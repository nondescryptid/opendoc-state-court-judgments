Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9155/2022/01.\]

13 September 2022

### District Judge Lee Lit Cheng:

1       During the COVID-19 pandemic, various safe management measures were implemented by the Government to curb transmission of the virus. The 42-year-old accused conspired with others to flout the restrictions on social gatherings by participating in the running of an illegal karaoke lounge in a rented semi-detached house (“the House”) located in a residential estate at Greenwood Avenue from February to May 2021.

2       The owner of the House lodged a police report after a neighbour complained of noise and suspicious activities. The operations of the illegal karaoke lounge came to a halt when the police raided the House shortly after midnight on 8 May 2021.

3       The accused pleaded guilty to two charges as follows:

4       A third charge (_vide_ MCN-900712-2022) was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. This was for engaging in a conspiracy with others to provide public entertainment without a licence by offering the transmission of songs by way of karaoke at the House, which is an offence punishable under s 19(1)(a) read with s 19(1)(i) of the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257, 2001 Rev Ed) (“PEA”) and s 109 of the Penal Code.

5       Two other conspirators, Ting Boon Han (“Ting”) and Ong Jia Sheng Jason (“Jason”), pleaded guilty to the corresponding charges against them on 19 August 2022 together with the accused. As Ting and Jason played a larger role than the accused, they were each fined $6,000 for the offence of unlicensed supply of liquor and sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment for the offence of flouting restrictions on social gatherings.

6       Only the accused has appealed against the sentences imposed.

## Facts

7       The accused admitted to the following facts without qualification.

8       Sometime in or before January 2021, the accused together with Ting, Jason and others agreed to participate in the running of an illegal karaoke lounge at the House to supply liquor without licence and to provide entertainment in the form of karaoke to patrons without imposing restrictions on the group size for social gatherings. Another person, Toon Zhi Hui, joined the conspiracy on or about 9 March 2021.

9       It was not disputed that the accused played a lesser role than Jason and Ting in the running of the illegal karaoke lounge. Jason obtained funds for the illegal venture and orchestrated the initial set-up of the House. Jason and Ting played a coordinating role for the operations at the House. Ting rented the House and gave operations-related directions to the accused and Toon Zhi Hui. The accused assisted with delivery of supplies to the House and provided transport service to patrons by sending them home in his car. He was paid $20-$30 per customer by Ting. All the conspirators solicited customers for the illegal business.

10     The living room and two bedrooms in the House were set up as karaoke rooms equipped with karaoke entertainment systems, sofas and tables. Soundproofing was also installed to avoid detection. Liquor was supplied at the House without the requisite licence under the LCA and female hostesses were available at a fee.

11     Pursuant to the conspiracy, the conspirators organised parties for patrons at the House from early February 2021 till 7 May 2021 when the police raided the place. At all material times, no health checks were conducted on the patrons and no restrictions were imposed on the number of persons who could gather at the House. There were also no age restrictions imposed on persons who were served alcohol in the House, and alcohol continued to be served after 10.30pm.

12     When the police raided the House shortly after midnight on 8 May 2021, two parties were taking place in the House. Liquor and karaoke were supplied to both parties. The first party of 16 patrons (including three persons under the age of 18 years) was held in the master bedroom. A second party of six patrons was held in the second bedroom. At that time, the permitted group size for social gatherings was up to 8 persons.

13     At the time of the raid, Ting, Jason and others were in the House assisting with the parties, while the accused was in his car outside the House waiting to provide transport service by sending patrons home.

## Antecedents

14     Ting is untraced. The accused and Jason have unrelated antecedents.

## The Prosecution’s address on sentence

15     In relation to the offence of flouting restrictions on social gatherings, the Prosecution submitted that the culpability and the severity of breach were both high and sought a term of four weeks’ imprisonment each against Ting and Jason, and three weeks’ imprisonment against the accused.

16     In relation to the offence of unlicensed supply of liquor, the Prosecution sought a fine of $6,000 each against Ting and Jason, and a lower fine of $4,000 against the accused.

## Mitigation

17     The unrepresented accused pleaded for leniency saying that it was his first offence. He also asked for a lower sentence and to pay the fine in instalments as he was unemployed.

## My decision

### Flouting restrictions on social gatherings (MCN-900713-2022)

18     I assessed the severity of the breach to be moderate, given that 16 patrons were gathered for a party in the master bedroom at the time of the raid in breach of the prevailing limit of 8 persons.

19     I assessed the accused’s culpability to be high for the following reasons:

> (a)     The offence was premeditated, and the accused agreed to participate in the running of the illegal karaoke lounge at the House as early as January 2021, before the operations commenced in February 2021.

> (b)     The accused had deliberately flouted the law and showed no regard for the measures implemented to protect public health and safety.

> (c)     The offence was motivated by financial gains.

> (d)     The illegal karaoke lounge had operated for about three months.

20     The predominant sentencing consideration in this case is deterrence, both specific and general. There is a clear need to deter the accused and other like-minded persons from wilfully flouting safe management measures for profit. In my view, the custodial threshold was clearly crossed.

21     The punishment prescribed for a first offender is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. Having assessed that the severity of the breach was moderate and the culpability was high, I opined that a custodial term of around three weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. As the accused showed remorse by pleading guilty and taking into account the lesser role he played, I was of the view that a sentence of one week’s imprisonment would be appropriate.

22     The Prosecution relied on two unreported decisions as sentencing precedents, namely, _PP v Chin Ming Keat Gerard_ (SC-909615-2021) (“_Gerard Chin”)_ and _PP v Ang Yun Nan, Joel_ (SC-902039-2021) (“_Joel Ang”_).

23     I was mindful of the fact that unreported decisions carry little precedential value because they are unreasoned and this is especially the case when reasoned decisions are available: see _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> at \[13\], reiterating _Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\]. However, in the absence of any known reported judgment or any established sentencing guidelines relating to the two offences in question, I had considered the sentences imposed in _Gerard Chin_ and _Joel Ang_, and the facts set out in the charges and the statement of fact of the two cases tendered by the Prosecution. To be clear, I am in no way bound by these decisions but had referred to them to get a sense of the sentences that have been meted out in similar cases and to ensure that the sentence to be imposed on the accused was broadly consonant with those sentences.

24     Both _Gerard Chin_ and _Joel Ang_ involve the running of an illegal pub during the pandemic in violation of the safe management measures prescribed in the TMCO and liquor was supplied without licence. In both cases, the illegal pubs were operating in non-residential premises and the offenders were charged for contravening reg 9(1) of the TMCO for failing to ensure that the non-residential premises were closed to entry by any individual. In contrast, the corresponding charge against the accused in the present case was for engaging in a conspiracy to intentionally aid others to breach the limit on group size for social gatherings in contravention of reg 6(1) of the TMCO read with s 109 of the Penal Code. Even though the accused’s charge relates to a different provision of the TMCO, I agree with the Prosecution that _Gerard Chin_ and _Joel Ang_ are relevant as the facts relating to the offending conduct are similar, the mischief that the provisions target are the same, and breaches of both reg 6(1) and reg 9(1) of the TMCO attract the same prescribed punishment under s 34(7)(a) of the CTMA.

25     I will briefly set out the facts of the two cases gleaned from the charges and statement of fact that the offenders admitted to when they pleaded guilty.

#### Gerard Chin

26     The offender in _Gerard Chin_ (“Chin”) and his friend, Clinton, rented an office unit to run a pub without the requisite licences. Chin set up speakers and karaoke systems and operated the illegal pub from 1 to 6 February 2021. Chin paid Clinton $100 per day to work at the pub. When the police raided the unit on 6 February 2021, 62 patrons were drinking alcohol and singing karaoke.

27     Chin pleaded guilty to three charges:

> (a)     Supplying liquor without licence under s 4(1) read with s 4(3) of the LCA, for which he was fined $4,000 (i/d 16 days’ imprisonment).

> (b)     Failing to ensure that the non-residential unit was closed to entry by any individual in breach of reg 9(1) of the TMCO and punishable under s 34(7)(a) of the CTMA, for which he was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment.

> (c)     Leaving his ordinary place of residence without reasonable excuse on 6 February 2021 in breach of reg 4(2) of the TMCO and punishable under s 34(7)(a) of the CMTA, for which he was fined $3,000 (i/d 12 days’ imprisonment).

28     A fourth charge for providing public entertainment at the illegal pub without a licence under s 19(1)(a) read with s 19(1)(i) of the PEA was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

####    Joel Ang

29     The offender in _Joel Ang_ (“Ang”) was the occupier of a non-residential unit at a building known as Midview City. Sometime in December 2020, he converted the unit into an entertainment venue for customers to gather and host parties. Alcohol was supplied at the unit without licence. The police raided the unit in the early hours of 9 January 2021 and found 39 patrons drinking and chatting with loud music being played over the speakers. A second raid was conducted on 17 January 2021 and the police found 12 patrons drinking and chatting with loud music being played over the speakers in the unit.

30     Ang pleaded guilty to four charges:

> (a)     In relation to the operations at the unit, Ang pleaded guilty to

>> (i)       a charge under reg 9(1) of the TMCO committed on 9 January 2021, for which he was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment; and

>> (ii)       two charges under s 19(1)(a) of the PEA, for which he was fined a total of $7,500 (i/d 30 days’ imprisonment).

> (b)     Ang also pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge for breaching reg 6(1) of the TMCO for gathering with 8 other friends on 15 May 2021 to drink and sing karaoke at a different location not operated by him. The permitted group size for social gathering at the material time was no more than two persons. He was fined $8,000 (i/d 32 days’ imprisonment).

31     Three other charges relating to the operations at the unit were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing: a charge under reg 9(1) of the TMCO committed on 17 January 2021, and two charges under s 4(1) read with s 4(3)(a) of the LCA.

32     I assessed the culpability of the offenders in _Gerard Chin_ and _Joel Ang_ to be high (with Ang’s culpability higher because he re-offended after the first raid by the police), and the severity of the breach in both cases to be high (with Chin’s breach being more severe given the larger number of patrons present). I opined that a sentence of around one month’s imprisonment would be appropriate in both cases. In my view, the sentence meted out in _Joel Ang_ was on the lenient side given that he had re-offended after the first raid.

33     Comparing with the facts of the present case, I was of the view that the culpability of Ting and Jason was comparable to that of the offender in _Gerard Chin._ Having assessed the severity of the breach to be moderate in the present case (as opposed to high in _Gerard Chin_), I was satisfied that the sentences of two weeks’ imprisonment for Ting and Jason, and one week’s imprisonment for the accused on account of his lesser role, were consonant with the sentence imposed in _Gerard Chin_.

### Unlicensed supply of liquor (MCN-900711-2022)

34     In the absence of any known reported decisions or sentencing guidelines for the offence punishable under s 4(3)(a) of the LCA, I considered the sentence of $4,000 fine imposed in _Gerard Chin._ There, the illegal pub operated for only five days and alcohol was supplied to 62 persons on the day of the raid.

35     In the present case, the illegal karaoke lounge had been in operation for about three months and alcohol was supplied to at least 23 persons on the day of the raid. Given that the period of offending was significantly longer in the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that a fine of $6,000 for Ting and Jason, who played a similar role in directing and managing the operations as the offender in _Gerard Chin_, was appropriate. Given the accused’s lesser role, I imposed a lower fine of $4,000 against him.

## Conclusion

36     The sentences imposed on the accused were calibrated based on his role in the running of the illegal karaoke lounge and the facts of the case. The co-conspirators, Ting and Jason, were also sentenced at the same time as the accused. No appeal was filed by Ting and Jason, who would have finished serving their custodial sentences by the time of this judgment.

37     The accused is on bail pending appeal.
