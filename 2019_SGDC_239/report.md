\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9273/2019/01.\]

12 November 2019

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## A.   Introduction

1       The Accused, a 48 year old female Singaporean, faced 4 charges of criminal breach of trust as a servant under section 408 of the Penal Code. Upon a plea offer by the Prosecution, she pleaded guilty to 1 charge, with the remaining 3 charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 25 October 2019, I sentenced the Accused to 6 months’ imprisonment. The Accused also applied to defer her sentence to 25 November 2019 and I granted her application accordingly.

2       The Accused, being dissatisfied with my order, has filed the present appeal against my sentence on 7 November 2019. Accordingly, I set out my reasons for my sentence.

## B.   The Charges

3       The Accused had pleaded guilty to the following charge:

**4th Charge - DAC-927705-2018 (Amended)**

> You … are charged that you, between 1 January 2017 and 27 November 2017, at HK Tan Surgery Pte Ltd (the ‘Company’) located at 3 Mount Elizabeth #15-02, Singapore, being employed as a servant in the Company, to wit, a receptionist, and in such capacity being entrusted with certain property, to wit, cash amounting to $35,144/- belonging to the Company, did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating the sum of $35,144, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev.Ed.).

## C.   Punishment Prescribed by Law

4       For DAC 927705-2018, the punishment prescribed under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

## D.   Statement of Facts

5       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

> i.     The complainant is Dora Chew, female/ 70 years old. She is a director of HK Tan Surgery Pte Ltd (“the clinic”). The complainant and her husband are directors of the clinic, which deals with general surgery and aesthetic laser treatments.

> ii.     On 11 February 2014, the complainant employed the Accused to work for the company as a receptionist. The Accused’s duties include inter alia manning the registration counter, dispensing medicine and collecting payments.

> iii.     The Accused was allowed full access to the Clinic Program Manager (“CPM”) as part of her job. The CPM is used to capture the patient records, payment details and the medication dispensed.

> iv.     The Accused, by virtue of the full access, was allowed to make changes to those records. The Accused was required to generate a daily sales report through the CPM and a daily settlement through the credit card terminal at the end of the day. She would then hand over the documents to the complainant’s husband, who would check to ensure that the cash tallied with the sales report. He would pass the cash to the Accused the following morning so that she can place it in a tamper proof envelope which she would then hand over to a CISCO officer for bank crediting.

> v.     The Accused was also required to submit documents to IRAS on a quarterly basis. These documents include the daily sales reports, banking slips and settlement reports.

> **Facts Relating to DAC 927705/2018**

> vi.     Investigations revealed that the Accused misappropriated the monies belonging to the clinic using the following methods:

>> (a)       After receiving the monies from the complainant’s husband (the cash earnings from the previous day), she would keep a sum of money for herself before placing the remaining in the envelope and handing it to the CISCO officer, who would then deposit the monies into the clinic’s corporate account. She would do so two or three times a week.

>> (b)       She would amend the payment records in the CPM at the end of each month to ensure that they tally with the banking slips:

>>> (i)       She would pocket some of the cash payments made by some of the patients and adjust the amount paid by each patient in the CPM;

>>> (ii)       She would amend the payment mode in the CPM to reflect that the patient paid by VISA instead of cash after pocketing some of the cash payments

> vii.     The Accused would then delete the original receipts which were issued to the patients and print out amended receipts that tally with the banking slips to cover her tracks. She would also effect these amendments on the documents (daily sales reports, banking slips and settlement reports) before submitting them to IRAS. The records would therefore show that there were outstanding payments owed by some of the patients although payment had been made.

> viii.     According to the Accused, she got more and more confident over the years after taking the cash monies and amending the records as she thought that there was no way the complainant could detect the discrepancies. The offences came to light on 27 November 2017 when the complainant covered the Accused’s duties because she had gone on leave. The complainant noticed discrepancies in the transactions and she sought the assistance of an auditor to conduct checks. The auditor found that a total of $88,820 was unaccounted for over the past 4 years.

> ix.     The complainant confronted the Accused when the latter returned from leave. The Accused initially wondered how the complainant saw through her ruse, however she later admitted to pocketing the monies and amending the records.

> x.     The Accused spent the monies on herself and her family for their personal expenses.

> xi.     On 19 December 2017, the complainant lodged a police report stating that the Accused had misappropriated monies from the clinic.

> xii.     Between 1 January 2017 to 27 November 2017, the Accused dishonestly misappropriated a sum of $35,144 belonging to the clinic which was entrusted to her in her capacity as a receptionist, and she has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

> xiii.     The Accused has made full restitution for the losses.

## E.   Antecedents

6       The Accused is traced with similar antecedents:

> i.     The Accused was convicted of an offence of criminal breach of trust under section 406 of the Penal Code in DAC 8920 of 2004 by Court 13 Subordinate Courts on 16 November 2004 and she was given a $6000 fine which she paid in full.

> ii.     The Accused was also convicted of another offence of criminal breach of trust as a servant under section 408 of the Penal Code in DAC 4580 of 2005 by Court 2 Subordinate Courts on 3 July 1995 and she was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

## F.   The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence[^1]

7       The Prosecution had pointed out that the following aggravating factors:-

> i.     The offences were committed over a period of 4 years (from 1 April 2014 till 27 November 2017).

> ii.     The total sum involved in the 4 charges is $88,820 which is a substantial sum. The sum involved in the proceeded charge is $35,144.

> iii.     The Accused is traced with similar antecedents.

8       The Prosecution had also tendered a Table of Sentencing Precedents which showed that the courts have meted out sentences between 4 to 12 months for section 408 offences where the total amounts involved are between $30,423.96 to $48,843.47 where full or partial restitutions have been made:

9       The Prosecution also pointed out to me that in the case of **_Kavathi D/O Mailvaganam v PP_**, the High Court had made the following comments:

> i.     “To begin with, it was undisputed that the sentence of nine months’ imprisonment imposed by the court below was within the usual tariff for an offence under section 408 of the Penal Code given the amount of $30,423.96 which the appellant had misappropriated …” \[21\],

> ii.     “keeping in mind the premeditated manner of the appellant’s offending but also her plea of guilt and the partial restitution which she made, I was of the view that the **appropriate sentence for a usual offender in the appellant’s position would be 10 months’ imprisonment**” \[22\] .

In that case, the High Court had considered the accused to be less culpable than the precedents noted because she had not committed the offence for personal gain. Rather, she had done it out of fear caused by threats made by unlicensed moneylenders towards herself and her young son. Nor had she borrowed money from the moneylenders herself, but only acted as guarantor for a friend who had since gone missing.

## G.   Defence’s Mitigation and Sentencing Position

10     The Defence has urged me to consider the following[^2]:-

> **Accused’s personal, educational and employment background**

> i.     The Accused is a 48 year-old Singapore Citizen, born on 24th November 1970. She was previously employed as a receptionist in a clinic located at Mount Elizabeth.

> ii.     The Accused is married but lives with her elderly mother who is 75 years old. It is just two of them. No one else is living with them. The Accused’s father has passed away.

## Circumstances leading to the commissioning of the offence

11     The Accused was under tremendous amounts of stress due to a series of unfortunate events that occurred to her family and career. And this may have clouded her judgment and inadvertently resulted in her making unwise decisions.

12     Ever since 2016, the Accused’s mother was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. Her mother’s condition worsened and she was required to be hospitalised frequently. Recently, in September 2019, she has been diagnosed with early dementia.

13     As the hospital bills began to accumulate, the Accused was unable to clear off the debts with the hospital. Fearing that the hospital may reject subsequent treatment to her mother, the Accused had no choice but to resort to borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders to clear off her mother’s medical bill.

14     Due to the exorbitant interest rates, the debts with the unlicensed moneylenders soon spiralled out of control. At one point, they even wrote, using marker pen, the words “_O$P$”_ on the walls outside the Accused’s unit. The Accused had no choice but to commit the alleged offence.

15     The Accused only did what she did out of love for her mother. The Accused did not spend the monies on herself.

## Defence’s Sentencing Position

16     With respect to DAC 927702/2018, the Defence was of the view that a custodial term of 5 months imprisonment will be sufficient to serve the ends of justice.

## Mitigating Factors

17     The Accused was a receptionist. She had a variety of duties. Collecting payment was merely one of her duties. The Defence also cited **_Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam v PP_** **<span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1349</span>** at \[18\]: customer service officers are not considered to be in high positions of trust. The Defence was of the view that a receptionist is similar to a customer service officer and she is not holding a high position of trust.

18     In this case, the Defence also submitted that the Accused did not profit personally. She had used the monies for her mother. The Accused was also under pressure from the unlicensed moneylenders. In this regard, the Defence was of the view that the current case is very similar to **_Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam v PP_**, except that in that case the accused did not not make full restitution whereas in the present case, the Accused had made full restitution.

19     In the present case, the Accused has made full restitution of the amount of $30,991.00 on the proceeded charge as well as full restitution of the amounts involved in the 3 TIC charges. In total she had made restitution of $88,820.00 for all the four charges.

20     The Defence also submitted that the Accused is willing to accept responsibility for the charges and has pleaded guilty to the charges at the earliest opportunity. She has fully cooperated with the police during investigations and had readily admitted to the charges to the police when she was arrested thus saving valuable time and police resources.

## Defence’s Sentencing Position

21     The Defence noted that in **_Kavitha d/o Mailvaganam v PP_**, a sentence of 7 months was imposed. But the accused in that case did not make full restitution. The Accused in the present case did make full restitution. Thus, the Defence was of the view that the sentence imposed on the Accused should be below 7 months.

22     The Defence also pointed out that In **_PP v Nur Farhana bte Nasrullah Khan_** **<span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 73</span>**, a sentence of 4 months was imposed. The sums appropriated were slightly smaller than the present case, and the accused had no antecedents. But the accused in that case was an accounts assistant, i.e. a high position of trust. Thus, the sentence imposed on the Accused should be above 4 months, though not by much.

23     In view of the above matters, the Defence urged me to extend leniency when passing sentence against the Accused and to impose a sentence of 5 months imprisonment. A lengthy custodial sentence means problems getting someone to care for her aging mother, who is already suffering from early dementia (amongst others).

## H.   My Decision

## Sentencing considerations

## (a)   Sentencing objective

24     I am of the view that deterrence is the dominant sentencing objective for a section 408 charge.

## (b)   Culpability, harm, aggravating and mitigating factors

25     I am of the view that the Accused’s culpability and the harm caused were high. It is clear from the Statement of Facts that the section 408 offence was premeditated, carefully planned and coordinated. The Accused was required by her company to generate a daily sales report using the CPM and a daily settlement through the credit card terminal at the end of each working day. She would then hand these documents to the complainant’s husband who would check to ensure that the cash collected tallied with the sales report. He would then pass the cash to the Accused the next morning for her to place the same in a tamper proof envelope to be handed over to a CISCO officer for bank crediting. The Accused is also required to submit the documents to IRAS on a quarterly basis.

26     After receiving the cash from the complainant’s husband, the Accused would keep a sum of money for herself and she would amend the payment records in the CPM at the end of each month to ensure that they tally with the banking slips. She would then delete the original receipts which were issued to the patients and print out the amended receipts that tally with the banking slips to cover her tracks. She then proceeded to effect these amendments on relevant documents such as the daily sales reports, banking slips and settlement reports before submitting them to IRAS. The Accused’s actions clearly show that she had put in lot of thoughts into manipulating the company’s financial workflow in order to commit her offences. She had also taken great pains to cover up her tracks to ensure that her crimes would not be discovered.

27     The amount involved in the present case is also not insignificant in that the amount involved in the proceeded charge is $35,144 and the total sum taken by the Accused in the 4 charges was $88,820. This is a substantial amount of money. However, I do note that the Accused has made full restitution of the said sum.

28     I also note that the period of offending was also over a very long period from 1 April 2014 till 27 November 2017. Because of her careful planning, her criminal ways were not detected by the company for almost 4 years.

29     I also note that this is not the Accused’s 1st brush with the law. Looking at her conviction history, I note that she has 2 similar antecedents under section 406 and section 408 of the Penal Code. The Accused was given a fine for her section 406 offence in November 1994 and 6 months’ imprisonment for her section 408 offence in July 1995. Even though the Accused was given a jail term of 6 months for her section 408 offence in July 1995, she clearly has not learnt her lesson in that she chose to commit the same offence again in April 2014. While I note that the Accused’s antecedents are dated, I am of the view that the fact that she has chosen to commit another similar offence must be taken as an aggravating factor against the Accused.

30     As for the Accused’s mitigating factors, I accept the Defence’s submission that she had been cooperative during investigations and she had pleaded guilty to the charges.

31     The sentencing precedents for section 408 offences show a broad correlation between the amount misappropriated and the length of the imprisonment term. Where the amount misappropriated is higher, the courts have correspondingly imposed a more lengthy term of imprisonment.

32     In the present case, I note the comment by the High Court in **_Kavitha D/O Mailvagan v PP_** at \[21 to 22\] that the appropriate sentence for a usual offender where the sum involved is $30,423.96 and where the offender has pleaded guilty and has made partial restitution would be about 10 months’ imprisonment. I also note that the District court in **_Kavitha D/O Mailvagan v PP_** had sentenced the accused to 9 months’ imprisonment but the High Court on appeal had lowered the sentence to 7 months because the High Court was of the view that the accused had not committed the offence for personal gain and that she had committed the offence out of fear caused by threats by unlicensed moneylenders towards herself and her young son.

33     In the present case, I note the Defence’s submission that the Accused had committed the offences in order to provide for her mother’s medical expenses and not for her own benefit. I do not agree with the Defence’s submission on this point totally. The Accused started taking monies from the clinic in April 2014. However, I note that the Accused’s mother was only diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and kidney failure since 2016. Also in her Statement of Fact, the Accused had admitted to spending the monies **on herself** and her family for their personal expenses. Given this discrepancy, I am not prepared to accept the Defence’s submission that the Accused did not personally benefit from her offences. However, I am prepared to accept that the Accused had spent part of the monies on her mother’s medical expenses.

34     The Defence has also submitted that the Accused is only a receptionist and that she is not in a high position of trust. The Defence had tried to distinguish the case of **_PP v Nur Farhana bte Nasrullah Khan_** on the basis that accused in that case was an accounts assistant, i.e. a high position of trust. I do not agree with the Defence’s submission on this point. Even though the Accused was employed as a receptionist, her job scope involved more than the normal duties of a mere receptionist. The Accused was given the responsibilities of handling monies belonging to the clinic. The Accused was also put in charge of printing out the financial reports and submitting the financial statements to IRAS. In order for her to carry out her duties, she was given full access rights to the company’s CPM system with powers to amend entries in the CPM system. Given her responsibilities, it is very clear to me the Accused is placed in a high position of trust by her company.

35     In the present case, taking into account the above factors, the Accused’s antecedents and the number of charges preferred against the Accused, I would agree with the Prosecution that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment is not inappropriate for this case. Accordingly I imposed a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment on the Accused.

36     The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision has filed an appeal against my sentence.
