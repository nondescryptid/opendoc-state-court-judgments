### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

## Charge

The Accused, a 55-year old male, pleaded guilty on the first day of trial to a charge of drink driving under section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (RTA), Chapter 276. The alcohol in his blood measured 81 milligrammes of alcohol, exceeding the prescribed limit of 80 milligrammes of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood. The offence was committed on the 28 of May 2018.

2       I imposed on the Accused the mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 (in default to serve 5 days’ imprisonment) and the minimum 12 months’ disqualification order (DQ) from driving all classes of vehicles with effect from 16 September 2019. The accused is now appealing only against the DQ order. He has paid the fine.

## The Statement of Facts (SOF)

3       The SOF which the accused admitted without any qualification is reproduced below.

4       The complainant is one Sergeant Mohamed Rizwan attached to Traffic Police.

5       The accused is one Ho Kim Teck, male, 55 years old, Singaporean. He was the driver of motor car SKA8803L at the material time.

6       On 28 May 2018, about 10.55 pm, the accused was driving his motor car SKA8803L along Onan Road towards Geylang Road when he was stopped by the complainant at a police roadblock. The complainant observed that the accused reeked of alcohol. The complainant then administered a breathalyzer test on the accused, which he failed. The accused was then placed under arrest and brought to Traffic Police.

7       While at Traffic Police, the accused was conveyed to Changi General hospital (CGH) by ambulance as he stated that he was giddy. While at CGH, a specimen of blood was procured from the accused for testing. The blood specimen, sealed ‘Changi General Hospital’ and marked “Ho Kim Teck SXXX” was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") for analysis

8       Widodo Andreas, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the accused’s blood specimen, certified that the blood specimen contained 81 mg of alcohol / 100 ml of blood, which exceeds the prescribed limit.

9       The accused admitted to consuming beer on the material day prior to driving the car.

10     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence punishable under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

## The Sentence

11     The punishment prescribed for the offence of drink driving under section 67(1)(b) of the RTA is a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, and a minimum disqualification period of 12 months, unless “_special reasons_” exist.

12     The prosecution in their oral address on sentence informed the court that they were not objecting to the mandatory minimum fine and a DQ order of 12 months. In mitigation, counsel for the accused said that his client is a first offender who had pleaded guilty. Besides highlighting his personal background counsel said that on the day of the offence the accused’s daughter had been driving from their home till Joo Chiat complex. As she had a bad stomach ache, the accused took over the car and drove for a short distance before he was stopped at the road block. The accused had stopped drinking since the incident. He urged the court to impose a shorter period of disqualification than 12 months but stopped short of specifying the length.

13     The sentencing benchmarks for a drink driving charge under section 67(1)(b) for a first offender like the accused are clear. The Chief Justice in the case of _Edwin s/o Suse Nathan_ v _Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 194</span>_, at para 22, had set out the appropriate range of sentences for first time offenders – categorised within broad bands according to the level of alcohol. The accused falls squarely within the first band where the sentence would be a fine in the range of $1,000- $2,000 and the DQ order would be in the range of 12-18 months, considering that his level of alcohol is not that excessive.

14     The only issue here is whether there are “_special reasons_” to justify an exercise of discretion to impose a shorter period of DQ or not to impose a DQ at all. Case law has established that a “_special reason_” is a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge yet directly connected with the commission of the offence and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment. A circumstance peculiar to the offender as distinguished from the offence is not a special reason: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 265</span>. Further, even if special reasons are established, it does not automatically mean that the offender will not be disqualified. The court must separately consider whether the discretion not to disqualify should be exercised in his favour.

15     Turning back to the facts of this case, it appeared that the defence was premising their submission for a lower DQ on account of 2 reasons. Firstly, they claimed that the accused took over the wheel from his daughter because she had a stomach ache and secondly he drove for a short distance only. While there was no objective evidence to indicate that she really had a stomach ache, and even if she did, I cannot view this as a medical emergency or a life threatening situation for the accused to take over the driving after he had been drinking.

16     As for the second reason of having driven for a short distance only, firstly, the defence seems to have ignored the fact that this was because the accused was stopped at a road block by the police. It was not a case of him making a conscious and deliberate decision to drive for a short period only. In any event, this factor was considered in the case of _Cheong Wai Keong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 570</span>, where the offender had driven a short distance to get his vehicle into a car park. The offender had argued, just like this instant case, that since he had driven for a short distance only, it amounted to a “_special reason_” and he should be disqualified for a period shorter than the mandatory minimum of 12 months. The lower court disagreed and imposed a DQ order of 12 months. On appeal by the offender, the High Court affirmed the order of the lower court and held that “_it was preferable to lay down a simple rule that a person who was convicted of drunk driving should be disqualified for the mandatory 12-month period if he started the car and moved it at all, unless there were “special reasons” for not doing so, bearing in mind that the distance travelled did not constitute a “special reason_” _as such:_\[16\].

17     In the latter case of _PP v Ng Poh Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 233</span>, the court applied _Cheong_’s case and even though the distance driven was not more than two feet, this short distance was not considered a special reason and the minimum period of 12 months disqualification was imposed. The appeal by the offender against the disqualification order was dismissed by the High Court on the 26 of January 2007 (MA 161/2006/01).

18     In conclusion, I did not find in this particular case, “_special reasons_” to exercise my discretion to impose a period of disqualification below the minimum period of 12 months.
