Tort – Motor accident – Contributory Negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 14/2019.\]

26 April 2019

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

This is a claim for personal injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, against the Defendant arising from a chain collision that involved the Defendant’s taxi and the Plaintiff’s motorcycle. I entered interlocutory judgment at 60% against the Defendant. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

2       The Plaintiff was riding his motorcycle FBJ6641J (“the Plaintiff’s motorcycle”) in the second lane of the Seletar Expressway at about 7:40 am on 2 December 2016. He was travelling behind another motorcycle (“the 2nd motorcycle”), when the Defendant who was driving his taxi SHC5600A (“the Defendant’s taxi”) in the first lane, ahead of the Plaintiff and the 2nd motorcycle, cut into the second lane. The 2nd motorcycle collided into the rear of the Defendant’s taxi and the Plaintiff’s motorcycle collided into the 2nd motorcycle.

3       It is not disputed that the Defendant cut into the second lane causing the 2nd motorcycle to collide into the Defendant’s taxi. The Defendant conceded that he was 60% liable for the accident. The issues in this case were:

a.     whether the Plaintiff was contributorily negligent in travelling too closely behind the 2nd motorcycle, and

b.     if so, the extent to which the Defendant’s liability for the accident should be reduced.

## Decision

4       The Plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination was that he was travelling at around 50 km/h and was 5 metres behind the 2nd motorcycle (Notes of Evidence at pages 9 and 12). Rule 67 of the Highway Code provides that “_you must allow at least one car length for every 16 km/h of your speed._” Accordingly, at 50 km/h, the Plaintiff should have been travelling about three car lengths behind the 2nd motorcycle.

5       The Plaintiff relies on Diagram 1.68 of the Motor Accident Guide which provides that a vehicle that cuts into another vehicle’s lane is 100% liable for the collision. The Defendant relies on Diagram 1.90 of the Motor Accident Guide, which provides that where a chain collision is caused by a vehicle cutting in from another lane, the driver of that vehicle should bear 50% to 60% liability. As such, the Defendant submitted that his liability for the accident is 60%. The two diagrams (extracted from the respective parties’ Opening Statements) are set out below for comparison:

6       The key difference between Diagram 1.68 relied on by the Plaintiff and Diagram 1.90 relied on by the Defendant, is that Diagram 1.90 involves a chain collision and the issue of whether the 3rd vehicle in the chain was following too closely behind the 2nd vehicle, whereas there is no such issue in Diagram 1.68. I am of the view that the present case which involves a chain collision and the issue of whether the Plaintiff was travelling too closely behind the 2nd motorcycle, is more analogous to Diagram 1.90, rather than Diagram 1.68.

7       The Defendant also referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision in _De Cotta v Tan Hock Lee_ \[1971-1973\] SLR (R) 475, 479 (at paragraph 11), which cited with approval _Bingham’s Motor Claims Cases_ (6th Edition) at page 86 that “_two-wheeled vehicles require double the distance required by a four-wheeled vehicle to pull up”._ In that case, the appellant had stopped his van suddenly when he saw a tortoise on the road. The respondent who was riding his motor scooter at 30 mph (about 50 km/h) at 30 feet (about 10 metres) behind the appellant’s van, collided into the van. The Court of Appeal decided that a safe travelling distance for the scooter was 120 feet (about 40 metres) and that the respondent was 40% responsible for the injuries sustained by him, as there was contributory negligence on the part of the respondent in travelling too closely behind the appellant’s van (see paragraphs 11 to 13 of that decision).

8       In the present case, the Plaintiff’s evidence is that he was travelling at 50 km/h at 5 metres behind the 2nd motorcycle. The Plaintiff was travelling at a similar speed to that of the respondent in _De Cotta v Tan Hock Lee_, but at half the distance behind the 2nd motorcycle in front of him (5 metres instead of 10 metres). In the light of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _De Cotta v Tan Hock Lee_, that the Respondent at 10 metres behind Appellant was travelling too closely behind the Appellant’s van, I am of the view that the Plaintiff at 5 metres behind the 2nd motocycle in this case, would even more so, be travelling too closely behind the 2nd motorcycle. In the premises, I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s negligence in following too closely behind the 2nd motorcycle contributed to the accident.

9       Following Diagram 1.90 of the Motor Accident Guide and the Court of Appeal’s decision in _De Cotta v Tan Hock Lee_, I agree with the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff should bear 40% responsibility for the accident. In the premises, interlocutory judgment was entered at 60% against the Defendant with damages to be assessed, interest and costs reserved to the Deputy Registrar hearing the assessment of damages.
