### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused, male 29 years old, pleaded guilty to one charge relating to a conspiracy to traffic in not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis, one charge of possession of not less than 0.21 gram of methamphetamine and one charge of drug consumption. The charges were as follows:-

> **DAC 903472-2020 (Amended 1st charge)**

> are charged that you, on 2 June 2016, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with one Arun Raj s/o Chandran (NRIC No. xxx) (“**Arun**”) and one Kannan s/o R Kumaran (NRIC No. xxx) (“**Kannan**”) for Arun to traffic by delivering to you **two (02) blocks and some loose vegetable matter which were analysed and found to contain not less than 499.99g of cannabis** (“**the drugs**”), a controlled drug listed in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), and in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing, on 2 June 2016 at about 11.37 pm at Blk 327 Yishun Ring Road #XXX, Singapore, you received the aforesaid drugs, which were kept by you for Kannan, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(_a_) and s 12 of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the said Act.

> **DAC 940248-2016 (Amended 3rd charge)**

> are charged that you, on 3 June 2016, at or about 2.10am, at Block 327 Yishun Ring Road #XXX, Singapore, did have in your possession a Class A Controlled Drug listed in The First Schedule Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), _to wit_, **one packet containing not less than 0.32 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.21 gram of methamphetamine**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> **DAC 940249-2016 (Amended 4th charge)**

> are charged that you, on or about 3 June 2016, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug, to wit **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**, without authorization under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

2       Three other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC”). There was a further charge of drug trafficking (DAC 940247-2016), one further charge of consuming methamphetamine (DAC 940250-2018) and one charge of possessing utensils to consume drugs (DAC 940251-2016).

3       The accused was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and to the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane for the drug trafficking charge. He was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment each for the drug possession and consumption charges, with the sentences in the trafficking and consumption charges to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore 25 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Sentence was backdated to 4 June 2016 when the accused was first remanded.

4       The accused has filed an appeal against sentence.

## Statement of facts

5       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:-

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

> **INTRODUCTION**

> 1.    The accused is Ashvin s/o Ragupathy, a 29-year-old male Singapore citizen bearing NRIC number xxx (DOB: 2 December 1990). The accused was employed as a safety coordinator with a shipping firm at the material time.

> 2.    The involved parties are:

>> a.    Arun Raj s/o Chandran, a 30-year-old male Singapore citizen bearing NRIC number xxx (DOB: 20 June 1990) (“Arun”). Arun was employed in a bank at the material time. Arun has been friends with the accused since 2014.

>> b.    Kannan s/o R Kumaran, a 29-year-old Singapore citizen bearing NRIC number xxx (DOB: 8 October 1990) (“Kannan”). Kannan was employed as a safety coordinator with a shipping firm (different from Ashvin’s) at the material time. Kannan is a childhood friend of the accused and the duo knew each other since they were in primary school. Kannan is a cousin of Arun.

> **THE ARREST**

> 3.    On 3 June 2016, at about 2.10 am, a party of CNB officers raided the accused’s residence located at Blk 327 Yishun Ring Road, #XXX (“Unit”) and found the accused in his bedroom. The accused was placed under arrest on suspicion of having committed drug-related offences. The following items, among others, were seized:

>> a.    One block of vegetable matter wrapped with clear plastic (subsequently marked as (“B1A”);

>> b.    One block of open vegetable matter on a clear plastic (subsequently marked as “B2A”);

>> c.    One brown bag paper bag (subsequently marked as “C1”);

>> d.    One brown cloth bag (subsequently marked as “C2”);

>> e.    One red plastic bag (subsequently marked as “C3”);

>> f.    One electronic kitchen scale (subsequently marked as “C4A”);

>> g.    One pair of metal scissors (subsequently marked as “C5”);

>> h.    One rubbish bag (subsequently marked as “D1”);

>> i.    One piece of plastic which had been cut open (subsequently marked as “D1B”);

>> j.    One piece of plastic which had been cut open (subsequently marked as “D1C”);

>> k.    One packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked as “A1”);

>> l.    One improvised bong (subsequently marked as “A2”).

> 4.    The seized exhibits were then sealed in tamper proof bags and brought to the CNB Headquarters for investigations.

> **BACKGROUND FACTS**

> 5.    Sometime on 2 June 2016, Kannan over the course of phone calls with the accused informed the accused that he may be getting some “stuff”, which the accused understood to mean ‘weed’ (a street name for cannabis). Kannan asked the accused whether he could leave the “stuff” at the accused’s residence. Kannan also said that Arun would likely be the one collecting the weed.

> 6.    Sometime between 9 to 10 pm, the accused, Arun and Kannan met up at the Unit. Thereat, Kannan informed the accused that the shipment of weed would be coming that night. The accused initially asked why Kannan could not simply leave the weed at his own house. Kannan replied that his mother was at home, and that it was unsafe as he was still undergoing urine testing at the time. In the presence of the accused, Kannan then instructed Arun to collect a shipment of weed.

> 7.    On Kannan’s instructions, a taxi was booked using the ‘Grab’ application. Arun then took the taxi to Blk 256 Punggol Way.

> 8.    In the meantime, the accused left the Unit to meet a friend in the vicinity. Kannan also left the Unit. At about 11.37pm, Arun called the accused and told him that the window grill to the accused’s unit was locked. Thereafter, the accused returned to the corridor outside his Unit and took the brown bag from Arun. The accused then tried to slip the brown bag through the window grill to his bedroom. As the brown bag was too large to fit, the accused took out one block of weed and slipped it through the window grill before shoving the brown bag containing the remaining block of weed into the bedroom. The two blocks of weed were subsequently marked as exhibits “B1A” and “B2A”.

> 9.    The accused and Arun then went downstairs. The accused joined his friends at the void deck below, while Arun went home to celebrate his mother’s birthday.

> 10.    Sometime around midnight on 3 June 2016, Kannan approached the accused who was in the vicinity of the accused’s block. Kannan informed the accused he needed to take some of the weed received by the accused to pass to his \[Kannan’s\] customers. Kannan then met the accused and they returned to the Unit together.

> 11.    While in the accused’s bedroom, Kannan handed a red plastic bag containing a weighing scale in a box to the accused. Kannan asked the accused to take some plastic wrapping to pack the weed. The accused left the room and went to the kitchen. When the accused returned to his bedroom, he saw Kannan peeling off the plastic wrapper of one block of weed. Kannan then used a pair of scissors belonging to the accused, and broke some weed from the block. Kannan used the weighing scale and packed some weed into plastic wrapping. Kannan also told the accused he needed 150g for his customers, without specifying their identities. Kannan then informed the accused that he was leaving the house to pass the weed to his customers. Kannan subsequently left the accused’s Unit with the 150g of weed thereafter (subsequently marked as exhibit E1), with the two remaining blocks of weed left in the accused’s Unit. Kannan told the accused he would return in around an hour’s time for the rest of the weed. By keeping the drugs in his bedroom, the accused knew that he was helping Kannan conceal the drugs as he knew that Kannan was reporting for urine tests. He also knew that Kannan would be returning to retrieve the drugs to sell them to other customers, as Kannan was not consuming drugs at the time. The accused then pushed the two blocks of weed under his bed to hide them.

> 12.    At about 12.30 am, Arun met up with the accused at his Unit together with another mutual friend – one Naveen Davarajan. Arun knocked on the accused’s bedroom window and asked for some weed from the accused. The accused took some weed from the opened block of weed, wrapped it in some paper, and passed it to Arun through the bedroom window.

> 13.    Investigations revealed that Arun and Naveen left the Unit thereafter and were arrested shortly after by CNB officers on 3 June 2016 at about 1.40 am. The weed found in their joint possession was seized and marked as exhibit F1A.

> 14.    Investigations also revealed that after Kannan left the Unit, he met up to sell the 150g of weed to two customers (subsequently established to be one Pravin s/o Palanivallu (“Pravin”) and one Vinod s/o Pergasan (“Vinod”). This transaction took place in the vicinity of Block 330 Yishun Ring Road on 3 June 2016 at about 12.15 am. Both Pravin and Vinod were arrested shortly thereafter at about 12.25 am, and exhibit E1 was seized from them. After the transaction, Kannan took a taxi to Pasir Ris, where he was arrested at about 1.45 am. The accused has been acquainted with Pravin and Vinod since 2013. He is also aware that Kannan has sold weed to Vinod on a previous occasion.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1st CHARGE (DAC-903472-2020)**

> 15.    On 6 June 2016, the exhibits marked “B1A” and “B2A” were sealed in separate tamper-proof bags and were submitted to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

> 16.    Tan Ying Ying, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, who had conduct of the analysis in relation to the two said exhibits, subsequently issued two amended certificates dated 12 May 2020 under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) bearing:

>> a.    Lab No. ID-1632-01163-002, stating that the exhibit marked “B1A” was found to be one block containing (a) not less than 444.4g of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to contain cannabis, and (b) not less than 510.5g of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol.

>> b.    Lab No. ID-1632-00163-003, stating that the exhibit marked “B2A” was found to be one block and some loose vegetable matter containing (a) not less than 384.6g of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabis, and (b) not less than 424.1g of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol.

> 17.    Cannabis is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> 18.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Arun and Kannan for Arun to traffic in cannabis by delivering exhibits B1A and B2A to the accused. The conspiracy was formed between the accused, Arun and Kannan at the accused’s Unit on 2 June 2016.

> 19.    The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to abet in the trafficking of not less than 499.99g of cannabis. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA read with s 12 of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC-940248-2016)**

> 20.    On 6 June 2016, the exhibit marked “A1” recovered from the accused’s Unit was sent to HSA in a sealed tamper-proof bag for analysis.

> 21.    On 19 September 2016, Tan Ying Ying, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate under s 16 of the MDA bearing Lab No. ID-1632-00163-001, stating that the exhibit was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.32g of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.21g of methamphetamine.

> 22.    Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> 23.    The accused owned the exhibit A1 and knew that it contained methamphetamine. He possessed the said exhibit for his own consumption. The accused admitted to first consuming methamphetamine in 2013, and had bought exhibit A1 from someone who sold him contraband cigarettes for $100.

> 24.    The accused is not authorised to possess methamphetamine under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(_a_) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4TH CHARGE (DAC-940249-2020)**

> 25.    Following the accused’s arrest, he provided two bottles of his urine which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SA-16-00781-1 ASHVIN S/O RAGUPATHY xxx” and “C-SA-16-00781-2 ASHVIN S/O RAGUPATHY xxx” respectively in his presence.

> 26.    On 3 June 2016, the said urine samples were sent to HSA for analysis.

> 27.    Subsequently on 8 and 9 June 2016, HSA issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA bearing Lab Nos. AT-1633-04993-001-02 and AT-1633-04993-002-02 respectively.

> 28.    Chan Si Jia, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-16-00781-1 ASHVIN S/O RAGUPATHY xxx” issued the certificate bearing the Lab No. AT-1633-04993-001-02, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.

> 29.    Tan Joo Chin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-16-00781-2 ASHVIN S/O RAGUPATHY xxx” issued the certificate bearing the Lab No. AT-1633-04993-002-02, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.

> 30.    11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, a cannabinol derivative, is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

> 31.    The accused’s urine was tested positive for 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid due to his consumption of the said drug on or about 3 June 2016. The accused admits to smoking ‘weed’ since January 2014. He initially smoked weed about once a week. Prior to his arrest, he was smoking about two to three cigarettes of weed a week.

> 32.    The accused is not authorised to consume 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid under the MDA or in the Regulations made thereunder. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

## Consideration of sentence

6       Where the quantity of cannabis trafficked is not less than 330 grams and not more than 500 grams, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) is a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment, and to a mandatory 15 strokes of the cane.

7       For the drug consumption and drug possession charges, the prescribed punishment for each of these charges under s 33(1) of the MDA is a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or a fine of up to $20,000 or to both.

8       The prosecution submitted that the sentence for the drug trafficking charge should be 26 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and that a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for each of the drug consumption and drug possession charges. It also submitted that the sentences in the trafficking and consumption charges should run consecutively, so that the total sentence would be 26 years and 9 months’ imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane.

9       The defence submitted that the appropriate sentence for the drug trafficking charge should be 22 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. For the drug consumption and possession charges, the defence submitted for a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment per charge. Overall, the defence submitted for a sentence of 22 years and 7 months’ imprisonment and to 15 strokes of the cane.

10     The starting point in considering sentence for the drug trafficking offence would be the weight of the drugs involved. In _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 25</span> (“_Suventher_”), the Court of Appeal stated at \[29\]-\[30\] that the indicative starting point for the unauthorised import or trafficking in 431 to 500 grams of cannabis is between 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. The indicative starting point may then be adjusted upwards or downwards to take into account the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.

11     In callibrating the indicative starting point, I adopted the approach taken in _Public Prosecutor v Ravan s/o Samubil_ and others <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 103</span> (“_Ravan_”), where 499.99 grams of cannabis was trafficked. Hoo Sheau Peng, J (at \[55\]) took the indicative starting point to be 29 years’ imprisonment, being the highest end of the range of 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment for the weight of between 431 to 500 grams of cannabis trafficked. As the amount of cannabis trafficked in the present case was 499.99 grams, the indicative starting point would also be 29 years’ imprisonment.

12     Sentence would then be calibrated upwards or downwards to take into account the accused’s culpability and the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.

13     The prosecution argued that the culpability of the accused fell in the middle of the spectrum. It contended that while his role was limited to receiving and storing the drugs in his flat, there were three aggravating factors:-

> (a)     There was pre-meditation and planning. The accused agreed to help Kannan conceal the drugs as he knew Kannan was reporting for urine tests and it was unsafe for Kannan to keep the drugs;

> (b)     The accused took active steps to conceal the drugs by pushing the two blocks of weed (“cannabis”) under his bed to hide them; and

> (c)     There was an additional drug trafficking charge which was TIC.

14     In terms of culpability, by agreeing to keep the drugs for Kannan, the accused intended to help Kannan conceal the drugs as he knew Kannan was reporting for urine tests (SOF at \[11\]). This would have enabled Kannan to proceed to traffic the drugs. Apart from this, the accused played a role in repacking the drugs by handing a plastic bag to Kannan. He also helped conceal the drugs by pushing the drugs under the bed. However, these factors did not have a material impact on sentence.

15     More importantly, the accused had himself also trafficked in the drugs delivered to him. This formed the basis of DAC 940247-2016 which was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He took some weed from the opened block, wrapped it in some paper, and passed it to Arun through his bedroom window (SOF at \[12\]). Due weight was placed on this TIC charge which carried a minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.

16     In his plea-in-mitigation, counsel stated that the accused had only played a limited role and had reluctantly agreed to help Kannan. Kannan was the mastermind behind the criminal endeavour and the intended customers were clients of Kannan. The accused was not a co-ordinator. In relation to the packing of the drugs, the accused merely handed a plastic bag to Kannan while Kannan was repacking the cannabis. The accused kept the remainder under his bed as per Kannan’s instructions. I accepted the contention that the accused’s role was limited.

17     In considering sentence, I also took into the account the fact that the accused was a first offender, that he had shown remorse by pleading guilty at an early opportunity, that he had co-operated with the authorities and will continue to do so as a witness. It was a significant mitigating factor that the accused had not received or was promised any monetary benefit for his crime. He had foolishly committed the offence and had helped Kannan out of friendship.

18     However, the submission by the defence that there should be a downward adjustment from the indicative starting point due to the accused’s relative youth was totally devoid of merit. The accused was already 25 years old at the time he committed the offences. He was working as a safety coordinator with a shipping firm and could not be considered to be relatively youthful.

19     The accused’s accomplice Arun was sentenced to 24 years’ imprisonment and to 15 strokes of the cane for drug trafficking. Arun’s role was only to deliver the drugs to the accused. In so doing, Arun had also acted foolishly and did not offend for profit. There were no aggravating factors in Arun’s case, nor were there any TIC offences. As the accused was slightly more culpable than Arun and as one further charge of drug trafficking was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, I was of the view that an uplift of one year’s imprisonment (from Arun’s sentence) should be imposed.

20     In view of the aforesaid, I sentenced the accused to 25 years’ imprisonment for the drug trafficking charge. This represented a significant downward adjustment from the starting indicative sentence of 29 years’ imprisonment. He was also sentenced to the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane.

21     For the charge of drug consumption, the sentencing range set out in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ \[2005\] 3 SLR (R) for first time offenders would be 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment. The accused could not be considered a first offender as he admitted to smoking weed since January 2014 (SOF at \[31\]). One further charge of consuming methamphetamine (DAC 940250-2016) was also TIC. I was of the view that a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was appropriate. This sentence would run consecutively with the drug trafficking charge.

22     For the offence relating to the possession of 0.21 gram of methamphetamine, the amount of drugs was quite small. The accused was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment (which was within the usual range), with sentence to run concurrently.

23     The aggregate sentence was 25 years and 8 months’ imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane. In my assessment, sentence was proportional to the offences committed and was not in totality manifestly excessive.
