\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 32 of 2019.\]

17 October 2019

### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

1       I write this grounds of decision for the purpose of the Defendants’ appeal against my decision, following leave to do so granted by the High Court.[^1] By reference to the Defendants’ leave application, it appears that leave to appeal was granted for the following three prayers:

> a)     The granting of leave for the Respondent to amend his Statement of Claim dated 21st September 2016;

> b)     The refusal of leave for the Applicants to amend their Defence dated 21st March 2017 pursuant to the amendment of the Respondent’s Statement of Claim;

> c)     The whole decision of the Honourable Magistrate (_sic_) … at the trial of MC/MC 16661/2016.

2       I heard and decided this matter on 10th December 2018 as an MC-simplified trial pursuant to O108 of the Rules of Court.

3       I found for the Plaintiff whose claim was for damage to his car caused by the first Defendant’s bus (“the bus”), driven by the second Defendant. The Plaintiff’s case at trial was that he was driving with his family on the right lane of Orchard Boulevard, just outside ION Orchard, in the direction of Paterson Road, when the bus changed from the lane on his left into the right lane, without signalling, thus resulting in the right side of the rear bumper of the bus hitting the left side of the front bumper of the Plaintiff’s car.

4       As parties had agreed on the quantum, I allowed the claim at the agreed quantum of $8,390.10, with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ. As the Plaintiff had amended his Statement of Claim (upon counsel’s application made during oral closing submissions), I ordered costs of and incidental to the application fixed at $500 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants. I also fixed costs of the trial at $3,500 to be paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiff.

5       As originally pleaded, the accident took place on 29th (_sic_) September 2010 “along Orchard Road near to Paterson Road”. No time was stated.

6       The Defence denied any such accident. Pro-actively, the Defence referred to the police report (dated 26th September 2010) and Singapore Accident Statement (dated 27th September 2010) lodged by the Plaintiff which placed the time of the accident at 1:45pm on 26th September 2010. The Defence was that at that time, the bus “was not at or in the vicinity of the alleged accident location _i.e._ Orchard Road near to Paterson Road. On 26th September 2010 at or about 1:45pm, the Defendants’ Bus was at the bus stop near Block 223 Bukit Panjang Road.”[^2]

7       It is right that I first set out the reasons that I gave parties before I address further some of the matters that might be useful for the purpose of the appeal. I set out verbatim my said reasons[^3] in the following paragraphs \[8\] to \[18\].

##### Quote:

8       This would have been a straightforward NIMA claim had not a few mishaps happened. Amongst other things, the following occurred. The Plaintiff got his exact location of the accident wrong when he stated that it occurred on Orchard Road near ION Orchard (his AEIC/police report) and Orchard Road near to Paterson Road (SOC). In regard to the Defence, the Defendants pleaded that as at the time stated for the accident in the Plaintiff’s police report and accident statement, not a time mentioned in the SOC, _i.e._, 1:45pm, the Defendants’ bus was actually at Block 223 Bukit Panjang. The Defendant did not state, in its Defence or the AEICs of its four witnesses, that in fact at some time around that alleged by the Plaintiff as being the time of the accident, the bus in question was in fact on Orchard Boulevard after having exited from Orchard Turn. The impression I had was that the bus was never in the Orchard Road area.

9       As the case stands now, it is clear that the Plaintiff says that he was on the rightmost lane of Orchard Boulevard when the Defendants’ bus (which is an extra-long bus with two portions said to be colloquially called a bendy bus) encroached into his lane so that its right rear swiped against the front left of the Plaintiff’s car causing it relatively minor damage considering that the allegedly offending vehicle was a huge bus. This was close to the junction at Paterson Road.

10     The Defendants’ evidence is that the bus in question did ply the route where the Plaintiff now places the accident. By 1:45pm on 26th September 2010, however, it had gone on to Bukit Panjang. It is also reasonably clear that the said bus was at Orchard Boulevard about 1:33pm.

11     Mr Teo has applied to amend the SOC as Ms Lee has repeatedly stated that she objects to the unpleaded evidence as much as she would object to any amendment whatsoever at this time of the proceedings. Ms Lee says, correctly, that time-bar has kicked in.

12     Mr Teo’s proposed amendment is to substitute “Orchard Boulevard” for “Orchard Road” in paragraph 1 of the SOC. Considering O20 r5(2) rw r5(5) of the Rules of Court, I think that the amendment really only arises out of substantially the same facts as originally pleaded except for the change of the road name and that it would be just that I allow the amendment notwithstanding the time-bar. This is subject to the issue of costs and whether I need to make any other consequential orders.

13     There is no reason, _a fortiori_, to disbelieve either the Plaintiff when he complained about the accident or the bus driver, _i.e._, the second Defendant, when he said that he felt no impact whatsoever and did not think any accident occurred.

14     I consider that the objective facts are particularly useful in this case. In the Plaintiff’s police report, he did state that the accident was “outside ION Orchard going towards Paterson Road”. This description is more apt to refer to Orchard Boulevard as opposed to Orchard Road (bearing in mind 2AB12 to which Ms Lee helpfully referred me in closing).

15     The damage to the car is such that it might well have been possible for it to have been sustained without causing any reaction to the bus in question so that it was unsurprising that the second Defendant did not feel any form of impact and moved on right along. Given this, it was also not surprising that there was no visible damage to the bus in question.

16     The Plaintiff’s complaint of the accident, in spite of the denials of the Defendants, is consistent with the Defendants’ evidence when all of it is in. The bus survey reports show that the bus was at Orchard Turn near Ngee Ann City just about 1:27pm. It would have been on Orchard Boulevard at about 1:33pm. This is not too far away from the time stipulated by the Plaintiff, _i.e._, about 1:45pm. The Plaintiff’s time-stipulation can at most be estimated and 1:33pm would be about 1:45pm.

17     I am satisfied that on a balance of probabilities the accident did take place as the Plaintiff complained. Based on the evidence overall, the Plaintiff’s complaint likely did occur. The fact that the second Defendant did not know of its occurrence was simply because the impact was relatively so small that it caused no palpable reaction in the Defendants’ bus.

18     As quantum has been agreed at $8,390.10, my decision is that the Defendants shall pay the Plaintiff $8,390.10 with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ.

##### Unquote:

19     I would now like to explain a little more, where appropriate, some of the matters I articulated at \[8\] to \[18\].

20     The mishaps I referred to at \[8\] had to do with the pleadings. In his Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff omitted the time of the accident, stated the wrong date for the accident and placed the location wrongly at Orchard Road. Only the last was the subject of the Defendants’ complaint. In respect of the Defendants’ case, this had to do with the fact that they (possibly tactically) pleaded that the bus was at a different location, omitting altogether any reference to the bus having been on Orchard Boulevard as its itinerary. The affidavits of evidence-in-chief of the four Defendants’ witnesses stated the itinerary in only general terms as “Choa Chu Kang bus interchange to New Bridge Road Terrace; and New Bridge Road Terrace back to Choa Chu Kang bus interchange.”[^4]

21     In respect of \[9\] above, the Plaintiff had corrected the location of the accident to Orchard Boulevard at the end of his examination-in-chief.[^5] That the Plaintiff had made an error in respect of the actual road name was plain from three documents. The Plaintiff’s sketch[^6] states that the road on which the accident occurred was Orchard Road (_sic_) in the direction of Paterson Road. In his police report[^7], made on the day of the accident, the Plaintiff states in the band for “location” “Orchard Road outside ION Orchard going towards Paterson Road”. The Google map[^8] produced by the Defendants at trial shows the parts of this Orchard vicinity partly enclosed by a drawn red line (showing the relevant parts of the route taken by the bus) – Orchard Road, a one-way road, leads _away from_ Paterson Road, and, Orchard Boulevard, a one-way road, leads _towards_ Paterson Road (with ION Orchard on the right of Orchard Boulevard).

22     It is also noteworthy that the Plaintiff identified the bus in his two contemporaneous documents mentioned in the foregoing paragraph. In his police report, he said: “I did not take note which bus service number it is but I did take note of its registration plate number as TIB897L.”[^9] I was careful to note that the Plaintiff’s allegation was specific to the registration number of the bus, as opposed to the service number which was general to buses that plied the same route as the bus. In my view, and considering that this was a contemporary allegation, it pointed to the factual accuracy of the Plaintiff’s allegation.

23     With respect to \[10\], the Defendants produced two bus stop survey reports which tracked precisely, down to a second or two, the locations of their buses. The second bus stop survey report concerns the time of the bus (“897”) being at a bus stop in front of “Ngee Ann City (ORCHARD TURN)” at 1:27pm, minutes away from the accident location further away on Orchard Boulevard.

24     With regard to \[14\] to \[17\], the factual probabilities were thus in favour of a finding in favour of the Plaintiff. From the very start, he had got the bus number right (without knowing the service number) and he had drawn a sketch which effectually quadrated with Orchard Boulevard (rather than Orchard Road), a little distance from its junction with Paterson Road. There was no argument over the fact that his car was damaged, as shown by the agreed quantum.

25     I would now deal briefly with why I allowed the Plaintiff’s amendment to correct the road name from “Orchard Road” to “Orchard Boulevard”, which the learned Plaintiff’s counsel had characterised (not unreasonably, I thought) as one approximating a clarification as much as it was a correction.[^10]

26     A Plaintiff may be permitted to amend his statement of claim “at any stage of the proceedings” (O25 r5(1), ROC), the issue always being whether the Defendant is prejudiced in a way that cannot be compensated in costs. Looking at \[12\] above, (where I had referred to O20 r5(2) and 5(5) owing to the learned Defendants’ counsel’s objection over the Plaintiff’s action having by then become time-barred), and having now checked again the record, I am of the view that O20 r5(2) and 5(5) do not apply; the amendment application was in reality not one “to add or substitute a new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts…” What the amendment did was simply to correct the location of the accident rather than to change his cause of action and this fell within O20 r5(1).

27     The learned Defendants’ counsel’s objections during oral submissions, before I rendered my decision on the dispute in the trial, was limited to why I should not allow the amendment at all owing to O20 r5(2) and (5) referred to in the foregoing paragraph.[^11]

28     After I rendered my decision, the learned Defendants’ counsel sought, if not in those words, to persuade me that the amendments would cause the Defendants prejudice which could not be compensated by costs alone. It was argued that there were defences that might have been run which were not, such as contributory negligence. It was also argued that counsel might have dealt with why white paint had been transferred onto the damaged part of the Plaintiff’s car.[^12] Apart from these points having been made too late owing to these being points concerned with supposed prejudice going to whether the amendment should have been allowed, I failed to see why the former (_i.e._, contributory negligence) could not have been pleaded as an alternative to denial right at the start. As for the latter (_i.e._, the white paint, if such it was, as opposed to a defect in the photograph or something else), I told counsel that this was a matter that could have been taken up in cross-examination during the trial to discredit the Plaintiff, which was not done.

29     The learned Defendants’ counsel wished to amend, by way of a purported consequential amendment to, the Defence, to say that “the accident happened with a different vehicle”. I did not allow the proposed amendment because it was not in fact consequential on the amendment of the Statement of Claim.[^13]

30     The Defendants’ proposed amendment would have injected (subject to my rider in the last sentence) a needless, positive element into the Defendants’ case of which it had nothing in the way of proof, when all that was desired really was to put the Plaintiff to proof, which was the extant Defence. It had nothing to do with the correction of the location of the accident and was not consequential to the claim amendment I allowed. Worse, it might have entailed prolonging the trial for further evidence to be led or else it would have been purposeless. At the very least, it would have entailed evidence about the supposed white paint, which might have been gone into in counsel’s cross-examination pre-amendment, as part of her exercise in discrediting the Plaintiff and challenging his proof.
