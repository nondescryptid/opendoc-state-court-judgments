13 June 2022

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore engaged in the provision of management consultancy services. Mr Cano Laskin Alexandro David (“Mr Cano”) is the majority shareholder owning 94.56% of the plaintiff’s shares and one of its two directors[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). He was a Russian national who moved to Singapore in 2004 and has since become a Singapore citizen[^2]. Mr Cano has been joined as a third party in these proceedings and has been referred to as “Alex” in the pleadings[^3]. In this judgment, he will be referred to as “Mr Cano” or the “Third Party”.

2       The defendant, Tymoshchuk Oleksii, is stated as a Ukrainian in the court records. He reportedly also holds a Russian passport under the name of “Alexey Timoshchuk”[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). He was employed under an employment pass by a company called Russian Singapore Pte Ltd from 2012 but he also had business interests outside Singapore and frequently travelled overseas for business purposes[^5].

3       Mr Cano is the sole shareholder and director[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) of Russian Singapore Pte Ltd which he incorporated in 2008 with a view to better serve the Russian community in Singapore[^7]. The principal activities of Russian Singapore Pte Ltd are stated to be publishing of journals, periodicals and magazines as well as exhibition organisers.[^8]

4       Although the defendant’s employment with Russian Singapore Pte Ltd ceased in 2015, both he and Mr Cano continued to have dealings with each other. The nature of these dealings and the reasons for them are in dispute. According to the defendant, it was because Mr Cano had borrowed money from him, and was paying off his debt whereas Mr Cano says that they had continued to have business dealings with each other[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9).

5       The claim and counterclaim in this action arise from the different characterisations by Mr Cano and the defendant of their dealings with each other.

## The plaintiff’s claim

6       The plaintiff’s pleaded claim against the defendant is for the repayment of the sum of S$79,296.94 being the equivalent of US$58,850. This sum of money had been transferred from the plaintiff’s bank account to the defendant’s bank account for the defendant to make payment to one “Sergey” in Moscow[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10).

7       According to the plaintiff, the defendant had agreed to carry out the payment of the money as evidenced by messages exchanged on the WhatsApp platform between Mr Cano and the defendant from 2 July 2019 to 4 July 2019[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). The defendant knew that the sum of S$79,296.94 had been transferred to him solely for him to deliver the equivalent sum of US$58,850 to “Sergey” in Moscow on behalf of the plaintiff[^12]. However, the defendant subsequently failed to carry out the payment to “Sergey” and also refused to return the money to the plaintiff. Mr Cano’s repeated WhatsApp messages to the defendant sent between 5 July to 12 July 2019 to verify if the transfer to “Sergey” had been carried out were ignored[^13].

8       The plaintiff claims that it is entitled to be repaid the sum of S$79,296.94 which had been transferred from its bank account to the defendant being monies had and received by the defendant for the plaintiff[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14).

## The defence

9       The defendant denies the plaintiff’s claim altogether and denies that the plaintiff is entitled to any of the reliefs sought. He says that he had not agreed to carry out any payment on behalf of the plaintiff[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15).

10     The defendant says that at all material times, he had dealt with the Third Party and at no material time did the Third Party disclose the involvement of the plaintiff in their messages exchanged on WhatsApp. While he did receive the sum of S$79,269.94 into his account with DBS Bank, he denies that he had received it for, or to the use of, the plaintiff. He had no knowledge of which party had transferred the sum of S$79,269.94 into his DBS bank account[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

11     The Third Party had also not disclosed the full name of “Sergey”, the full address of “Sergey” nor any reason why US$58,850 was needed to be given to “Sergey” in Moscow in cash. The identity and location of the proposed recipient as well as the purpose of the transfer of the monies were not sufficiently ascertainable nor disclosed by the Third Party [\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

12     Further, as the defendant was not travelling to Moscow physically, it was never intended that the defendant himself would hand over US$58,850 to “Sergey” in Moscow in cash[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18).

13     The defendant denies that he had ignored the Third Party’s WhatsApp messages sent between 5 July 2019 and 12 July 2019. He pleaded that the messages received from the Third Party were difficult to understand, such as,

> “He is sitting there and waiting for them. He get nervous”; “It’s not my money”; “it’s not mine”; “It will start such a mess, it will be impossible to stop”; “there is very little time left”; “Have mercy on me!”; “It’s not my money”; “But this is not my money and the consequences will be terrible”; and “In Moscow, I have to give back not $58,850, but + $1,500 (a penalty for the late payment) May I bring this money by cash?”[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19).

14     The defendant avers that he learnt for the first time of the alleged involvement of the plaintiff in the matter of handing over US$58,850 to “Sergey” in Moscow in cash only when he received the letter of demand from the plaintiff’s solicitors dated 22 July 2019 demanding payment of $79,269.94 by 12.00pm on 24 July 2019. The letter of demand had alleged an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant which he denies[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20).

15     In the event that the Third Party had caused S$79,269.94 to be paid out from an account of the plaintiff into the defendant’s DBS Bank account for handing over of the sum of US$58,850 to “Sergey” in Moscow in cash, the defendant was unaware of any business reason for the plaintiff to do so. Consequently, the Third Party’s action in making the payment to the defendant would be in breach of his statutory and fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21).

16     The defendant pointed out that prior to the Third Party’s request to hand over US$58,850 to “Sergey” in Moscow in cash, he had alleged that his personal accounts, and also company accounts of the plaintiff, had been closed. The Third Party had, in particular, provided the defendant with a letter issued by Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Limited (“SCB”) to the plaintiff dated 14 June 2019 entitled “Notice of account closure”. SCB’s letter stated that due to increasing standards on client due diligence across the financial industry, after a recent review of the plaintiff’s account/s, SCB was no longer able to continue its banking relationship with the plaintiff. Reference was made to the SCB website on “Customer Due Diligence” or “CDD” wherein it was mentioned that the bank’s CDD procedures ensure that it knows who its customers are and the need to spot any suspicious occurrence, in particular money laundering[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22).

17     The defendant further disclosed that on a date and for reasons not clear to him, the sum of S$79,269.94 in his DBS Bank account had been frozen by an order issued by the Singapore Police Force. In the circumstances, the defendant awaits the direction or order from the court[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23).

18     As for the plaintiff’s pleaded claim, the defendant stated that there is no such cause of action as “monies had and received”. In the event that the plaintiff was seeking equitable relief, it was the defendant’s position that the plaintiff had not come to court with clean hands[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24).

19     If the defendant were found liable to the plaintiff on its claim, he seeks to set off against such liability such sums as he may be awarded by way of his counterclaim.

## The counterclaim and third party claim

20     The defendant had launched a counterclaim as well as a third party claim which is premised on the exact same set of facts.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

21     The defendant had pleaded that if he were found liable to the plaintiff on its claim, he would counterclaim against the Third Party for contribution for the whole of the plaintiff’s claim on account of the latter’s breach of his statutory and fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). Additionally, the defendant had pleaded a set-off based on his counterclaim[^27].

### Defendant’s claim for repayment of outstanding loan given to the Third Party

22     In chronological sequence, the first head of the defendant’s counterclaim is premised on a loan allegedly provided by the defendant to the Third Party at the latter’s request in 2013 as outlined below[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28):

> (a)     The Third Party had borrowed S$195,700 from the defendant on or around 22 June 2013 and has been indebted to the defendant since.

> (b)     Over the years, the Third Party had made part payments of various sums to the defendant pursuant to such debt, _viz_ once in 2014, six times in 2015, ten times in 2016, 11 times in 2017, and six times in 2019 with the last part payment made on 15 May 2019, leaving a balance of S$56,500 outstanding.

> (c)     The Third Party had made a significant portion of such part payments of his personal debt through the accounts and credit cards of the plaintiff, making no distinction between himself and the plaintiff in respect of which he controls as a director and majority shareholder with 94.56% shareholding.

> (d)     Despite repeated demands, the Third Party has failed to repay the defendant. In the premises, the defendant claims that the Third Party and/or the plaintiff are jointly and severally liable to the defendant for the repayment of the outstanding debt of $56,500.

### Defendant’s claim for work done at the Third Party’s request

23     The defendant’s second head of claim is for work done in relation to a website development project[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29):

> (a)     At the Third Party’s request, the defendant had on or around May 2019 agreed to procure the provision of services related to certain websites (“Russian Visa”/russianvisa.sg and “Visa-Singapore” / singaporevisa.sg) and their underlying systems based on blockchain technology, which websites were to be run or managed by the plaintiff.

> (b)     An offer to commence work was accepted by the Third Party on or around 18 March 2019. The work was completed by July 2019.

> (c)     It was an express, alternatively an implied term of the agreement that the Third Party and the plaintiff would be jointly and severally liable to pay the defendant a reasonable sum for the work. However, in breach of the agreement, the Third Party and the plaintiff had refused to pay the defendant a reasonable or any sum.

> (d)     On a _quantum meruit_ basis, the defendant claims that a reasonable remuneration for the work done is $82,000.

### The defendant’s claim that the corporate veil should be pierced and the plaintiff and the Third Party be jointly and severally liable

24     The defendant claims that the Third Party had made no distinction between himself and the plaintiff in all of his affairs, and the corporate veil of the plaintiff should be pierced because[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30):

> (a)     The Third Party is liable to the defendant but is deliberately evading or frustrating such liability by interposing a company under his control.

> (b)     The Third Party is the alter ego of the company as the company is carrying on the business of the Third Party, its controller.

> (c)     The Third Party has abused the separate legal personality of the company to the detriment of other parties such as the defendant.

25     The defendant claims the following reliefs against the Third Party[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31):

> (a)     contribution from the Third Party towards the whole of the plaintiff’s claim for causing $79,269.94 to be transferred out of the account of the plaintiff for no known business of the plaintiff in breach of his statutory and fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff;

> (b)     the Third Party and the plaintiff be jointly and severally liable to the defendant for a principal outstanding debt of $56,500, for which the defendant is entitled to contribution towards the plaintiff's claim, set-off against the plaintiff's claim, and/or by counterclaim; and

> (c)     the Third Party and the plaintiff be jointly and severally liable to the defendant for work that the Third Party engaged, the benefit of which was for the plaintiff, in the sum of S$82,000 as _quantum meruit_ or in the alternative, such sum as may be assessed in damages, for which the defendant is entitled to contribution towards the plaintiff's claim, set-off against the plaintiff's claim, and/or by counterclaim.  

## Issues

26     Based on the various contentions raised by the parties in this action, the following issues arise for the court to decide:

> (a)     Whether the plaintiff’s pleaded claim in monies had and received constitutes a valid cause of action; and if so, whether the claim is proven;

> (b)     Whether the Third Party is indebted to the defendant in the sum of S$56,500 being the outstanding balance of loans given by the defendant to the Third Party from 2013;

> (c)     Whether there was any agreement reached between the plaintiff and the defendant for a website development project; and if so, what is the amount due to the defendant, if any;

> (d)     Whether the corporate veil of the plaintiff should be pierced such that the plaintiff and the Third Party be jointly and severally liable to the defendant on his counterclaim and third party claim.

### Whether the plaintiff’s pleaded claim in monies had and received constitutes a valid cause of action

#### Defendant’s submission

27     The defendant made a fundamental challenge to the plaintiff’s pleaded claim in monies had and received in his assertion that no such cause of action exists. Counsel for the defendant, Mr Daniel Lim (“Mr Lim”), submitted that the plaintiff’s cause of action has not been properly pleaded[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32). Reliance was placed on the Court of Appeal’s observations in _Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> (“_Alwie Handoyo_”) at \[124\] and \[125\], see below:

> 124    Second, although the Plaintiffs’ claim in Suit 89 against Alwie in respect of the US$550,000 was pleaded as _money had and received_, that, strictly speaking, is not a cause of action. The action of money had and received was a type of “common” count. Common counts were historical pleading devices that permitted the pleading of claims in _general_ terms with specific details of the debt sought to be recovered left to the law of evidence: _Mason & Carter_ (\[112\] _supra_) at paras 114–115. We refer to Prof Yeo Tiong Min’s (“Prof Yeo”) helpful explanation in “Restitution, Tracing, and Change of Position” \[1994\] SJLS 138 at 140:

>> The action for money had and received is no more than a form of action, from a distant time in English legal history when plaintiffs had to take writs out in specific formats. It says nothing more than that the defendant owes the plaintiff a debt \[footnote omitted\]. The **_reason_** for the debt is **_unexplained_**. **_To call the action for money had and received a cause of action is akin to calling an action for damages a cause of action_**. It adds nothing to the analysis.

>> \[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics\]

> 125    The use of “common” counts or forms of action has since been abolished, but the nomenclature associated with that system has persisted. That should change, as is the case in Canada where references to most “common” counts have “more or less disappeared from contemporary Canadian professional discourse”: Peter D Maddaugh and John D McCamus, _The Law of Restitution_ vol 1 (Canada Law Book, Looseleaf Edition, 2013) at para 4:300. Plaintiffs should be precise in elucidating the basis for their restitutionary claims. Identifying the precise underlying cause of action for a restitutionary claim has practical consequences in terms of affecting what the plaintiff needs to show in order to establish the claim. We agree with the comment by the editors of _Goff & Jones (8th Ed_) (\[101\] _supra_) at para 1.29 that “\[t\]he old language of ‘money had and received’ … conceals as much as it reveals about the nature of a claim”. In our view, the underlying basis for the action for money had and received is now embraced under the rubric of unjust enrichment: see _Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] AC 669</span> at 710.

28     Mr Lim further referred to a number of authorities including _Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 44</span> in which the Court of Appeal has made it clear that unjust enrichment is a separate cause of action with restitution as a remedy[^33]. No amendment has been sought by the plaintiff to amend its claim to one of unjust enrichment, despite its counsel’s representation that he would do so if there was a need. As such, Mr Lim submitted that no leniency should be accorded. The plaintiff’s pleadings are fatal to its claim, and accordingly, the claim should be dismissed.

29     While _prima facie_ it might seem that the plaintiff’s claim was intended to be one in unjust enrichment on the ground of failure of basis – the basis being the Third Party’s request to the defendant to pay Sergei in Moscow US$58,850 in cash which failed as the defendant did not carry it out – Mr Lim submitted that the basis for the payment was something else. It was the performance of a counter-promise that the defendant would arrange the courier “on the Sergei matter” after the Third Party enters into a written contract on the repayment of the personal loan[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34).

30     Mr Lim sought to draw an analogy of the present case to the facts in _Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v Jiacipto Jiaravanon_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 696</span> (“_Simpson Marine_”). The Court of Appeal in _Simpson Marine_, in dealing with a claim for a refund of a pre-contract deposit paid for the intended purchase of a yacht, had found that the basis for payment of the deposit did not fail. It reversed the High Court’s decision as the payment of the deposit was not made on the basis that a contract of purchase would be executed such that there was a total failure of consideration when the respondent payor decided not to proceed with the purchase. The Court found on the evidence that the basis of the deposit was to keep the property (_viz._ the two yachts) off the market for a specified period until the respondent could decide which yacht he wanted to buy. As the yachts were in fact kept off the market for a specified period, there was no total failure of basis when the respondent decided not to purchase either yacht. Hence, the appellant was not liable to return the deposit.

31     Similarly, in the present case, it was submitted that the basis of the payment (_ie_ that the defendant would pass US$58,850 to Sergei in Moscow) did not fail when the transfer did not materialise because[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35):

> (a)     the defendant was prepared to move forward with the deal, being that the S$79,269.94 would be withheld pending a guarantee by the Third Party for the S$56,500 outstanding loan owed him; and

> (b)     the defendant was not unjustly enriched when no transfer materialised because he was waiting for the Third Party’s guarantee before transferring the US$58,850.

32     In the premises, the elements of unjust enrichment are not made out.

33     Mr Lim submitted further that the plaintiff had not come to court with clean hands, relying on the dicta of the High Court in _Ong Lu Ling v Tan Ho Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 65</span> (“_Ong Lu Ling_”) at \[11\] that in such a case, the loss will have to lie where falls. Part of the reason why the defendant had not made the transfer was due to the fear that he might be involved in the furtherance of an unlawful purpose in making the transfer of the cash to Sergei. The legitimacy of the transaction was highly suspect given the alarming statements that the Third Party had made to him in the WhatsApp messages and the evidence given by Sergei in cross-examination[^36].

#### Plaintiff’s / Third Party’s submission

34     Counsel for the plaintiff and Third Party, Mr K Bala Chandran (“Mr Bala”), submitted[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) that the observations of the Court of Appeal in _Alwie Handoyo_ at \[124\] and \[125\] pertaining to a pleading of money had and received should be viewed in their proper context. He sought to rely on the remarks of the High Court in the same case, _Tjong Very Sumito and others v Chan Sing En and others_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 953</span>, which had allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for money had and received against two of the defendants wherein the High Court had explained that:

> A claim of money had and received is part of the wider body of the law of unjust enrichment (_Star Cruise Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 183</span> at \[120\]), provided the following conditions are satisfied:

>> (a)    the defendant has received a benefit (_ie_, he has been enriched);

>> (b)    the enrichment is at the plaintiff’s expense;

>> (c)    it is unjust to allow the defendant to retain the enrichment; and

>> (d)    there are no defences available to the defendant.

35     Mr Bala also referred the court to a subsequent case, _Viet Hai Petroleum Corp v Ng Jun Quan and another and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 887</span> (“_Viet Hai Petroleum_”) where the plaintiff’s claim of money had and received based on a total failure of consideration was allowed. Chua Lee Ming JC (as His Honour then was) had opined as follows:

> \[42\]  In my view, the plaintiff also succeeded in its alternative claim for money had and received.

> \[43\]  The underlying basis for a claim for money had and received is subsumed under the rubric of unjust enrichment: _Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> (at \[125\]). As the Court of Appeal went on to observe, unjust enrichment is the event and restitution the response to that event (at \[126\]). So to say one has ‘an action for money had and received’ means that one claims restitution of money paid on the ground that there has been unjust enrichment. One such instance of unjust enrichment is ‘total failure of consideration’.

36     Accordingly, Mr Bala submitted that the proper way to view a pleading of “money had and received” is to examine if the facts give rise to a claim in unjust enrichment; if they do, the claim must be allowed. Applying the principles as elucidated, it was submitted that the plaintiff’s claim here must be allowed as all the four elements of a claim in unjust enrichment are met, as outlined below[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38):

> (a)      Elements 1 and 2 (receipt of benefit by defendant and defendant having benefitted at claimant’s expense):

>> It is not disputed that the plaintiff did transfer the sum of S$79,269.94 to the defendant. As such, it must be found that the defendant did benefit at the expense of the plaintiff.

> (b)      Element 3 (unjust factor):

>> From the plaintiff’s pleadings, it is abundantly clear that the plaintiff is relying on “total failure of consideration”, _ie_ total failure by the defendant to effect delivery of moneys to Sergey in Moscow, which was the entire purpose of the transfer in the first place.

> (c)      Element 4 (no defence):

>> The only “defences” pleaded by the defendant to the plaintiff’s claim are, first, that there is no such cause of action as “moneys had and received” and, second, that the plaintiff has not come to court with clean hands. The first pleaded defence of there being no cause of action is not sustainable. As for the second pleaded defence of no clean hands, the defendant’s allegation that the transfer was suspicious or improper was a baseless and unsupported speculation. It was clearly an afterthought since it was never raised contemporaneously.

37     While Mr Bala’s submissions at PCS \[36\] had stated that the plaintiff seeks leave, if necessary, to include the words “_the Defendant has been unjustly enriched in the sum of S$79,269.94_”, he nonetheless maintains that no amendment is needed to satisfy the plaintiff’s pleaded claim in unjust enrichment.

38     With regard to the defendant’s further submission that there was no unjust enrichment since he was waiting for the guarantee from the Third Party for the balance outstanding loan of S$56,500 before he moved forward with the transaction to transfer the US$58,850, the plaintiff pointed out that this was never pleaded, and was completely false.

#### My decision

##### Sufficient material facts pleaded to constitute unjust enrichment claim

39     In _Benzline Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 239</span> (“_Benzline Auto_”) at \[45\], the Court of Appeal had reiterated the constituent elements of a claim in unjust enrichment as follows:

> 45    The three requirements of a claim in unjust enrichment are (a) enrichment of the defendant, (b) at the expense of the plaintiff, and (c) circumstances which make the enrichment unjust (_ie_, the presence of an “unjust factor”): see _Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 540</span> at \[110\]. Additionally, the defendant may attempt to raise defences to defeat the claim in whole or to reduce the quantum of the claim.…

40     While the term “unjust enrichment” has not been used in the plaintiff’s statement of claim, it cannot be seriously argued that the three requirements of a cause of action in unjust enrichment are not disclosed on the face of the plaintiff’s pleaded case. Upon a perusal of the statement of claim, it is quite evident that the three requirements of an unjust enrichment claim are all set out therein, beginning from \[3\] which states:

> 3    The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for the sum of S$79,269.94, which had been transferred by the Plaintiff to the Defendant's bank account in Singapore for the Defendant to deliver on the Plaintiff’s behalf to one "Sergey" in Moscow, Russia, an amount equivalent to US$58,850.00. To date, the Defendant has neither delivered the said sum to Sergey nor returned same to the Plaintiff.

41     The first two requirements of enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the plaintiff are satisfied by the averment of the transfer of the monies from the plaintiff to the defendant’s bank account. The third requirement – circumstances which make the enrichment unjust or “unjust factor” being failure of consideration or failure of basis – is also encapsulated in \[3\] of the statement of claim. The Court of Appeal had elaborated on the scope of this “unjust factor” in _Benzline Auto_ at \[46\] as follows:

> 46    The specific unjust factor relied upon in this case was pleaded as a failure of consideration, which the Judge referred to instead as a “failure of basis”; the two terms are synonymous

> …

> …

> .. The concept of failure of basis is succinctly summarised in Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell & Stephen Watterson, _Goff & Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2016) (“_Goff & Jones_”) at para 12–01, as follows:

>> … The core underlying idea of failure of basis is simple: a benefit has been conferred on the joint understanding that the recipient’s right to retain it is conditional. If the condition is not fulfilled, the recipient must return the benefit. …

> The inquiry has two parts: first, what was the basis for the transfer in respect of which restitution is sought; and second, did that basis fail?

> 47    The first stage is largely common sense,

> …

> …

> 53    Having identified the basis of the transfer, the next step is to determine whether that basis has failed. The prevailing position is that the failure must be total, not partial.

42     In my view, the averments in the statement of claim are sufficient to inform the court of the unjust factor of “failure of basis” relied on, _ie_ failure by the defendant to deliver the monies to Sergey in Moscow contrary to his express agreement to do so, thus causing the enrichment of the defendant to be unjust, the material facts of which are as stated below:

> 5    By a WhatsApp message transmitted on or around 2 July 2019 at 5:08PM, Alex asked the Defendant if he could assist the Plaintiff in delivering the sum of US$58,850.OO to Moscow, Russia.

> 6    By several WhatsApp messages transmitted on or around 2 July 2019 from 5:09PM to 4 July 2019 at 5:39PM, the Defendant indicated willingness to so assist the Plaintiff.

> …

> 8    Pursuant to this arrangement, the Plaintiff made an Internet banking transfer of the sum of S$79,269.94 (being the equivalent of US$58.850.00 at the prevailing exchange rate) to the Defendant's DBS Bank account with account number XXXX.

> …

> 10    By WhatsApp messages transmitted on or around 4 July 2019 at 6:59PM, the Defendant acknowledged receipt of the said sum of S$79,269.94 and indicated that he would carry out the transfer of monies in Moscow as agreed.

> 11    By reason of the foregoing, the Defendant knew that the sum of S$79,269.94 had been transferred to him solely for him to deliver the equivalent sum in United States Dollars (i.e. US$58,850.OO) to Sergey in Moscow on behalf of the Plaintiff.

> 12    By a series of WhatsApp messages transmitted from 5 July 2019 to 12 July 2019, Alex attempted to verify with the Defendant if the monies had been handed over / transferred to Sergey, but the Defendant ignored the messages.

> 13    To date, the Defendant has neither handed over the sum of US$58,850.00 to Sergey in Moscow nor has he returned the sum of S$79,269.94 or any sum of money at all to the Plaintiff despite various requests by Alex on behalf of the Plaintiff.

43     It is noted that the High Court in _Ong Lu Ling_ at \[3\] had remarked that an action couched simply as “money had and received” was inadequate and an amendment of the cause of action to one of “unjust enrichment” was in order and had been allowed by consent. However, it would appear that no further particulars had been pleaded in that case unlike what is seen in the present case as stated above.

44     From my reading of the judgment in _Viet Hai Petroleum_, the claim was also pleaded in the alternative as one for money had and received on the basis of total failure of consideration. Although the remarks at \[42\] and \[43\] of _Viet Hai Petroleum_ were strictly _obiter_, the Court had nonetheless treated it as a claim in unjust enrichment.

45     The general rule of pleadings as set out in O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court 2014 requires that “every pleading must contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be”.

46     The facts pleaded by the plaintiff in its statement of claim are, in my view, sufficient for the court to find that the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff. As such, I disagree with the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff’s claim ought to be dismissed by reason of its pleadings alone.

##### Evidence adduced supports the elements of unjust enrichment

47     The material facts pertaining to the transfer of the monies from the plaintiff’s account and receipt of the monies by the defendant in his DBS account are clearly proven. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), the Third Party had exhibited a copy of the note from Maybank dated 19 July 2019 which showed that a transfer of S$79,269.94 had been made from the plaintiff’s account to the defendant’s account on 4 July 2019 at 18:42:27[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39). The transfer is admitted by the defendant[^40].

48     The defendant had also admitted during cross-examination that the funds went into his personal bank account[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41). This bank account with DBS was apparently “frozen” by the Singapore Police Force for the purposes of investigation after the Third Party had filed a police report. Notwithstanding that the account had been released sometime in December 2019, the defendant chose not to disclose this fact to the court when he filed his AEIC as he did not think it was important to mention it thus giving the wrong impression that his account was still “frozen”[^42] when the matter came for trial or as at the date of his AEIC.

49     The defendant had further admitted that he had been asked by the Third Party to effect the transfer of the monies to Sergei but he had failed to do so.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) It appears that he had deliberately not contacted Sergei to effect the transfer of the monies, see excerpt below[^44]:

> Q    … I am only asking in terms of this amount of that 79,000 you received, and you were saying in your message to him, “Hey, my courier is---will not drive around the whole day. Give me address. Give me contact information.” What was the purpose?

> A    Well, the purpose was to pass this money to this certain ‘Sergei’.

> Q    Right, but you did not do it, right?

> A    No.

50     In regard to the defendant’s submission[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) of a different basis for the transfer of monies being “_the performance of a counter-promise that the Defendant would arrange the courier on the Sergei matter after the Third Party enters into a written contract on the repayment of the personal loan_”, this is nowhere pleaded in the Defence and Counterclaim and the Third Party claim as correctly pointed out by Mr Bala[^46]. Since it had not been pleaded, the plaintiff and/or Third Party would not have had the opportunity to lead evidence on the defendant’s allegations. In any event, it has to be disregarded as the court is precluded from making any finding on an unpleaded matter.

51     Even if it were part of the defendant’s pleaded case, the evidence adduced does not support a finding that there was any alleged counter-promise by the defendant that he would arrange the payment to Sergei after the Third Party had provided a written contract or guarantee for repayment of his personal loan:

> (a)     The WhatsApp messages sent by the defendant to the Third Party between 2 July 2019 to 4 July 2019 which relate to the amount of US$58,820 required in Moscow do not contain any references to any outstanding debt due from the Third Party to the defendant.

> (b)     A reasonable reading of the messages sent by the defendant to the Third Party showed that he had agreed to arrange the transfer to Sergei upon receipt of the monies[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47):

>> (i)       On 4 July 2019 at 6.59pm, he had messaged the Third Party stating, “The money has come. I’ll fix it now in Moscow.” The defendant had earlier been given the address and phone number of Sergei.

>> (ii)       When the Third Party informed the defendant that Sergei had asked how long he should wait, and if the defendant could give the courier’s phone number, the defendant had answered, “10 - 15 min, I’ll give him a call, and write you immediately”

> (c)     The defendant had not at any time informed the plaintiff that he would be holding the money as security for the alleged debt. He had unilaterally decided that he would keep the money as a guarantee for the debt payment[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48), see excerpt below:

>> Q    … Mr. Tymoshchuk, whether or not he replied, you could have always returned the money, right?

>> A    Well, my thinking was, since he owes me money, I better--- so my thinking was, since he owes me money, I better keep this money as a guarantee for my debt payment.

>> Q    Did you tell him that?

>> A    No, I did not, because he refused to meet up with me.

>> Q    Did you message him to tell him that you will hold his money as a guarantee?

>> A    No, I did not.

> (d)     The Third Party’s explanation as regards the written document that he was prepared to sign is that this was to get repayment of the sum which had been transferred from the plaintiff’s account to the defendant for payment to Sergey, and not that he was guaranteeing repayment of his alleged personal loan to the defendant[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49). The Third Party had offered to have his lawyer do the paperwork needed for the defendant to deliver the money but the defendant had declined as he had his own lawyers. The Third Party’s account is consistent with the tenor of the messages seen in the Agreed Bundle at pages 152 to 153.

> (e)     The defendant had not produced any document prepared by his lawyers for the Third Party to sign pertaining to any repayment despite his message that it would be sent “very soon”[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50).

##### Unclean hands?

52     In support of a purported defence against any equitable relief being sought by the plaintiff, the defendant had cited the following dicta from _Ong Lu Ling_ at \[11\]:

> Unjust enrichment is an equitable relief, and equity is a fastidious and exacting companion of law; she demands that all supplicants before her arrive in court with clean hands. In this case, the plaintiff — and possibly everyone else who testified before me — was covered with dirt from head to toe. Ong Lu Ling’s prayer for a refund of the $600,000 will not be granted. The loss will have to lie where it falls, even if at undeserving feet. For the reasons above this action is dismissed and each party is to pay his own costs.

53     Mr Lim had canvassed the argument that part of the reason why the defendant did not make the transfer to Sergei was due to the fear that he might be involved in the furtherance of an unlawful purpose and cited the rather alarming WhatsApp messages received from the Third Party pertaining to Sergey. The suspicious nature of the transaction with Sergei was relied on as evidence of unclean hands.

54     In _Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 655</span> at \[181\], the Court of Appeal had explained that the view expressed in _Ong Lu Ling_ at \[11\] of unjust enrichment being a discretionary equitable relief is, with respect, mistaken. Instead, it is to be regarded as a claim based on strict liability at common law (subject to the defence of change of position). See _Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 801</span> at \[137\]. As such, Mr Lim’s submission of unclean hands on the part of the plaintiff/Third Party as a defence to defeat the plaintiff’s claim is with respect, misconceived.

55     The plaintiff has in any case provided evidence that the transaction and payment meant for Sergei was a legitimate one. The intended recipient of the funds, Sergei Efimov (“PW2”), had filed an AEIC to testify that he was the “Sergey” who had provided consultancy and marketing services to the plaintiff in respect of two contracts[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51). PW2 testified that he is a specialist in metallurgy who has worked in that field for more than 20 years[^52]. The sum of US$58,850 was to reimburse him for his expenses and payment for his services rendered to the plaintiff.

56     PW2 was subject to cross-examination by Mr Lim. He confirmed that the phone number given by the Third Party to the defendant to contact him was indeed his telephone number[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53). He also confirmed that he was waiting in his flat at the address given by the Third Party to the defendant at the material time to receive the payment that was to be arranged by the defendant.

57     PW2 had testified that his dealings were with the Third Party as the director of the plaintiff company as far as the payment of US$58,850 was concerned[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54). Payment in cash was preferred over bank transfers due to difficulties with currency control[^55]. PW2 also disclosed that he was subsequently paid in August 2019 by the Third Party[^56].

58     The evidence of PW2, as per his AEIC, remained intact despite Mr Lim’s rigorous cross-examination. There was nothing adduced by the defendant to show that PW2’s transaction with the plaintiff for which he was to be paid US$58,850 was in any manner tainted with illegality such that the “loss should lie where it falls” even if that principle were applicable to the facts of the case.

##### Plaintiff has proven its claim

59     From the foregoing analysis, it is my finding that the defendant has failed to raise any valid defences to the plaintiff’s claim in unjust enrichment.

60     As the defendant had admitted receiving the monies paid from the plaintiff’s account which was for the purpose of payment to DW2 in Moscow and the defendant having failed, refused and/or neglected to carry out the purpose, has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff. In the premises, the plaintiff has proven its entitlement to restitution of the sum of S$79,269.94 paid to the defendant.

### Whether the Third Party and/or the plaintiff are liable to the defendant in the sum of S$56,500 being the balance outstanding of loans given by the defendant to the Third Party

#### Defendant’s case

61     According to the defendant, the loan given by him to the Third Party had come about in the following manner:

> (a)     The Third Party had accompanied the defendant to the Bentley car dealership to act as a translator when the defendant wanted to buy a luxury car for his wife. The defendant had paid cash of over S$550,000 for the car.

> (b)     Seeing that the defendant had money to spare, the Third Party then asked for a loan from the defendant.

> (c)     In May 2013, the Third Party had borrowed US$100,000 from the defendant which he returned in full on 30 May 2013.

> (d)     On or around 22 to 24 June 2013, the Third Party had borrowed US$155,000 (equivalent to S$195,700) in total from the defendant. Of this sum, the defendant had transferred US$79,000 to the Third Party’s bank account, and the balance was paid in cash.

62     Over the years, the Third Party had made repayments of the loan to the defendant by paying for the defendant’s purchases and expenses for items such as air tickets, hotel accommodation, and online shopping by the defendant and his family using credit cards issued in his name as well as that of the plaintiff.

63     The defendant had compiled the list of repayments made by the Third Party over the years using an Excel document. Then on 21 April 2018, the defendant had a meeting with the Third Party in his car during which they discussed the Third Party’s debt to him. The defendant had prepared a handwritten document which the Third Party had signed acknowledging that he had an outstanding debt at a compromised amount of S$70,000 which was to be repaid as follows:

> (i)     S$5000 on 23 April 2018, and

> (ii)     S$4000 per month thereafter.

64     The Third Party did not keep to the agreed repayment schedule. As at the date of the filing of his counterclaim, the amount due and owing to the defendant stood at S$56,500.

#### Plaintiff’s and Third Party’s case

65     The Third Party flatly denied borrowing any money from the defendant. There was no reason for the defendant, then an employee of Russian Singapore Pte Ltd, to make any loans to the Third Party or to the plaintiff, as the Third Party was in fact paying the defendant a good salary. He also had a good credit rating to borrow money from the banks if he needed.

66     The Third Party denied that the payments made by him for the defendant’s expenses were part-payments towards discharging his debt. They were for business expenses and transactions and had nothing to do with any loans. As for the handwritten document which the defendant had produced as evidence of a purported admission of the debt, the Third Party denied that he had signed it.

67     In his closing submissions, Mr Bala submitted that the defendant’s case on having given a loan to the Third Party is unbelievable and not supported by the evidence. In particular, the following points were canvassed[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57):

> (a)     the total absence of written documentation to evidence the existence of an alleged loan;

> (b)     the defendant’s account of how the alleged loan amount was disbursed to the Third Party (in huge amounts of cash) was unbelievable; and

> (c)     the defendant’s conduct was totally inconsistent with him having extended a loan to Mr Cano.

#### My decision

68     Given the diametrically opposed positions of the parties as to whether the Third Party had taken any loans from the defendant, the principles laid down by the High Court in _ARS v ART_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span> (“_ARS_”) at \[53\] for determining the existence of an oral agreement provide helpful guidance:

> (a)     in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time;

> (b)     where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence;

> (c)     the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists;

> (d)     oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’s recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);

> (e)     credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence;

> (f)     where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words; and

> (g)     if there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will nevertheless examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement concluded between the parties.

69     In addition to the defendant’s testimony as outlined at \[61\] to \[63\] above, Mr Lim submits that the following supports the existence of a loan given to the Third Party:

> (a)     documentary evidence in the form of email communications between the Third Party and the defendant, debit advice from banks, repayments through credit card, and a signed agreement;

> (b)     the Third Party’s own admission under cross-examination of the existence of a “loan” and “repayments”; and

> (c)     conduct of the Third Party and the defendant as shown in the WhatsApp exchanges between them for the use of the Third Party/plaintiff’s credit cards, which appears consistent with a debtor-creditor relationship.

##### Documentary evidence

70     The defendant had pointed to the following documents:

> (a)     A debit advice dated 30 May 2013 issued to the Third Party stating that his United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) account was debited with US$100,000. This was the Third Party’s repayment of US$100,000 to the defendant[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58).

> (b)     An email from the Third Party to the defendant dated 22 June 2013[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) with the subject “135,000” and “Bank account to send money USD” which gave the Third Party’s name, address and bank account number as the beneficiary.

> (c)     A debit advice dated 24 June 2013 issued by Bank Julius Baer which showed that US$79,000 had been transferred from the defendant’s account to the Third Party’s UOB account[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60).

> (d)     Extracts of WhatsApp chats in 2017, 2018 and 2019 showing that the credit cards in the name of the Third Party and the plaintiff had been used by the defendant to make various purchases.

> (e)     Excel sheets prepared by the defendant and sent as email attachments to the Third Party setting out the list of “repayments”.

> (f)     Handwritten document which the Third Party had signed on 21 April 2018 acknowledging that he had an outstanding debt of S$70,000.

71     The Third Party readily admitted that payments had been made into his bank account as evidenced by the debit advice issued by the bank in May and June 2013. However, the sums that went into his account were not loans given by the defendant. He explained during cross-examination that at the time, the defendant was employed with Russian Singapore Pte Ltd as its Chief Investment Officer. They were working with a number of Russian businessmen who had expressed interest in setting up companies or purchasing properties in Singapore. The monies were received from these prospective investors as deposits for the intended property purchases and other business investments. The payments were made into his account instead of the company account as the company could not issue invoices for these deposits. When the deals did not materialise, the monies were then returned to the investors. See excerpt below[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61):

> Q    So, this is an email from you to the Defendant, Mr. Tymoshchuk. The subject header is 135,000. It’s dated the 22nd of June 2013. And you are asking the Defendant to send money to your bank account with UOB. Correct?

> A    That’s correct.

> Q    So, clearly isn’t this an evidence of you borrowing money from the Defendant?

> A    Absolutely not. Of course, not an evidence. At this time, at this material time, he was my chief investment officer. We were working on various investment deals. At that time, we have among the other transactions we did, we had, uh, interested investor parties in Russia to purchase, uh, real estate in Singapore. So, he would collect money from the investor in Russia and remit this money to my personal account with the reasons that this money was not invoiced under company. This was a deposit from the investor to look for the real estate deal in Singapore. So, my company would not be able to invoice for it because this was deposit due to the client that was u---supposed to be used for the either purchase real estate property in Singapore or setting up a Singapore company to be paid into this company as a initial share capital belonging to the actual investor. So, because he had my full trust, I would authorise him to collect such payments in Russia from the investor and remit it to my account in Singapore for the purposes of their continual on the deal which whether be a deal of setting up a company or purchase a real estate in Singapore.

72     The Third Party explained that as the chief investment officer, it was the defendant’s job to look for investments, find prospective investors and if they were persuaded to invest in Singapore, collect the deposits and deliver to him. If the clients had agreed to proceed with setting up of a company in Singapore, or to purchase property, the deposits would be utilised to make the necessary payments. That was why the sum of US$100,000 had been debited from his account and paid to the defendant in May 2013 after three weeks. The deal had fallen through and the defendant as chief investment officer was receiving the money to return to the client. There was no logical reason for the Third Party to have personally borrowed the money from the defendant who was then his chief investment officer only to return it after three weeks[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62). If indeed the US$100,000 sent by the defendant in May 2013 to the Third Party’s account was a personal loan as claimed by the defendant, the remittance advice could have indicated this fact but did not.

73     Having seen and heard the Third Party in court, I can find no reason to disbelieve his account pertaining to the transfers. The explanation given on the defendant’s role as chief investment officer and their collaboration to bring in the investments was a reasonable and credible explanation. It was also consistent with the defendant’s own explanation that he had joined the Third Party’s company because he wanted to do business together with him[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63). Hence, the defendant had regarded the Third Party only “nominally” as a boss. It is a reasonable and logical inference that the two men had agreed on this modus for their business which had appeared to work well for several years.

74     The Third Party had trusted the defendant and regarded him as a close friend. He had personally assisted the defendant with the latter’s application for permanent residence[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64). They would wine and dine together and meet with their families[^65].

75     The Third Party’s testimony that the two men enjoyed a close relationship is evident from the content of their WhatsApp exchanges and the liberal use of the Third Party’s credit card accounts for the purchases made by the defendant of air tickets and hotel stays, and even for online purchases by defendant’s family members on Lazada[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66). They had a mutual agreement for the defendant to use the Third Party’s credit cards for his expenses in Singapore while the defendant would cover the Third Party’s cash payments in Moscow. That arrangement had continued even after the defendant left Russian Singapore Pte Ltd as the parties continued to work together on various investment projects. The Third Party had also assisted the defendant in setting up his company, Stigma Pte Ltd, in Singapore[^67].

76     The defendant would keep records of all their transactions and the amounts spent on the credit cards and update the Third Party on a regular basis. Hence, the Third Party did not dispute any of the Excel attachments which the defendant had sent to him by email[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68). None of these Excel records prepared by the defendant had any reference to a loan.

77     It is also significant that in all of the WhatsApp messages exchanged between the parties exhibited by the defendant, there is no reference to any loan of US$155,000 that was given by the defendant to the Third Party[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69), or any loan for that matter.

78     The only two sets of documents which has any reference to a loan or debt are (1) a list of payments similar to the Excel document in the Agreed Bundle to which the defendant had added further columns stating “Amount of debt” and purportedly the amount of interest due (“Amount of %”) with the heading “Alex Cano’s loan repayment interest rate 15.00%”[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70); and (2) a handwritten agreement purportedly signed by the Third Party on 21 April 2018 acknowledging a debt of S$70,000 and proposing repayments of S$5000 on 23 April 2018 and S$4000 per month thereafter.

79     As for the document (DB6A), the defendant had only sent it to the Third Party on 8 July 2019, after he had received the monies which he had promised to deliver to Sergei but had instead decided to keep for himself. The format of this document differs vastly from the Excel attachments that the defendant had previously sent to the Third Party (AB21 to AB36). It appears to be a self-serving document. The date and the circumstances under which it was sent to the Third Party supports an inference that the document had been created solely to support the defendant’s alleged claim for a loan.

80     On the purported handwritten agreement[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) (Exhibit D1), the Third Party has denied that he signed it[^72]. While the signature appears to be similar to that of the Third Party’s appearing on other documents, in the face of the Third Party’s strident denial, as the defendant has the burden of proving that the signature is that of the Third Party it would be incumbent on the defendant to procure forensic evidence of a handwriting expert to discharge his burden of proof. The direct evidence of the defendant that he had seen the Third Party sign the document does not assist the defendant’s case as there is no basis to prefer his version over that of the Third Party’s.

81     Looking at Exhibit D1, it is a clean A4 size sheet of paper with less than eight words written on it. It is questionable whether such a note could have been prepared by the defendant while sitting in the driver’s seat of his car[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73). The defendant had stated that he wrote out several proposals starting with the actual amount owed by the Third Party at the time. He was prepared to compromise, so the amount was reduced two or three times before they settled on the agreement in D1. The defendant’s explanation that he had torn up the rejected proposals was simply too convenient and self-serving. It was the same explanation that he had given as to the initial written document evidencing the loan – it had been destroyed. Notably, the defendant had described D1 as the “new receipt” which the Third Party had issued after they destroyed the old one[^74]. This appears to contradict the defendant’s testimony that he was the one who had written out the contents of their agreement in D1.

82     Without independent forensic evidence on the authenticity of the Third Party’s signature on D1, it is unsafe to place any reliance on it.

##### Third Party’s admission of the existence of a “loan” and “repayments” under cross-examination?

83     Mr Lim had pointed to the language used by the Third Party when he was cross-examined on his WhatsApp messages sent to the defendant which had used the word “_repayment_” in reply to the message from the defendant asking, “What do you need to do to fulfil your obligations to close the _loan_ in time?” It was submitted that the use of the word “_repayment_” was a clear admission of the existence of a loan since repayments do not make sense unless it is an acknowledgement that monies are owed.

84     Reading the entire exchange at the cross-examination of the Third Party, it does not support Mr Lim’s submission. It had been four days since the sum had been transferred to the defendant and he was extremely anxious as his counterparty, Sergei, had been waiting for the payment:

> Q [\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) … And then you respond, “We’ve agree with you about this. I am ready to sign, I know where the money will come from for the _repayment_.” And then you continue asking, “Can I write it myself?” This is clearly about the loan and the repayments by you, correct?

> A    Um, incorrect, uh, let me clarify. On the---the event that started all these, uh, transaction that end us here happen on the 4th of July where I transfer company, company has transferred from Mr. Tymoshchuk that---this amount of money. I was very stressed, because I was given impression by Mr. Tymoshchuk messages that the monies on the road in Moscow with the courier to be delivered at any moment and the only thing that prevents Mr. Tymoshchuk to give the instruction to courier is the absence of the address and number of the person where the money to be delivered. After the money was credited and Mr.Tymoshchuk has acknowledged that he received this money in his account he---communications with him became very difficult and you can see there’s a number of messages and unanswered calls from me asking- trying to reach Mr.Tymoshchuk and asking him for \[inaudible\] clarification for the status of transaction. He did not---he replied very few times, at one time he proposed the meeting, but at that time I was in the concert where my daughter was performing and I was not able to, uh, leave the concert and have a meeting with him. I knew by this time 4 days after, because I did not expect such a long delay, so by the 8th of July, I---I was---I pleaded with him repeatedly …

>> …

>> My understanding at that time 4 days after money was delivered to the Mr. Tymoshchuk that I still had a hope, I still had a hope, that he will honour his promise, and he will deliver the money. My understanding from him by his answers, is that he can still deliver the money as agreed, provided that some legal documents in terms of loan or whatever legal terms will drafted.

> Q    Mr. Cano, this is your own statement here in---by WhatsApp contemporaneous which happen at that time would agree with you about this. “I’m ready to sign, I know where the money will come from for the repayment.”

> …

> …

> A    His---in his messages and communications with me, he let me understand that we need to sign some legal documents. The documents at that point are not even ready. He called it a loan, I, uh---

> …

> .. at this time, I would agree to anything to fulfil my obligations with my counterparties in Moscow.

> Q    Mr. Cano, this is your own statement here in---by WhatsApp contemporaneous which happen at that time

> …

> A    I was not talking about--- a repayment by me.

>> … it’s directly related to 79,000, those were even mentioned it just one line above $58,850.

>> …

>> …

>> .. we’re talking about paperwork that would allow him to fulfil his, uh, delivery of, uh, the money in Moscow.

85     It is quite clear from the Third Party’s responses (as extracted above) that he was not referring to repayment of any loan by him in his message of 8 July 2019, but a repayment of the sum meant for Sergei which had been transferred to the defendant.

##### The ‘loan’ is not proven

86     Considering the defendant’s case that the loan had been given to the Third Party since June 2013, the lack of any references in any of the WhatsApp messages exhibited to any loan is telling. This glaring omission is indicative that the Third Party and the defendant never had a debtor-creditor relationship.

87     In the premises, I find that the defendant has not proven that there was any loan of S$197,500 given to the Third Party on or around 22 June 2013.

88     The defendant has also not proven that the sum of S$56,500 is the outstanding balance of the loan given the discrepancies between the defendant’s tabulation (in D6A) and the transactions pleaded in his counterclaim, as pointed out by Mr Bala in his submissions[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76). While the defendant had in cross-examination admitted to the “mistake”, no application has been made to amend any part of the pleadings[^77].

### Whether there was any agreement reached between the plaintiff and the defendant for a website development project; if so, what is the amount due to the defendant, if any

#### Concluded agreement for website development project

89     The defendant’s claim that there was a concluded agreement reached with the Third Party for the development of a website to be run or managed by the plaintiff rests on an email exchange in March 2019[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78). In response to the defendant’s email sent on 15 March 2019 which had set out in considerable detail the various functions and key features of the system, the Third Party had responded in Russian, “Great plan! Let’s realise it!”[^79].

90     A WhatsApp chat group was thereafter created in April 2019 to facilitate the project with representatives from the defendant’s company and also from the plaintiff. The Third Party himself had participated actively in the chat by sending almost 100 messages[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80).

91     On 29 July 2019, the key representative of the defendant, Evgenii Prikhodko (DW2), had sent a message asking for a date to confirm acceptance of the project. Instead, the Third Party had pretended not to know anything of the project or which entity he was dealing with.

92     The plaintiff/Third Party denies there was any agreement reached with the defendant for the creation of a website for the benefit of the plaintiff. There was no signed written agreement which would have been sensible given the broad scope of work and the large fee of S$105,000 charged by the defendant.

93     Mr Bala had also submitted that the circumstantial evidence does not support a finding that an agreement had been reached in March 2019 as alleged. This is because at that time, the defendant was of the belief that the Third Party was indebted to him for a substantial sum of more than S$50,000. Given this scenario, it was improbable that the defendant would have agreed to provide paid services to the Third Party and/or the plaintiff.

94     Further, even if an agreement had been reached for the creation of website for the plaintiff’s benefit, the defendant had no _locus standi_ to sue on it. The persons who had given direct evidence of the work done and the manhours expended had testified (DW2 and DW3) were employees of Stigma Pte Ltd. As such, the proper party to make a claim for the work done under the alleged agreement ought to be Stigma Pte Ltd and not the defendant.

95     It is trite that no formal written agreement is necessary to establish a binding contract between parties. Based on the contemporaneous email exchange between the defendant and the Third Party, there was clearly an acceptance by the Third Party when he responded to the defendant’s proposal with a positive resounding reply “Great plan! Let’s realise it!”. The question is whether it was merely an acceptance of a proposal to explore and negotiate further or whether a concluded contract had been reached.

96     On an examination of the content of the WhatsApp chat messages from AB98 to AB139, I find that there is a concluded agreement for the defendant to “design and create a web-service for the provision of visa processing services in Singapore using the loyalty system using cryptocurrency”. In particular, the active participation by the Third Party in the chat contradicts his denial of a concluded contract, as can be seen from the following[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81):

> (a)     The Third Party had joined the chat group from its inception on 11 April 2019[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82). He had commented on the design and made suggestions on the template used. This had continued all the way to 16 April 2019. When informed by the defendant’s representative that the changes had been carried out, he had replied, “Ok”.

> (b)     On 26 April 2019, the defendant’s representative had set out in detail the features of the service which had been completed and was available at a temporary website address. He had also stated that they were “at the finish line” and asked for comments on various matters[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83). The Third Party’s response sent on the same day at 13:57:58 was “Got it.”[^84]

> (c)     On 7 and 8 May 2019, the defendant’s representative had requested for some documents. The Third Party responded stating that he would add his IT guys to the group, and requested for administrative rights for the group chat. Two representatives from the plaintiff were added to the group chat on 9 May 2019. The Third Party had introduced the group to them as “the guys with whom we are creating a new visa application system in which each client will have a crypto wallet”, and that they “need help (to) integrate our PDF Form Filling System”.

> (d)     On 23 May 2019, the defendant’s representative informed that most of the work had been completed and requested for feedback while they did the final testing.

> (e)     On 24 May 2019, the Third Party replied to say that he had taken a look and would provide his comments.

> (f)     On 3 June 2019, the Third Party responded to say that he had taken an initial look at the website at visa.sitisit.ru and that it looked “nice, clean, ordered and pleasing to the eyes”. He however pointed out _inter alia_ that the site did not allow a language switch from Russian to English and _vice versa_. Various screenshots were attached to show the deficiencies and suggestions were made. The defendant’s representative replied that they would start fixing the errors.

> (g)     On 5 June 2019, the defendant’s representative informed that they had launched the English version of the site, to which the Third Party replied to say, “Great.”

> (h)     On 8 June 2019 at 13:45:10, the defendant’s representative wrote to say that they had not received any comments or feedback on the project. He proposed to consider the project completed and launch it in its current state, with bugs and minor errors to be promptly fixed during the 30-day warranty period. At 13:50:08, the Third Party replied to say “Good”. The defendant’s representative then followed up to request for the domain, hosting and actual contact details for the site.

> (i)     On 9 June 2019, the plaintiff’s representative stated that the English version of the site had areas that needed to be revised and attached numerous screenshots.

> (j)     There was further communication on other features of the website between the plaintiff’s representatives and the defendant’s representative from 10 June 2019 to 2 July 2019.

> (k)     On 4 July 2019, the Third Party added his representative, Dmitry, to the group.

> (l)     On 5 July 2019, Dmitry responded to say that he had checked and “found nothing serious”.

> (m)     On 9 July 2019, one of the plaintiff’s representatives, one John, had indicated that the Singapore address should be at 8 Cross Street #28-65, Manulife Tower, Singapore 048424. This is the plaintiff’s registered address as seen in the ACRA records[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85).

> (n)     Subsequently, and up to 21 July 2019 further feedback was given by one Anna as well as John, the plaintiff’s representatives.

> (o)     On 23 July 2019, the defendant’s representative asked for complete feedback and comments on the project as soon as possible. If there were no comments and feedback, he asked for confirmation of acceptance of the project and for payment for their work as soon as possible. Further fixes were asked for and made.

> (p)     On 26 and 27 July 2019, the defendant’s representative asked for further comments and for a date to be set for the final acceptance of the project. The Third Party responded stating “Let’s get in touch on Monday”. The Third Party did not respond to the chat on Monday 29 July 2019.

97     As outlined above, the Third Party had been in active communication with the defendant’s representatives in the group chat from the very start and had given his comments and directions on the project. He had also introduced the plaintiff’s employees to the group and they had participated to request for changes and fixes which presumably were to ensure that the website was suitable for the plaintiff’s use. Significantly, when payment was asked for on 23 July 2019, there was no response from the Third Party or any of the plaintiff’s representatives to query on the basis for the payment request.

98     The detail and scope of the communications in the WhatsApp group chat lead to an irresistible inference that the parties had a concluded agreement. They cannot be regarded as just casual discussions between the Third Party and the defendant on the possibility of starting a joint project as alleged by the plaintiff/Third Party[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86).

99     Accordingly, I find that there was an agreement reached between the plaintiff and the defendant for the website development project. While the work was done by the employees of Stigma Pte Ltd, the contract as evidenced by the offer from the defendant had been accepted by the Third Party by their respective email exchanges. As such, there is no impediment on the defendant’s standing to sue on the contract. In any case, the defendant’s alleged lack of _locus standi_ has not been pleaded in the Defence to Counterclaim.

#### Amount due to the defendant for work done

100    The defendant is not claiming for the contract price of S$105,000 as it is conceded that some aspects of the project were not completed.

101    It cannot be denied that there is an implied term that a reasonable sum is payable for work done. The Third Party had also agreed under cross-examination that considerable work had been done by both parties.

102    The defendant, however, has the onus of proving what is the value of the work done. He relies entirely on a document titled, “Diverse Non-Governmental Expert Organization 000 ‘Independent Expertise’ which has assessed the work done at a value of S$82,000.

103    As the document had been objected to by the plaintiff, its authenticity and contents have to be proven by the calling of the maker, purportedly one Ulfkhart Anna Pavlovna, described as the “head of the expert organisation”. Without the testimony of the maker, the document is inadmissible. See Jet Holding Ltd & Ors v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd & Anor <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 417</span> at \[146\] to \[149\].

104    Without the expert assessment as to the value of the work done, the defendant has not proven his entitlement to S$82,000 in quantum meruit. As there was no application to bifurcate the proceedings, it is also not appropriate for the court to make any order for damages to be assessed. In the premises, the defendant’s counterclaim in respect of the website development project is dismissed.

### Whether the corporate veil of the plaintiff should be pierced such that the plaintiff and Third Party be jointly and severally liable to the defendant on his counterclaim and third party claim

105    As I have found against the defendant on both heads of his counterclaim, there is no necessity to consider the arguments made on joint and several liability of the plaintiff and/or the Third Party by piercing the corporate veil of the plaintiff.

106    I would, however, agree with Mr Bala’s submission that the evidence in the present case do not go to show the Third Party had incorporated or used the plaintiff to abuse and/or take advantage of the plaintiff’s separate legal personality. Further, the remedy of piercing the corporate veil is to have the shareholder rendered personally liable for the corporate entity’s obligations. The defendant here appears to be seeking a completely opposite remedy as far as the counterclaim is concerned, _viz_ to make the company liable for the personal debts of the Third Party.

### The defendant’s claim for contribution from the Third Party

107    The defendant has pleaded that in the event that he is found liable to the plaintiff on its claim, the Third Party is liable to contribute towards the same by reason of his breaches of fiduciary and statutory duties owed to the plaintiff. I have to agree with Mr Bala that the defendant has no _locus standi_ to make a claim for any alleged breaches of fiduciary and statutory duties to the plaintiff. It is a matter to be taken up by the plaintiff and its shareholders. The defendant’s claim for contribution from the Third Party is, with respect, misconceived.

108    In any case, no evidence has been led by the defendant that the transfer of the monies from the plaintiff’s account to the defendant amounts to a breach of his fiduciary or director’s duty on the part of the Third Party.

## Conclusion

109    In conclusion:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant in unjust enrichment for money had and received is allowed; and judgment is entered in its favour in the sum of S$79,269.94 together with interest and costs as claimed.

> (b)     The defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff and the Third Party is dismissed.

> (c)     The defendant’s third party claim against the Third Party is dismissed.

110    The court will hear submissions on costs on a date to be fixed.
