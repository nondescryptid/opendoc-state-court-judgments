### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The Accused claimed trial before me to 3 charges under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“the Penal Code”). He was accused of outraging the modesty of one V. V and the Accused were working together as fellow insurance agents with an insurance company (“the insurance company”).

2       At the end of the trial, I found that the three charges had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and I accordingly found the Accused guilty and convicted on all the charges.

3       I sentenced the Accused to the following sentences on the three charges:

> (a)     MAC 912279/2018: 11 months’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane;

> (b)     MAC 912280/2018: 1 month’s imprisonment; and

> (c)     MAC 912281/2018: 9 months’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane.

4       I ordered the imprisonment sentence of 11 months to run consecutively with the 1-month sentence, giving a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment of 3 strokes of the cane.

5       The Accused being dissatisfied with the outcome had filed a notice of appeal against both conviction and sentence. I now set out the grounds of my decision in respect of the three convicted charges.

### The charges

6       The three charges are in respect of three incidents which took place in relation to the same person V, on the same day, 1 June 2018. The details of the alleged acts of molest, as contained in the three charges, are as follows:

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

7       The Prosecution’s case for the first and third charges rests mainly on the confession of the Accused to the police (exhibit P8). As for the second charge which took place in a lift, the Prosecution relied mainly on the CCTV evidence recorded by the lift cameras. The Prosecution also adduced evidence of V as well as a few other witnesses whom V confided in after the incidents.

## THE DEFENCE

8       The Defence does not dispute the physical acts set out in the charges, save that for the second charge where the Defence asserted that there is reasonable doubt as to whether there was actual contact to result in a kiss on V’s cheek. In any case, for all the 3 charges, the Defence’s case was that there was consent on the part of V to all the acts of intimacy carried out by the Accused. The Defence asserted that there was an on-going intimate relationship between the parties.

9       Therefore the main issue will be whether the acts committed by the Accused were done with the consent of V.

## THE PRIOR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACCUSED AND V

10     One of the issues in contention prior to the incidents on 1 June 2018 is the state of the relationship between the Accused and V from the time they got to know each other all the way to the fateful day of 1 June 2018.

### The background relationship

11     The Accused started working in the insurance company earlier than V. He joined the insurance company as a financial adviser in November 2016. He came to know V as a colleague when she joined the insurance company as financial services consultant in October 2017. At the time the Accused was 26 years old and was married with one child. V was 21 years old then and was still studying in Singapore Management University. V was thus studying and working as an insurance agent at the same time.

12     They came to know each other as they were in the same team and would meet each other at their monthly district meetings. They had also gone for a team retreat together in December 2017 where they had sailed on a yacht.

13     As an insurance agent, V had to learn how to get customers through various activities such as ‘canvassing sessions’ as well as ‘door-knocking’ sessions. ‘Canvassing’ was explained by V to mean something like a road show conducted at a public location such as the outside of a MacDonald’s outlet whereby the insurance agents will try to get to talk to members of the public about insurance in the hope of securing new customers. ‘Door-knocking’ is a term used to describe the process of going from door to door in a HDB estate in order to get an opportunity to talk to potential customers. Typically, such sessions would be done by a pair of insurance agents. V testified that she has heard from her other colleagues that the Accused was quite effective at getting customers through such door-knocking and has in fact help other colleagues to secure some customers through that. She was thus encouraged by her team managers to go door-knocking with the Accused.

### The Relationship between V and the Accused leading to 1 June 2018

14     V’s WhatsApp message exchanges with the Accused were retrieved from her handphone and tendered as evidence to show the communication between them. In the first message between them dated 19 October 2017, V had texted the Accused saying “Hi, Kia Dong, \[V\] here. We are trying to arrange a canvassing session on Saturday. Would you like to join?”

15     It is not disputed that thereafter, for the months of December 2017 to February 2018, the Accused and V had gone together for door-knocking sessions at a frequency of once a week[^1]. V confirmed that the Accused was indeed good at door-knocking, helping her to successfully close a customer at their first session together.

### V’s version of the physical relationship

16     However, their relationship was more than just mere colleagues. V admitted in court that there was one occasion in February 2017 that she had sexual intercourse with the Accused in a toilet located at Tampines Hub. Although she said that was the only occasion she could remember, when shown her previous statement to the police, she accepted that she did inform the police that there was another occasion of sexual intercourse with the Accused in a car, although she could not remember anything about this incident at the time of her testimony in court. She also testified that during a door-knocking session in February 2018 before the sexual intercourse incident, the Accused had suddenly hugged her from behind while walking down the stairs in a HDB flat. She did not express any unhappiness to the Accused about being hugged as she had thought it could be that he was feeling a bit down.

17     Nonetheless, V testified that she was uncomfortable with any physical intimacy with the Accused. She said she had no such feelings for him and she had only given in to having sexual intercourse with him as a result of him pestering her repeatedly. She was aware that the Accused was married with a child. She regretted the acts of physical intimacy with the Accused.

18     In order to prevent future acts of physical intimacy, V decided not to go door-knocking with the Accused. Whilst the Accused continued to invite her to go door-knocking with him in March and April 2018, V repeatedly turned him down. WhatsApp messages were highlighted showing that the Accused had asked V to go door-knocking on at 5 occasions from March to April 2018 but each time V had said no. The 5 dates are 1 March[^2], 8 March[^3], 12 March[^4], 29 March[^5] and 29 April 2018[^6].

19     V then informed that the Accused continued to ask her for door-knocking session whenever they met in the office. One day after an office meeting, the Accused had again asked her to go door-knocking with him. V told the Accused that if he promised not to do whatever he did before to her, she would be able to go door-knocking with him and he agreed.

20     Hence on 19 May 2018, V had messaged the Accused to ask if he would be free to door-knock the following week[^7]. V then resumed door knocking with the Accused on 23 May 2018. Nothing eventful happened during that session and the Accused did not attempt to be physically intimate with her.

21     During this time with the Accused on 23 May 2018, V also talked a lot about one K with the Accused. K is a male colleague who joined the insurance company at the same time as V. Sometime in March 2018, V had become closer in relationship with K and they were at a stage of dating but were not in a serious relationship yet at that point in time on 23 May 2018. They officially became a couple in July 2018. She had intentionally talked to the Accused about K so as to give the Accused the impression that she was close and “sort of dating” K at that point in time. This was to let the Accused know that she was already close to someone else and she did not want what had happened between them to happen again.

22     As nothing physically happened between them on 23 May 2018, V thought that the Accused had turned over a new leaf and agreed to go for another door-knocking session with the Accused. She had accordingly arranged to meet again on 1 June 2018 at about 6.00pm to continue with the door-knocking session from where they had stopped on 23 May 2018.

### The Accused’s version on the state of relationship leading to 1 June 2018

23     The Accused denied that he had pressurised V into having sexual intercourse with him. It was put to V that they had an ongoing consensual physical and sexual relationship right up to 1 June 2018[^8].

24     He claimed that he and V had first started physical intimacy in January 2018 with cuddling at the Marina Bay Financial Centre Starbucks. Subsequently, he had engaged in hugging and cuddling at the void deck of a client’s flat. This then progressed to mutual hugging, cuddling and kissing during a door-knocking session sometime from mid-January to end-January 2018. By this time, the Accused asserted that they have progressed to a romantic relationship.

25     The next physically intimate moment took place on 4 February 2018. The Accused claimed that after a door-knocking session at Compassvale Link, they had gone to the Sky Garden and sat on a stone chair. The Accused confirmed that this was the same location as the alleged incident on 1 June 2018.

26     Thereat, the Accused had engaged in what the Defence Counsel has described as ‘making out’ with V – kissing her on her neck, ear and cheek, fondling her breast underneath her shirt and rubbing her vaginal area over her panty. V was seated on his lap with her back facing him during this intimate session.

27     The Accused then recollected 3 instances of sexual intercourse with V in February. The first and second times, both occurred in the Family room toilet in Tampines Hub on the 5th and 12th of February 2018. The third time was in his vehicle in a multi-storey carpark on 19th February 2018. He claimed that he did not pressurise V and all the acts were consensual.

28     He further claimed that there were further acts of physical intimacy such after 19 February 2018 such as hugging and “making out” on 20th and 22nd February 2018. He alluded to a final act of intimacy when he went door-knocking with V on 15 March 2018. He admitted that there was no text message with V on this alleged door knocking on 15 March 2018[^9].

29     He then informed that the next door-knocking session after 15 March 2018 was on 23 May 2018 but nothing physically intimate had happened between them on that day[^10].

30     The Accused asserted that at no time did V ever tell him or extract a promise from him not to do what he did before to her or to have any sexual or physical intimacy with her.

## THE 3 INCIDENTS OF ALLEGED MOLEST ON 1 JUNE 2018

31     It is not disputed that V and the Accused met up on 1 June 2018 to door-knock at Block 277D, Compassvale Link. They met up at around 6.30pm. V took the MRT there whilst the Accused drove. After they met up, they went door-knocking at the HDB flat as planned.

32     After they finished door-knocking, V went to buy a waffle as she had not had dinner yet and she had another appointment that night. After she had bought the waffle, the Accused wanted to sit on the ledge next to the playground. However V did not want to sit there. Thereafter on the Accused’s suggestion, they went up to the Sky Garden at level 3 of Block 275D.

33     What transpired at the Sky Garden and the events that followed are the subject of the three charges. It is not disputed by the Accused that he had committed the alleged acts of intimacy on V as set out in the three charges at three locations: (i) the Sky Garden; (ii) inside the lift when the Accused and V came down together from the Sky Garden to the carpark at the basement level; and (iii) in the Accused’s car before the Accused drove V to her next appointment. I will now turn to the statement of the Accused P8 as the case with regard to what had transpired at the Sky Garden and in the Accused’s car will turn crucially on the contents of P8.

### The First Charge – The incident at the Sky Garden

#### The contents of P8 on the Sky Garden incident

34     The Defence did not dispute that the statement P8 was made voluntarily by the Accused without any threat, inducement or promise and thus did not object to the admission of the statement. It is settled law that a conviction may be grounded solely on an accused person’s confession, even if that statement is subsequently retracted, so long as the court is satisfied that the confession was voluntary, true and reliable: _Lim Thian Lai v Public Prosecutor_ \[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 3192 at \[43\]. The Defence only argued that the statement had not been accurately recorded.

35     I found that P8 clearly carried an unequivocal admission on the part of the Accused that he had on 1 June 2018 carried out all acts of physical intimacy on V without her consent. He gave this statement shortly after the incident, on 6 June 2018. The events of that day would have been fresh on his mind. I noted also that P8 is a typewritten statement but contained handwritten amendments by the Accused at various parts of the statement indicating that the Accused did have a chance to go through his statement and was given an opportunity to amend, delete or add to it and he did exercise this opportunity. The statement recording took place in the afternoon and was not unduly long, lasting 1 hour and 25 minutes from 3.10pm to 4.35pm.

36     I now set out extensively the relevant parts of P8. P8 started off from paragraphs 2-4 with details of the Accused’s relationship with V and how they had a secret affair which involved 3 incidents of sexual intercourse in February 2018, with 2 times in the Family Room at Tampines Hub and once in his car. The Accused also stated in P8 that during door to door sales, there were a few occasions in January and February 2018, where he had hugged V from behind and held her by her waist.

37     However, paragraph 5 then changed its tone with the opening line: “However, on 1st June 2018 **matter got a little ugly**.”

38     Paragraph 5 went on to provide details of how they had ended up at the Sky Garden that day. They had conducted door to door sales at Block 277D of Compassvale Link which ended at around 7.00pm as V wanted to buy a chocolate waffle. After purchasing the waffle, the Accused had suggested to V to sit by the playground at level 1. However when V did not seem keen to sit there, saying “Huh?, what? here?”, the Accused suggested going to the Sky Garden and they eventually ended up at the Sky Garden at level 3, Block 275D of Compassvale Link.

39     Paragraph 6 then states the following:

> After she had her waffle I suddenly looked at her and had a strong sexual urge. I then hugged her from the back first and wrapped my hands around her body \[the Accused inserted in his own handwriting the following words at the end of this sentence: “and told her that I wanted to have sex with her”\]. I could hear \[V\] telling me 'No' but I ignored her call and continued my advances. Immediately, I then inserted my hand inside her shirt and underneath her bra and groped her breast but I can’t remember which breast was it. It was a skin to skin contact to her breast. \[V\] keep telling me to stop touching her but I ignored her and continued to touch her. I then smelled her hair and told her that she smell good and kiss her on her right cheek, neck and collarbone area. She again was telling me to stop but I ignored her. Throughout this ordeal I remember holding onto her tightly and telling her that I want to have sex with her and she told me 'No'. At this juncture, \[V\] then checked her phone and realized that it was already 8pm and she had to leave. She then stood up and walked away. The location that she has to go was nearby as such she went to my car and we sat in it.

40     The above paragraph made it very clear that V had said “No” to the Accused to his request for sex multiple times and the Accused had “ignored” her and “continued \[his\] advances”. The Accused also stated clearly that V had kept telling him “to stop touching her” when he inserted his hand underneath her bra to grope her breast but he “ignored her and continued to touch her”. This process of him touching her and V telling him to stop was described as an “ordeal”.

41     Reading this paragraph, it is an inescapable conclusion the Accused had admitted in his statement that V was not consenting at all to being touched intimately by the Accused and had continually told him “No” and to stop what he was doing. The word “ordeal” which meant a very unpleasant, painful or trying experience further made it clear that V was clearly not consenting to these very sexually intrusive acts being committed on the sensitive parts of her body.

### The Third Charge – The incident in the car

#### The contents of P8 on the car incident

42     Paragraphs 7 and 8 then set out the details of what had happened inside the Accused’s car after they had gone into it from the Sky Garden:

> \[7\] When we were in the car \[“in the front seat” – inserted by the Accused in his handwriting\] we moved to the backseat as I wanted to continue my intimacy with her. When we were at the backseat she told me that had to leave and she only have till 8. 15pm. I then moved closer to her and continued to kiss her cheek, neck and collarbone and I remember this time round again I did insert my hand into her shirt and underneath her bra and groped her breast (skin to skin). I then again told her that I want to have sex with her and she told me 'No'. She then added that if I am horny I can just masturbate myself. I found it weird to masturbate myself in my car \[“I did not comply with her request” – inserted by the Accused in his handwriting\].

> \[8\] At this juncture, her mobile phone rang and it was one of our colleague namely \[K\] who had called her. I then stop touching her and drove her to her destination. After dropping her, I drove to my own appointment nearby the vicinity. On the same night I did text \[V\] if her appointment has ended but there was no reply from her. I remember sending her few text message that same night but she did not reply to any of my messages.

43     Reading the above 2 paragraphs on their own, other than V saying “No” to his request for sex, there does not appear to be any words or actions on the part of V that she was not consenting to his physical acts of intimacy in the car. Further the act of moving from the front seat to the back seat can be viewed as an indication that V was agreeable to him continuing with his acts of intimacy.

44     However, in the succeeding paragraph under the Q and A section, it was made clear that the acts in the car were also without V’s consent. The series of Q and A are as follows:

> Q3)    Were all the intimacy you had with \[V\] consented or not consented by her?

> A3)    Everything was consented except for the incident on 1st June 2018 which was not consented at all.

> Q4)    Did you had sex with her on 1st June 2018?

> A4)    No

> Q5)    Do you know that if a female subject does not give you any consent to any sexual physical intimacy you have committed an offence?

> A5)    Yes I am aware. It is considered that I have molested her.

> Q6)    If you know that by her not consenting is an offence why did you still continued to do so?

> A6)    It is because I had a strong sexual urge and could no longer control myself.

> Q7)    Did you use force or restraint when you molested her on 1st June 2018?

> A7)    Yes I did (the following words “when she asked me stop and I did not that was when I used force to hold her tightly and restraint her from moving till her mobile phone rang” was manually cancelled by the Accused and in place he wrote the following words: “**I also wish to state that she said “No” 5-10 times from the start of the incident at Sky Garden to end of the incident in backseat of my car**”.) (my emphasis)

> …..

> Q9)    Do you have anything else you want to add to your statement?

> A9)    I am really sorry for what I have done. It was really in a moment of impulse. I promise to change over a new leaf and will never ever do such a thing ever again. I really hope that the authority will give me a chance.

45     The answers given by the Accused to the direct questions by the recorder of the statement Senior Investigating Officer of the case, Rakbir Singh, PW1 (“IO Rakbir”), made it very clear that the Accused was admitting that all the acts committed on 1 June 2018 were non-consensual. This would mean that all the physical acts of intimacy by the Accused committed on V in his car were without V’s consent. Any doubt that his admission of non-consensual acts extended to the events in his car would be removed by his handwritten answer at A7 where he had explicitly stated that V had said “No” 5-10 times from the beginning of the incident at Sky Garden all the way to the end of the incident in the backseat of his car.

46     A7 was stated in the context of his earlier answers to Q5 and Q6 whereby he had stated that he understood that he would be committing an offence of molest if the female subject has not given consent to his acts of physical intimacy and that he had done so because of a strong sexual urge and he could not control himself. There is clearly no misunderstanding as to the purport of his answers. The Accused was clearly admitting that all the acts of intimacy committed by him on V at the Sky Garden and at the backseat of his car were without V’s consent.

47     It is only in the context of this admission of guilt that the last paragraph of P8 made sense where he apologised, stating that what he did was done in a moment of impulse. He then promised that he would never do such a thing again and pleaded for a chance to be given to him by the authority. He was clearly expressing his remorse for the wrong committed on V.

### The weight to be given to the statement in respect of the First and Third Charges

48     In the light of the clear and unequivocal admission in P8, full weight should be given to it unless the Accused was able to show that it was unsafe to do so due to its inaccuracy. In Court, the Accused claimed that he had informed IO Rakbir that the acts of physical intimacy were consensual. In the light of his insistence that the physical acts of intimacy were carried out with the consent of V, the Accused had to explain why he had given a statement to the contrary.

#### Argument that certain words or lines did not come from the Accused

49     He tried firstly to cast doubt on the statement by stating that he did not use certain words or that certain lines did not come from him, particularly those which were incriminating. Hence, he asserted that IO Rakbir did not ask him Q 3 and he did not provide the answer in A3 that “everything was consented except for the incident on 1st June 2018, which was not consented at all”.

50     He further claimed that IO Rakbir did not ask him Questions 5-7 and he did not give the answers to these questions. He also claimed that he did not give the answers given at A9 about saying sorry and asking for a chance to be given to him. He further claimed that IO Rakbir had explained A9 was just to show that he was being cooperative.

51     I found the Accused’s evidence on not giving the incriminating parts of the statement to IO Rakbir unbelievable.

52     Firstly, I found that IO Rakbir had no reason to frame the Accused by falsely typing out incriminating words not used by the Accused. Secondly and crucially, it is not disputed that after the statement had been typed out, the Accused was given every opportunity to read through and amend the statement as he deemed fit. The Accused had exercised this opportunity given by penning in his own hand amendments to the statement. The amendments were inserted into paragraphs 3, 5, 6, 7 and Answer 7 at paragraph 9.

53     I note that the amendments were substantial, comprising more than a few sentences in some instances. Of particular interest is his amendment to A7. He had been asked in Q7: “Did you use force or restraint when you molested her on 1st June 2018?

54     His answer at A7 as typed was “Yes I did when she asked me stop and I did not that was when I used force to hold her tightly and restraint her from moving till her mobile phone rang.” The Accused then manually deleted the line after the words “Yes I did” and inserted the following new line in place of the deleted portion: “I also wish to state that she said “No” 5-10 times from the start of the incident at Sky Garden to end of the incident in backseat of my car”.

55     The act of leaving the words “Yes I did” intact whilst deleting the rest of the sentence showed clearly that the Accused had applied his mind to what he was reading. He had consciously responded to the question of whether he had used force on restraint on V with his answer of “Yes I did”. It is unbelievable that he could have failed to understand the significance of his affirmative answer to a simple and direct question. He could easily have deleted these words and answered “No”. Instead he went on to add that V had said No to him 5-10 times from the beginning of the incident in Sky Garden all the way to the end at the backseat of his car, making it clear that he had not only restrained V but had done so despite her saying “No” to him multiple times.

56     The Accused then claimed that he had asked IO Rakbir what the meaning of “force or restraint” was and IO Rakbir had answered “Hugging”[^11]. I found it incredible that the Accused as a university graduate in Singapore would not understand the meaning of “force” or “restraint” and had to ask IO Rakbir for the meaning of these words. It is common knowledge that the main medium of instruction of a university degree in Singapore would be English. I also found it incredible that he would simply accept IO Rakbir’s explanation that it meant “hugging” which connotes something that is welcomed and affectionate as opposed to “force” and “restraint”. He would know “hugging” cannot be synonymous to use of force or restraint. The fact that he went on to add the line that V had said “no” thereafter to him multiple times clearly showed he knew that the action he was doing was something unwelcomed by V. It would be incompatible for him to add this line if he were to think that he was responding to a question of whether he was merely hugging V in a consensual manner.

57     Another attempt at distancing himself from the statement was the Accused’s evidence that he did not use the word “ordeal” in paragraph 6. When cross-examined by the DPP on whether he understood the word “ordeal” to mean something that was non-consensual, the Accused’s retort was that he was not a law student and he did not know the exact meaning of “ordeal”. He went on to say that he took the word to mean as “throughout this whole thing”.

58     I found it unbelievable that the Accused would not understand the word “ordeal” which is clearly not a difficult word. It was clearly not a legal jargon that only a law student would be able to comprehend. The fact that he left the word unchanged clearly showed that he knew that he was admitting that the acts being committed on V were not consented by her and hence what she was experiencing was an “ordeal”.

59     Reading P8 on the whole, it was clear that the narrative was one that the Accused and V had a consensual physical relationship during the earlier part but on 1 June 2018, this was not so, hence the narrative at paragraph 5 had used the phrase “However, on 1st June 2018, matter got a little ugly”. During cross-examination of IO Rakbir, he was merely asked by the Defence Counsel whether the Accused had used the words “got a little ugly”. IO Rakbir was asked this question a few times:

> Q:    Could you turn to page 2 of P8 at paragraph 5? Here, you have … it is stated, “However on 1st June 2018, matter got a little ugly”. Did the Accused say this?

> A:    Yes

> Q:    So these are his words, not yours?

> A:    Yes

> ….

> Q:    So, the description of “ugly” was something… it’s a word that the Accused had used and not yourself, correct?

> A:    Yes.[^12]

60     I found it telling that it was never put to IO Rakbir that the Accused did not use this phrase. The Accused when on the stand also did not assert that these were not his words. He was also did not deem it necessary to amend this phrase when he amended other parts of the statement.

61     In my view, this is a further indication that the Accused had clearly intended to give a narrative of an initial consensual physical relationship he had with V but which changed and ultimately resulted in a non-consensual sexual encounter he had with V on 1 June 2018 starting with the Sky Garden and ending off with what had happened in the backseat of his vehicle. This is further reinforced by Q3 and A3 in P8 where the Accused had categorically stated that all the acts of intimacy he had with V was consented by her “except for the incident on 1st June 2018 which was not consented at all”.

62     Finally, I found that the last answer A9 of paragraph 9 of the statement clearly could only have come from the Accused despite the Accused denying that he had given such an answer.

63     Firstly, I found that the nature of the last paragraph being one of remorse and seeking for leniency is consistent with the rest of the overall narrative of the statement which is an admission of his wrongdoing. It dovetailed squarely with the recognition of his wrongdoing and his promise never to repeat it.

64     Secondly, I found his explanation that he did not change it because IO Rakbir had said that this paragraph was to show the judge and the authorities that he had been “very cooperative”[^13] clearly unbelievable. As a university graduate in Singapore, he would surely comprehand that this paragraph was clearly an expression of his remorse of having done something wrong. He would have understood it as a plea for leniency and not merely to show that he had been “cooperative”. I had the benefit of observing him in court and his command of the English language and I found that he was clearly fluent and proficient in the language. If it is true that he had been under the impression that his entire statement had been one of denial of any wrongdoing, he would surely not have allowed this last answer to stand unamended.

#### Argument that when V said No multiple times, it was in reference to him asking her for sex

65     The Accused tried to explain that when he wrote that V had said “No” 5-10 times to him from the beginning to the end, it was in reference to him asking her to have sexual intercourse with him[^14].

66     Whilst it is true that the Accused did state earlier that in the statement that he told V that he wanted to have sex with her, it was only mentioned at 2 instances, once at paragraph 6 during the incident at the Sky Garden and another time at paragraph 7 during the incident in the backseat of his car. However, in this answer where he stated that V had said “No” 5-10 times, it was clearly more than just in response to his request for sex.

67     When asked by Defence Counsel, why he did not specifically mention that the 5-10 times of No by V were in response to his request for sex when he was handwriting this amendment, he replied lamely that

> “I think I was just --- I was just very tired and all that. I was very tired and ---I just ---- basically just did my best, uh, I --- could.”[^15]

68     The Accused had the presence of mind to delete a line and substitute these additional words on his own. If he really had in mind that V’s “No”s were in response only to his request for sex, he could have easily stated so. In any case, the Accused would have difficulty explaining why he would be overwhelmed by tiredness given that he had reported to IO Rakbir in the afternoon and the recording of the statement only took 1 hour and 25 minutes.

69     Furthermore, he had added this line in response to question Q7:

> Did you use force or restraint when you molested her on 1st June 2018?

70     The Accused’s answer was clearly in the context of him committing molest on V and therefore V’s “No”s would have been understood to be in response to his acts of physical intimacy such as his touching and kissing of V on the intimate parts of her body.

71     I therefore have no hesitation in rejecting this attempt at confining his answer only to his requests for sex.

#### The Accused’s explanation as to why he did not amend the incriminating parts of P8 when he read through it

72     The Accused, in essence, whilst he did not allege that P8 was involuntarily made, asserted that there were omissions and inaccuracies in the statement. He claimed that all the parts which amounted to him committing acts which were non-consensual were not said by him.

73     The first difficulty the Accused has in maintaining the above position is that this will beg the question as to why he did not amend those incriminating parts by deleting them and substituting them with his assertion that V had consented to all the acts on 1 June 2018. He had been given the opportunity to do so and he had made deletions and amendments to his statement but none of those amendments affected the narrative that he did commit outrage of modesty on V on that day.

74     This is such an obvious question that even his own Defence Counsel noted it and had asked him this question directly. The Accused gave a wholly unconvincing and meandering response to it. As he could not give a clear explanation, he was asked repeatedly during his examination by his own counsel and the Court. I will set out in full the number of times this question was asked to illustrate his shambolic response that was at times hard to even understand:

##### (1)   The first time, by the Defence Counsel

> Q:    So, is there an explanation as to why you did not amend those paragraphs or those mistakes or rectify them?

> A:     **Um, as---as I already mentioned, I---I---I really did my best and I really like amend as much as I could. Because I was like a lot---a lot of details I already shared with the IO saying like not included and all that. I already did my best to like add in as far as possible and like---yah. And coupled with like my---my state of mind back at that 1st June, uh, I was---yah. I was just really---I was just really very scared and intimidated, alright. To be---to be summoned to the police HQ.** [^16]

##### (2)   2nd time, by the Court

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. So, what---what---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

To answer 3 in which---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, what---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

which---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

are you trying to say?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

To which IO Singh typed everything was considered

 |
| 

\[inaudible\] but actually it was just consensual as well.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, you---so, you disagree with answer 3, is it?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Uh, I don’t---I disagree.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yah. So, you are saying that incident on 1st of June was consensual as well?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. You read that on that day itself?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Uh, I’m sorry?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

You read this answer 3 on that day?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Uh, I mean, I glanced through, lah.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I glanced through.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright. And you disagree---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Just---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

with answer 3 that day?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

**That day I just mo---like just glanced through. Because like as all I has already---I already shared like---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes. But glancing through, uh, means whether---so, what are you---what are you trying to say when you say you just glanced through? My question is did you read your answer 3 written here in this form and whether you agreed with this answer 3 being given as typed or being---being typed out that way by the IO?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

**I---I---I did read it and---but it’s like---basically I just---I---I---I---I just disagree ah. I---I.** [^17]

 |

  
  

##### (3)   3rd time, by the Court

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay? I want to ask you about the day itself.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

When you read through, right, and did you disagree with this form of answer given---as typed out here?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Just---I---I just---basically I just went through and---and---yah. Like---like what I’ve already mentioned, I uh---I was just---trying to just really just, uh, I kind of---I kind of rushed through and I kind of rush through and I just---I just signed off. I just rush through and I just signed off.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yah. But I---I---you have not answered my question. You understand what I’m saying?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Okay, okay.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, are you saying that you did not see this part or you saw it? Because when you say you rushed through---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I don’t understand what you mean. What is the effect of when you say you rushed through? I can read very fast and I can still see what is written and I can still make a decision whether I agree or disagree with it. You understand what I’m saying?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

**I---you---Your Honour, I---I---I just want to highlight, alright. I just want to highlight, alright. The truth is that, uh, on the---on the 1st June, right, I---I---I---I---I---like whenever I recall, right, like it’s like just---everything was just consensual, alright? Everything was just consensual and I---uh, I---I really don’t know---And I really don’t know---I really don’t know why, ah, she’s just suddenly want to just report the matter to police. I---I really don’t know. Okay. It was consensual.[^18]**

 |

  
  

##### (4)   4th time, by the Defence Counsel

> Q:    Okay. So, let’s just go back in time on the 6th of June, you remember going to the police station, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you remember that IO Singh had printed and given you this document, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, did you read from the start, from page 1?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And then you went through paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, yes?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And then page 3, you are at paragraph 7, 8, 9, yes?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And then you are reading the questions, correct? And the answer that has been typed out.

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, when you see that question, number 3, and then you read the answer, which has been stated there.

> A:    Yah.

> Q    You’ve already said that this was not the answer you gave so what is going through your mind when you are reading these words “everything was consented and except for the incident on 1st June 2018, which was not at all consented---which was not consented at all.” What is going through your mind, when you read this? In relation to what is being said, what is going through your mind?

> A:     **Maybe---maybe what was going through on my mind was---perhaps like oh, uh, that in---I’m just---I---I---I’m just thinking lah may---it might be like back on 6th June like---oh I’m the police station, I’m---I’m currently having an investigation---I’m being alleged for---I’m being accused for, uh, accused of outrage of mode---uh, like, you know, like because I was alleged and accused of an outrage of modest---of---of modesty, there---therefore it must be correct.** That kind of---the---the---the, you know.

> Court:    “Therefore it must be, correct?” What is---what is “must be correct?”

> Witness:     **Like---like whatever the---the---I---I---IO Singh actually typed out from me, lah. Like how he actually typed out the---the---whatever I narrated to him**.[^19]

##### (5)   5th time, by the Defence Counsel

> Q:    Okay. So, Mr. Chua, you would know what had happened on the 1st of June 2018, yes?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    You would know, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    So, now you are reading this paragraph---this sentence you are at the police station and you’re reading this sentence, “Everything was consented except for the incident of 1st June 2018, which was not consented at all.”

> A:    Uh-huh.

> Q:    So, you---you were there on---you were there at Compassvale Link on the 1st June 2018, yes?

> A:    Yes. Yes.

> Q:    So, if you read something like this, what are your thoughts at that---on that day about what is being stated here?

> A:     **I---I---I---I really cannot recall exactly, I---I---I really cannot recall like exactly like---.[^20]**

##### (6)   6th time, by the Defence Counsel

> Q:    Okay. So, before that can I just check did you read that line on the---on 6th June 2018, the question and the answer did you read those words?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    What---So, when the answer was given---is where the answer is stated as “Everything was consented except for the incident of 1st June 2018, which was not consented at all”, how---what was your understanding of it, did you form a view?

> A:    Um, (pause – 00:00:19) I---I---**I really don’t know like---I’m---I’m really not sure how to answer. For answer---thr---thr---answer 3.**

> Q:    Okay. So, did you think about whether it was true or not? Did the---did you think about that?

> DPP Joseph:    Your Honour, I think this question has been asked numerous times and as a simple question the witness has already given his answers at numerous times that---

> Court:    I will allow this last question.[^21]

##### (7)   7th time, by the Defence Counsel

> Q:    So, when you read questions 3 and answer 3, you see the sentence, “Everything was consented, except for the incidence, of 1st June 2018, which was not consented at all.”

> A:    Mmm.

> Q    Did you think through about whether or not this line here is true or not?

> A    It’s not.

> Q    Sir, I’m not asking you, whether today you are---what is your view on that sentence on that day,---

> A    Mmm.

> Q    do you think about whether or not this is true or not.

> A    I---**I really cannot recall---I really cannot recall like, it’s not like I read the questions then I like read---then I look at it very long that kind of thing. I---I really cannot recall. All I can say is I really just---I just briefly gran---glanced through and then, yah. I don’t recall reading the questions like word for word and then answer for answer, and then like down there, reading there for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, If---if---if you know I mean like, that’s all I can say (my emphasis)**.

> Court:    Alright. I think we have given enough chances to the accused to try to answer this question, okay?

> Anand:    Your Honour, I will---

> Court:    We move on.[^22]

75     The Accused was very hesitant and waffled through his answers despite having long pauses and the questions being repeated to him. He was not able to provide a coherent answer as to why he did not amend the incriminating answers if he was of the view that they were not the answers provided by him. On one hand he tried to give the impression that he had assumed that IO Rakbir had recorded correctly what he had told him and hence he did not really check through his answers and on the other hand he also appeared to be saying that he had noted that the answers stated in P8 were wrong. In any case, he was at a loss to explain why he did not correct his statement.

76     This pattern continued during his cross-examination by the DPP. After some hemming and hawing, the Accused admitted that an objective reader of paragraph 6 of P8 would reach a conclusion that he had molested V. However, he continued to be hesitant, unsure and confusing in his answers:

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

So, Mr. Chua, now, you have agreed that reading paragraph 6---it shows from paragraph 6 that you have molested \[V\], correct? You agree now?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I mean, based on objective reading---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes, just based---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

on reading the paragraph alone---paragraph 6.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, yes, I agree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And what I’m saying now is, it’s very clear from this that you did molest her. That is why in your EIC, you made various allegations against the IO that paragraph 6 was not recorded accurately from you. You agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Sorry, question again. Sorry, sorry.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes. Could you please break up your question? Because there’s---there are few things there in your question.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, paragraph 6 as it stands, clearly shows that you did molest \[V\], agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Agree, agree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And although you now seem reluctant to admit this in Court, I am putting to you that when you first read paragraph 6 on 6th of June 2018, you also understood this to mean that you had molested \[V\] based on paragraph 6. Agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And the reason why I say that is because now at trial, you are giving various reasons such as the IO inserting things that you did not say to try and explain away paragraph 6. Agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, all this shows that you---that any objective reader as well as yourself when you first read paragraph 6 on 6th of June 2018, understood paragraph 6 to mean that you were admitting to molesting \[V\] at the Sky Garden, agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Sorry, question again. Sorry, sorry.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Let’s just make this very clear, when you read paragraph 6 on 6th of June 2018, you understood paragraph 6 to mean that you were admitting to molesting \[V\] at the Sky Garden, agree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And the reason why I say your---you disagreeing now, is not believable is because now in Court, you are trying to give explanations as to why paragraph 6 was not said by you. You can agree or disagree and I’ll move on from here.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, by disagreeing, you are saying that when you read paragraph 6 on 6th of June, you did not read it as meaning that you had molested \[V\]. Is that what you are saying?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Sorry, can you repeat the last---the---the---the second part again?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, my question was very simple, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay, okay.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

My question was, on 6th of June when you read paragraph 6-

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

did you understand paragraph 6 to mean that you were admitting to molesting \[V\] at the Sky Garden?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No. I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, by disagreeing, you are saying when you read paragraph 6---when you read paragraph 6 on 6th of June---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

you did not think that this meant that you were admitting to molesting \[V\]?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, so when I---when I read through, I didn’t think it meant that way.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, just to be clear---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

your evidence now is that when you read paragraph 6 on 6th of June---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh-huh, yah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

you did not think that it meant that you were admitting to molesting \[V\]?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, correct.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, based on reading paragraph 6, you thought that all this was consensual?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When it says, “I could hear \[V\] telling me ‘no’ but I ignored her call and continued my advances”, you are saying---you thought that \[V\] had consented?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because prior to that, I got, uh, I was prompting her to have sex, that’s why she told me “no”.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No, it does not say---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah---Oh.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

that, correct? Your statement does not say that. Your statement says you hugged her from the back, wrapped your arms around her body, you could hear her telling you “no”, but you ignored her and continued your advances. You inserted your hand and groped her breast. \[V\] keep telling me to stop touching her but I ignored her and continued to touch her.”

 |
| 

A

 | 

So---uh, sorry, what’s the---so what’s the question again?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So---uh--- So, I give you one more chance to explain---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay, okay, okay.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Chua, when you read paragraph 6 on 6th of June, you knew that paragraph 6 was saying that you admit to molesting \[V\] at the Sky Garden. You agree or you disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, in essence, by disagreeing, you are saying by reading paragraph 6, your understanding is that \[V\] consented to all these acts?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Was consensual between myself and \[V\].

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

When you read---when you were reading paragraph 6---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

When reading---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

on that day itself.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

on that day.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, despite all these words about her saying “no” and you ignoring her, and continued to touch her, you are saying that this was still consensual on that day itself when you were reading it.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes. I take it as consensual.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But when I asked you this question earlier, reading as an objective reader, you agreed that reading this paragraph shows that it was not consensual and it was molest, correct? You agreed earlier.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I agreed earlier based on like how I---how---how I---like based on right now, I’m reading it, yah.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Right.

 |
| 

A

 | 

As an objective reader, lah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**So, why is it that when you were reading it on 6th of June, you drew a different conclusion and opposite conclusion, that it was consensual?**

 |
| 

**A**

 | 

**Because I---I narrated whatever I told the IO and---so, it’s just really based on what I narrated. I---I take it that the IO captured the essence of what I narrated.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No, Mr. Chua, the statement was printed for you to read over and to sign on the statement, whatever is typed is reflected in this statement and you read paragraph 6. So, why is it that when you read paragraph 6, you thought that it was consensual? This is the 3rd time I’m asking you.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I---I really can’t recall. I---I just take it that, uh, based on what is written in paragraph 6, it is what I---what I narrated to the IO and---**

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**So, just to clarify, are saying that what you read in paragraph 6 on the day was what you narrated to the IO?**

 |
| 

**Witness: It’s**

 | 

**different---It’s, yah---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. Alright---

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**It doesn’t---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So---

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**it doesn’t tally, so---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

when you read it on that day you and you saw that it was different---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I---I take it that---

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**Did you see that it was different from what you narrated to the IO?**

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**Uh, I really---I really cannot recall. I just---I just take it that---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, I’m---

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**same thing.**

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**I’m not sure what your answer is. Because your answer is, you---when you read paragraph 6, you take it as what was na---narrated to the IO, so---but now, you’re saying that it is different from what you narrated to the IO. So, what did you read on that day?**

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**(pause – 00:00:08) So, I just---I just assumed that---I just assumed that it was correct. I just assume that---**

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**Okay. So, you read paragraph 6, and you assumed that it was correct?**

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**I assumed that---I just assumed that it was correct.[^23]** (my emphasis)

 |

  
  

77     From the above, the Accused, took the position of merely “assuming” that what was written by IO Rakbir was correct on that day. That was his explanation as to why he did not amend the parts that he had disagreed with.

78     I found this explanation wholly untenable. He had amended substantial parts of the statement when he was given the opportunity to do so. This showed that he had read through the statement and had applied his mind to the contents before consciously and deliberately amending parts of the statement. It is inconceivable that he would have simply and nonchalantly “assumed” that the IO wrote correctly what he had narrated, knowing that the statement was in response to the allegation that he had molested V.

79     The long and short of it is that the Accused really had no cogent explanation as to why he had not amended the incriminating parts of his statement. It is also unacceptable that the Accused could possibly have read the statement as stating the his acts of physical intimacy were consensual at the time of signing when it is so clear that the entire narrative of the events of 1 June 2018 was that he had outraged the modesty of V. The Accused himself conceded that an objective reader of P8 would have come to the conclusion that the Accused had committed the physical acts of intimacy without V’s consent.

80     The irresistible conclusion is that the Accused had knowingly admitted to IO Rakbir that he had outraged the modesty of V on 1 June 2018 at the Sky Garden and in the back of his car and he had signed on the statement because that was what had happened in fact.

81     For completeness, I include here an argument brought about belatedly by the Defence Counsel. It was only raised for the first time in the Defence Counsel’s reply to Prosecution’s submissions. It was highlighted at paragraph 60 of the Reply that in D3, IO Rakbir had posed to V this question (at Q4/A4):

> Our investigations revealed that on 1 June 2018 when both of you and Mr Chua were at the Sky Garden. He hugged you and you sat on his lap and you did not struggle nor did you resist in any form. Is this true?

82     It was submitted that this version of events as presented by IO Rakbir could only have come from the Accused and it therefore directly contradicted the alleged confessions contained at paragraph 6 of P8. The Defence accordingly submitted that it was clear and obvious that the purported confessions at paragraph 6 of P8 did not come from to the Accused.

83     I found this argument rather mischievous. Firstly, this was never put to IO Rakbir when he was on the stand that the Accused’s statement had not been accurately recorded given this apparent contradiction. Secondly and crucially, the Prosecution pointed out in actual fact after P8 had been recorded, the Accused had given another version to the IO before this statement D3 was recorded from V, thus explaining why the question posed by IO Rakbir was framed this way. It was only after this response by Prosecution that the Defence Counsel then tailored his submission in Court to argue that at the very least before 11 June 2018, the Accused had already told IO Rakbir that he had not molested V and that this was not a defence only concocted at the time of the trial[^24].

84     If the Accused had subsequently given a different version from P8, it would plainly explain why IO Rakbir had posed the question to V subsequently in that manner to give V a chance to respond to the assertion by the Accused that the acts of physical intimacy were consented by V. This assertion by Prosecution that there was a subsequent statement by the Accused even though coming “from the Bar” was not disputed the Defence Counsel. Hence this fact was clearly known to the Defence Counsel. By omitting to inform that the Accused had subsequently given contrary statement to IO Rakbir, and instead making a submission that rode on such an omission, the Defence Counsel was in danger of misleading the Court. I would at this point remind Defence Counsel that in their earnestness to defend their clients, they must remember that they are officers of the court.

### Corroboration by V on the First and Third Charges

##### (1)   The cessation of door-knocking sessions in March and April 2018

85     In addition, I found this statement of the Accused to be strongly corroborated by the evidence of V. V had explained very clearly why there was a sudden decrease in door-knocking activities with the Accused in March and April of 2018. Her evidence that she had repeatedly turned the Accused down whenever he asked her to go door-knocking with him is well supported by the WhatsApp messages between them. As set out at \[18\] above, there were 5 instances to show that V had expressly turned the Accused down, citing either that she was busy or had no time. There was not a single instance in these 2 months of text messages which referred to a door-knocking session being carried out by both of them during this period. The WhatsApp message of the Accused to V on 29 April 2018 was very telling of the change in V’s attitude on door-knocking with the Accused, from one of enthusiasm up to February 2018 to repeatedly fobbing him off in March and April 2018:

> 10:51 - Chua Kia Dong: Next week doorknock?

> 10:52 – \[V\] AIA T6: Next week no time leh

> 10:52 – \[V\] AIA T6: Hahahah

> 10:54 - Chua Kia Dong: Go ehh

> 10:54 - Chua Kia Dong: Long time no doorknock alrdy[^25]

86     V’s testimony that she had been door-knocking with the Accused on a once a week frequency from December 2017 to February 2018 was unchallenged by the Accused. Hence the sudden cessation of such activities between them clearly showed that something had happened between V and the Accused. It strongly corroborated V’s evidence that she did not want to continue with any physically intimate relationship with the Accused and was trying to avoid any activities that would bring them alone together.

87     The sudden change that came about from the WhatsApp message on 18 May 2018 resulting in the door-knocking session on 23 May 2018 is consistent with V’s evidence that she had obtained a promise from the Accused that he would not be physically intimate with her again. On that assurance she had agreed to go door-knocking with him on 23 May 2018.

88     Her evidence that nothing physically intimate happened between them on 23 May 2018 was again unchallenged by the Accused during her cross-examination. The Accused himself admitted to this[^26]. This gave the assurance and confidence to V to agree to another door-knocking session with the Accused on 1 June 2018. If there was a continuing intimate physical relationship between the Accused and V, it would be a bit strange that nothing intimately physical occurred between them on 23 May 2018 when they were both alone together.

89     Her evidence that she did not want such a relationship with the Accused and that she had intentionally avoided door-knocking session with him was also corroborated by K.

90     K had testified that prior to 1 June 2018, V had informed him that she was uncomfortable about going door-knocking with the Accused as he had tried to stand very close to her and tried to touch her or hug her. He had advised her to stop working with the Accused and V had told him that she had been rejecting a few of his offers to go door-knocking with him[^27].

91     In contrast, the Accused was only able to make a bare assertion that his relationship with V continued to be a romantic and physically intimate one right up to 1 June 2018. However, he was not able to provide any explanation as to why V had repeatedly turned him down in March and April 2018 for door-knocking sessions.

92     The Accused testified that he had consensual sexual intercourse with V on 3 occasions in February 2018, with 2 occasions in the Family toilet in Tampines Hub and the last occasion was in his vehicle on 19 February 2018.

93     The Accused was able to provide a lot of details about the instances of physical intimacy in February 2018. However, his testimony about acts of physical intimacy after February 2018 until just before 1 June 2018 was strangely vague and tentative. When he was asked whether after 19th February 2018 which was the last time they had a sexual encounter, they had any form of physical intimacy, the Accused could only reply vaguely “likely have” as he had met her on various times in the office or during door-knocking sessions.

94     However, he could only point to one more time of door-knocking session during the period of March and April where V had testified that she ceased all door-knocking activities with the Accused. The Accused claimed that there was one door-knocking session on 15 March 2018 with V. When asked whether there was any physical intimacy during that session, the Accused could only say that he could not remember exactly but likely there would have been. He based his assertion that there was such a door knocking session on his phone calendar (exhibit D16 – screenshot of his calendar) where there was a reference of “door-knock with \[V\]”.

95     I found this assertion of “door-knocking” on 15 March 2018 suspect. Firstly, he had never confronted V through his Defence Counsel when V was on the stand that there was a door-knocking session on 15 March 2018 and that they had shared a physically intimate moment together. V had already testified that she had been avoiding going with the Accused for door-knocking sessions to prevent any more physical intimacy from taking place for March and April 2018.

96     Secondly, looking through the WhatsApp messages between the Accused and V (exhibit P9) and the dates where there was a scheduled appointment in the Accused’s phone calendar (exhibit D16), I found that for each of the entries of “Door knock with \[V\]”, there would be corresponding messages in P9 that corresponded with details that are consistent with such a meet up. The following entries for doorknocking with V are found in D16 which had corresponding messages in P9: 18 January, 25 January, 31 January, 1 February and 4 February and 23 May 2018.

97     However, when it came to 15 March 2018, there was a glaring dearth of any text messages on 15 March 2018. In fact, the last messages exchanged around that period was on 12 March 2018 where the Accused had asked her to door-knock that night but V had turned him down. Thereafter, there were no exchanges until 19 March 2018.

98     I therefore found that the Accused had been discredited on his evidence that there was any door-knocking session carried out with V on 15 March 2018 and consequentially, his evidence that there was consensual physical intimacy on that day between him and V could not stand.

99     Hence, it was very clear to me that there was indeed a very sharp difference in the frequency of door-knocking sessions between them looking at the period of Jan and February 2018 and the period of March to April 2018 with the first door-knocking session only appearing on 23 May 2018. This evidence is clearly in support of the narrative given by V that she did not want to continue with a physically intimate relationship with the Accused from March 2018 onwards.

#### V’s testimony in court about the event in Sky Garden

100    In court, V was able to give a clear account of the events that happened at the Sky Garden on 1 June 2018 which was consistent with the contents of P8. She had testified that after the door-knocking session, she had bought a waffle as she did not have her dinner yet. Her next appointment was to see a client in Sengkang at about 8-8.30pm and the Accused had agreed to drive her there. She had also left her jacket earlier in his car.

101    However, as they had a bit of time, the Accused suggested sitting on the ledge next to the playground. She was reluctant to do so as she did not like the idea of the Accused sitting too close to her. She testified that the Accused then suggested going to the Sky Garden and she agreed to go with him to look for seats that are separated from each other.

102    They had gone to the wrong block initially. When they found the correct block, they went to the area where there were separate round stools. Upon reaching the area, the Accused sat down first and pulled V down to sit on his lap. The Accused hugged her from behind and when she tried to get up, he had tightened his grip. V told him “No” but the Accused did not let her go. Instead, he started to smell her hair and said it smelled good. He then started kissing her on her ear area, neck and collar bone. He thereafter reached his hand underneath her clothes and bra to touch her breast. He then said he wanted to “fuck” her.

103    All the while, V kept telling the Accused “No” but to no avail as he was much stronger than her. After a while, her phone rang and she managed to get up to answer the call. It was from a colleague. Thereafter she testified that she went off with him in his car for her next appointment. Although she was still feeling scared of him, she decided to go along as she was late for her next appointment and her jacket was in his car. She also did not know whether she should file a report against him and therefore she did not want to alert him at this time and just went along with him to his car.

104    I found her account on the event of 1 June 2018 in relation to the Sky Garden very consistent with the statement P8 given by the Accused. She corroborated P8 on the following matters set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 of P8:

> (a)     Accused was the person who suggested to go to the Sky Garden area when V was reluctant to sit next to the playground.

> (b)     The Accused hugged her from behind and wrapped his hands around her body.

> (c)     V had told him “No” but he ignored her and carried on with his advances by inserting his hand under her shirt and bra and groped her breast with skin to skin contact.

> (d)     V kept telling him to stop touching her but he ignored her and continued to touch her.

> (e)     Accused kissed her on her cheek, neck and collarbone area. He smelled her hair and told her she smelled good.

> (f)     Accused held her tightly and asked her to have sex with him but she said no.

> (g)     The episode ended when V checked her handphone (V testified that she answered a call).

####    V’s previous accounts on the location of the first incident of outrage of modesty

105    However, what appeared to be rather unusual is the fact that V had reported the location of the first incident of molest to be have occurred at a staircase at the third level of Blk 277D and not at the Sky Garden. This was in her First Information Report (P2) as well as her police statement recorded on 4 June 2018 (exhibit D4), just 3 days after the alleged incident. In D4, she had described the acts of molest on her by the Accused in almost identical details: the hugging from behind, the touching of her breast under her bra, the kissing of neck and collarbone area, the smelling of her hair, her repeated “No”s to the Accused and the end of the incident triggered by her receiving a phone call.

106    In another statement given by her to the police on 6 June 2018 (exhibit D5), she had again stated the location of this incident to be a staircase of level 3 of Block 277D, Compassvale Link.

107    It was only in a further statement given by her on 7 June 2018 (exhibit D2) that she stated that the first incident of molest on 1 June 2018 took place in the Sky Garden[^28].

108    This location being on a staircase about the first molest incident on 1 June 2018 was also mentioned by V to K on 1 June 2018. K testified that V had called him between 10.04pm and 10.32pm that day after the alleged incident. This was based on the text messages between them (exhibit P4). At 10.04pm, V had texted him stating “Appointment, I call you when home”, and at 10.32pm, K had stated, “What else he do? Like WTF, siah, he squeezed your boobs, you didn’t whack him meh?”. K testified that based on his message at 10.32pm, he had already heard from V in a phone call on what the Accused had done to her and hence asked her if the Accused had done anything else.

109    In that phone conversation with V, K said that V had told him that the Accused had molested her by hugging her from behind and thereafter putting his hand underneath her shirt and bra to squeeze her breast and that this happened whilst they were walking down from another level during door-knocking that day[^29].

110    From K’s testimony, it would appear even on the same day of the incident, V had given the location of this first molest to be at a staircase in a HDB block.

111    The Defence Counsel had cross-examined V on this discrepancy and V’s reply was that she was traumatised by the event and because there were earlier incidents of her being hugged from behind, she had been confused about the location. She confirmed that there was no incident of any molest on the staircase on 1 June 2018 and the first incident of molest happened in the Sky Garden. She further explained that her mind was more focused on what had happened rather than on the location[^30].

112    At first brush, it would appear to be quite unbelievable that V could have been confused about the location barely a few hours after the incident. V had either been so traumatised by the event that she made a mistake on the location or she had deliberately altered the detail to avoid stating that the incident had occurred at the Sky Garden.

113    I found that there was no plausible reason why she would have deliberately lied about the location. The gravamen of the complaint was that the Accused had molested her on that day. There is no dispute that the acts complained of were indeed committed by the Accused. Hence, it would be strange why V would have deliberately lied about the location since that would not make her story any more credible. The Accused did not deny that he had held her from behind and kissed her and put his hand under her shirt to touch her breast and that these acts took place in the Sky Garden. I therefore could not fathom why she would deliberately lie about where the acts took place. It would serve no purpose. I note that even when the Defence Counsel was putting his case to her, all he could repeatedly do was to assert that V had given this false information to mislead the authorities into thinking that an incident happened at the staircase, without suggesting any motivation to her for such a lie.[^31]

114    Hence, the only reasonable conclusion I could reach is that V had been so traumatised by the incident that she had conflated the events such that she had wrongly stated the location to be at the staircase, which was in reference to an earlier incident in February 2018 where the Accused had hugged her from behind during their door-knocking sessions.

#### V’s account of the incident in the car

115    Whilst P8 had made reference to an incident in the car after the Accused and V had gone down from the Sky Garden, V testified during examination in chief that she could only remember going to the car and thereafter arriving at the next appointment. She could not remember any details between reaching the car and arrival at the next destination. It was only during cross-examination when she was confronted with a previous statement to the police (exhibit D2) recorded on 7 February 2018 that it was revealed that she had given an account of the incident in the Accused’s car. It is noted that V did not mention anything about a molest incident having taken place in the Accused’s car on 1 June 2018 in her first information report as well as her first 2 statements to the police. She only made reference to this incident in D2 that she had been molested twice on 1 June 2018, with the first time at the Sky Garden and the second time in the Accused’s car[^32].

116    V during re-examination could not give any explanation as to why she could not remember the incident in the car and could only remember the incident at the Sky Garden. However, her answers to the questions posed to her as recorded in D2 are consistent with the version given by the Accused in P8. The relevant parts of D2 are as follows:

> Q10)  Did you told Mr Chua that you only have till 8.15pm suggesting to him that if he wants to do anything physical with you he only had till 8.15pm to do so?

> A10)  No, by telling that I had to leave by 8.15pm it did not mean that he can do anything physically (sexual) to me. When I told him that I had to leave by 8.15pm clearly suggested that he should stop his advances immediately as I have to rush for my next appointment.

> Q11)  Why did you agree to move from the front seat to the back seat?

> A11)  The only reason that I agreed was because I was scared of him. As I am scared that he will be more aggressive towards me and will molest me further hence, I just heeded him advise and listen to him. All I wanted was for him to send me to my next destination and I have made up my mind that after that I am not going to have any more contact with him. The moment he dropped me at Sengkang I stop communicating with him in every aspects and informed my supervisor about the matter and lodged a police report subsequently.

> Q12)  In total on 1st June 2018 how many times did Mr Chua molested you?

> A12)  He molested me twice on 1st June 2018. First was at the Sky Garden and second was in his car. Both occasions he used force and restraint me tightly not allowing me to move. I was struggling and keep telling him to stop touching me but he did not stop. He only stop when my phone rang when \[K\] called me and reminded me for my next appointment.

> Q13)  Do you have anything else to add to your statement?

> A13)  Yes, I do not know if this makes a difference but I would like to state that after Mr Chua forceful advances towards me I was feeling really scared and did not know how to react. Hence, I texted \[K\] who is also known as “\[KL\]” as that is his Chinese name. I asked him to call me so that I can use the phone call as an excuse that I am getting late and will have to leave. That was when my phone rang in the car I told Mr Chua that I had to really leave as soon as possible and that was only when he stopped his sexual advances towards me.

117    I found from the answers she gave in D2, she clearly stated that the touches by the Accused in the car were unwelcomed and non-consensual. She had asked him to stop but he had continued with his “sexual advances”. He only stopped when V’s phone rang with a call from K. She had proffered a cogent reason as to why she had moved to the back seat as she was afraid that the Accused might become more aggressive if she did not comply. She also explained that by telling him that she had to leave by 8.15pm, it did not mean she consented to him touching her but it was to tell him to stop his advances as she had to leave for her next appointment.

118    These assertions she made are consistent and corroborate the version given by the Accused in P8. The Accused had stated at paragraphs 7 and 8 that they had moved to the back seat as he wanted to continue his “intimacy” with V. V had also told her that she had to leave as she has only “until 8.15pm” which is consistent with her explanation that it was her way of telling him to stop as she has to go. Furthermore, the Accused also stated similarly that he had stopped touching her only when she received a phone call from K.

119    Although V in court still could not recollect the incident in the car, she accepted that she had told the truth in her police statement given on 7 June 2018 and that her memory of the incident would have been fresher on that day compared to the time of her giving evidence in court [^33].

120    Given the consistency, I found that V’s answers were corroborative of the Accused’s admission in P8 that he had continued to molest her in his car and the acts of intimacy were carried out without her consent. Her lack of consent is also consistent with what had taken place earlier at the Sky Garden. If she had resisted and made known her unwillingness to engage in any physical intimacy in the Sky Garden, it would have been unlikely that she would be agreeable to that after they had gone into the vehicle.

121    D2 was used to cross-examine V on the ground that it contained statements inconsistent with her testimony in court, particularly on the ground that V had failed to mention anything about being molested in the car, even though it was a very serious matter. The Defence had attempted to cast doubt on her veracity since V had earlier testified that the only molest incident that had taken place on 1 June 2018 was at the Sky Garden and nowhere else[^34].

122    This evidence of V that she was molested in the car on the face of it would be inconsistent with her testimony in court that she was molested on 1 June 2018 only once at the Sky Garden. Accordingly, since she has been cross-examined on this matter in D2, I found that pursuant to section 147(3) of the Evidence Act Cap 97, the inconsistent parts of D2 would be “admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by the person would be admissible”.

### The Second Charge – The incident in the lift

#### The CCTV footages

123    P8 did not make any reference to any incident in the lift. However, there was clear and indisputable evidence in the form of CCTV footage of the inside of the lift as captured by 2 security cameras in the lift.

124    The footages played in court showed that when V and the Accused walked into the lift at level 3, there was a lady with a dog already inside the lift. When the lift reached the ground floor, the lady and her dog exited the lift, leaving the Accused and V in the lift to continue their descent to the basement carpark.

125    As soon as the lift door closed, the Accused could be seen moving towards V while she turned her face away from him. V could be seen turning her face away but the Accused moved in to kiss her neck or cheek area. V could be seen saying “No” and turned her back towards the Accused to face the lift wall. The Accused was undeterred and drew her in towards him with his arm around her waist and gave an audible moan as he proceeded to kiss on her left cheek and neck area. 3 lip-smacking kissing sounds could be heard at this juncture[^35]. Force could be seen to be applied as V’s head was seen being moved sideways by the force of his kissing.

126    I found that there was clearly contact made by the Accused’s lips, both by the audible sounds heard and also by the fact that V was clearly physically trapped by the Accused’s hand around her waist and she was wedged by the Accused’s body on her back and the lift wall in front of her. In that position, she had no space to manoeuvre out and would have been successfully kissed by him.

127    At trial, the Accused initially maintained that he could not recall if his lips had made contact with the V’s cheek whilst they were in the lift[^36]. However, he conceded that his cautioned statement concerning the Second Charge which was recorded on 18 December 2018 (Exhibit D24) reflected that he had indeed kissed V on the cheek in the lift since he did not deny the act but had merely claimed that it was consensual[^37]. The Accused also conceded that his memory of the events in the lift would have been more accurate at the time of his statement in December 2018 than at the time of the trial[^38].

128    The Accused had admitted in his evidence-in-chief that he was aware at the time of the incident that V was saying “no” to him kissing her. He explained that he proceeded to kiss her despite that as he thought V was being “coy” when she said “no” and they were merely continuing with whatever they were doing at the Sky Garden:

> Q:    Now, based on the footage that we just saw and based on your recollection, did \[V\]--- what did \[V\] say inside the lift?

> A:    She said no.

> Q:    Do you know what she was saying no to?

> A:    Yah, because I was---I was trying to kiss her so she said no.

> Court:    So, what is she---what is she saying no to?

> Witness:    Uh, she’s---she’s saying no because---uh, because I was trying to kiss her.

> Court:    So, she was saying no to what?

> Witness:    To my trying to kiss her.

> Q:    Now, when you leaned into \[V\] to try and kiss her, did you know if she was okay with it?

> A:    I think at that point in time, um, it did not really like register to me as a firm or a stern no and like she---I felt like she was like---just like being coy with me like she was like kind of like shy but okay kind and---and we were also going back to my car as well ah. So, I thought like---like, it was all consensual and everything from---yah.

> Q:    Why---why did you try and---why did you try to kiss \[V\] when you were inside the lift?

> A:    Because it’s---because we were just---we were continuing from, um---um, whatever we were doing at the Sky Garden, lah. So---then some more like, now, we were going back to my car as well. So, I thought it’s just like---just a continuation from the Sky Garden.[^39]

129    Having had the benefit of watching the CCTV footage several times, I found that V showed no sign of any positive response to the Accused’s kiss. If it was consensual, I would have expected some form of reciprocity to his physical action. Instead, her body language clearly demonstrated her unwillingness to be kissed by the Accused. She was seen turning her face away and thereafter turning her back to the Accused. There was nothing coy about her saying “No” to being kissed by the Accused and the Accused could not have possibly misread the situation.

130    In the video footage of exhibit P11, just before the Accused moved into kiss, I could catch a glimpse of V’s face[^40]. She looked a bit tense and was not smiling. After the lift stopped and the Accused released his grip on her, V was momentarily motionless facing the wall, as if stunned. She only reacted to move when the Accused moved her out of the lift with his hand. Such a reaction is consistent with a person who did not welcome the kisses.

131    Furthermore, given my above finding based on P8 that V had repeatedly said “no” to his sexual advances at the Sky Garden immediately prior to the incident in the lift, it would defy logic for the Accused to claim that he thought V would consent to being kissed in the lift.

#### V’s testimony on the lift incident

132    After watching the CCTV footage, V was able to say that she had moved to one side of the lift after the lady had exited so as to keep a distance from the Accused. However the Accused had “cornered” her and she could not get away from him. She also testified that she could hear herself say “No” at least one time to the Accused[^41]. V had clearly expressed her refusal to being kissed by the Accused by saying “no” to him and moving away from him in the lift and trying to avoid his kiss.

133    While V was unable to recollect whether the Accused’s lips had actually made physical contact with her cheek at the point of her oral testimony at trial, she affirmed that she had not consented to be kissed by the Accused and would “classify it as molest” if the Accused’s lips had come into contact with her cheek[^42]. However, upon her memory being refreshed with her police statement dated 23 August 2018 (Exhibit D14) where she had stated on that day that the Accused had kissed her in the lift on 1 June 2018, she confirmed that what she said to the police was true and accurate, given that her memory of the event then would have been closer to the actual event[^43].

134    V’s evidence on what she has stated in D14 is admissible as pursuant to section 162 of the Evidence Act Cap 97, a witness may testify to facts mentioned in a document used to refresh her memory although she “has no specific recollection of the facts themselves, if \[she\] is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document”.

135    I therefore found that the Accused’s attempts to kiss V whilst inside the lift were successful in that his kisses did land on the cheek of V and that such kisses were clearly unwelcomed and without the consent of V.

### Post-incident behaviour of V

#### V’s text message to K at 8.06pm

136    I found V’s post-incident evidence consistent with her feeling that her modesty had been outraged by the Accused. The first piece of evidence is the phone message she sent to K at 8.06 pm immediately after exiting the lift telling K to call her. Her message reads “ Kor, please call me” which is captured in the screenshot taken of her phone at exhibit P4.

137    V explained that she was hoping that K would call her and if he did, there will be “lesser chance” that the Accused would be able to do anything to her. V testified that she was feeling afraid of the Accused, in that he might continue to do what he did earlier at the Sky Garden. She further explained that in her mind, if K called, the Accused would not dare to do anything if someone was on the line with her[^44].

138    I found her explanation very plausible. As it turned out, K did call and did interrupt the Accused when he was in the midst of kissing and touching V, resulting in V answering the call and the Accused ceasing his sexual advances. This is not disputed as the Accused admitted so in his statement in P8 at \[8\] where the Accused stated, “At this juncture, her mobile phone rang and it was one of our colleague namely \[K\] who had called her. I then stop touching her and drove her to her destination.”

139    The reason for V to send out this brief message is clearly a strong indication of the state of mind V was in. V was fearful of what the Accused might do to her when she went in his car and had thought of a method to protect herself. This reason was not something she had concocted whilst on the stand as seen by the fact that she had highlighted this to IO Rakbir in her statement to him on 6 June 2018 (exhibit D2) where she stated at A13:

> Yes, I do not know if this makes a difference but I would like to state that after Mr Chua forceful advances towards me I was feeling really scared and did not know how to react. Hence, I texted \[K\] who is also known as “\[KL\]” as that is his Chinese name. I asked him to call me so that I can use the phone call as an excuse that I am getting late and will have to leave. That was when my phone rang in the car I told Mr Chua that I had to really leave as soon as possible and that was only when he stopped his sexual advances towards me.

#### The almost immediate reporting of the acts of the Accused to V’s colleagues

140    I note that V’s position that she had been molested by the Accused was reported to her colleagues almost immediately on the first opportunity after she had parted with the Accused. The Accused had dropped her off for her next appointment. On her arrival at her client’s place, her colleague who was meeting her was not there. As she was feeling lost and confused, she gave another colleague, T, a call. T was the first person she disclosed an incident of molest to. She had tried calling K but K was busy and did not pick up her call. Hence, she had called T. She told T about what the Accused did to her without going into the details. T advised her she should either make a police report or inform her managers about it.

141    I found this evidence of V very reliable and cogent as it was supported by the text messages exchanged between her and T later that evening beginning at 11.38pm on 1 June 2018 (exhibit P15) which confirmed that V had indeed told T earlier that evening about being molested by the Accused. I set out here the text messages:

> 1 June 2018

> 11.38pm V: Don’t want K alr. He scold me.

> V: Don’t want tell K anything alr.    

> 2 June 2018

> 2.42am T: But pls tell \[J\]

142    It is not disputed that J refers to one of V’s managers. V had explained the above messages as she having told T about the incident on 1 June 2018. From the rest of the conversation, it is clear that T was advising V to report the matter to her manager and let the manager handle the matter. T had expressed concerns that K should not confront the Accused as K might get “piss off” and “lay hands” on the Accused and that would be an offence[^45].

143    What is clear from these messages from T as well as those from K highlighted above[^46] is that V had immediately told at least 2 persons on the same evening on 1 June 2018 after the event. This also lent support to V and K’s evidence that their relationship was quite close at this time.

144    In addition, K also testified that V was crying and feeling very frightened when she told him about the incident on the phone that very night. He had to calm her down before she could slowly give him the information[^47]. His evidence corroborated V’s testimony that she was crying and hence K had texted her “Don’t be sad already”[^48]. The contemporaneity of her disclosure to T and K and V’s distressed state on that same evening are consistent with V feeling her modesty outraged by the action of the Accused on 1 June 2018.

145    If V had consented to the sexual advancement and there has been a continual romantic relationship with the Accused from February 2018 to 1 June 2018, there would be no fathomable reason for the very drastic action on the part of V to complain about him to her colleagues on 1 June 2018 and subsequently to her manager J on 2 June 2018. It was only after V’s managers meet up with the Accused and the Accused denying that he had done anything to V, that V decided to lodge a police report on 4 June 2018.

## THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

### The motivation to make a false claim against the Accused

146    In the Defence’s closing submission, there was no reason proffered as to why V would fabricate a false claim against him. Nonetheless, when the Accused was on the stand, the defence did attempt to put up 2 possible reasons.

147    The first was that V was afraid that of having her affair with the Accused exposed which would jeopardise her relationship with K. Hence V had made these false allegations to show everyone that there was no affair between them[^49].

148    I found this suggestion to be wholly illogical. According to the Accused, this affair he was having with V was “very secretive and under the carpet”[^50]. If that was really the concern of V, then it would make no sense for her to draw attention to this relationship by making up an allegation that the Accused had molested her. In any case, V had denied such a suggestion[^51]. There was no assertion by the Accused nor did he testify that he had threatened to tell others about his affair with V. Hence there would have been no concern that V would have of her alleged affair being exposed by the Accused and hence did a pre-emptive strike.

149    The second reason suggested by the Accused was that that V was upset with him for insinuating that she would break up K’s other relationship in a conversation they had on 23 May 2018. It was suggested to her that she was so offended by his statement “Then don’t be so mean. Shouldn’t break other person’s relationship”, that she took revenge on him by fabricating a false allegation against the Accused. V firmly disagreed with this suggestion, stating that such a response would be “very immature”[^52].

150    I found this suggested second reason to be wholly preposterous. It would simply defy logic for V to make such a serious false allegation out of vengeance over such a trivial passing remark by the Accused even if he had made it.

### The lack of credibility of V

151    The Defence had attacked the credibility of V on several aspects of her evidence, alleging that her evidence lacked credibility and therefore she was an untruthful witness and the court should prefer the evidence of the Accused.

152    However, the Defence had wrongly insisted that the evidence of V must meet the “unusually convincing” test in order for Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This is because this is not a case where the Prosecution’s case rests solely on the evidence of one witness.

153    The main evidence of the Prosecution lies on the confession of the Accused in P8 as well as the CCTV recordings of the incident in the lift. Accordingly I have dealt with at length above to show why those evidence have been found to be reliable and show convincingly that the Accused had carried out all the alleged acts as set out in the 3 charges, knowing full well that such acts were not consented to by V.

154    Therefore an attack on the credibility of V’s evidence cannot be done in isolation without reference to P8 as well as the CCTV evidence.

155    I will now proceed to examine the issues of credibility raised by the Defence.

#### V’s selective memory

156    The Defence firstly highlighted that V had not been forthcoming about the past instances of sexual intercourse between V and the Accused. In court, V could only remember one incident at the Family room in Tampines Hub where she said she was an unwilling party. However, V had stated in her police statement D2 that she had sexual intercourse with the Accused twice, once in the Tampines Hub and once in a car. There was also an amendment made in the statement showing that originally she had stated that she had sexual intercourse twice with the Accused at Tampines Hub but she amended it to one time.

157    The Defence submitted that therefore the Accused’s version ought to be believed that he had sex with V on three occasions, namely twice at Tampines Hub and once in his vehicle. The Defence rubbished V’s claim that she was able to delete certain memory as absurd and ridiculous.

158    As no expert evidence such as a psychiatrist on the effect of sexual trauma on a person, it would be difficult for the Court to assess the truthfulness of V’s assertions on why she could only remember certain matters and not others, from a medical perspective. However, what is clear is that there is no overt reason for V to be deliberately untruthful in not remembering clearly that there was more than one sexual encounter with the Accused. She had readily admitted that there was one occasion that she had sex with the Accused. What is more crucial is her evidence that after February 2018, she decided not to have any more physical intimacy with the Accused and hence she stopped going door knocking with the Accused from March until she obtained an agreement from the Accused in not repeating his action. She then resumed door-knocking with him on 23 May 2018. Even based on the Accused’s version, all three occasions of sexual encounter occurred in February 2018. Hence, even if there had been more than one sexual encounters in February 2018 and that V was not an unwilling party to those sexual encounters, the fact is that all such encounters had ceased after February 2018.

159    Hence, the fact that V did have sexual encounter with the Accused on more than one occasion in February did not lend any credence to the Accused’s case that they continued to have a romantic relationship all the way until 1 June 2018.

160    Similarly, V’s inability to recall the molest incident in the car on 1 June 2018 did not infer that there was deliberate untruth on her part. If she was already determined to give evidence in a trial against the Accused, there would be no reason why she would deliberately not give details of what had happened in the vehicle since it was not disputed that the Accused did in fact engage in physical intimacy with the Accused in the vehicle.

161    Similarly, there is no reason for V to deliberately suppress her memory of what had happened in the lift. Granted, it might seem strange and bizarre for V to still not be able to recount the incident even after refreshing her memory by viewing the CCTV footages as well as her statement where she had mentioned that the Accused had molested her in the car. On the other hand, it is a reflection of the candour of V in that she would readily admit to not remembering those incidents even though it would be advantageous for her to say that she did. If V had been out to get the Accused, it would be most logical for her to give the evidence to support her allegation. Hence, I found her coming across as being very forthright and candid witness in that she genuinely could not remember those incidents and hence was not prepared to say she did.

#### V’s knowledge of the seating arrangement at the Sky Garden

162    The Defence Counsel had cross-examined V at length over her evidence that she did not know that there were separate seats in the Sky Garden prior to her entering the Sky Garden with the Accused. In court, V had stated that she did not want to sit at the ledge at the playground as she wanted to keep a distance from the Accused. She then said she agreed with the Accused’s suggestion to go to the Sky Garden to see if there was separate seating available in that location.

163    However, in her statement to the police on 11 June 2018 (D3), she had stated that she agreed to go to the Sky Garden because there were separate seats there. Her answer at A3 was

> It is because he wanted me to sit on a concrete parapet in front of the playground and I said such was because if we were to sit there chances of him to come close to me is very likely by if we move up to the Sky Garden area the location of the chair is different. The seating arrangement at the Sky Garden were such where there were 4 stools and there were spaces in between hence, he will not be able to come close to me.

164    The Defence latched on this statement to show that V had lied and asserted that this showed that she knew about the seating arrangement inside the Sky Garden because she had been there before with the Accused. The Defence also asserted that V had lied in Court to hide the fact that she knew about the inside of the Sky Garden as she was physically intimate with the Accused there on one occasion in February 2018.

165    When confronted with the conflicting evidence, V maintained that on the day of the incident, she could not remember ever being inside the Sky Garden before but had only seen it from the outside and hence she could not have known the exact seating arrangement inside the Sky Garden.

166    When asked about how it is possible then that she had given a statement that suggested that she knew about the seating positions of the stools in the Sky Garden prior to going there with the Accused on 1 June 2018, she proffered this answer:

> I think because this statement was given after the incident has occurred.[^53]

167    I found V’s explanation plausible. As her statement was taken after the incident has happened, it is entirely conceivable plausible that her knowledge of the seating arrangement at the Sky Garden acquired after the incident had weaved its way into her answer when she was explaining why she did not want to sit at the ledge.

168    I found therefore that V had not deliberately lied about her lack of previous knowledge of the seating arrangement in the Sky Garden. In any case, whether she did know about the seating arrangement prior to going to the Sky Garden is not a material fact which would affect the credibility of V’s evidence as a whole.

#### V’s evidence of receiving a phone call in the Sky Garden

169    The next discrepancy highlighted by the Accused was over whether V had received a call in the Sky Garden. This was because her testimony in court that she received a call from K was contradicted by her statement where she had stated that she had merely checked her handphone.

170    I found this discrepancy to be wholly immaterial in the context of the incident in that it is a relatively minor point as to whether V got up from the Accused to check her phone or to respond to a phone call. On both the Accused’s account as well as V’s, the Accused’s acts of physical intimacy were interrupted by V doing something to her phone. I find that there is no reason why V would deliberately change her evidence on this point and further no advantage gained or lost as to whether there was an actual call that came in.

171    The Defence had submitted that if it is true that V had checked her phone instead of receiving a call, it would show that there was no restraint on V and therefore that the entire episode was consensual. I found this argument fallacious because clearly the Accused would have to stop his acts at some point in time and release his grip on V. Just because V had managed to get up at that point to check her phone did not mean that the Accused had not forcefully restrained V earlier on in order to kiss her and touch her breast. Whether it was to check her phone or to pick up a call, the Accused did release his grip on V at that point.

172    Further, given that it is undisputed that V did receive a phone call from K later on when she was in the car with the Accused which also interrupted the Accused’s sexual advances, it would also be possible that V had inadvertently mixed up the 2 incidents.

#### Post-molest behaviour of V was incongruent

173    The Defence has submitted that V’s behaviour in following the Accused to his car to take a ride with him was patently inconsistent with someone who had just been molested by the same person. It was also submitted that the CCTV footage of V coming into the lift showing that she was cheery and was not in any distress. This showed that nothing untoward had happened to her in the Sky Garden.

##### (1)   The act of V following the Accused to his vehicle and thereafter moving to the back seat of car

174    I would agree with the Defence that it would seem rather strange for someone who had been molested to still follow the perpetrator into his vehicle and thereby ran the risk of further molest. Further, moving to the back seat of the car merely on being told to do so on first brush would also be inconsistent with the action of someone who had just been molested. The most natural thing for a victim to do would be to take flight to get away from the perpetrator as soon as possible.

175    V had given a few reasons for her decision to follow the Accused to his vehicle. In her statement to the police at D3, she was asked at Q5 why she would still let the Accused send her to the next destination despite what he had done to her at the Sky Garden. She replied that it was because her jacket was in his car. She went on to explain by stating

> My intention was to allow him to send me to my next destination and take back my jacket from his car and thereafter to stop all contacts with him. And that was what I did after he dropped me off at my next destination, I stopped all contacts with him. He did text me several times the same day at night and I did not reply to him.

176    In court, V further elaborated that on the way to the Accused’s car, she had reasoned that once she reached the next appointment she would be safe as her colleague would be there. She also thought the Accused would not molest her again since if she was late, her colleague would check on her. She also said she did not want to alert the Accused that she was intending to make a complaint about his actions[^54].

177     In her reply A11 in her statement D2 when asked why she would move to the back seat of the car, she explained that she was feeling scared of him and that he would be more aggressive towards her and hence she just heeded his advice and listened to him.

178    She candidly admitted that she was ‘stupid’ and had no common sense when suggested by the Defence Counsel that she should have realised that the Accused could do things to her in the car. She said all she could think of then was that there was no time for the Accused to do anything. She then added that if she had acted logically then all these things “shouldn’t even have happened”[^55].

179    I found that her explanation has a ring of truth to it. Many times, victims do not have the luxury of time to analyse their best option on the spur of the moment and it is unfair to expect everyone to react in the same way. In that moment right after the molest, V felt that she had to carry on as normally as possible so as not to alert the Accused and was just hoping to complete the rest of the journey as planned without any more incident. With the benefit of hindsight, it would be easy to criticise the actions of V in continuing to follow the Accused into his car as being inconsistent with someone who had just been molested by him.

180    Further, her reaction or behaviour, should not be viewed in isolation but in the context of the overall case for the Prosecution. In this regard I found that her action although not in consonant with expected normal behaviour nonetheless was consistent with and corroborated the admission of the Accused in P8 that he had indeed molested V at both the Sky Garden and in his vehicle on that day. It is because of the admission of the Accused as well as the other supporting evidence highlighted above, that any doubt concerning V’s evidence can be safely resolved in favour of her version. I found that on the whole, V had given a plausible explanation for her action in following the Accused to his car right after she had been already molested in the Sky Garden. She had come across as a forthright and credible witness.

181    Her evidence on her state of mind that she had planned not to have anything further to do with the Accused and to cease all contacts with him once she has been sent safely to her next appointment is also supported by the evidence of the WhatsApp messages between them at P9 showing that she stopped responding completely to the Accused’s messages after she had been dropped off:

> 01/06/2018, 18:39 - Chua Kia Dong: Haha

> 01/06/2018, 21:22 - Chua Kia Dong: Ur appt end alrdy?

> 01/06/2018, 21:33 - Chua Kia Dong: \[V\] i go back first sleepy

> 01/06/2018, 22:27 - Chua Kia Dong: Yx sent u back already?

182    This case illustrates the observation made by the High Court and which was implicitly accepted by the Court of Appeal in the case of _Yue Roger Jr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 829</span> (“_Yue Roger Jr_”) at \[3\] that “people react in different ways to sexual abuse, including compartmentalising or rationalising their reactions.

##### (2)   The demeanour of V as seen in the CCTV footage of the lift did not show a traumatised victim

183    In the CCTV footage of the lift incident, V, upon entering the lift with the Accused, had greeted the lady with the dog and had made conversation about the dog, asking whether it would bite. When the lady exited the lift with the dog, V had also said “bye-bye”. It was put to V that based on that footage, she appeared to be happy and not traumatised, to which V had agreed. It was then put to her that she could look happy, cheerful and lively only because she was not molested at the Sky Garden just minutes earlier. V disagreed and said that the only reason she was so happy was because there was someone else in the lift[^56].

184    I found that V’s reason for appearing happy and cheerful credible. Similar to the observation made in _Yue Roger Jr_ highlighted above, we cannot expect all victims of a sexual assault to react in a particular way. It really depends very much on the individual with all her individual traits. In the situation she was in, it does not beggar belief that her reaction could be one of relief on seeing someone else in the lift. It could also be her way of coping with the situation.

185    What is more telling is the way she had reacted the moment the Accused came close to her immediately after the lift door closed. Her reaction to the Accused closing in on her to kiss her had been set out in detail above which showed that there was no consent on her part to any form of physical intimacy from the Accused. If she had really engaged in a consensual “making-out” session just moments earlier, there would have been no such adverse reaction on her part to the Accused’s further sexual overtures.

#### When did V take her jacket from the Accused’s car

186    The Accused had testified that V had taken her jacket from his vehicle on 30 May 2018. He provided some details as to how after a team meeting on that day, V had arranged with him to go door knocking. After checking his schedule, the Accused then texted V to inform her that he was available on 1 June 2018. Thereafter he suddenly remembered that V had left her jacket in his car. He then went to look for her in the office to ask her to collect her jacket. Thereafter, they had walked together to Block 519 Tampines Central 8 multi-storey carpark where he gave back the jacket to V which he took from his boot.

187    When the Accused’s instructions on this event were told to V, she said she could not remember such an incident had taken place on 30 May 2018. However, she maintained that she did collect her jacket on 1 June 2018 and hence it could not be true that she had already collected her jacket on 30 May 2018 . V also explained that in her text to K on 1 June, she had made mention of the fact that she had left her jacket in the Accused’s car the last time that they had gone door-knocking and that was one of the reasons she had gone to his car with the Accused on 1 June 2018 which was to retrieve her jacket .

188    I found that the purport of this evidence from the Accused was really to rebut V’s claim that one of the reasons why she wanted to follow the Accused to his vehicle on 1 June 2018 was to collect her jacket. However, I found that this assertion by the Accused was uncorroborated by any other evidence. Accordingly, it is merely a self-serving uncorroborated assertion on his part. The jacket had been left in the Accused’s car after their last door-knocking session on 23 May 2018. Hence, if they had already arranged to go for another door-knocking session on 1 June 2018, the Accused could have easily passed the jacket over to V on that day. There would have been no need for the Accused to go and look for V on 30 May 2018 and make her walk all the way from the office to his car in a multi-storey carpark just to collect her jacket.

#### Did V really struggle when she was on the Accused’s lap in the Sky Garden?

189    The Defence Counsel also attacked the credibility of V in that her evidence that she could not use her hands was illogical as that would a natural reaction. V had claimed that she did not drop the waffle while she was struggling and resisting because she did not see the use of doing that. The Defence also submitted that at the point that when the Accused had used one of his hands to touch V’s breast, she could have broken free.

190    I did not find V’s answer to be unbelievable. The Accused had already admitted in P8 to wrapping his hands around V’s body and that throughout the ordeal, he was holding her tightly. V corroborated this in court by demonstrating that the Accused’s hands were wrapped tightly around her arms such that she could not really use her hands to break free. Further, there is nothing to suggest that when the Accused had managed to use his hand to grope V’s breast that he had released his grip on V’s body. He could very well have continued to wrap tightly around V’s arms whilst his hand proceeded to go underneath V’s clothing to touch her breast.

## CONCLUSION ON THE ISSUE OF CONVICTION

191    In conclusion, I found that there was a preponderance of evidence to support the evidence of V that she has been molested by the Accused in the manner as set out in the charges. The main evidence in support of her evidence would be the Accused’s own admission in his police statement P8 and CCTV evidence of the lift incident.

192    This was a case where the Accused had taken advantage of a younger colleague who had given in to his sexual advancement earlier on. Even though the colleague had made it clear that she does not wish to have such a physical relationship with him, he proceeded to try his luck on 1 June 2018. This time round, the victim would have none of it and decided to report the matter to her superiors. When the Accused had denied even kissing her, she felt compelled to lodge a police report.

193    Accordingly, I found that the charges had been proven against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and found him guilty and convicted of all the three charges.

## THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE

### The Prosecution’s submissions

194    The Prosecution based on the sentencing framework laid down in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_), submitted for a global sentence of **14 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes** of the cane.

195    The Prosecution submitted on the facts of the present case, the starting point for the first charge should be on the higher end of Band 2 for the following reasons:

> (a)     High degree of sexual exploitation. The Accused had intruded into the victim’s private parts by groping her breast with skin to skin contact.

> (b)     There was an element of force and restraint when the Accused pulled the victim onto his lap and hugged her tightly. He had further tightened his grip when the victim tried to get up. The victim was effectively trapped and restrained.

> (c)     The victim had been traumatised by the event. This is evident from the distress shown when she was crying as she recounted the event to K.

196    The Prosecution thus submitted for a sentence of 12 months and 3 strokes for the first charge.

197    For the second charge on the lift incident, the Prosecution submitted that the facts fall within the middle of Band 1. This was because the degree of sexual exploitation was low in that the victim’s private parts were not intruded upon. Nonetheless, the Accused had persisted with his conduct despite V making clear that she did not consent to his acts. There was also an element of restraint as the Accused leaned in forcefully to kiss V whilst putting his arm across her to stop her from moving. The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for this charge.

198    Finally for the third charge, the Prosecution submitted that the facts fall within the middle of Band 2 as the Accused had similarly intruded upon the private parts of the victim. There was also an element of restraint in that it took place within a confined space of the vehicle. The Prosecution thus submitted for 12 months’ imprisonment but calibrated the sentence of caning to 1 stroke.

199    Prosecution submitted for the sentence of imprisonment for first two charges to run consecutively thus giving a global sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.

### The Defence’s submission on mitigation and sentencing

200    The Defence had asked for a global sentence of 6 months and one week’s imprisonment with no caning to be imposed.

201    It was submitted that the starting point for the first charge should be 7 months’ imprisonment and after calibration, adjusted to 6 months’ imprisonment. This sentence was submitted to be run consecutively with the proposed sentence of 1 week’s imprisonment for the 2nd charge. As for the 3rd charge, the Defence submitted that the starting point should be 6 months’ imprisonment and thereafter adjusted downwards to 5 months’ imprisonment.

202    It was submitted that the Accused only claimed trial on the issue of consent and did not deny that there was skin-to-skin contact. However, the physical contact only lasted for a few minutes and that there was no premeditation on the Accused’s part.

203    It was further submitted that there was no relationship of trust hence no abuse of such a relationship. On the issue of trauma, the Defence submitted that the Court should take into account the objective evidence of the CCTV evidence showing that the victim was not traumatised. It was also emphasised that the Accused did not use any force on the victim and that the victim had willingly followed him to his vehicle.

204    The Defence Counsel highlighted the difficult personal circumstances of the Accused. His father had passed away 2 weeks after the Accused was found guilty of the offences and the family was still grieving. He is also a father of 2 young girls, aged 6 and 4 years old. He is no longer in the insurance industry and was working as a Ninja Van driver. It was submitted that a long sentence would have a crushing effect on his family. Finally, testimonials on his good character were submitted on the Accused’s behalf.

### The Accused’s antecedent record

205    The Accused has no record of any previous convictions.

### The reasons for the sentence

206    It is common ground that the applicable sentencing framework for an offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code is that as laid down in the case of _Kunasekaran_. In _Kunasekaran_, the High Court held that the sentencing framework and principles laid down in _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> (“_GBR_”) for sentencing aggravated outrage of modesty offences under section 354(2) of the Penal Code offences are applicable to sentencing of outrage of modesty simpliciter cases under section 354(1) of the Penal Code save that the sentencing range should be calibrated downwards in view of the shorter maximum sentences prescribed for the less serious offence.

207    The indicative sentencing ranges for the two offences as set out in _Kunasekaran_ and _GBR_ are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.3%"> <col width="39.26%"> <col width="36.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Section 354(1)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Section 354(2)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 5 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 1 year</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5-15 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1-3 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15-24 months</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3-5 years</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

208    To identify the appropriate Band, _GBR_ held that the court should first consider the following offence-specific factors:

> (i)     The degree of sexual exploitation such as the part of the body touched and the duration;

> (ii)     The circumstances of the offence such as:

>> (a)       the presence of premeditation;

>> (b)       the use of force or violence;

>> (c)       the abuse of a position of trust;

>> (d)       the use of deception;

>> (e)       the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and

>> (f)       the exploitation of a vulnerable victim.; and

> (iii)     The harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological.

209    Based on the consideration of the abovementioned offence-specific factors, the court should then ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment:

> (i)      Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.

> (ii)      Band 2: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception.

> (iii)      Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence-specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.

210    After identifying the band in which the offence in question falls within and determining precisely where within that range the offence falls to derive the indicative starting point, the Court should then consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that relate to the offender to calibrate the appropriate sentence for the offender. Aggravating factors may include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance. Mitigating factors may include a timeous plea of guilt or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused that relates to the offence.

211    In the present case, I found that the offence for the first charge committed by the Accused fell clearly somewhere slightly above the midpoint of Band 2. There was persistence and some restraint on the part of the Accused when he continued to wrap his hands around V’s body tightly over her arms to prevent her from getting up when he committed the outrage of modesty. He also had intruded onto the sensitive and private part of V with skin to skin contact. The duration of the molest was not short. It was not a fleeting touch but the incident lasted for a few minutes.

212    As for the third charge, similarly there was skin to skin contact with a private part of the victim and the duration of the molest was not a mere fleeting touch. However, I found that this was less aggravating in that there was no evidence of any restraint carried out by the Accused albeit it was still committed within a confined space. Accordingly I would place the third charge offence as falling within the middle of Band 2.

213    As for the second charge, this would be the least aggravated offence in that there was no contact with a private part of the victim’s body. However, there was a sense of restraint in that V was trapped momentarily by the body of the Accused and his arm over her as she was pressed towards the side of the lift. There was also persistence in the conduct of the Accused in his kissing of the victim. I found that it would fall within the lower end of Band 1.

214    The High Court in _GBR_ also held that caning would nearly always be imposed for cases within Band 2 of at least three strokes of the cane (see \[33\] of _GBR_).

215    In terms of mitigation, I find that the Accused did not show any remorse by claiming trial and had thus put the victim through reliving the entire ordeal. V could be seen to be visibly distressed during periods of the trial where she had to recount the specific events which she found to be traumatic. She also had to undergo robust cross-examination over 3 days. Hence, there was no mitigating factor in favour of the Accused by virtue of a timeous plea of guilt present. I note however that the Accused to his credit did at least initially show some remorse by admitting candidly to having committed the acts on 1 June 2018 without any consent on the part of V in his first statement to the police.

216    I found that the rest of the mitigating factors raised by the Defence Counsel did not amount to much weight. It is trite law that personal hardship and even suffering inflicted upon the rest of the family would not carry any significant weight as these would be the inevitable consequence of committing an offence and getting punished for it. As for the personal testimonials about his good character, these are again not exceptional matters that can make a dent on what is otherwise an appropriate sentence.

217    For the first charge which is the most serious of the three charges, I would therefore peg it at 11 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane, after considering that there were no other significant aggravating and mitigating factors. I did not impose the full 3 strokes of the cane although that would be in line with _GBR_. This was because I had in mind that I would also be imposing one stroke for the third charge so had calibrated the number of strokes to two so as not to have a crushing effect on the Accused.

218    As for the second charge, I am of the view a short custodial sentence of one month would be sufficient. As for the third charge, I would impose a slightly shorter sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane to reflect the slightly less aggravating feature of this offence.

## CONCLUSION

219    By virtue of section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 68, I would have to order at least two terms of imprisonment to run consecutively. Given that this is the Accused’s first offence, I am of the view that there is no need to run all the three sentences consecutively and that by running the longest with the shortest terms of imprisonment, it would sufficiently satisfy the principle of general deterrence in this case.

220    Based on the overall criminality of the Accused and after applying the approach taken in _Kunasekaran_, I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.
