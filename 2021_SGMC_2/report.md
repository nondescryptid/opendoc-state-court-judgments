Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Protection from Harassment Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9889/2020/01.\]

6 January 2021

### District Judge Peter Lo:

1       The Accused, Lim Teck Guan, is a 44-year old Singapore citizen and was a property agent at the material time. The complainant was the Accused’s ex-girlfriend.

2       On the first day of trial, the Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge of unlawful stalking under s 7(1) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev. Ed.) (“the Act”):

> You,…are charged that you, between March 2018 and October 2018, in Singapore, did unlawfully stalk one \[C\] by engaging in a course of conduct which involved acts associated with stalking, _to wit_,

>> i.    setting up a ‘WeChat’ account impersonating \[C\] and posting compromising pictures of \[C\];

>> ii.    creating two ‘Instagram’ accounts impersonating \[C\] and posting compromising pictures of \[C\] including one picture which had a caption containing a sexual innuendo;

>> iii.   sending \[C\] multiple messages and emails containing threats and informing her that he was waiting for her and following her; and

>> iv.    trying to add \[C\] through ‘WeChat’ with an account bearing the username ‘I am still alive’, which caused distress to \[C\], and you did intend to cause distress to \[C\], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(6) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Chapter 256A, 2015 Rev. Ed.).

3       After having considered the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 5 months. The Accused has filed an appeal and these are the grounds for my decision.

## Statement of Facts

4       A summary of the facts as contained in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”), which the Accused has admitted to without qualification, are set out as follows.

5       The Accused, who was previously in a relationship with \[C\] (the “complainant”), was unhappy about their breakup in March 2018. From March 2018 to October 2018, the Accused stalked the complainant by intentionally engaging in the following course of conduct to get the complainant’s attention (referred to as the “First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Harassing Acts” respectively):

> (a)     On 20 March 2018, following the breakup, the Accused set up an account on “WeChat” to impersonate the complainant. He posted compromising pictures of the complainant, including a cropped picture of the Accused and the complainant topless in bed (without showing the complainant’s breasts). The Accused included captions such as “she loves to sleep with married men” and “slut who sleeps around” and posted a list of the complainant’s friends, threatening to add them to this account to access the photographs. He also made the WeChat username searchable. The Accused eventually took down these photographs when the complainant pleaded with him to do so.

> (b)     In mid-June 2018, the Accused perceived that the complainant was in a relationship with another person and threatened her by sending the following messages to her:

>> (i)        _“once I found out who u going to die…I’ll make sure u disappear…Fucking bitch…Treat me like a pest…U will regret…Fuck u”_

>> (ii)        _“by tonite I want to see a video showing u use hammer to smash up the speakers and earrings I bought…otherwise I’ll harass the consultants in the list…I’ll make sure u get sacked by MOHH…That’s the sweetest revenge for your arrogance and stupidity…Fuck u BITCH…I’ll find out who the guy…Fucking BITCH…You come back u will see blood”._

> The Accused did not carry out these threats.

> (c)     In July 2018, the Accused emailed the complainant stating that he had waited for her for many hours at the airport in end June 2018 and had waited to see her during lunch time at her work place many times, expressing his regrets and sincerity to resolve any misunderstandings between them.

> (d)     Between 28 July 2018 and 2 August 2018, the Accused set up three Instagram accounts with usernames impersonating the complainant and used these Instagram accounts to harass the complainant:

>> (i)       On the first Instagram account (“the First Instagram Account”), he posted compromising photos of the complainant, including the same topless photo referred to in paragraph 5(a) above, with a caption _“Want to see more? PM me at WeChat”_. He also posted a photo of the back of a lady in her undergarments (not the complainant) and a photo of the contact list of the complainant’s associates and colleagues. He identified the complainant’s occupation and place of work and included a link to the WeChat account in the profile. The profile of the First Instagram Account was public for a period of time. After the profile was subsequently made private, the Accused sent follower requests to various other accounts. At one point, the First Instagram Account had 45 followers with access to the photos and was following more than 600 accounts, all of which would have received a notification from the First Instagram Account and a link to it.

>> (ii)       When the First Instagram Account became inaccessible, the Accused opened a second Instagram account (“the Second Instagram Account”) which was made public, but he did not post anything under this account.

>> (iii)       When the Second Instagram Account became inaccessible, the Accused opened a third Instagram account (“the Third Instagram Account”) and posted compromising photos of the complainant. This account was public. On 2 August 2018 at about 9.15pm, the complainant called the Accused saying that she had made a police report and told him to “stop what you are doing otherwise I will take action against you”. The Accused maintained the account and continued garnering followers out of anger as the complainant hung up the call after he replied “you could have prevented all these” and refused to engage him. He decided to remove the photos in the early hours of 3 August 2018.

> (e)     In early October 2018, the Accused attempted to add the complainant through WeChat with the username “I am still alive” (with a profile picture stating “You left like I was never a reason to stay”). He sent about 4 to 5 messages stating his intention to resolve their misunderstandings. The complainant did not reply and blocked him from WeChat 2 days later.

6       As a result of these actions, the complainant’s reputation had been damaged as her colleagues, friends and strangers had seen her compromising photos. She has also been approached by colleagues and friends concerning the matter.

7       In 2019, the Accused attempted to contact the complainant’s ex-boyfriend who was in Shanghai through the “_Douban_” messaging platform. The Accused asked the ex-boyfriend, who was still in contact with the complainant’s mother, to consider telling her about what the Accused perceived was the bad influence of the complainant’s long-time classmate. The Accused had this perception because the long-time classmate was gay.

## Prescribed Penalties

8       The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 7(1) of the Act was a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.

## Antecedents

9       The Accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

10     The Prosecution referred to the sentencing framework as set out in the three-Judge High Court decision of _Lee Shing Chan v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 41</span> (“_Lee Shing Chan_”) and submitted the present offence should be classified as moderate harm and medium culpability under that framework.

11     The Prosecution further submitted that the present case fell within the higher end of the 4+ to 6 month’s imprisonment term indicated under the sentencing framework in _Lee Shing Chan_ and that a sentence of an imprisonment term of 6 months was warranted.

12     With regard to aggravating factors, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused had carried out the Fifth Harassing Act and reached out to the complainant’s ex-boyfriend in 2019 even after the complainant had informed the Accused on 2 August 2018 that she had lodged a police report. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused demonstrated a lack of remorse by not only persisting with his course of conduct after he was informed about the police report, but had widened it to initiate contact with third parties related to the complainant.

13     The Prosecution also submitted that the protracted course of conduct by the Accused demonstrated that even after he had apologised after one instance, he did not stop. The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused’s message to the complainant stating “I want you to remember me as what I am, not the monster you have created” showed that the Accused blamed everyone for his actions except himself.

14     The Prosecution submitted that the only applicable mitigating factor was that the Accused had pleaded guilty. However, any sentencing discount that may have applied would be offset by the Accused’s evident lack of remorse in continuing with the harassment even after a police report was lodged.

## Mitigation & Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

15     The Accused raised the following in his mitigation plea:

> (a)      **No nudity** – the Accused stated that he had not posted any nude photographs of the complainant and had exercised restraint and had limited the harm caused to the complainant.

> (b)      **Full Co-operation with Investigations** – the Accused stated that he had rendered full cooperation with the police and admitted to all the evidence presented to him, which was he submitted was a clear indication of remorse.

> (c)      **No Antecedents** – the Accused highlighted that he had no antecedents and has a clean criminal record.

> (d)      **Impact on Employment** - the Accused submitted that a criminal conviction may cause him to lose his license to practise as a real estate salesperson. He would also face the risk of losing his food stall business which he had recently started.

> (e)      **Good Character** – the Accused submitted that he is a helpful, reliable and honest person and submitted testimonials from his friends, former NS Commanding Officer, colleague and clients in support.

> (f)      **Regret and Remorse** – the Accused submitted that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest time. He submitted he was genuinely remorseful and was determined not to reoffend again.

> (g)      **Offer of Apology** – the Accused submitted that he had repeatedly apologised to the complainant through email and Instagram since end June 2018, and two apology letters dated 18 October 2019 and 27 December 2019 through his previous defence counsels. He requested the complainant’s ex-flatmate to forward an apology message to her in November 2018 and sent two typewritten apology letters to the complainant.

16     In his mitigation plea, the Accused also referred to the sentencing framework in _Lee Shing Chan_ and submitted that there was slight harm and “moderate” (which I take to mean “medium”) culpability in the present case. As such, he submitted that the applicable indicative sentencing range would be a short custodial sentence of up to 4 months[^1].

17     The Accused also stated in his mitigation plea that a community-based sentence in the form of a short detention order should be imposed on him. He submitted that given the lack of nudity in the compromising photographs and the remorse that he had shown in his sincere apologies to her and in taking down the said photographs, the consideration of deterrence should not trump those of rehabilitation in his case. Alternatively, a fine of $5,000 should be imposed.

## Issues to be determined

18     The issue before the court was what the appropriate sentencing option and sentence was in the present case.

## The Applicable Law

19     In _Lee Shing Chan_ at \[35\], the court set out the following sentencing framework for unlawful stalking cases under s7 of the Act.

> (a)     Identify the level of harm caused by the offence (slight, moderate or severe) and level of culpability (low, medium or high), having regard to the offence-specific factors.

> (b)     Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range by reference to the following matrix.

![]([2021] SGMC 0002_Image/[2021] SGMC 0002_image1.png)

> (c)     Identify the appropriate starting point within that range, having regard again to the offence-specific factors

> (d)     Adjust the starting point based on offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors.

> (e)     Where an offender has been convicted of multiple charges, consider whether further adjustments are necessary to take into account the totality principle.

20     The non-exhaustive list of offence-specific factors referred to in paragraphs 19(a) and 19(c) above were set out in _Lee Shing Chan_ at \[36\] and reproduced below:

22     I have applied the above framework to the facts of the present case as follows.

## Harm Caused

23     As mentioned above, the Prosecution submitted that the present case was one which was classified as moderate harm whilst the Accused submitted that it should be classified as slight harm instead.

24     With regard to the type and extent of harm caused to the complainant, it is noted that the Accused had posted compromising photographs of the complainant on WeChat and Instagram which bore usernames that impersonated the complainant. Whilst the photographs did not involve explicit nudity (in that it did not show the complainant’s breasts), it showed the complainant topless in bed with the Accused together with captions containing sexual innuendos. On top of making these photographs publicly accessible, the Accused had identified the complainant’s occupation and place of work, sent follower requests to other accounts and posted a photograph of a contact list of the complainant’s associates and colleagues. As a result, the complainant’s reputation was damaged as her colleagues, friends and strangers had seen these photographs and she had even been approached by her colleagues and friends regarding this matter.

25     The Accused had also caused the complaint distress by sending threats to her on WeChat in mid-June 2018. Even though these threats were eventually not carried out, the nature and content of these threats (being threats on her life, threats to get her dismissed from her job and threats to harass her colleagues) would have caused the complainant significant alarm and distress.

26     The harm caused by the Accused’s actions was not limited only to the complainant but had also extended to third parties. As noted earlier, the Accused had posted a contact list of the complainant’s associates and colleagues on Instagram which was publicly accessible for a period of time. In doing so, the Accused had needlessly exposed such personal information just so that he could get a reaction from the complainant and caused harm to the complainant’s associates and colleagues as a result. The Accused’s actions also reached the complainant’s ex-boyfriend when he requested the complainant’s ex-boyfriend to consider telling the complainant’s mother about what he perceived to be a negative influence on the complainant by her long-time classmate.

27     In light of the above, I agree with the Prosecution that the present case should be classified as moderate harm under the sentencing framework in _Lee Shing Chan_.

## Culpability

28     Next, I have examined the level of culpability on the part of the Accused based on the factors set out in _Lee Shing Chan_. As mentioned above, both the Prosecution and Accused submitted that the present case was one which should be classified as medium culpability.

29     With regard to the Accused’s _mens rea_, I note that in the present case, the Accused had engaged in a course of conduct that was intended to cause distress to the complainant. This would be contrasted with the _mens rea_ of "knowing or ought reasonably to have known that the course of conduct was likely to cause distress”, which would arguably be less serious.

30     With regards to the Accused’s motive, he submitted that his initial intentions were to compel the complainant to reopen communication channels with him. Even though the Accused submitted that he was blinded by a desire for closure and was unable to accept the abrupt end of his relationship with the complainant[^2], this only went to show that the Accused had committed the offence out of self-interest.

31     With regard to the degree of premeditation, planning or sophistication, the Accused conceded in his mitigation plea that there was some amount of planning in the present case[^3]. With regard to the First and Fourth Harassing Acts, it would have taken some degree of planning and premeditation to set up the WeChat and Instagram accounts to impersonate the complainant, make the posts, sending follower requests to other accounts and posting a contact list of the complainant’s associates and colleagues. It was further noted that in the Third Harassing Act, the Accused had informed the complainant that he had waited for her for many hours at the airport and waited to see her during lunch time at her work place many times which would have involved premeditation and planning.

32     With regard to the course of conduct by the Accused, I have considered that five Harassing Acts were carried out by the Accused over a period of eight months from March to October 2018. In this regard, even though it could be said that there were breaks between each of these Acts, I agree with the Prosecution that this had spanned a significant period of time during which the Accused would have disrupted the complainant’s professional and personal life.

33     It bears mention that the Accused was only able to gain the compromising photographs of himself and the complainant because of their prior intimate relationship. Despite his continued proclamations to have the complainant’s interests at heart, he had abused the complainant’s trust in him by posting these photographs on a publicly accessible platform.

34     All things considered, I agree with the Prosecution and the Accused that the present case should be classified as medium culpability.

## Indicative Sentencing Range & Appropriate Starting Point

35     Since I have found the present case to be classified as moderate harm and medium culpability, under the framework in _Lee Shing Chan_, the indicative sentencing range would be 4+ to 6 months.

36     In my view, the custodial threshold was clearly crossed in the present case. This was also acknowledged by the Accused in his mitigation plea:

> 59    In the light of creating Instagram accounts to impersonate the Complainant and posting her compromising photographs (without nudity) with sexual innuendo on the social media (Instagram), where unknown parties could have seen the photographs, the custodial threshold may in principle be crossed…

37     After having considered the offence-specific factors as set out in paragraphs 23 to 34 above, I was of the view that the appropriate starting point was an imprisonment term of 5 months.

## Aggravating Factors

38     With regard to the aggravating factors, I agree with the Prosecution that the fact that the Accused’s continued harassing conduct even after he had been informed that a police report had been made against him demonstrated a lack of remorse. Not only did the Accused not cease his conduct after the police report was made, he went on to carry out the Fourth Harassing Act and contacted the complainant’s ex-boyfriend.

## Mitigating Factors

39     With regard to the Accused’s submission on cooperation with the police, there was nothing before me that showed the degree or extent of cooperation such as to merit any significant sentencing discount. However, I accepted that there could be some mitigating value (although slight) after having considered the Accused’s submission that he had “been entirely candid during police interviews and admitted to all the evidence presented to him”.

40     With regard to the Accused’s submission on the emotional and mental stress which he says he suffered from, I find that this to be of little, if any mitigating value. The Accused submitted that he was “shocked and devastated” at the complainant’s “sudden decision to break up”. Whilst this could possibly have explained the First Harassing Act on 20 March 2018, it would not explain the subsequent Harassing Acts that took place in the months that followed, right until October 2018. It seemed to me that the situation of stress faced by the Accused was unexceptional. Further, the Accused’s submission on having to take care of his elderly mother-in-law did not seem related to the commission of the offence. Finally, the Accused’s submission that he let his anger take control of him was not a mitigating factor in the circumstances of the present case.

41     With regard to the Accused’s submissions on the impact to his employment, I find this was a natural consequence of his own acts and should be accorded little weight in mitigation.

42     With regard to the Accused’s submissions on his attempts at apologising to the complainant, I did not find this to be of significant mitigation value. The apologies sent in 2018 did not appear to convey any sense of remorse whilst those in 2019 appeared to be motivated, not from a genuine sense of remorse but because the police had already become involved and the Accused had been informed of the Prosecution’s sentencing position.

43     I find that the only mitigating factor that should be given some weight would be the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty on the first day of trial. I can accept that this would have spared the complainant the need to testify and saving court resources. However, I also note that the plea of guilt was only entered after multiple pre-trial conferences.

44     After considering the aggravating and mitigating factors in the present case, I was of the view that that no further adjustment to the appropriate starting point of 5 months imprisonment was required.

## Community Based Sentencing

45     I had considered the Accused’s submissions that a community sentence in the form of a short detention order would be appropriate. I have also considered his promises to never reoffend, his submissions that his offence was out of character due to the sudden loss of affection from the complainant and that a custodial sentence would cause him to risk losing his estate agent license and food business.

46     The following paragraph in Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_, 2nd Ed at 32.097 would be relevant:

> A short detention order of 14 days would be manifestly inadequate if an imprisonment term of four or more weeks would otherwise have been called for: _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> at \[17\]

47     In _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span>, in upholding the sentence of a 10-day short detention order, See J stated at \[17\] that he “might have been more readily persuaded otherwise if the facts at hand had warranted a much lengthier term of imprisonment – say, exceeding four weeks.”

48     I have also considered that the indicative sentencing range in the present case was 4+ to 6 months. The Accused’s submissions indicated a sentence of a term imprisonment of up to 4 months.

49     I have also considered the following paragraph in Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_, 2nd Ed at 32.097:

> …hardship to the offender or his family is not normally taken into account in sentencing as some degree of suffering is to be regarded as a normal concomitant of imprisonment…Neither is loss of employment a factor typically taken into account in sentencing…

50     I agree with the Prosecution’s submissions that the Accused has not raised any exceptional circumstances to show why rehabilitation should trump deterrence in the present case. I also agree with the prosecution that the Accused has not demonstrated a strong propensity for reform.

51     In light of the circumstances, I was of the view that a short detention order of up to 14 days would not have been an appropriate sentencing option.

## Conclusion

52     After having considered that the present matter should be classified as moderate harm and medium culpability under the sentencing framework in _Lee Shing Chan_, the applicable aggravating factors and mitigating factors and the case authorities cited to me, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in the present case would be an imprisonment term of 5 months and sentenced the Accused accordingly.
