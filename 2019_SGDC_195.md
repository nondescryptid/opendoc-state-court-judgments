23 September 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused claimed trial to one charge under s 420 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 (‘PC”) (‘the cheating charge”). He was alleged to have cheated one Mdm Oh Ai Cheng (‘Mdm Oh”) by deceiving her into believing that he would transfer ownership of motor car registration number EV 7362J to her name, when he knew this was false. As a result of the deception, Mdm Oh was dishonestly induced into delivering S$13,830/- to him.

2       One charge under s 5A(3) of the Immigration Act, Cap 133 (“IA”) (“the immigration charge”) was stood down. The Accused had indicated that he would plead guilty to it at the conclusion of the trial of the cheating charge.

3       At the end of the trial, I convicted the Accused on the cheating charge. After considering the respective parties’ submissions, I sentenced him to 16 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused then pleaded guilty to the immigration charge which was stood down. He admitted that he had failed to present his passport to an immigration officer for examination at the Woodlands Checkpoint when he was leaving Singapore for Malaysia on 11 Jul 15. I sentenced him to six weeks’ imprisonment.

5       I ordered both sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively, making the total aggregate sentence 16 months’ and six weeks’ imprisonment.

6       The Accused has appealed against the conviction and sentence for the cheating charge only.

## THE TRIAL

## The Case for the Prosecution

7       The Prosecution’s case, led by DPP Stacey Fernandez, was that the Accused had cheated Mdm Oh by deceiving her into believing that he would transfer ownership of a car bearing registration number EV7362J (“the car”) to her name, a fact he knew to be false. By that deception, he had dishonestly induced Mdm Oh into delivering $13,830 to him. To establish her case. DPP Fernandez relied on the oral evidence of Mdm Oh and one Tan Chet Joo (“Tan”), who was the registered sole proprietor of M/s Ditar Motor Trading (“DMT”), and various documentary evidence which corroborated their oral evidence.

8       Mdm Oh testified that sometime in September 2001, she went to DMT located at Woodlands Street 13, Blk 326, #01-119 to purchase the car. There, she met the accused, who had introduced himself as the boss of DMT. The Accused had also represented to Mdm Oh that he could transfer ownership of the car to her. Relying on this representation, Mdm Oh handed the accused $13,830 in cheques made payable to DMT and cash. She used the car until 8 February 2002, when it went missing from where she had last parked it. She later learnt that a finance company, Swee Seng Credit Pte Ltd (“SSC”) had taken possession of the car. She also learnt that the ownership of the car had not been transferred to her name. Mdm Oh paid $7,548 to SSC on 25 March 2002 for the ownership of the car to be transferred to her name. Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) records showed that the registered owner of the car in September 2001 was SSC, and not DMT.

9       Tan testified that in July 2011, the accused had asked him to register DMT as a sole proprietorship in his name. This was because the accused was a bankrupt at the time. The accused brought him to United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) to open a bank account for DMT. Tan testified that his actual role in DMT was limited to washing and cleaning the cars sold by DMT. He had no involvement in the business end. He said that the accused handled all the business operations of DMT, which included dealing with customers.

## The Case for the Defence

10     Mr Jayakumar, for the Accused, led evidence that DMT’s business model was to purchase cars with expiring certificate of entitlement (“COE”), revalidate them, and then sell the cars. In the event it did not have sufficient funds, it borrowed from credit companies such as SSC to renew the COE using what was known as a floor stock financing, also known as a short term loan. This was the manner in which the car was acquired by DMT.

11     DMT acquired the car in June 2001. Its COE was expiring on 31 Aug 01. The Accused arranged for a floor stock financing with SSC in order to renew the COE for five years. According to the Accused, this was done after he had obtained Tan’s approval. According to the Accused, the ownership of the car was transferred to SSC because this was a requirement under the floor stock financing and it was the usual industrial practice. However, he said that this did not affect DMT’s ability to sell the car.

12     The Accused’s defence was essentially that Mdm Oh had been told that she needed to settle the COE renewal portion with SSC. And he had also told her that she would need to sign a short term loan agreement because the COE had been renewed.

## THE ISSUES

13     The three issues for determination –

> (i)     Whether the Accused had deceived Mdm Oh into believing that he could transfer the car’s ownership to her;

> (ii)     Whether Mdm Oh was induced to deliver $13,830 to the Accused by manner of the deception;

> (iii)     Whether the Accused had a dishonest intention when he made the false representation to Mdm Oh.

## THE COURT’S FINDINGS

## Did the Accused deceive Mdm Oh into believing that he could transfer the car’s ownership to her?

14     The Accused’s case was that he had sold the car to Mdm Oh for $13,500. In his examination-in-chief, he said he had told her that he had renewed the COE for another five years at a cost of $9,222[^1]. As such, she had to sign a short-term loan agreement with DMT in relation to the $9,222[^2]. According to the Accused, Mdm Oh had then done some calculations to decide whether to get a loan to pay the $9,222 or pay in cash[^3]. These calculations were written on page two of Exhibit P2, below the DMT stamp. After she had done the calculations, she had asked for some time to make her decision. He claimed that she repeatedly sought further delays each time he brought the matter up[^4].

15     Mdm Oh testified that in her discussions with the Accused, she was told of the various cost components; the price of the car was $13,500, the deposit was $300, the insurance was $544 and registration of the vehicle in Mdm Oh’s name was $86. The breakdown was written down by the Accused on the second page of Exhibit P2. The total price that she had agreed to pay for the car was $13,830.

16     It was pertinent to note that the registration of the vehicle in Mdm Oh’s name was written by the Accused as “ROV”. When asked, the Accused had agreed that “ROV” referred to the fee for the transfer of name of the car to Mdm Oh’s[^5].

17     Mdm Oh testified that she was made to understand that upon making payment of $13,830, she would get possession of the car[^6]. She did not say that the Accused had informed her that she had to enter into a short term loan agreement for the renewed COE portion. Pertinently, she was not cross-examined on this issue by Mr Jayakumar.

18     Subsequently, on 16 Sep 01, Mdm Oh and the Accused signed the agreement to buy the car (Exhibit P5). After taking possession of the car, she called the Accused several times to ask if the transfer of ownership had been effected. The Accused then asked her to hand him her NRIC to do the transfer of ownership[^7]. Subsequently, her NRIC was returned to her by the Accused with a sticker pasted on it. The car’s registration numbers ‘EV7362’ was written on the sticker (Exhibit P6)[^8]. After that, Mdm Oh did not receive any further document in relation to the transfer of ownership.

19     The LTA record (Exhibit P16) confirmed that SSC was the registered owner of the car from 15 Aug 01 to 1 Apr 02. The Accused admitted that he knew this[^9]. Therefore, he knew that DMT could not transfer ownership of the car to Mdm Oh. That was why the question whether he had informed Mdm Oh that she had to sign a short term loan agreement with SSC for the renewed COE became significant. This was because, if the accused’s version was believed, it would negate the element that he had led Mdm Oh into believing that he could transfer the car to her. However, I found that the evidence did not support the Accused’s version that he had told her.

20     I agreed with DPP Fernandez that it was a bare assertion without any documentary evidence to support it. The Accused’s reliance on the handwritten entries at the bottom of Exhibit P2 made by Mdm Oh as supporting his assertion was misplaced. If indeed these entries were in connection to the renewed COE, then the figure written down should have been ‘9,222’ which was the sum paid for the renewed COE, and not ‘10,000’. The Accused’s explanation that ‘10,000’ was written down because it was easier to calculate simply made no sense. Firstly, this was because there was a difference in the cost of borrowing $10,000 compared to $9,222. Secondly, I found Mdm Oh’s explanation for making the entries internally and externally consistent. The ‘10,000’ she had written at the bottom of page 2 of Exhibit P2 was consistent with the figure ‘10,000’ written by the Accused at the top of the same page. She explained that the ‘10,000’ written by the Accused represented the amount left after deducting the $300 deposit from the price of the car. She had then done a calculation to find out the cost of getting a loan of ‘10,000’. That led to the entries at the bottom of the page. She did this in order to make a decision whether to pay the $10,000 in cash or to take a loan. Her explanation was more cogent than the Accused’s ‘easier to calculate’ explanation.

21     Exhibit P5, which was the sale and purchase agreement, was also inconsistent the Accused’s defence. Exhibit P5 clearly showed that the agreed price was $13,500, that a deposit of $3500 was paid, and that the balance payable was $10,000. Of more significance, Exhibit P5 also stated that there was no outstanding amount due to the finance company.

22     It was patently clear that the Accused’s story that he had told Mdm Oh about the need to enter into a short term loan agreement to effect the transfer of the car was critical to his defence. As DPP Fernandez put it, it was at the very heart of the cheating allegation. However, this critical aspect of the defence was never put to Mdm Oh during her cross-examination. The assertion only surfaced for the first time when the Accused took the stand. Despite being asked several times why it was never put to Mdm Oh, the Accused had failed to provide a good reason for the omission. The only conclusion that I could draw was that the story that he had informed Mdm Oh about the short term loan agreement was not true; it was an afterthought.

23     The Accused’s vacillating evidence in respect to what he had said to Mdm Oh regarding the short term loan agreement further fortified this conclusion. The first time the short term loan agreement came up was during the Accused’s examination-in-chief. He said that he had told Mdm Oh that she “_must sign the short-term agreement with \[him\] after 2 weeks_”, and he said Mdm Oh had replied “_Okay_”. When he reminded her about it, she kept asking for extensions of time.[^10]. The second time the subject was raised was during the Accused’s cross-examination the next day. When asked about why it was not put to Mdm Oh that he had told her about the short term loan agreement, his answer was that the agreement had “_nothing to do with \[Mdm Oh\]. Because this is \[his\] loan that he borrowed…What has it to do with Mdm Oh_”[^11]. A few questions later, his version changed yet again. He said that he had told her “_if she wanted to buy the 5 year COE, \[he said\] that \[he\] had already borrowed from Swee Seng---therefore, \[she\] had to go down to Swee Seng to settle…If she needed the loan, she had to sign the agreement. She \[could\] also come to \[DMT\] to sign the agreement. She knew of this_”[^12].

24     For the reasons set out in \[20\] to \[23\], I found that the Accused’s evidence on this issue was not credible. I therefore rejected his defence that he had told Mdm Oh that she had to sign a short term loan agreement in order to effect the transfer of ownership of the car to her. I found that the Accused had deliberately omitted to inform her that SSC has ownership of the car. He did this with intent to deceive her into believing that DMT has ownership, and that therefore he could transfer the ownership to her.

25     On the other hand, Mdm Oh’s evidence was cogent and consistent. They were supported by the documentary evidence before me. She was not told nor was she aware that DMT had taken a loan from SSC to renew the COE. She did not know that DMT was not the owner of the car when she signed the sale and purchase agreement.

## Was Mdm Oh induced to deliver $13,830 to the Accused as a result of his deception?

26     Mdm Oh paid the Accused the sum of $13,830 by way of cheques payable to DMT and in cash. She made these payments relying on the Accused’s representation to her that he could sell her the car, and his assurances that the car would be transferred to her. Her conduct after taking possession of the car was consistent with this state of mind. As already set out in \[18\] above, after taking possession of the car, she had called the Accused several times to ask if the transfer of ownership had been effected. The Accused had then asked her to hand him her NRIC to do the transfer of ownership. Subsequently, her NRIC was returned to her by the Accused with a sticker pasted on it. The car’s registration numbers ‘EV7362’ was written on the sticker (Exhibit P6). I inferred from this evidence that the Accused had done this in order to placate her and to lull her into believing that the transfer of ownership was being processed or that it has been done.

## Did the Accused act with dishonesty?

27     The Accused had deceived Mdm Oh into believing that he could transfer the car ownership to her. I agreed with DPP Fernandez that the only plausible reason for doing this was that he had intended to cause wrongful loss[^13] to Mdm Oh, by inducing her into handing $13,830 to him. After the money was handed over, he did not transfer the ownership to her. Instead he tried to conceal his dishonest intent by giving the impression that he was in the process of transferring ownership by asking her to hand her NRIC to him, and then returning it to her pasted with a sticker with the car’s registration numbers written on it.

## Was the Accused the Boss of DMT?

28     One aspect of the defence was that the Accused alleged that Tan, not him, was the boss of DMT. Tan was the registered sole proprietor, and he had full control of the business. He also had sole access to the company’s UOB account. This was to give the lie that he had no access and control of the $13,830 which was paid by Mdm Oh into DMT’s account.

29     Tan refuted the Accused’s claims. He said that the Accused had instructed him to register DMT in his name on 4 Jul 01, and set up the UOB account for DMT[^14]. Tan was asked to do these things because the Accused was a bankrupt at the time. Tan said that the Accused handled “_everything_” in relation to DMT[^15]. Tan’s involvement with DMT was to help clean cars on the Accused’s instructions, and for which he received a stipend[^16]. The Accused also handled applications to revalidate the COE. He would sign on these applications. Tan confirmed that the signatures in Exhibit P18, which were applications to revalidate COE, were appended by the Accused.

30     Tan also testified that the Accused handled all matters concerning DMT’s finances. He was authorised to make withdrawals from the UOB account[^17]. He held the cheque books, and he issued cheques on behalf of DMT[^18].

31     Tan maintained his evidence during cross-examination. He repeated that the Accused was his “boss”. He also pointed out that the name of the company, Ditar Motor Trading, was chosen by the Accused himself. It was pertinent to note that the Accused also went by the name “Ditar Hong”, as evidenced by his name card which was handed to Mdm Oh (Exhibit P1).

32     I found Tan’s evidence to be consistent and credible. The Accused’s submission that he bore a grudge against the Accused, and therefore his evidence should be disregarded, has no merit. His evidence was corroborated by Mdm Oh in that Mdm Oh had testified that the Accused had introduced himself as the boss of DMT and given her his name card (Exhibit P1)[^19]. He had told her that he was the car dealer. She had dealt with him the whole time. Mdm Oh also testified that she had seen the Accused instructing a male Chinese who was “_tall, skinny_” to touch up the car before it was handed over to her[^20]. Lastly, it was inconceivable that Tan would have used the Accused’s name for his company.

33     On the Accused’s side, I found his story in relation to Tan being the boss of DMT to be filled with inconsistencies. The most significant and telling inconsistency was when he testified on the signatures that appeared in Exhibit 18, the revalidation of COE forms. Initially, he testified that he had never said that Tan had signed Exhibit P18. This was because he claimed that he had never seen Exhibit P18[^21] before the trial. He maintained this stand despite the fact that Mr Jayakumar had put to Tan two days before that the signatures were appended by Tan. Later on in the course of the cross-examination, the Accused said that he “_had never seen \[Exhibit P18\] before”_[^22], yet he “_thought Mr Tan had signed on this_”[^23].

34     Lastly, when it was highlighted to him that the signatures in Exhibit P18 were very similar to those which had been signed by him in Exhibits P3, P4 and P5, he disagreed and obtusely insisted that they did not look similar. When pressed, he said that “_\[he was\] not a professional_”[^24]. A visual examination showed that the signatures in all these exhibits looked similar. As DPP Fernandez submitted, and I agreed, the Accused “_was trying to distance himself from his true involvement in \[DMT\]_”.

35     I found that on the evidence, the Accused was the operating mind and will of DMT. He was the boss of DMT. I believed Tan when he said that he was just the sole proprietor in name only. His role was non-existent save to clean and touch up the cars before they were delivered to the clients. This being the case, apart from causing wrongful loss to Mdm Oh, the Accused had also made a wrongful gain when he received the $13,830 from Mdm Oh pursuant to his deception on her.

36     For the reasons set out above, I was satisfied that DPP Fernandez had proven her case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

## Undue Delay In Prosecution

37     On the issue of undue delay in prosecution, Mr Jayakumar said that the Accused had been prejudiced as he was unable to avail himself of documents which would otherwise have supported his defence. I noted that factually, there was a delay of some 14 years from the lodging of the police report in February 2002 to the start of investigations after the Accused was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint in 2015. The question was whether the delay had prejudiced the Accused in his defence to the charge.

38     I did not find that there was prejudice to the Accused. His defence revolved around the oral communications which he had allegedly made to Mdm Oh concerning the need for her to sign a short term agreement for the renewed COE for the transfer of ownership. As this was an oral communication, there would be no documentary evidence. This put Mr Jayakumar’s submission that he was unable to avail himself of documents which would otherwise have supported his defence to bed. Also there was ample documentary evidence in connection to the case and which had been admitted. They showed the contrary was true; that there was no such oral communication made.

## THE ACCUSED’S ANTECEDENTS

39     In 1992, the Accused was convicted on four counts of cheating under s 420 PC and two counts of abetment of cheating under s 420 read with s 109 PC. The breakdown was as follows -

> (\* denotes consecutive sentences)

40     The total aggregate sentence was three years and six months’ imprisonment. Seven s 420 PC charges, six s 420 read with s 109 PC charges and one charge under s 6(1) of the Unlicensed Second Hand Dealers Act, Cap 288, were taken into consideration.

## SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

41     On the cheating charge, DPP Fernandez submitted for a sentence of one year six months’ to two years’ imprisonment for the following reasons –

> (a)     He was traced for cheating offences in 1988, 1990 and 1992. He was sentenced to a substantial total sentence of three years’ six months’ imprisonment.

> (b)     The present offence was planned and premeditated.

> (c)     He caused substantial loss to the victim and personally benefited.

> (d)     He spun a fanciful defence during the trial.

> (e)     A slight uplift was warranted from the sentencing precedents.

## MITIGATION PLEA

42     Mr Jayakumar highlighted that the Accused was an undischarged bankrupt in 1998 to 2017. He was married and has a 12 years’ old daughter. He was the sole bread winner and he worked freelance, selling scrap materials for recycling. He suffered from high blood pressure and rheumatism and required regular medication. He also has pain in his leg arising from an injury suffered in an accident. Mr Jayakumar asked me to consider that the antecedents were some 27 years old. Other than that, he had stayed out of trouble.

43     On account of the above mitigating factors, Mr Jayakumar asked for a sentence of two months’ imprisonment.

## THE SENTENCE

44     The offence was a planned and premeditated one. This was an aggravating factor. The Accused had deceived Mdm Oh by dishonestly concealing from her the fact that he could not transfer the car to her. She had bought the car because of the deception. He then made her believe that the transfer was in the process when he asked for her NRIC, and then returned it with a sticker with the car’s registration number pasted on the NRIC. This was a ruse to deceive her into continuing to believe that he was going to transfer the car to her.

45     By virtue of his deception, Mdm Oh handed over $13,830 to DMT. That was the amount that he had wrongfully gained. However, I noted that the actual loss to Mdm Oh was only $7,548, which was the amount she paid to SSC to effect the transfer of ownership to her. This was because the car had been delivered to her. When calibrating the sentence, this has to be taken into account.

46     The Accused’s defence rested on two main planks. The first was that he had told Mdm Oh that she had to sign the short term loan agreement in order for the car to be transferred to her. In other words, Mdm Oh knew that he could not transfer the car to her name. The second was that Tan was the boss of DMT and that the Accused had no access to DMT’s UOB account. Therefore, he could not have benefitted. Not only were these defences against the weight of the evidence, but the Accused’s defences were exposed as fanciful, and was nothing more than a sham. I accepted DPP Fernandez’s submission that the manner in which the Accused had run his defence ie, based on lies and afterthoughts, was relevant in sentencing as an aggravating factor.

47     The Accused was not a first offender. He has similar antecedents. Mr Jayakumar’s submission that the antecedents were committed 27 years ago was off the mark. The conviction was in 1992. The present offence was committed in 2001. There was a hiatus of only nine years, and not 27 years. He has not learned his lesson from his conviction and his substantial incarceration. These considerations meant that an uplift from the sentencing norm was warranted. To compound his recalcitrance, there was a singular lack of remorse. Instead of mitigating, he had continued to assert and maintain his sham defence.

48     The cases cited by DPP Fernandez showed that for amounts similar to that in the present case, the sentences have ranged from eight to 12 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the case of _Selvarajoo s/o Malayappan Krishsamy v PP (“Selvarajoo”)[^25]_ was particularly instructive. In this case, the Accused had claimed trial. The amount cheated was $14,000. In sentencing the accused, the trial judge took into account that the Accused had cast aspersions on the bank manager’s good name, that he had shown no remorse, and concocted a web of lies. He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. He was a first offender.

49     All considered, I was of the opinion that 12 months’ imprisonment was the appropriate starting point for the Accused because he had shown no remorse and had concocted lies in the prosecution of his defence. He had also tried to throw Tan under the bus when he claimed that Tan was the boss of DMT and had full control of DMT’s bank account. But as he has similar antecedents and had been sentenced to a substantial period of imprisonment, an uplift of four months was appropriate to account for this aggravating factor that was not present in _Selvarajoo_.

50     I therefore sentenced him to serve 16 months’ imprisonment.

51     The Accused is currently on bail pending the appeal.
