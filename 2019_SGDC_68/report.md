### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of being a member of an unlawful assembly under section 143 of the Penal Code, Cap 224. The offence was committed on 1 Jul 18 at about 1.30 am, at the vicinity of Block 603, Woodlands Drive 42.

## THE FACTS OF CASE

2       The Accused was 20 years old at the time of the offence. He was 21 years old at the time of his conviction. The victim, Wan Hamzah Bin Wan Razak (“Wan”), was 17 at the time of the offence.

3       The Accused, together with his five friends namely, Darwisy, Nazrul, Firdauz, Hasib and Yan, had on the date and time of the offence, assaulted Wan. The assault on Wan was in retaliation to an allegation that Wan had made a rather offensive statement to one Vanessa, who was Hasib’s girlfriend; the statement being that Wan had told her that he wanted to rape her. Bent on teaching Wan a lesson, they lured him into meeting them at 888 Plaza at Woodlands. They had then surrounded him and started questioning him. After that, they jointly assaulted him.

4       Specifically, the Accused had punched Wan several times on his face. After the assault, the Accused had threatened Wan that it would be much worse if he made such provocative remarks again.

5       As a result, Wan suffered a cut below his eye. He did not seek medical attention for it.

## PROSECUTION’S SENTENCING SUBMISSION

6       APP Asran Samad asked for three months’ imprisonment. He highlighted that this was a group violence involving five young men who had ganged up on a 17 years old teenager. The offence was premeditated and planned. After deciding to beat up the victim, they had called him to meet them at 888 Plaza. When Wan arrived, they had brought him to a secluded spot at Block 603. There, they delivered their brand of rough justice. The Accused was not a passive actor. He had landed several punches at the victim’s face.

7       APP Asran also highlighted that the Accused had been placed on probation on 7 Jan 16 for a similar offence under section 143. This meant that he had committed the present offence less than a year after he had completed his probation sometime in July 2017. APP Asran therefore objected to the calling of a probation report.

## DEFENCE MITIGATION

8       Mr Siraj, counsel for the Accused, stressed that the offence was committed out of a misguided sense of righteousness to address a perceived wrong committed by Wan. Since his last transgression with the law, the Accused had settled down with a family of his own and was working part-time. Since his latest arrest, he had stayed away from the co-accused persons.

9       Notwithstanding the fact that the Accused had been placed on probation in 2016, Mr Siraj urged the Court to call for another probation report for the present offence. He argued that the Accused should be treated as a youthful offender. Therefore, rehabilitation remained the paramount consideration in sentencing. He said that a second chance at probation should not be excluded just because the offence was a serious offence. His pattern of offending did not reflect an escalation from his previous offence, in that, he was not the instigator, did not play the most active role, and was not the one who had struck the first blow. Any countervailing consideration of deterrence could be addressed by imposing stringent probation conditions. In any event, Mr Siraj argued that at the very least, calling for a probation report would provide an objective, third party assessment of the Accused’s prospects for rehabilitation.

10     Mr Siraj highlighted that the Accused has shown commitment to improve his employment prospects. This was to provide for his family and avoid straying from the straight and narrow path. He has strong familial support. His own family unit is stable. His wife, sister, brother-in-law and parents were committed to provide effective supervision over him. He has shown genuine remorse over his actions. He understood the anxiety and trauma he had caused to his loved ones. He has dissociated himself from his negative peers ie, he has cut all ties with them since the commission of the offence.

11     In the alternative, Mr Siraj submitted that a short detention order (SDO) of not more than 14 days was more appropriate than an imprisonment sentence. The nature of SDO would serve as an effective deterrent on the Accused given that he is extremely anxious about the prospect of being incarcerated. It would deliver the short, sharp lesson to him about the adverse consequences if he was to transgress the law again.

## COURT’S FINDINGS

12     The Accused was only 20 years old when he committed the offence, and had attained the age of 21 when I convicted him. However, youth alone did not automatically mean that rehabilitation would be the paramount consideration in sentencing, and that I should therefore call for a probation report. I must look at all the relevant circumstances of the case and then decide what the paramount sentencing consideration was.

13     In this regard, the Accused’s antecedent was relevant. He was placed on 18 months’ probation on 7 Jan 16 for a similar offence under section 143. In that case, he and his friends had assaulted members of an opposing team over some wild tackling during a street soccer game. What he did was to push one victim. In that regard, his culpability was low.

14     Comparing that against his actions in the present case, the contrast was very stark. The Accused was more involved. He had thrown multiple punches on Wan, most of which were to the face, a vulnerable part of the body. More pertinently, the group had actually stopped their assault when someone had called out that the police were coming. They were walking away from Block 603 when the Accused suddenly hauled Wan back to Block 603 and punched Wan a few times on the face. This act encouraged the others to follow suit and to rain more punches on Wan.

15     The Accused clearly played a significant role in the present offence. His culpability was high. This demonstration of gratuitous violence presented an escalation in his violent behaviour compared to his previous offence.

16     I noted that the Accused successfully completed his 18 months’ probation sometime in July 2017. In conjunction with his probation, he would have been put through programmes, inter alia, on how to be a socially responsible person, on how to deal with negative peer pressures and influences, and on constructive engagement. The fact that he had re-offended within a year clearly demonstrated that these lessons had either no effect on him or their effects had dissipated with the passage of time.

17     Mr Siraj said that the Accused was now a more settled man with a family to care for. In this regard, I found it worrying that during the commission of the offence, the Accused’s wife and baby were present in the vicinity, when he had joined in with the group to beat Wan up. This showed that being a husband and a father had not tempered the Accused’s pro-criminal tendencies. Additionally, it cast grave doubts over his wife’s ability, and consequently the family’s ability, to effectively supervise him.

18     The fact that he had dissociated himself from negative peers has no weight given that this was after the fact. It should be noted that this same point was similarly pleaded in the 2016 court proceedings. It seemed to me that this was pleaded to ingratiate himself with the court in order to obtain leniency. The more pertinent point to note was that despite having gone through probation and its attendant programmes, he chose to associate himself with negative peers again in 2018.

19     For all the above reasons, I declined to call for a probation report as I was of the opinion that probation was not appropriate. As he was now 21 years old, reformative training was also out of the question. I also declined to impose SDO as the offence committed was a serious offence. SDO is designed for first time offenders who committed minor offences, who needed to be given a short, sharp lesson about what the consequences would be if he or she persisted in criminal behaviour.

20     I was of the view that deterrence took centre-stage. The factual matrix surrounding the assault, and in particular, the Accused’s actual role in the assault, as expanded above, warranted the imposition of a custodial sentence. But given the Accused’s age, and the fact that he had only one antecedent, and he has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, I found that the prosecution’s submission of a three months’ imprisonment sentence to be excessive. All considered, I sentenced him to one month’s imprisonment.

21     Both the Prosecution and the Accused have appealed against the sentence. The Accused is on bail pending appeal.
