3       Upon his conviction, the accused person admitted to 9 charges and consented for them to be taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The 9 charges consist of 7 charges under the RTA, 1 count under MV (TPRC) Act and 1 count under the Road Traffic Rules. The accused claimed trial to the remaining 3 stood down charges comprising 2 charges under the RTA and 1 charge under Sec 279 of the Penal Code. For these 3 charges, the matter was fixed for a pre-trial conference.

4       In respect of the 13 charges, which the accused had pleaded guilty to, he was sentenced to serve a total of 52 weeks imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of $4,800, and in default to serve 24 days imprisonment. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from 06-January-2020 and for 20 years with effect from his date of release from prison. He is now appealing against his sentence.

## Statement of Facts (SOF)

5       The material portions of the SOF of the proceeded charges which the accused admitted without any qualification is as follows:

6       The accused is Jeevan S/O Ahoorum, a 46-year-old male Singaporean (date of birth: 26th December 1973).

7       Prior to the commission of all the offences, on 19 June 2009, the accused had been convicted in District Court No. 21, State Courts of the Republic of Singapore, of various offences, including 2 offences under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) (Cap 276, 2004 Rev. Ed) in DAC-48737-2007 and DAC-48739-2007, and he was disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 10 years from 19June 2009 till 18 June 2019.

#### Facts Leading to the 7 Proceeded Charges on 23 July 2016, 9 January 2017 and 27 June 2017 (DACs 932664, 932666 – 932667, 932669 – 932672 of 2018)

8       On 27 June 2017, at or about 3.40pm, the accused was driving a motor car with a number plate bearing registration number SS4343J, a silver-coloured Jaguar. At the material time, he drove whilst under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles.

9       The victim (A1) is Ong Kok Heng, a 57-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was driving the motor car bearing registration number SJL1050S.

10     The complainant (A2) is Land Transport Authority (LTA) enforcement officer Yeo Ying Xuan, a 34-year-old male Singaporean, attached to Transport and Enforcement Unit. At the material time, he was the rider of FX54Y on covert duty.

11     On 27 June 2017, at about 3.40pm, A2 was looking out for a car with a suspected false number plate ‘SS4343J’. A2 saw the accused driving the said car along the carpark of Blk 322 Hougang Avenue 5. The accused drove out of the said carpark and A2 trailed him all the way to Tampines Avenue 1.

12     Along the single lane slip road of Tampines Avenue 1 into Tampines Avenue 5, Singapore, A1 was driving his car along the slip road, just in front of the accused. A1 came to a stop at the stop line in order to give way to other vehicles in the main road. The accused was driving carelessly without due regard for the safety of others, and thereby collided into the rear of A1’s car from behind. A1 wanted to exit the car to approach the accused. Just as A1 was alighting, the accused signaled for A1 to move to the main road to settle the matter. Not wanting to block traffic in the slip road, A1 then drove forward and stopped at the main road.

13     However, the accused did not stop his car and instead sped off at a fast speed, beating a red light in the process.

14     No one was injured in the accident. At the time of accident, the weather was fine and the road surface was dry. The visibility was clear and the traffic flow was light. The traffic lights were in working order.

15     Further investigations also revealed that the accused had affixed the number plate SS4343J on a de-registered motor car SLF5217K, which was de-registered on 10 February 2017 and due for export.

16     Upon further screening of the vehicle number SS4343J, the accused was found to be driving whilst under disqualification on the following occasions:

> a.     On 23 July 2016, at about 2.40pm, the accused was driving a blue BMW using the number plate SS4343J. The vehicle was captured for a speeding offence on Traffic Police Speed Laser Camera. The said number plate was used on another de-registered vehicle SKN3449R (de-registered on 4 June 2014) and due for export.

> b.     On 9 January 2017, at about 4pm, the accused was driving a blue BMW using the number plate SS4343J. The said number plate was used on another de-registered vehicle SKN3449R (de-registered on 4 June 2014) and due for export.

17     Consequently, on 27 June 2017, when the accused drove whilst under disqualification, there was no insurance policy or security in respect of Third-Party Risks that complied with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap. 189) (“MVA”), in relation to the use of the vehicle by the accused.

18     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed the following offences:

> a.     3 counts of driving whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4) of the RTA,

> b.     1 count of driving using vehicle without insurance coverage under Section 3(1) of the MVA, punishable under section 3(2) and section 3(3) of the same Act.

> c.     3 counts of using a de-registered vehicle under section 10(1) punishable under section 10(3) of the RTA.

#### Facts Leading to the 2 Proceeded Charges on 22 April 2018 (DACs 932659 – 932660 of 2018)

19     On 22 April 2018, at or about 1.55am, between Bukit Timah Road and Claymore Road, Singapore, the accused was driving the motor car bearing registration number SJX 5708P, a black-coloured BMW. At the material time, he drove whilst under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles. Consequently, there was no insurance policy or security in respect of Third-Party Risks that complied with the requirements of the MVA, in relation to the use of the vehicle by the accused.

20     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed 1 count of driving whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4) of the RTA and 1 count of driving using vehicle without insurance coverage under Section 3(1) of the MVA, punishable under section 3(2) and section 3(3) of the same Act.

#### Facts Leading to MCN-900557-2018

21     The victim is Toh Kok Sian. At the material time, he was working as a bus driver.

22     The witness is Jinnyline Q Uiray Toh. She is the victim’s wife.

23     On 10th November 2017 at about 9.26 a.m., the police were informed about a case of an assault located at ‘Bus Stop 54301, Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2, Singapore’, hereafter known as the incident location.

24     On 10th November 2017 at about 9.20 a.m., along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 towards the incident location, the accused was driving a BMW bearing license plate SKP6160S, while the victim, accompanied by the witness, was driving his company’s school bus bearing license plate PA4714A. At the material time, the accused drove whilst under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles.

25     While driving, the accused, without signaling, changed lanes into the lane that the victim was driving on. As a result, the victim sounded his vehicle’s horn. The accused proceeded to wind down his car window and pointed his middle finger at the victim. At the traffic light junction towards the incident location, while both the accused and the victim were stationary side by side, the accused signaled and gestured to the victim to stop his vehicle by the side of the road.

26     Both the victim and the accused stopped at the bus stop of the incident location and alighted from their vehicles. They began quarrelling over the earlier incident on the road. During the confrontation, the accused turned aggressive and punched the victim once on his face, hitting the left eyebrow area. The accused continued punching the victim several more times, but the punches landed on the victim’s arm as he was blocking his face. The witness remained in the car and only alighted after the accused started to punch the victim. The witness then called for the police after she saw blood on the victim’s face.

27     The victim was not conveyed to hospital after being attended to by paramedics at the incident location. The victim went to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic the following day. A medical report dated 27 December 2017 was provided by Dr. Lee Mun Tuck who examined the victim on 11 November 2017. In the medical report, the victim was observed to have the following injuries:

> a.     A superficial laceration measuring 4cm on the left temple with superficial 2x2mm skin loss

> b.     A bruise on the lower left eyelid with no complaint of blurred vision

> c.     One scratch on the right chest measuring 12x1cm

> d.     Three superficial linear bruises measuring 16x0.5cm, 13x1cm, 7x2cm

28     The accused has since paid compensation to the victim.

29     By virtue of the foregoing, the defendant has committed 1 count of voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

#### Facts Leading to the DAC 932677 of 2018

30     On 13 October 2017, at or about 5.05am, along Newton Road, Singapore, the accused was driving the motor car bearing registration number SS6666D, a white-coloured Jaguar. At the material time, he drove whilst under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles

31     The accused had affixed the number plate SS6666D on a de-registered vehicle with registration number SLF5217K. The vehicle had been de-registered on 10 February 2017 and was to be exported.

32     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed 1 count of driving whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4) of the RTA.

#### Facts Leading to the 2 Proceeded Charges on 29 December 2018 (DACs 909359 and 909360 of 2019)

33     The accused was first charged on 14 February 2018 for the offence MCN-900557-2018. He was then charged with an additional 24 offences, including the above traffic offences, on 2 October 2018, and was released on police bail. While he was released on bail, he committed further traffic offences.

34     On 29 December 2018, at or about 12.25am, along Veerasamy Road, Singapore, the accused was driving the motor car bearing registration number SLQ1212S, a blue-coloured BMW. At the material time, he drove whilst under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles. Consequently, there was no insurance policy or security in respect of Third-Party Risks that complied with the requirements of the MVA, in relation to the use of the vehicle by the accused.

35     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed 1 count of driving whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4) of the RTA and 1 count of driving using vehicle without insurance coverage under Section 3(1) of the MVA, punishable under section 3(2) and section 3(3) of the same Act.

37     The accused also has other convictions under the Penal Code for offences, which included theft, extortion and cheating.

## The Sentence

38     In this case, the accused has been convicted of 6 charges of having driven a motor car on 6 different dates while under a disqualification order which prohibits him from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 10 years from 19 June 2009 till 18 June 2019, which is an offence under section 43(4) of the RTA, 3 charges of driving the vehicle without insurance coverage as required under section 3(1) of the MV(TPRC) Act, 3 charges of using a motor car when the registration had been cancelled which is an offence under section 10((1) of the RTA and 1 charge of causing voluntary hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code.

39     The prescribed punishment for the above offences is as follows:

> ·    Section 43(4) RTA- Fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both;

> ·    Section (3) MV(TPRC) - Fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both and to be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction.;

> ·    Section 10(3) RTA - Fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both;

> ·    Section 323 Penal Code Cap 224- Imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both

40     The prosecution, in their address on sentence, highlighting a number of aggravating factors sought for custodial sentences for all the offences except for those under section 3(1) of the MV (TPRC) and section 10 of the RTA and for these offences, they submitted for fines. In particular, for the offences of driving under a disqualification order they submitted for 6 months imprisonment for offences committed before the accused was charged and 7 months imprisonment for those committed after he was charged. With regard to the disqualification order they argued that a lifetime disqualification order should be imposed on the accused as he had committed multiple offences of driving while under such an order and this was not the first time he had committed such these offences. For the section 323 offence of voluntarily causing hurt, they stressed that it was a road rage situation where the accused was the aggressor and a sentence of 4 weeks imprisonment would be appropriate. In total, they submitted for a sentence of 13 months and 4 weeks imprisonment, with 3 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively and a lifetime disqualification order.

41     In their written plea in mitigation, counsel for the accused mentioned the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity thus saving precious prosecutorial and judicial resources. He had been co-operative in the course of investigation and had admitted to all the traffic offences. With regard to the offence of voluntarily causing hurt, under section 323 of the Penal Code, they submitted that the accused’s culpability was at the lower end as the injuries suffered by the victim was superficial and no weapon was used by the accused during the altercation. In terms of the individual sentences the defence submitted for a fine or alternatively 1 week imprisonment for the section 323 charge, imprisonment terms of 8 weeks for the charges under section 43(4) of the RTA for having driven while under a disqualification order committed before the accused was charged and 12 weeks imprisonment for those committed after he was charged and fines for the rest of the charges.

42     I shall deal with the charges under section 43(4) of the RTA of the accused having driven while under a disqualification order issued for a period of 10 years with effect from the 19 of June 2009, since they form 6 of the 13 charges he had pleaded guilty to. The accused had committed these 6 offences on the 23 July 2016, 9 January 2017, 27 June 2017, 13 October 2017, 22 April 2018 and 29 December 2018. The fact that he had defied the law on 6 distinct occasions is an aggravating factor which cannot be disputed. What was significant too was the fact that the offence of 23 July 2016 was not his first breach of section 43(4). His record of previous convictions indicated that he had been sentenced on 2 charges of having contravened section 43 (4) on the 19 June 2009 and was sentenced to 2 months imprisonment for the first charge and 4 months imprisonment for the second charge.

43     As a starting point, I could not accept the defence submission of a sentence of merely 8 weeks and 12 weeks imprisonment for the accused’s current offences under section 43(4) of the RTA. This would ignore the fact that the accused is not a first offender for this offence. The principle of escalation must apply here, as obviously the stint of a 4-month imprisonment term for his second violation of section 43(4) did not have the desired effect on this accused. Further, the accused had committed the offences on 22 April and 29 December 2018 after he had been charged in court on the 14 February 2018 and while he was on court bail.

44     The prosecution had submitted and I accept that it has been held that the commission of offences while on court bail was indeed an aggravating factor. (See _PP v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 753</span>). In the latest case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 217</span>, (at paragraph 29), the learned Judge of Appeal, Justice Chao Hick Tin opined as such when he said:

> “_In my judgment, there is only one good reason for elevating the appellant’s sentence beyond the indicative starting point – which is very close to or at the mandatory minimum of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane –_ **_and it is the fact that he committed the offences while out on bail. It demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention_**_.”_ (Emphasis added).

45     Where the sentencing considerations are concerned I took guidance from the High Court case of _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1028</span> (_Saiful_) at \[17\] where the court held that general and specific deterrence are the forefront sentencing considerations when dealing with offences under section 43(4) of the RTA. This is because accused persons who drive whilst under a disqualification order evince a blatant disregard for the law and a complete disregard for the disqualification order and are not easy to detect. What was a further aggravating factor was the fact that the accused had used fake number plates when he had driven on the 6 occasions. This was a ploy he had employed to escape detection from the authorities.

46     On those 6 occasions where he had flagrantly and intentionally broken the law, including twice after being charged, there was no evidence of any circumstances compelling the accused to commit these offences. There was no light shed in his mitigation plea as to why he had to defy the law on those 6 occasions. While I accept that a plea of guilt is a relevant mitigating factor, it has to be balanced against the fact that the prosecution would not have any great difficulty in proving these 6 charges under section 43(4) of the RTA. Considering all the relevant circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence of 20 weeks imprisonment for the 4 offences committed before the accused was charged in court and 28 weeks (a further uplift of 8 weeks) for those 2 he committed after he was charged and while on court bail would be appropriate.

47     In relation to the duration of disqualification, which must be imposed further, I was mindful that the prosecution had sought a lifetime ban and the defence sought a period, which was fair and just. I again returned to Saiful’s case where it was stated that “_while there is no invariable rule that the disqualification period imposed for a s 43(4) offence must be double that of the original disqualification period, in most cases, a s 43(4) offender can and should expect a period of disqualification that is at least twice the original period_” … at \[20\]. This would appear to have been the pattern in the accused’s record as he was first subjected to a 2-year disqualification order then to 5 years and finally to 10 years on 19 June 2009. Exercising some leniency towards the accused, I decided that the usual tariff of twice the last period of disqualification, resulting in a period of 20 years, would be fair and just.

48     I now come to the offence of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code, which the accused committed on the 10 November 2017. The prosecution had characterised this as a ‘road rage’ case, which I agree with. The altercation between the accused and his victim arose from the accused’s manner of driving when he changed lanes without signalling. He reacted to the victim’s horning by pointing his middle finger. It eventually resulted in a confrontation where the accused was clearly the aggressor as he punched the victim once on his face and followed with multiple punches, which fortuitously the victim managed to block. The victim’s wife was sufficiently alarmed when she saw blood on his face, which caused her to call for the police.

49     Relying on the sentencing framework for section 323 offences as set out in _Low Song Chye v PP _<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>, I would categorise this as a Band I case, in that since the injuries suffered by the victim were lacerations, bruises and scratches, they are not that serious and the indicative sentencing range would be fines or a short custodial term of up to 4 weeks imprisonment. I also referred to the case of _PP v Lim Yee Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span>, where it was held that where offences under section 323 stemmed from conflicts that arose in the course of common road use, the deterrent sentencing policy underlying road rage violence had to also apply, at \[26\] and \[27\]. Considering the need therefore to pass a deterrent sentence in this case where the offence here is the classic case of a road rage situation, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed and 4 weeks imprisonment as submitted by the prosecution would be justified.

50     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors including the plea in mitigation, I passed the following sentences on the accused:

51     I ordered the terms of imprisonment of 20 weeks in DAC 932664-2018, the 28 weeks imprisonment in 932659-2018 9(the 2 section 43(4) charges) to run consecutively with the sentence of 4 weeks imprisonment for the section 323 offence in MCN 900557-2018. The total sentence of the accused is therefore 52 weeks imprisonment which adequately reflects his culpability. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $4,800, and in default to serve 24 days imprisonment. He is also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 20 years with effect from his date of release from prison. The accused’s application to surrender on the 6 of February 2020 was granted.
