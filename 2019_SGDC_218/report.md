\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9145/2019/01.\]

21 October 2019

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Background

The accused, Mr Ozer Mahir, a 51-year-old Turkish national, claimed trial to two counts of outraging the modesty of his Indonesian domestic maid (“the Complainant”) and one count of insulting her modesty.

## Gag Order and In-Camera Proceedings

3       A gag order in respect of the Complainant’s identity had already been imposed on 19 September 2017 during the mentions stage. When the trial commenced before me on 21 March 2018, the Prosecution applied to have the Complainant’s evidence heard in camera. The Defence objected to the application. I granted the Prosecution’s application as I was satisfied that it was expedient in the interest of justice to do so pursuant to s 7(2) of the State Courts Act (Cap 231, 2007 Rev Ed).

## Undisputed Facts

4       Mr Ozer was a Marine Chief Engineer. He first came to Singapore from Turkey in 1998. He had his own business in Singapore and worked from home. He returned to Turkey in 2007 and stayed there. He got married in Dec 2009. In September 2015, he moved back to Singapore. He lived with his wife, Aysegul Ozer (“the Wife”) aged 44 and their three daughters, aged 6 and a pair of twins aged 3 at a condominium at Blk 343 Upper Bukit Timah Road #XXX (“the residence”).

5       The Complainant was an Indonesian national, aged 32. She first came to Singapore to work as a domestic helper in 2007 and since then had worked at several households. Mr Ozer was her 11th employer. She was employed directly by Mr Ozer through an online maid recruitment portal called “Anisya”, and started working as a domestic maid for Mr Ozer on 9 November 2016. Her salary was $600 a month. She was entitled to take her off days on Sundays and public holidays. She kept her own passport, work permit and her mobile phone. She was entrusted with a set of house keys and allowed to use the internet. During her employment, she communicated with Mr Ozer and the Wife in English. Between 5 December 2016 and 10 January 2017, Mr Ozer went back to Turkey while the Wife and daughters remained in Singapore. There were no major issues between the Complainant and the Wife during this period. On 12 March 2017 at 8.06pm (see exhibit P1), the Complainant lodged a police report against Mr Ozer in respect of 3 incidents which took place at the residence between 6 March and 8 March 2017. As it was late at night, she returned to the residence after lodging the police report. The next day on 13 March 2017, Mr Ozer was arrested at his residence at 4.30pm (see arrest report at exhibit P2) while the Complainant was sent to the Indonesian embassy.

6       The Prosecution’s case was that Mr Ozer first molested the Complainant in the kitchen on 6 March 2017 at about 10.30pm by touching her left buttock (“the first incident”). Two days later on 8 March 2017, at about 9am, he insulted her modesty by exposing his penis to her when he was in the master bedroom (“the second incident”). Later at 12.30pm on the same day, when they were in Mr Ozer’s computer room, he molested her a second time by grabbing her wrists and pushing her head towards his crotch (the third incident”). For the first incident on 6 March 2017, it was not disputed that the Wife and children were then all at home. As for the second and third incidents on 8 March 2017, it was not disputed that only Mr Ozer, the Complainant and the twins were at home. The Wife had left for her English class at 8.30am and the elder daughter had gone to school.

## The Applicable Law

7       Mr Ozer denied committing the offences. There were also no eyewitnesses to the incidents. In this regard, the relevant case-law had been set out comprehensively by the Prosecution and the Defence in their Closing submissions. Essentially, where there was no independent corroboration, the law would require the Complainant’s evidence to be “_unusually convincing_[^1]” and in determining whether it would be safe to convict solely based on the Complainant’s evidence, the Court could assess her credibility by having regard to her demeanour alongside the internal and external consistencies or lack thereof in her evidence[^2].

## The issue before the court

8       Thus the issue before the Court was whether the Complainant’s evidence was unusually convincing such as to prove the prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt[^3].

## Case for the Prosecution

9       The Prosecution called a total of three witnesses namely the Complainant (PW1), her former employer, Ms Zeng Meiyan, Lynn (PW2) and a rebuttal witness, the Investigating Officer (IO) Thanabalan s/o Kothandapani (PW3). The material evidence as adduced from the Complainant and PW2 was as follows.

### Evidence of the Complainant

### First incident on 6 March 2017

10     The Complainant testified that on 6 March 2017 (Monday), at about 10.30pm, she was washing dishes in front of the kitchen sink when Mr Ozer suddenly entered the kitchen. He approached her from the back and stood very close behind her. As his right hand reached out to take a glass from the shelf at the sink, his left hand touched her left buttock. The Complainant felt that it was done deliberately because she could feel his knuckles. She could not say how long it lasted but it was fast. She felt angry and stopped her washing. She turned around, looked at Mr Ozer in the face and asked, “_What are you doing towards me, Sir_?” Mr Ozer replied that he was sorry and that he just wanted to take the glass. He then left the kitchen. At that time, the Wife was in the twins’ bedroom.

11     The Complainant felt confused and frightened. She did not know whom she could report the incident to. She did not have a good relationship with the Wife hence she feared that the Wife would not believe her word.

### Second incident on 8 March 2017, 9am

12     On 8 March 2017 (Wednesday), at about 9am, when the Complainant was in the kitchen preparing milk for the twins, she heard Mr Ozer calling out for her. The Complainant thought that Mr Ozer wanted her to collect the dirty laundry. She ran towards the master bedroom and stood at the entrance. Mr Ozer was standing topless in front of the dressing table with a towel tied around his waist and he was holding a hair dryer in his right hand. She said, “_Yes, Sir_” and they were looking at each other. Mr Ozer put the hair dryer down and suddenly used his left hand to lift the front portion of his towel and exposed his penis. He said, “_Come, Ms Y, you see_” and he looked down. The Complainant was frightened and angry. She told him in a raised voice, “_What are you showing to me, Sir? Don’t do this._” She then returned to the kitchen. After she left, Mr Ozer called for her again but the Complainant ignored him and proceeded to make milk and prepare breakfast for the twins. At that time, the twins were watching television in the living room and the eldest child was at school. The Wife was not at home. The Complainant later brought the twins downstairs to the swimming pool to play with water. Although the Complainant was frightened and confused, she said that she did not know whom she could refer the matter to and she did not have any friends that she trusted.

### Third Incident on 8 March 2017, 12.30pm

13     After the twins had played at the swimming pool, the Complainant brought the twins back to the residence at about 11 plus am. She bathed them and put them to bed. She then went to the kitchen to wash the children’s milk glasses when she heard Mr Ozer calling out her name from his computer room. It was about 12.30pm. The Complainant went into the computer room and Mr Ozer instructed her to clear the rubbish. She was bending down and tying the rubbish bag when suddenly Mr Ozer walked to the door and locked it. She shouted three times for him to open the door but Mr Ozer approached her and used both his hands to hold her wrists hard. She tried to break free of his grip but did not have the strength to do so. He then used his left hand to push the back of her head hard towards his crotch and she could feel the pain. He was wearing a T-shirt and a pair of short pants and the Complainant’s face was only an inch away from touching his private parts and right thigh. The Complainant somehow managed to slide her body down to the floor. She then ran to the door, unlocked it, opened it and ran to the kitchen. She was very frightened and felt that Mr Ozer had become very indecent towards her and she found it unacceptable.

14     The next night, the Complainant contacted her previous employer, Mdm Zeng Meiyan Lynn (PW2) through WhatsApp to ask her why her male employer had behaved indecently towards her. She confided in PW2 that she was very frightened and no longer comfortable with her male employer. Although PW2 encouraged the Complainant to tell her what happened, the Complainant did not give PW2 the whole story. She simply said that her male employer had gone beyond the limit of decency. PW2 advised the Complainant that she could also report it to the police. It would be noted that the Complainant was not able to produce the Whatsapp conversation she had with PW2 as her old phone could not be switched on.

15     On Sunday, 12 March 2017, which was the Complainant’s off day, she went to lodge a police report against Mr Ozer in respect of the 3 incidents.

### Change of DPP in the midst of the Complainant’s re-examination and subsequent recalling of the Complainant to the stand

16     The first tranche of the trial ended on 22 March 2018 in the midst of the Complainant’s re-examination. When the trial resumed on 19 July 2018, another Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”), Mr Nicholas Lai, had taken over conduct of the case and he informed the court that it just came to his attention that PW2 had kept her Whatspp messages with the Complainant in her phone and these messages would be tendered when PW2 took the stand. DPP Lai then proceeded to finish up with the re-examination of the Complainant with the understanding that the Complainant would be re-called to the stand for a second round of examination-in-chief (“EIC”) in relation to her Whatspp conversation with PW2.

### Evidence of PW2, Zeng Meiyan Lynn, former employer of the Complainant

17     The Complainant worked for PW2’s household for about 7 months in 2016 until September 2016 when she left PW2’s employment to go home for “family” reasons. PW2 found the Complainant to be a helpful and polite maid who cleaned well. About 4 to 6 weeks after the Complainant returned to her hometown, she messaged PW2 using Whatsapp and indicated that she would like to work for PW2 again as she was unable to sustain her lifestyle in Indonesia. By then, PW2 had already found a replacement maid hence the Complainant eventually went to work for another family (ie Mr Ozer’s family) but she remained in touch with PW2 on a regular basis through Whatsapp.

18     PW2 told the court that on 8 March 2017, the Complainant had Whatspp her to say that she was scared because her employer had touched her buttock. The Complainant also mentioned to PW2 that something happened the week before. PW2 advised the Complainant to lodge a police report as she feared for the Complainant’s safety. In this regard, the Prosecution tendered exhibit P34 which consisted of screenshots retrieved from PW2’s handphone of the Whatsapp messages exchanged between the Complainant and PW2 for the period 8 March 2017 to 13 March 2017. The Prosecution also admitted exhibit P35 which set out the Whatsapp messages between the Complainant and PW2 from 6 to 14 March 2017.

## Case for the Defence

19     The Defence called a total of 4 witnesses. They were Mr Ozer, the Wife and 2 of their friends. The material evidence as adduced from Mr Ozer and the Wife was as follows.

### Evidence of Mr Ozer

20     Mr Ozer testified that the Complainant arrived at his residence in the evening of 9 November 2016 to start her job. On 1 December 2016, he asked her if she wished to be paid up to 1 December first but she indicated that there was no urgency hence it was agreed that she would receive her salary on 10thday of each month.

21     Mr Ozer said that the Complainant’s primary duties were to help look after the children and perform other housework however the Wife would do the cooking. The family would usually have their dinner around 7pm. By 8pm, the Wife would put the children to bed and Mr Ozer would make his own tea and bring his mug into the computer room. By 9 pm, the children would be asleep and Mr Ozer and the Wife would then retire to the master bedroom. The room doors would all be left open so that they could hear the children if they were to wake up. The children especially the twins would wake up frequently during the night. The Complainant would also have her dinner at the same time after which she would do the cleaning up. By 9pm, she would also have retired to her room which was located beyond the kitchen area.

### Bintan episodes

22     Mr Ozer described the Complainant as a loud, sensitive and aggressive person who did not like to take instructions and was unable to accept criticism. She would not hesitate to sulk and display her unhappiness even in public. Nothing significant happened at the beginning of her employment. Unfortunately, their relationship turned sour during the family trip to Bintan over the Chinese New Year period on 25 to 27 January 2017 whereby there were 2 unhappy episodes. The first episode happened on the night before they left Bintan. They were going for dinner when one of the twins let go of the Complainant’s hand and consequently the twin fell. The Wife warned the twin not to release the Complainant’s hand and gave the same warning to the Complainant but not in an angry manner. The Complainant however reacted angrily and said that it was the child who let go of her hand. The second episode occurred during lunch the next day. The Complainant had been busy playing with her phone. Even when the food was served, she continued to be on her phone instead of taking care of the children. The Wife sternly warned the Complainant to stop playing with her phone which she had been playing with since morning. The Complainant retorted angrily and loudly that the children were sitting, the food was on the table, so what if she played with her phone. Mr Ozer tried to calm both women down. Just then one of the children wanted to go to the toilet so the Wife brought the child to the toilet. After the Wife left the table, the Complainant started complaining to Mr Ozer about the Wife referring to her rudely as “your wife”, raising her voice and pointing with her finger. Mr Ozer told her not to raise her voice in public and said that his wife was right, that she should do her work first instead of playing with her phone. Mr Ozer also told the Complainant that if she was not happy working with them, she could leave.

### Laundry episode

23     Upon their return to Singapore from Bintan, as the Complainant had not been following instructions when doing the laundry which resulted in some of the clothes being worn out, the Wife told the Complainant not to touch her clothes and that she would wash her own clothes. The next day, the Complainant was still not following instructions so the Wife told her not to wash any of the clothes and that the Wife would do the laundry for the family. On 30 January 2017, the Complainant went to Mr Ozer and told him that she wanted to leave their employment as she could not work with the Wife any more. She agreed to stay on until they found a replacement and she said she would also start to look for a new employer. Immediately on that day, Mr Ozer and the Wife began their search for a new maid. They activated their account on Anisya website (from where they recruited the Complainant) and placed an advertisement. They asked for recommendations from their friends and social circles through Whatsapp. Later they also met some agents. Further advertisements were placed on the Anisya website on 13, 20, 21st and 22nd February 2017 (see exhibit D3).

### Rude sms episode

24     Mr Ozer told the court that there were other unhappy episodes with the Complainant. On 28 Feb 2017, the Wife telephoned the Complainant to ask about the children but despite calling the Complainant many times, she was unable to reach the Complainant. The Complainant later sent the Wife a rude sms text at 4.31pm: “_What happen call me so many times?? I’m busy with twins they are eating_” (see exhibit D16).

### The late night out episode on the Wife’s Birthday on 3 March 2017

25     3 March 2017 was the Wife’s birthday. Mr Ozer and his Wife were out for the night and they came home late. When they got home, they found the elder daughter watching television in the living room while the Complainant was waiting for them at the sofa. The Complainant shouted at them angrily. She also complained that the children did not want to sleep. Mr Ozer became angry too and told her that she could leave if she was not happy but that she could not talk to them like that.

### The “missing” episode at IMM on 4 March 2017

26     The next day on 4 March 2017, Mr Ozer wanted to celebrate the Wife’s birthday at home so he drove the children and the Complainant to IMM to buy a cake. He decided to visit a jewellery shop with the elder daughter and instructed the Complainant to stay with the twins at a particular location to wait for him. When he returned to the spot 5 to 6 minutes later, he could not find the Complainant and the twins. He called her many times but could not reach her. Finally, half an hour later, he found them inside the shop, Giant. When he questioned her as to why she did not wait for him and did not answer his calls, she replied that the twins were getting impatient and that she did not bring her phone. Mr Ozer scolded her but the Complainant acted as if he had no reason to scold her and that it was not her fault that she did not have her phone with her.

### Events on 6 March 2017, date of the first incident

27     On 6 March 2017 (Monday), Mr Ozer fetched the elder daughter to school in the morning. The Wife had left home at around 8.20 or 8.30am for her English class. Mr Ozer took his usual morning nap after which he showered and made breakfast for himself. The Complainant was at home looking after the twins. The Wife came home around 12.30pm. At about 4pm, as Mr Ozer had to attend to some work outside home, he arranged for the Complainant to go with the twins to pick the elder daughter up from school. Soon after he drove off, it started to rain heavily. Mr Ozer called the Complainant and learned that the Complainant and the twins were still on the condominium premises. He told her to stay put and wait there for him while he went to fetch the elder daughter after which he would return to pick her and the twins so that they would not get wet. Subsequently he was unable to reach the Complainant as she did not answer his calls. Eventually the Complainant called him and told him that they were at the bus stop. However, when he drove to the bus stop, the Complainant and the twins were not there. He finally saw them walking towards the school and they were far away from the bus stop. He picked them up and they were all soaking wet. Mr Ozer was angry and scolded the Complainant for not waiting at the condominium and later not waiting at the bus stop. The Complainant again behaved as if Mr Ozer was scolding her for no reason. She started saying things like the rain had slowed down. Mr Ozer later dropped the Complainant and the children off at the condominium before he left for his work.

28     Mr Ozer recalled having dinner with his family at about 7pm that evening. As usual, the Wife put the children to bed at around 8pm while he went to the computer room with his mug of tea. The children were asleep before 9pm. Mr Ozer and his wife then went to their master bedroom to retire for the night. He did not leave his bedroom at all that night. He also did not go to the kitchen at 10.30pm to molest the Complainant.

### 7 March 2017

29     Mr Ozer did not recall anything noteworthy happening on 7 March 2017 except for the Complainant sending him a photograph at 8.48am through Whatsapp of the twins playing at the playground (see page 31 at exhibit D1).

### Events on 8 March 2017, date of the second and third incidents

30     On 8 March 2017 (Wednesday), Mr Ozer sent the elder daughter to school in the morning. The Wife had left for her English class by 8.30am. Her lesson was conducted at Somerset from 8.30am to 11.30am. After taking a short nap, Mr Ozer showered then went to the kitchen to make his tea. The Complainant was in the kitchen and they had a casual conversation during which the Complainant sought his permission to take an extra day off after Good Friday to attend her cousin’s wedding. Mr Ozer told her that it was better that she asked the wife about it. The Complainant then started telling Mr Ozer about her friends and apparently she had been making friends through the social media including an app called Tango. The Complainant disclosed that she put a picture of her back on the app and after that she began to receive monetary offers of $200, $400 and so on. Mr Ozer got angry and asked her what she was doing. He scolded her sternly and told her that she should not do anything illegal, get pregnant and “bring any troublemaker boyfriend”. He also told her that the next time she quarrelled with his wife, he would dismiss her without checking with his wife. The conversation ended there. Mr Ozer denied calling the Complainant to the master bedroom at about 9am on 8 March 2017 and exposing his penis to her.

31     At about 11.21am on 8 March 2017, Mr Ozer Whatsapp his wife in Turkish, “_Aysegul call me when you arrive. I will fetch from downstairs and we shall go to furniture mall_” (see translated message at exhibit D4T). Mr Ozer explained that he was arranging to meet his wife downstairs at their condominium after her English lesson so that the twins would not see her because if they were to see her, they would stick to her and they would not be able to leave home. The Wife acknowledged his message with “_Ok_” at 11.28am. At 12.10pm, the Wife Whatsapp Mr Ozer to say, “_Soon after I ring come down_”. Mr Ozer understood the Wife to be saying that she was on the bus and would be arriving soon and he was to go downstairs when she gave him a ring. It also meant that he should getting ready to go down. At 12.24pm, there was a missed video call to his phone as shown in exhibits D4 and D5. Mr Ozer explained that he probably missed the Wife’s call because he was either at the door or on the way down to his car. When he left home, he was in a T-shirt and jeans and wearing casual shoes. At 12.32pm, when he was already in his car, he gave the Wife a video call to find out her exact location and to let her know that he was coming (see exhibit D6). He later fetched her from somewhere near the condominium playground and they then proceeded to the Furniture mall and IMM. At IMM, the Wife made some purchases and they later went to pump petrol using the Wife’s supplementary credit card (see exhibit D7, credit card statement of Mr Ozer). Mr Ozer also told the court that the elder daughter finished school at 2.45pm that day so they should have gone to fetch her and reached home by 3pm on 8 March 2017.

32     Mr Ozer denied calling the Complainant to his master bedroom at about 9am on 8 March 2017 and exposing his penis to her. He also denied summoning her to the computer room at about 12.30pm that same day. He told the court that at no time during the Complainant’s employment did he harass her sexually or try to be funny with her by asking her to be his secret girlfriend.

### 9 to 13 March 2019

33     No significant events occurred on 9 to 12 March 2017. 12 March 2017 was the Complainant’s Sunday off. Mr Ozer did not see her that day. On 13 March 2017, it was the same morning routine. The Wife left for her English lesson. At around 3pm or 3.30pm, the police came to his residence and took him away to assist in investigations.

### Evidence of the Wife, DW2

34     The Wife essentially gave evidence in support of Mr Ozer. She told the court that she already knew basic English and was able to speak daily conversational English before she came to Singapore in September 2015. After she came to live in Singapore with Mr Ozer and their daughters, she enrolled in an English course and attained an intermediate certificate from the Canadian Education College on 29 April 2016 (see exhibit D10). She subsequently enrolled in the continuation of the intermediate course from 3 March 2017 to 24 May 2017 (see receipt at exhibit D12) and was awarded another certificate (see exhibit D11). The lessons for the period March to May 2017 were conducted at Somerset from 9.30am to 11.30am three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The Wife would take the bus and the journey including walking time took about one hour. The Wife would have to leave home by 8.30am to make it for her 9.30am class.

35     The Wife testified that the Complainant was their second domestic helper. The first helper worked for them for about 10 months. They next employed the Complainant through the Anisya website. In this regard, the Wife was still primarily responsible for taking care of the children. She tended to their toileting, cleaning up and night care. She also did the grocery shopping and cooking at home because Mr Ozer would only eat Turkish food. The Wife communicated with the Complainant in basic English and they did not have problem understanding each other. They would also communicate using Whatsapp. The Wife had also told the Complainant that she was free to cook her own food if she did not like the food prepared by the Wife. During the Complainant’s employment with them, she did not complain that she did not have enough food to eat. The Wife would also set aside food for the Complainant before their meals and not give her the leftovers.

36     The Wife would usually put the children to bed at around 8pm and they would be asleep by 8.30pm or 8.45pm. She and Mr Ozer would then retire to their bedroom where she would try to get some sleep since she would be woken up by the children constantly through the night. As the Wife did not want any noise coming from the kitchen to disturb the children, the Complainant would usually have finished her work and retired to her room by 8pm.

37     The Wife described the Complainant as someone who would react carelessly without thinking. The Complainant would tell them things that they did not ask her about. She would also speak up if she was not happy even if she were in public and she had a loud voice.

### The various unhappy episodes

38     Initially, the Wife did not encounter any major problems with the Complainant. Their troubles with the Complainant started with the Bintan trip. In this regard, DW2 gave similar evidence as Mr Ozer regarding what happened at Bintan. She also told the court about the laundry episode, the rude sms episode and her birthday late night out episode.

39     DW2 cited 2 other occasions of unprofessional behaviour exhibited by the Complainant. On 14 February 2017, DW2 had invited her friends over for breakfast but the Complainant was unco-operative and the Wife ended up having to do the washing herself when they ran out of clean utensils. On 18 February 2017, at the twins’ party which was held in the condominium’s function room, the Wife had problem finding the Complainant when she needed the Complainant’s help as the Complainant was laughing and “fooling around” with the other maids.

### Events on 6 March 2017

40     With regards to the first incident on 6 March 2017, the Wife told the court that she and Mr Ozer had retired to their room around 8.45pm. All the room doors would be left open so that they could hear the children if they woke up and that night she did not hear any shouting or commotion coming from the kitchen around 10.30pm.

### Events on 8 March 2017

41     On 8 March 2017, she left for her English class at 8.30am. Before leaving home, she and Mr Ozer had already planned that they would go somewhere after her lesson. At 11.21am, about ten minutes before her lesson ended, Mr Ozer Whatsapp her, “_Aysegul call me when you arrive. I will fetch you from downstairs and we shall go to furniture mall_.” She understood him to be telling her not to go upstairs because if the twins were to see her, they would not let them leave. At 11:28am, the Wife replied “_OK_”. At 12.10pm, the Wife Whatsapp Mr Ozer to say “_Soon after I ring come down_”. She explained that she was on the bus and would soon be alighting. She messaged him so that he could get ready to leave home and go to the car. At 12.24pm, she deliberately gave Mr Ozer a missed call by calling him then hanging up shortly to let him know that she had reached the condominium. At 12.32pm, Mr Ozer called the Wife from his car and said that he was on his way. He later picked her up near the condominium pool. They then went to the Furniture Mall at IMM where they bought some clothes and other items. They planned their return trip according to the elder daughter’s school dismissal time and should have gone home around 2.45pm.

42     When she reached home on 8 March 2017, she did not notice anything amiss with the Complainant. She also did not observe anything wrong or unusual with the Complainant on 9 to 12 March 2017.

## Evaluation of the evidence and findings

### Whether the Complainant was a credible witness

43     I did not find the Complainant to be a credible witness.

### The Complainant was not frank and forthcoming

44     She was not frank and forthcoming as can be seen from the following.

> (i)     The Complainant testified during her first EIC that her relationship with Mr Ozer was “_normal_” prior to 6 March 2017[^4]. When DPP Lai took over conduct of the trial during the second tranche and resumed the first re-examination of the Complainant, she suddenly revealed that when the Wife was at home, Mr Ozer would act “_very nice_” and only talked to her when it concerned “_important_” things. The Complainant said that however, when the Wife was out, Mr Ozer would “_always talk all the funny things_” and he would _“try to come near \[her\] all the time”_ to persuade her to be his “black girlfriend”, meaning a girlfriend that no one should know about[^5]. The Complainant ought to have been candid and forthcoming during her first EIC and told the court that Mr Ozer had been making sexual advances towards her. This was a crucial piece of evidence which changed the complexion of the Prosecution’s case and set the context for the commission of the offences against her.

> (ii)     The Complainant also had ample opportunity during her first cross-examination to provide the court the background behind the three incidents, particularly when the Defence Counsel, Mr Kesavan Nair, was questioning her as to whether she had any explanation for the sudden change in Mr Ozer’s behaviour on 6 and 8 March 2017. Instead, she offered the reason that Mr Ozer was perhaps taking advantage of her since the Wife was not home the whole day[^6]. She ought to have told the court honestly that Mr Ozer had been harassing her sexually prior to the incidents. It would be noted that she had no difficulty articulating to PW2 how fake Mr Ozer had been, as evident from her Whatsapp message on 8 March 2017 at 11pm, “_but when his wife around He always talk to me very rude and black face and shouting then if she go out different again. I already dowant talk to him anymore. So disgusted mam_.” There was no reason why the Complainant could not similarly have told the court the whole story.

> (iii)     The Complainant also ought to have disclosed all the pertinent details regarding Mr Ozer’s sexual harassment when she first raised it during her first re-examination but she failed to do so. She brought up new evidence during her second EIC (when she was re-called and shown the Whatsapp messages that she had sent to PW2 in exhibit P34). She testified that Mr Ozer started saying “_funny things_” to her around January or February 2017[^7]. She recalled 2 to 3 such occasions although she could not remember the dates:

>> a)       The first time happened in the twins’ room when the Wife was not at home. Mr Ozer said that he wanted to get to know the Complainant “more closely” and that he wished he could be her boyfriend. He also told her he wanted her to be his dark girlfriend. The Complainant replied that she was his maid and that he had no right to speak to her like that[^8].

>> b)       The second occasion took place one week before he touched her buttock on 6 March 2017. Mr Ozer apparently urged the Complainant to “just try with me 1 time” which the Complainant understood Mr Ozer to be saying that he wanted to sleep with her. In response, the Complainant scolded Mr Ozer and warned him not to go near her and reminded him that she was his maid and he was being impolite towards her. At that time the Wife was in the room with the twins[^9].

>> c)       The third occasion was when the Wife was out for exercise at night and Mr Ozer told the Complainant that she was prettier than his other maids[^10].

45     The Prosecution contended that the Complainant had stated in her Whatsapp messages to PW2 that Mr Ozer had expressed romantic feelings to her one week before the incidents but that she had rejected Mr Ozer’s advances. It submitted that since the Complainant testified about Mr Ozer’s attempts to persuade her to be his black girlfriend before she had sight of these messages in court, it meant that she could not have tailored her evidence to suit the messages. It would be noted that on 8 March 2017, at 6.44pm, the Complainant told PW2, “_You know my sir try to be funny to when my mam is not around._” A few messages later, at 6.56pm, she wrote, “_Last week this happen mam. I’m going to record his voice but I got no time to take my phone_.” At 6.59pm, she wrote, “_I explain to him, sir you are my employer. I always respect you but you do this to me. He said so what Ms Y. Its ok this small things only. Because I really sayang you._” At 10.58pm, she said “_Yes He say nothing and will try to get me. What the meaning I also don’t understand._” The Complainant’s messages were vague and it was not clear as to what funny business she was alluding that Mr Ozer was up to. In my view, the Complainant’s Whatsapp messages implied that Mr Ozer was acting in a way that was unbecoming of an employer but it was not apparent from the contents that Mr Ozer had been pestering her to become his girlfriend and to sleep with him. In fact, it would appear that she was contradicting herself. In court, she said that when Mr Ozer told her to “_try with \[him\]_”, she had understood him as saying that he wanted to sleep with her whereas in her Whatsapp message, when Mr Ozer said that he would “try to get her”, she declared to PW2 that she did not understand what Mr Ozer meant. I therefore found the Complainant’s belated evidence and lack of candour regarding Mr Ozer’s amorous overtures not only disconcerting but her manner of presenting her evidence in dribs and drabs was also unsatisfactory. In my view, her evidence in this regard was also not corroborated by her Whatsapp messages.

### The Complainant’s evidence was internally inconsistent

46     The Complainant’s evidence was internally inconsistent in a number of material aspects:

> (i)     The Complainant testified during her first EIC that she did not tell anyone about the incidents until the night of 9 March 2017 when she messaged PW2 to say that her employer had behaved indecently towards her. There was clearly a discrepancy in the date as exhibit P34 showed that the first time the Complainant told PW2 about Mr Ozer’s indecent behaviour was actually on 8 March 2017 at 6:44:36pm. Aside from this discrepancy, it was significant that the Complainant failed to tell the court that she had been communicating with PW2 since 4 March 2017. On 6 March 2017, she had sent a message to PW2 at 10:36:38pm to say “Hello madam ☺” (see exhibit P35, page1). The Complainant told the court that she trusted PW2. Given her close relationship with PW2, when the Complainant initiated contact with PW2 on 6 March 2017, she could have confided in PW2 then that her male employer had just molested her on her buttock six minutes ago in the kitchen. In this regard, as the Complainant only told PW2 about the first incident on 8 March 2017, PW2 had assumed that the first incident occurred on 8 March 2017 because to PW2, if it were that important, the Complainant should have told PW2 about it on the day itself[^11].

> (ii)     The Complainant was also in contact with PW2 on 7 March 2017. She again had the chance to tell PW2 about the first incident but she did not. By 8 March 2017 at 6.44pm when the Complainant chatted with PW2 again through Whatsapp, all three incidents had taken place. Although the Complainant’s Whatsapp conversation with PW2 lasted about 5 hours from 6.44pm to 11.38pm, she only told PW2 about the first incident. She also had the time to tell PW2 that the Ozers had only left her broccoli soup and chicken bones for dinner. If the Complainant was prepared to tell PW2 about the first incident, it was curious why she held back from disclosing the other two incidents which had escalated in nature. She also did not provide any coherent explanation as to why she did not bring up the second and third incidents with PW2 on 8 March 2017 except to say that she eventually told PW2 everything[^12] but that took place only on 13 March 2017 after the Complainant had lodged her police report.

> (iii)     Another material inconsistency could also be found in her evidence regarding her decision on when to file a police report. The second incident happened at 9am on 8 March 2017. Later that morning, she took the twins to the swimming pool. At around 12.30pm, she put them to bed and was planning to go to the police after that[^13]. Just then, Mr Ozer summoned her to the computer room where the third incident took place. If the Complainant had already made up her mind to lodge a police report after the second incident, the third incident should only have reinforced her decision to go to the police. The third incident would have demonstrated that Mr Ozer was taking things to the next level. He had ignored her repeated shouts (three times) for him to unlock the door, physically restrained her, refused to release her wrists and tried to violate her by pushing her head forcefully towards his crotch. By the first incident, the Complainant knew that Mr Ozer was not joking about it when he expressed his desire previously for her to become his girlfriend. By the second incident, the Complainant knew that Mr Ozer was not deterred by her scolding after the first incident. By the third incident, she knew that he had no qualms about attacking her sexually. She had every reason to fear for her physical safety and modesty. She told the court that she was afraid that Mr Ozer might finally rape her[^14]. It was therefore bewildering that she should change her mind about making a police report on 8 March 2017 after the third incident. The Complainant when cross-examined, said that she did not know why she could not make a police report at that time[^15].

### The Complainant’s evidence was externally inconsistent

47     The Complainant’s evidence was externally inconsistent in the following material aspects.

> (i)     In respect of the second incident, the Complainant told the court during her first EIC that Mr Ozer had lifted his towel exposing his penis to her and at the same time, he said, “Come, see this”. In her police report (exhibit P1), she stated that when “he started to flash to \[her\]”, she shouted at him and moved out of the room. In her second EIC, the Complainant suddenly disclosed in court for the first time that Mr Ozer had not only asked her to look at his penis, he had also asked her to touch it[^16]. This was a material inconsistency.

> (ii)     The Complainant was definite that the third incident happened after 12.20pm, more or less at 12.30pm on 8 March 2017[^17]. She could not remember if Mr Ozer left the residence after the third incident because she did not see him[^18] but she recalled that the Wife returned home that afternoon at 5pm. It was critical to note that the Complainant’s evidence as to the timing of the third incident was materially contradicted by the Whatsapp messages between Mr Ozer and the Wife in exhibits D4T, D5 and D6. The documentary evidence in these exhibits showed that Mr Ozer and the Wife were arranging to meet each other at around 12.30pm after the Wife’s lesson so that they could go to the Furniture Mall together. Mr Ozer’s credit card bill in exhibit D7 proved that the Wife was at the Furniture Mall on 8 March 2017 as she had made purchases at IMM with her supplementary credit card that day. D7 also proved that the Wife had made payment at Shell Bukit Batok on 8 March 2017 and corroborated the evidence of Mr Ozer and the Wife that they had gone to pump petrol after visiting the Furniture Mall/IMM on 8 March 2017. Since the Wife had yet to obtain her driving licence[^19], the credit card bill in exhibit D7 also proved that Mr Ozer was the one who drove the car that day. In the light of such incontrovertible documentary evidence, I agreed with the Defence that it was highly improbable for Mr Ozer to have committed the third offence. It was also inconceivable that he would have chosen such an inconvenient timing to make his move on the Complainant.

> (iii)     In respect of the third incident, there were other material inconsistencies in the Complainant’s evidence. For instance, the Complainant told the court during her first EIC that she was in the kitchen when she heard Mr Ozer calling out her name from his computer room. This was similar to what she had stated in her police report (exhibit P1). However, during her cross-examination, she told the court that she had just left the twins’ room after settling them to bed when Mr Ozer called her to go to the computer room[^20]. Another glaring example was that during her first EIC, she said that Mr Ozer had used his left hand to push the back of her head towards his crotch but in her police report, she stated that he released her left wrist and used his right hand to push her head towards his crotch area. A third material inconsistency could be seen in her evidence as to who ultimately unlocked the computer room door. In her first EIC, she told the court that after she managed to free herself from Mr Ozer’s hold, she was the one who unlocked the door and thereafter got out of the room. In her police report, she stated that it was Mr Ozer who opened the door and let her out.

### Whether the Defence had raised a reasonable doubt

48     I was of the view that the Defence had raised a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case as it had presented a case which was consistent and corroborated by documentary evidence in the material aspects.

> (i)     Mr Ozer’s evidence as to what happened since the Complainant started her employment with them was substantiated by the Wife’s testimony. Both Mr Ozer and the Wife’s accounts regarding their unhappy episodes with the Complainant were real episodes and not fabricated (except for the Tango episode[^21] which was disputed). The Prosecution submitted that the Defence had exaggerated the episodes in order in paint the Complainant in a bad light. It would be noted that the Bintan and laundry episodes were severe and unpleasant enough to strain the relationship between the Complainant and the Wife to the extent that the Complainant approached Mr Ozer on 30 Jan 2017 to say that she wanted a change in employer. On the evidence, it did not appear that the Ozers had exaggerated the degree of acrimony in their working relationship. Insofar as the Tango episode was concerned, on one hand, the Complainant claimed that she did not use the Tango app but in the same breath, she said that she had told one employer that she was using Tango but it was a different employer, not Mr Ozer[^22]. I was therefore inclined to believe Mr Ozer’s version that the Complainant had apprised him regarding her activities on Tango.

> (ii)     Contrary to the Prosecution’s submission that the Complainant was performing satisfactorily prior to the incidents and that the Ozers had no intention to terminate her services, the Defence adduced documentary evidence in exhibits, D3, D8 and D9 to show that they were in the process of finding a new maid.

> (iii)     As set out in \[47(ii)\] above, the objective documentary evidence in exhibits D4T, D5 and D6 showed that it was highly improbable for Mr Ozer to have committed the offence in the third charge. The Prosecution did not adduce any evidence to challenge the Defence in this regard.

> (iv)     Contrary to the Complainant’s assertion that the Wife’s English was not good and that the Wife would also not understand her English if she were to tell the Wife that her husband had molested her[^23], the Defence tendered exhibits D10, D11 and D12 to show that the Wife was attending English lessons and could converse in daily conversational English. In this regard, the Wife’s statement to the Investigation Officer (PW3) was also recorded in English (see exhibit P37).

> (v)     The Defence also adduced evidence from their friends, DW3 (Zeynep Dorum) and DW4 (Christina Gonazalez Ruiz) regarding the Complainant’s character which was in line with what Mr Ozer and the Wife had told the court, namely that the Complainant was loud and not afraid to speak her mind. DW3 and DW4 had the chance to interact with and observe the Complainant when they were over at the Ozers’ place. DW3 found the Complainant to be too talkative and outspoken and that she had a different character from a normal maid. DW4 found the Complainant’s way of speaking vulgar and saw that she was disrespectful to the Ozers. The Prosecution did not dispute their evidence.

49     For completeness, I would also deal with the Prosecution’s submission that Mr Ozer could come out with no reasonable explanation as to why the Complainant had framed him. During his cross-examination, Mr Ozer admitted frankly that he did not know why the Complainant had brought these baseless accusations against him. Suffice it for me to say that the burden of proof rests with the Prosecution.

## Conclusion

50     In conclusion, having regard to the totality of the evidence, I did not find the Complainant’s testimony to be unusually convincing such as to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt. She was not a frank and forthcoming witness and her evidence was filled with material inconsistencies. On the other hand, the Defence had raised a reasonable doubt by presenting a consistent and credible case which was corroborated by documentary evidence. In the circumstances, I acquitted Mr Ozer of all three charges accordingly.
