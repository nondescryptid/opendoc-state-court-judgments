13 October 2022

### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to one count of drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(3A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

2       Both the Prosecution and the Defence asked for the mandatory minimum sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment, which was imposed in the present case. The Accused has appealed against the sentence.

## Charge

3       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> You, Sappakitpaiboon Prattana are charged that you, on or before the 13th of April 2021, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, Methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) and punishable under Section 33(3A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Statement of facts

4       The Accused is Sappakitpaiboon Prattana, a female 29-year-old Thailand national.

5       On 13 April 2021, the Accused was arrested by Singapore Police Force officers at Block 510 Serangoon North Avenue 4 #XXX Singapore 550510, on suspicion of having committed an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”).

6       The Accused was brought to Woodlands Police Division HQ, where she provided two bottles of her urine samples, which were each sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “P-SL-21-01452-1 SAPPAKITPAIBOON PRATTANA” and “P-SL-21-01452-2 SAPPAKITPAIBOON PRATTANA” respectively in her presence.

7       The said urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 14 April 2021.

8       The HSA issued two certificates under Section 16 of the MDA bearing Laboratory Numbers 2106724-AT-001 and 2106724-AT-002 on 24 April 2021.

> a.     Ng Chee Ann, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having had conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked “P-SL-21-01452-1 SAPPAKITPAIBOON PRATTANA”, issued the certificate bearing Laboratory Number 2106724-AT-001, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> b.     Chang Hian Twan, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having had conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked “P-SL-21-01452-2 SAPPAKITPAIBOON PRATTANA”, issued the certificate bearing Laboratory Number 2106724-AT-002, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

9       Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

10     The Accused admitted in her statement that she had consumed “Ice”, which is the street name for Methamphetamine, on 6 April 2021. She consumed “Ice” using a bottle with a glass pipe and rubber tube. The Accused’s urine samples were found to contain Methamphetamine as a result of her consuming “Ice”.

11     The Accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume Methamphetamine. She has thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under section 33(3A) of the said Act.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s case

12     The Prosecution asked for the mandatory minimum sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

### Mitigation plea

13     The Defence sought the minimum sentence.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) The Mitigation Plea stated that:

> (a)     The Accused was sincerely remorseful and regrets her wrongdoing.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> (b)     The Accused and her husband are experiencing marital woes and were living separately about 2 months before her arrest.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (c)     The Accused has 2 daughters, who are 10 years old and 6 years old. [\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The Accused’s biggest concern arising from the present case is that she understands that she would be deported back to Thailand (as she is currently on a long term pass), which would result in her being separated from both her children.

> (d)     Prior to this case, the Accused did not have any criminal record in Thailand or Singapore.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) This was the very first time that she had consumed drugs, and she did so because of an emotional breakdown arising from her marital woes.[^7]

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Punishment

14     The prescribed punishment for s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(3A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act is imprisonment for a term of not less than one year but not more than 10 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000.

15     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment set by Parliament: _Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 684</span> at \[44\] (Benny Tan, _Assessing the Effectiveness of Sentencing Guideline Judgments in Singapore Issued Post-March 2013 and A Guide to Constructing Frameworks_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1004</span> at \[46\]).

16     The court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence, _viz._ Completeness principle: _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\] and _Goh Ngak Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 254</span> at \[37\].

### Plea of guilt and cooperation with authorities

17     I gave due weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[77\]. This saved the criminal justice system resources that would have been expended with a full trial.

### Antecedents

18     I gave due weight to the fact that the Accused is untraced.

### Sentence

19     In the present case, the Accused was represented by Defence Counsel when she pleaded guilty. The Accused also had the assistance of a Thai interpreter. I was satisfied that when the Accused pleaded guilty, she understood the nature and consequences of her plea and she was fully aware of the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the law. She had also admitted to the offence without qualification. Given the lack of aggravating factors, I sentenced the Accused to the mandatory minimum of 1 year’s imprisonment.

## Conclusion

20     All things considered, the Accused was given the mandatory minimum sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment prescribed by s 33(3A) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

21     Given the facts of this case, the mandatory minimum sentence was the appropriate sentence and cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.

22     The Accused is currently serving her sentence.
