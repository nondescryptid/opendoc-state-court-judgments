Damages – Assessment

29 July 2022

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       To be, or not to be, that is the question. But sometimes, that is only half the question. Litigants and lawyers focused on establishing a breach of contract or breach of duty sometimes forget that establishing liability is only half the battle – the true relief lies in the remedy. A plaintiff who fails to consider the _appropriate_ remedy for the breach in question risks wasting time and costs barking up the wrong tree. This was one such unfortunate case.

2       In this case, the Plaintiff sought and was awarded _both_ an account of profits as well as damages as remedy for its claim for breach of fiduciary duties and ancillary liabilities. The Plaintiff appeared not to have appreciated that for such a claim, damages and an account of profits are _alternative and inconsistent_ remedies. The Plaintiff did not elect and obtained interlocutory judgment for both. How should damages be assessed in such a situation?

3       The assessment of damages hearing took place before me. After considering parties’ submissions, I awarded the Plaintiff damages in the sum of $33,811.35. However, I made it clear to parties that the damages assessed _did not include_ any amount(s) for the Plaintiff’s claim for diversion of business from the Plaintiff to the 4th Defendant. Insofar as that claim was concerned, the Plaintiff was granted remedy in the form of an account of profits, and the amount was to be determined through a taking of accounts. I arrived at this decision with some reluctance and difficulty. These are the ground of my decision.

## Background Facts

### The Parties

4       The Plaintiff is a company in the business of selling photocopying machines as well as other office products.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

5       The 1st Defendant, Hau Yew Ching, was employed by the Plaintiff as a sales manager between 2 January 2014 to around 7 May 2016. It was the Plaintiff’s case that the 1st Defendant was at all material times a _de facto_ director of the Plaintiff.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

6       The 2nd Defendant, Sim Thia Meng, was also a sales manager employed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff alleged that the 2nd Defendant was also a _de facto_ director of the Plaintiff.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

7       The 3rd Defendant, Sim Mui Eng, was a shareholder of the Plaintiff. The 2nd and 3rd Defendants are siblings.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

8       The 4th Defendant is a Singapore company incorporated in September 2014. The Plaintiff alleged that the 4th Defendant was incorporated by or at the instigation of the 1st and 2nd Defendants while they were _de facto_ directors of the Plaintiff, with the intention of using the 4th Defendant to compete with the Plaintiff.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

9       The 5th Defendant, Sim Beng Choo Irene, is the sole director of the 4th Defendant.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

### The Plaintiff’s Claims

10     The Plaintiff’s primary claim was that the 1st Defendant, as an employee and _de facto_ director of the Plaintiff, had breached his contractual and fiduciary duties to the Plaintiff by incorporating the 4th Defendant to compete with the Plaintiff.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) Further, the Plaintiff also claimed that the 1st Defendant made various unauthorised and/or improper payments from the Plaintiff’s bank accounts, either to the 3rd Defendant,[^8] to third parties[^9] or to the 4th Defendant.[^10] Substantially similar allegations were made against the 2nd Defendant.[^11]

11     As against the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants, the Plaintiff claimed that they dishonestly assisted the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duties[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) and were “_liable to account to the Plaintiff as constructive trustee on the grounds of dishonest assistance_”.[^13] For the 3rd Defendant, the Plaintiff additionally claimed that she was liable for “_knowingly received the Plaintiff’s monies which were unauthorised_”.[^14]

### Proceedings Against and Settlement with the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

12     Prior to the commencement of the trial on liabilities, the Plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. Accordingly, on 2 November 2016, a Notice of Discontinuance was filed by the Plaintiff, discontinuing the action against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.

13     The precise terms of the settlement between the Plaintiff and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were not disclosed. However, the Plaintiff confirmed during the assessment of damages proceedings that it had received payments of $35,000 from each of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (i.e. a total of $70,000) in settlement of the Plaintiff’s claims against them.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

### Trial and Interlocutory Judgments

14     The Plaintiff’s remaining claims against the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants then proceeded to trial.

15     At the commencement of the trial on 11 June 2018, the trial judge entered interlocutory judgment against the 4th Defendant (“**11 June IJ**”) since the 4th Defendant “_was not represented by Counsel as required by the Rules of Court and was not contesting the claim_”.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) Interlocutory judgment against the 4th Defendant was entered in the following terms:

> Interlocutory Judgment is entered against the Fourth Defendant for the Plaintiff with:

>> (a)    damages to be assessed for:

>>> (i)    knowingly assisting the 1st and 2nd Defendants in diverting contracts to the 4th Defendant; and

>>> (ii)   knowingly assisting the 1st and 2nd Defendants in breach of their fiduciary obligations.

>> (b)    a declaration that the 4th Defendant be liable to account to the Plaintiff as constructive trustee on the grounds of dishonest assistance in breach of fiduciary obligations by the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

> Interest and costs to be reserved to the registrar assessing damages.

16     At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found that “_the_ \[1st Defendant\] _had acted with the_ \[2nd Defendant\] _to set up the_ \[4th Defendant\] _and together with the_ \[5th Defendant\]_, they had used the_ \[4th Defendant\] _to operate in competition with the Plaintiff and to profit from this arrangements”_.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) It was further held that:

> (a)     The 1st Defendant was in breach of his duties owed to the Plaintiff as an employee as well as a _de facto_ director as he had acted against the interest of the Plaintiff.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (b)     The “_amounts the_ \[4th Defendant\] _received for services rendered were for the same business activities that the Plaintiff had engaged in_”.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

> (c)     The 5th Defendant had “_dishonestly assisted the_ \[1st and 2nd Defendants\] _in breaching their duties to the Plaintiff and that the Plaintiff were entitled to claim against the_ \[5th Defendant\] _for the profits made by the_ \[4th Defendant\] _for the business activities that the company had engaged in that were in competition with the Plaintiff_”.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

17     Having made these findings, on 7 September 2018, interlocutory judgment was entered against the 1st, 3rd and 5th Defendants (“**7 Sep IJ**”) in the following terms:

> 1.    Interlocutory Judgment is entered **against the First Defendant** for the Plaintiff with:

>> (a)     **damages to be assessed** for:

>>> (i)    the breaches of his contractual duty as well as fiduciary duties,

>>> (ii)   for all unauthorised payments made to the Third Defendant; and

>>> (iii)   for competing with the Plaintiff in its business activities.

>> (b)     **an account be taken** of:

>>> (i)     **all the secret profits made by the First Defendant** and the **payment of all secret profit to the Plaintiff upon taking of the account**;

>>> (ii)   all the **profits made by the Fourth Defendant as a result of the diversion of the business to the Fourth Defendant**.

> Interest and costs to be reserved to the registrar assessing damages.

> 2.    Interlocutory Judgment is entered **against the Fifth Defendant** for the Plaintiff with:

>> (a)     **damages to be assessed** for:

>>> (i)    knowingly assisting the First and Second Defendants in diverting contracts to the Fourth Defendant;

>>> (ii)   knowingly assisting the First and Second Defendants in breach of their fiduciary obligations.

>> (c)    \[sic\] **an account be taken** of:

>>> (i)    all the **secret payment made by the First Defendant to the Fifth Defendant** and the **payment of all secret payment to the Plaintiff upon the taking of the account**;

>>> (ii)    **all the profits made by the Fourth Defendant as a result of the diversion of the business to the Fourth Defendant**.

> Interest and costs to be reserved to the registrar assessing damages.

(emphasis added)

18     In summary, interlocutory judgment was entered for _damages to be assessed_:

> (a)     against the 1st Defendant, for:

>> (i)       the breaches of his contractual duty as well as fiduciary duties,

>> (ii)       all unauthorised payments made to the 3rd Defendant; and

>> (iii)       competing with the Plaintiff in its business activities.

> (b)     against the 4th and 5th Defendants, for:

>> (i)       knowingly assisting the 1st and 2nd Defendants in diverting contracts to the 4th Defendant;

>> (ii)       knowingly assisting the 1st and 2nd Defendants in breach of their fiduciary obligations.

19     In addition to damages, interlocutory judgment was entered for _an account to be taken_:

> (a)     against the 1st Defendant, of

>> (i)       all the secret profits made by the 1st Defendant and the payment of all secret profit to the Plaintiff upon taking of the account;

>> (ii)       all the profits made by the 4th Defendant as a result of the diversion of the business to the 4th Defendant;

> (b)     against the 5th Defendant, of

>> (i)       all the secret payment made by the 1st Defendant to the 5th Defendant and the payment of all secret payment to the Plaintiff upon the taking of the account;

>> (ii)       all the profits made by the 4th Defendant as a result of the diversion of the business to the 4th Defendant.

20     In addition, the Plaintiff also obtained judgment for a declaration that the 4th Defendant be liable to account to the Plaintiff as constructive trustee "_on the grounds of dishonest assistance in breach of fiduciary obligations by the 1st and 2nd Defendants_”.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

### The Assessment of Damages Hearing

21     After interlocutory judgments were entered, the Plaintiff sought directions for an assessment of damages, and that was the hearing which eventually took place before me.

22     Although the 7 Sep IJ ordered that an account be taken and the 11 June IJ granted a declaration that the 4th Defendant be liable to account to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff did not seek any directions for the taking of an account. Counsel for the Plaintiff and the Defendants further confirmed at the assessment of damages hearing on 8 July 2021 that the instant proceedings was _only_ for the assessment of the Plaintiff’s _damages_ and _not_ for the taking of an account pursuant to the 7 Sep IJ and the 11 June IJ.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

23     The assessment of damages hearing took place before me on 5 May and 8 July 2021. The 1st and 5th Defendants were represented by counsel. The 4th Defendant was not represented by counsel and, being a corporate entity, also had not obtained permission from the court to be represented by any of its officers. That being the case, notwithstanding that the 5th Defendant was a director of the 4th Defendant and was in attendance at the hearing, technically speaking, the assessment of damages proceedings proceeded without the 4th Defendant’s participation.

24     In this decision, unless otherwise specified, all references to “_Defendants_” shall refer only to the 1st and 5th Defendants.

## Parties Positions

### Plaintiff’s Claims

25     The Plaintiff claimed _damages_ in the aggregate sum of $241,840.35, which comprised of:

> (a)     $26,800 being improper payments which the 1st and 2nd Defendants made or caused the Plaintiff to have made to the 3rd Defendant from the Plaintiff’s bank account (“**1st Head of Claim**”);

> (b)     $27,300 being unauthorised purchases and payments which the 1st and 2nd Defendants made or caused the Plaintiff to have made from the Plaintiff’s bank account (“**2nd Head of Claim**”);

> (c)     $41,511.35 being unauthorised transactions and payments which the 1st and 2nd Defendants made or caused the Plaintiff to have made to the 4th Defendant from the Plaintiff’s bank account in 2015 (“**3rd Head of Claim**”);

> (d)     $146,229 being revenue of the 4th Defendant from the diversion of businesses from the Plaintiff to the 4th Defendant and secret profits made by the 1st and 5th Defendants in 2014 and 2015 (“**4th Head of Claim**”).

### Defendant’s Position

26     The Defendants essentially denied all of the Plaintiff’s claims.

> (a)     For the 1st and 2nd Heads of Claim, the Defendants’ position was that these payments were not “_improper payments_” and were made in the ordinary course of the Plaintiff’s business.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

> (b)     For the 4th Head of Claim, the Defendants’ position was that the revenue and profit received by the 4th Defendant were not from businesses diverted from the Plaintiff, and therefore no secret profit was made by the 4th Defendant. Further, although the 1st and 5th Defendants admitted to having received the certain “_profits_” from the 4th Defendant,[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) these amounts had been fully diminished by account of the $70,000 settlement payment which the Plaintiff received from the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.[^25]

> (c)     The Defendants did not specifically address or raise any arguments in respect of the 3rd Head of Claim.

## Preliminary Issues

27     Before examining each head of the Plaintiff’s claims, it was necessary to first address two preliminary issues.

### Preliminary Issue 1: Remedies

28     As mentioned, the Plaintiff obtained two interlocutory judgments in these proceedings:

> (a)     The 7 Sep IJ (see \[17\] above), pursuant to which interlocutory judgment was entered against the 1st and 5th Defendants for damages to be assessed and for account to be taken (and for payment) of secret payments and/or profits made by the 1st, 4th and/or 5th Defendants;

> (b)     The 11 June IJ (see \[15\] above), pursuant to which interlocutory judgment was entered against the 4th Defendant for damages to be assessed and a declaration that the 4th Defendant is liable to account to the Plaintiff.

29     As at the time parties tendered closing submissions in these assessment of damages proceedings, the Plaintiff continued to assert interest under the 7 Sep IJ and the 11 June IJ for accounts to be taken of the secret payments and profits made by the 1st, 4th and/or 5th Defendants.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) The Defendants raised no objections to this. In fact, counsel for the Plaintiff and the Defendants confirmed at the hearing on 8 July 2021 that the proceedings before me was _only_ to assess the Plaintiff’s _damages_ and _not_ for the taking of accounts.[^27] Accordingly, all parties appeared to accept that the Plaintiff still had a separate right to an account of profits from the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants under the under the 7 Sep IJ and/or the 11 June IJ.

30     The problem, however, was that damages (which necessarily referred in this context to equitable compensation since common law damages is neither an available nor appropriate remedy for equitable wrongs: see _Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing and others_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 631</span> at \[32\]) and an account of profits are _alternative and inconsistent remedies_ in respect of a claim for breach of fiduciary duties. The former is compensatory while the latter is gain-based. That these are inconsistent and alternative remedies is well-established in case law: see, for example, _Innovative Corp Pte Ltd v Ow Chun Ming and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 943</span> at \[135\]; _Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Liu Cheng Chan and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 15</span> (“**_Parakou Shipping_**”) at \[179\] and \[183\]; _Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd and another (First Currency Choice Pte Ltd, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 189</span> at \[25\] and \[26\]. 

31     Of course, a plaintiff may elect between these inconsistent remedies and such election need not be made when proceedings are first brought. However, such election should generally be made when judgment is given in the plaintiff’s favour: see _Parakou Shipping_ at \[183\]. In _Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 WLR 192</span> (“**_Tang Man Sit_**”), Lord Nicholls summarised the position as follows (at 196 and 197):

> The law frequently affords an injured person more than one remedy for the wrong he has suffered. **Sometimes the two remedies are alternative and inconsistent. The classic example, indeed, is (1) an account of the profits made by a defendant in breach of his fiduciary obligations and (2) damages for the loss suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the same breach.** The former is measured by the wrongdoer’s gain, the latter by the injured party’s loss.

> …

> **Faced with alternative and inconsistent remedies a plaintiff must choose, or elect, between them.** He cannot have both. The basic principle governing when a plaintiff must make his choice is simple and clear. **He is required to choose when, but not before, judgment is given in his favour and the judge is asked to make orders against the defendant.** A plaintiff is not required to make his choice when he launches his proceedings. He may claim one remedy initially, and then by amendment of his writ and his pleadings abandon that claim in favour of the other. He may claim both remedies, as alternatives. **But he must make up his mind when judgment is being entered against the defendant. Court orders are intended to be obeyed.** In the nature of things, therefore, the court should not make orders which would afford a plaintiff both of two alternative remedies.

(emphasis added)

32     The rule on _when_ election must be made, however, is not an inflexible one. Typically, it is be made at the time when judgment is given after a trial. Alternatively, as it occasionally happens, the trial judge may expressly specify and order that the two remedies are granted in the alternative: see _Von Roll Asia Pte Ltd v Goh Boon Gay_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1053</span> at \[80\], \[119\]; _ABB Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Sher Hock Guan Charles_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 111</span> at \[111\]. Yet there may be situations where the plaintiff should be allowed to elect after further information has been made available to him (for example, where default judgment was obtained): see _Tang Man Sit_ at 197E-G. The question is whether the approach strikes a “_fair and reasonable balance between the interests of the parties, having regard also to the wider public interest in the conduct of court proceedings_”: see _Tang Man Sit_ at 197H.

33     In this case, the Plaintiff obtained judgment after trial both for an account to be taken of the secret profits, as well as for damages to be assessed. The Plaintiff did not make an election.

34     Before me in these assessment of damages proceedings, the bulk of the Plaintiff’s claims – i.e. those under the 4th Head of Claim – was for the revenue of the 4th Defendant as a result of the diversion of business from the Plaintiff and secret profits made by the Defendants in 2014 and 2015 as a result of such diversion. These, however, were not the Plaintiff’s damages. The revenue and/or secret profits made by the 1st, 4th and/or the 5th Defendants were their gains and not the Plaintiff’s loss. For me to assess these as “_damages_” in these proceedings would make no sense. More importantly, it appeared to be the parties’ common understanding that the Plaintiff still had a separate right and entitlement to an account of profits of “_all the secret profits made by the First Defendant_”,[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) “_all the profits made by the Fourth Defendant_”[^29] and “_all the secret payment made by the First Defendant to the Fifth Defendant_”.[^30]

35     In these circumstances, I was of the view that the most fair, reasonable and sensible approach that I could take was to proceed on the basis that the damages to be assessed _could not_ include any equitable compensation arising from the 1st Defendant’s breach(es) of fiduciary duties relation to the diversion of businesses from the Plaintiff to the 4th Defendant. I arrived at this conclusion for the following reasons:

> (a)     Looking at the 7 Sep IJ and 11 June IJ as a whole, the trial judge clearly awarded the Plaintiff the remedy of an account of profits (through the procedure of the taking of an account) in respect of the 1st Defendant’s breach(es) of fiduciary duties. Specifically, account was ordered to be taken of “_all the profits made by the Fourth Defendant as a result of the diversion of the business to the Fourth Defendant_”.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that where judgment was given for damages to be assessed for breach of fiduciary duties, such damages would _not_ include equitable compensation relating to the diversion of businesses to the 4th Defendant.

> (b)     Further and in any event, the Plaintiff had, by its conduct, elected for the remedy of an account of profits in relation to the diversion of businesses to the 4th Defendant. This was evident from (i) the Plaintiff continuing to assert a separate right to have an account taken of the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendant’s profits from such diversion;[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) and (ii) the claims under the 4th Head of Claim for the “_revenue_” and secret profits in respect of the diversion of business to the 4th Defendant (which the Plaintiff wrongly understood as “_damages_”).

> (c)     Proceeding in this manner would not be unfair to the Defendants, because the Defendants raised no objection at each stage of the process when the Plaintiff continued to assert the right an account of profits. In fact, even up to the conclusion of these proceedings, no such objection was raised by the Defendants. Therefore, I did not think that the Defendants could fairly complain of the lateness in the Plaintiff’s election.

36     To conclude on this preliminary issue, the assessment of the Plaintiff’s _damages_ pursuant to the 7 Sep IJ and the 11 June IJ would be conducted on the basis that the Plaintiff was _not_ entitled to any equitable compensation arising out of the 1st Defendant’s breach(es) of fiduciary duties in relation to the diversion of business from the Plaintiff to the 4th Defendant. Insofar as that claim was concerned, judgment had been given and/or the Plaintiff had elected for the remedy of an account of profits. That was to be recovered through the separate process of the taking of an account pursuant to the 7 Sep IJ.

### Preliminary Issue 2: Impugned Transactions

37     The Plaintiff in advancing its claims against the 1st to 5th Defendants had particularised various specific transactions and payments which, according to the Plaintiff, were:

> (a)     “_improper payments_” in the form of “_referral fees_” which the 1st and 2nd Defendants caused the Plaintiff to make to the 3rd Defendant (“**Improper Payments to D3 Claim**”);[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) and

> (b)     “_unauthorised transactions_” which the 1st and 2nd Defendants caused the Plaintiff to enter into with third parties (“**Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim**”).[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

38     The Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim corresponded with the Plaintiff’s 1st and 2nd Heads of Claim respectively. Conceptually, they were separate and distinct claims from the Plaintiff’s _other_ claim that the 1st Defendant (and 2nd Defendant) breached his duties in setting up the 4th Defendant to compete with the Plaintiff and to divert the Plaintiff’s businesses to the 4th Defendant.

39     At the conclusion of the trial on liability, the trial judge found the 1st Defendant was a _de facto_ director of the Plaintiff and he breached his duties in setting up the 4th Defendant to compete with the Plaintiff.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) The trial judge also found that the 1st and 2nd Defendants made arrangements for the Plaintiff to purchase goods unrelated to the Plaintiff’s business activities from the 4th Defendant, thereby causing loss to the Plaintiff.[^36] The Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim were not specifically addressed, although interlocutory judgment was entered against the 1st Defendant for damages to be assessed for “_all unauthorised payments made to the Third Defendant_” and for breaches of the 1st Defendant’s contractual and fiduciary duties.[^37]

40     Because the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim were not specifically addressed, I had some hesitation as to whether and how damages on these claims should be assessed. The issue was particularly pertinent because the Defendants were arguing throughout these _assessment_ proceedings that the payments to third parties and to the 3rd Defendant were made in the ordinary course of the Plaintiff’s business and therefore not wrongful (see \[26(a)\] and \[26(b)\] above). More worrying was the fact that this was done _without objection_ from the Plaintiff’s counsel, and all the parties appeared to have proceeded with the assessment of damages hearing _as if_ the issue of liability in respect of the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim were still open questions and – worse still – for determination in this _assessment of damages_ proceedings.

41     That cannot be right. Damages are to be assessed where _judgment_ is given for them to be so assessed: see O 37 r 1 of Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). If there is no liability there can be no judgement for damages to be assessed. Conversely, if liability has been established and judgment entered, then the damages arising from the breach of obligation is to be quantified _without_ re-litigating the elements of liability: see _Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd v Shiok Kim Seng (trading as IKO Precision Toolings) and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 279</span> at \[22\] and \[23\]. Damages should only be assessed within the bounds of the judgment directing its assessment, without variation or modification of the judgment: see _Ho Yew Weng, Alan James v Poh Eng Wah Mark t/a SG Vehicles Trading_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 179</span> at \[9\].

42     Accordingly, I gave specific directions for parties to identify in their written closing submissions the specific _transactions_ which were impugned at the trial on liability. This would determine whether and how damages were to be assessed in respect of the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim.

43     In response to these directions, the Plaintiff submitted that _all_ the transactions _pleaded_ in the statement of claim in respect of the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim were impugned since the Plaintiff obtained full judgment against the 1st Defendant.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) In fact, interlocutory judgment was specifically entered against the 1st Defendant for damages to be assessed for “_all unauthorised payments made to the Third Defendant_” and for breaches of the 1st Defendant’s contractual and fiduciary duties.[^39] This, the Plaintiff submitted, suggested that the trial judge was satisfied that the Plaintiff had established the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim in full.

44     The Defendants submitted that the transactions impugned at the trial on liability were transactions “_in competition_” with the Plaintiff and “_for the purchase of goods by the Plaintiff from the Fourth Defendant which were unrelated to its business activity_”.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) The Defendant then went on to suggest, curiously, that the trial judge “_may have_” had the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim in mind when granting judgment against the 1st Defendant “_for the purchase of goods by the Plaintiff from the Fourth Defendant which were unrelated to its business activity_”.[^41] This suggestion was curious because the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim involved transactions which the Plaintiff entered into with _third parties_ (i.e. not any of the defendants in this suit). That being the case, it was inconceivable that the trial judge could have had these transactions in mind in finding that the 1st Defendant breached his duties in causing the Plaintiff to make purchases _from the 4th Defendant_. The Defendants did not explain the basis for this non-sensical postulation.

45     Having reviewed the certified transcript for the trial on liability and having considered parties’ submissions, I was of the view that the Plaintiff’s position on this preliminary issue must be correct.

46     The transactions which were the subject of the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim were specifically identified in the Plaintiff’s pleadings. Evidence on these claims were led at trial and at no point did the Plaintiff abandon these claims. In fact, the Plaintiff continued to advance arguments in respect of these claims in its written closing submissions tendered after the trial on liability. Since the trial judge did not dismiss any of the Plaintiff’s claims and granted interlocutory judgment for all the reliefs sought by the Plaintiff, it would only be reasonable to infer that the trial judge found liability against the Defendants on _all the pleaded claims_ advanced by the Plaintiff. This was also consistent with the trial judge granting interlocutory for damages to be assessed for “_all unauthorised payments made to the Third Defendant_”,[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) which corresponded specifically with the Improper Payments to D3 Claim.

47     Accordingly, the assessment of the Plaintiff’s damages must proceed on the basis that judgment had been given on liability in respect of the entirety of the Improper Payments to D3 Claim and the Unauthorised Transactions with 3P Claim in respect of each of the transactions pleaded by the Plaintiff.

48     I now turn to consider each head of the Plaintiff’s claim for damages.

## Plaintiff’s 1st Head of Claim

49     The Plaintiff’s 1st Head of Claim was for damages in the sum of $26,800, being improper payments made by the 1st and 2nd Defendants to the 3rd Defendant from the Plaintiff’s bank account. These payments were recorded as “_referral fees_” paid by the Plaintiff to the 3rd Defendant for certain goods sold by the Plaintiff.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) The Defendants’ main response to this head of claim was that the Plaintiff _“operated on referral fee system wherein fees are paid to the referrer who referred a business or transaction between a third party and the Plaintiff_”.[^44] On that basis, the Defendants submitted that the referral fee amounting to $26,800 were payments made “_in the Plaintiff’s ordinary course of business_” and were therefore not “_improper payments_”.[^45]

50     The issue with the Defendants’ submission was that this was not a trial on the Defendants’ liability. The trial on liability was over and the trial judge found the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants liable to the Plaintiff. Specifically, the trial judge ordered that damages be assessed for “_all unauthorised payments made to the Third Defendant_”. The breach of duties in making “_unauthorised payments_” to the 3rd Defendant was expressly pleaded by the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff had particularised each specific transaction for which allegedly unauthorised “_referral fee_” was made to the 3rd Defendant.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) The 1st Defendant had denied in his Defence that these payments were “_improper_”.[^47] Accordingly, the issue as to whether the payments were “_improper_” was clearly in dispute between the parties. The trial on liability was conducted on that basis and all parties had the opportunity to put forward the evidence and submissions in support of their respective positions, namely, whether the payment of “_referral fees_” to the 3rd Defendant were proper or improper. At the end of the trial, the trial judge gave judgment to the Plaintiff on that basis. Neither party sought clarifications or further arguments before the trial judge, and there was no appeal. It was therefore not open to the Defendants to re-litigate this issue and dispute, at these _assessment of damages_ proceedings, that the payments were proper or made in the ordinary course of the Plaintiff’s business. That was water under the bridge. These proceedings were limited to assessing the Plaintiff’s losses as a result of these _improper_ payments having been made.

51     In the circumstances, I was unable to accept the Defendants’ submissions on the 1st Head of Claim. These payments had been found to be “_unauthorised_” and it was plain that the Plaintiff has suffered losses to the extent of the payments having been made. No evidence or argument was put forward by the Defendants as to any benefit which the Plaintiff received as a result of the payments having been made. I therefore allowed the Plaintiff’s 1st Head of Claim in full and assessed the “_unauthorised payments made to the Third Defendant_” referred to at \[1(a)(ii)\] of the 9 Sep IJ at $26,800.

## Plaintiff’s 2nd Head of Claim

52     The Plaintiff’s 2nd Head of Claim was for $27,300 in unauthorised purchases made by the 1st and 2nd Defendants from the Plaintiff’s bank account (i.e. using the Plaintiff’s funds). To be clear, this head of claim differed from the 1st Head of Claim in that these payments were _not_ made to the 3rd Defendant. Rather, these were payments made to _third parties_ (namely, Joshua Investment Pte Ltd and Express Confectionary) for the purchase of a HT-Race Hair and Scalp Treatment Machine and old computer systems (“**Third Party Transactions**”). The Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants “_entered into_ \[these\] _unauthorised transactions on behalf of the Plaintiff using the Plaintiff’s monies_”.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

53     In respect of this head of claim, the Defendants made the simple submission that the payments made by the Plaintiff in respect of the Third Party Transaction were part of the Plaintiff’s “_cash back system_” which should “_be taken as a payment made in the Plaintiff’s ordinary course of business and such payment shall not be claimable against the Defendant as the alleged ‘improper payments’_”.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

54     I was unable to accept or comprehend the logic of this submission.

55     As mentioned above (at \[44\] above), the Defendants, albeit for curious reasons, had acknowledged that the trial judge found liability against the 1st Defendant in respect of the Third Party Transactions.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) In those circumstances, it was clearly not open to the Defendants to argue at this stage, as they did, that these transactions were in fact part of the Plaintiff’s “_cash-back_” system and therefore not “_improper payments_”.[^51] At the risk of repetition, whether the payments were improper or proper, authorised or unauthorised, made breach of the 1st Defendant’s duties or not, were all matters which went towards the 1st Defendant’s liability and not to the issue of damages. Those argument ought to have been canvassed at the trial on liability and if it was not, the Defendants would have been barred under the extended doctrine of _res judicata_ from raising them now. Whichever is the case, these arguments on liability are irrelevant in these assessment of damages proceedings.

56     What then was the Plaintiff’s loss for having made payments towards the Third Party Transactions which were unauthorised and unrelated to the Plaintiff’s business?

57     As a matter of common sense, if the transactions were unrelated to the Plaintiff’s business and the 1st Defendant caused the Plaintiff to enter into these transactions and make payments towards them, the Plaintiff’s damage ought to be the full amount of the payments made unless the Defendants can show that the Plaintiff received some benefit from the purchase of the old computer system and the HT-Race Hair and Scalp Treatment Machine. In this case, there was no such evidence put forward by the Defendants. It is also not clear to me if, for example, there was any residual value in the computer system or the HT-Race Hair and Scalp Treatment Machine and whether the Plaintiff could have mitigated some of its losses by selling these items. In any event, mitigation was not pleaded and therefore not something which the Defendants were entitled to raise or rely upon.

58     Accordingly, I allowed the Plaintiff’s 2nd Head of Claim in full and assessed the damages for the 1st Defendant’s breach of contractual and/or fiduciary duties in making unauthorised purchases from the Plaintiff’s account referred to at \[1(a)(i)\] of the 7 Sep IJ at $27,300.

## Plaintiff’s 3rd Head of Claim

59     The Plaintiff’s 3rd Head of Claim was for the sum of $41,511.35, being payments made from the Plaintiff’s bank account to the 4th Defendant in 2015.

60     The Plaintiff’s case was that the 1st and 2nd Defendants arranged for the Plaintiff to make these payments to the 4th Defendant to purchase goods from the 4th Defendant which were unrelated to the Plaintiff’s business activities, thereby causing the Plaintiff losses.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) In this regard, the trial judge had found that “_arrangements were made by both Defendants for the Plaintiff to purchase goods from the Fourth Defendant which were unrelated to its business activities and thereby causing financial loss to the Plaintiff_”.[^53]

61     The 1st Defendant’s pleaded defence was that “_the transactions...were all normal commercial transactions conducted with the objective of assisting the Plaintiffs to improve and increase its sales and did not cause the Plaintiffs any loss or damage as alleged_”.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) This was specifically dealt with and rejected by the trial judge:[^55]

> It was undisputed that together with the Second Defendant, the First Defendant during his employment with the Plaintiff had set up the Fourth Defendant, VM Office. Technology Pte Ltd on 3 September 2014 with the Fifth Defendant as the sole director. It was also undisputed that the business activities of the Fourth Defendant was the same as that from the Plaintiff. The First Defendant had conceded that he knew it was wrong for him to have been involved in the setting up of the Fourth Defendant and had thought it was best to keep this at a low profile. He had also thought that it was not so nice to let Mr Ng know of the Fourth Defendant’s incorporation. **It was the First Defendant’s case that the Fourth Defendant was set up to help the Plaintiff increase its sales revenue**.

> He asserted during his cross-examination that the practice of using another company’s name to quote a higher price was also what ACCO Technology Pte Ltd was practicing and that PW1 should be aware of his practice. I noted that this was not deposed in his own affidavit of evidence-in-chief with the necessary documentary evidence in support nor was this put to PW1 when he was on the stand. In fact, the First Defendant chose not to even cross-examine PW1 when he was on the witness stand. This was also the same for the Fifth Defendant. She similarly had not put this assertion to PW1 when she had cross-examined PW1. **Accordingly, I disregarded this bare assertion made by the First Defendant.**

(emphasis added)

62     In essence, the trial judge rejected the 1st Defendant’s defence and found that “_arrangements were made by both Defendants_ \[i.e. the 1st and 2nd Defendants\] _for the Plaintiff to purchase goods from the Fourth Defendant which were unrelated to its business activities and thereby causing financial loss to the Plaintiff_”.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) The trial judge found that this was a breach of the 1st Defendant’s duties “_as an employee as well as a de facto director_” of the Plaintiff.[^57]

63     The Defendants did not specifically address this 3rd Head of Claim in their closing submissions.

64     Given that the trial judge had found that (i) the 1st Defendant breached his duties in making arrangements for the Plaintiff to purchase goods from the 4th Defendant; and (ii) these purchases were “_unrelated to \[the Plaintiff’s\] business activities_”,[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) the Plaintiff’s damage ought to be the full amount of the payments made unless the Defendants can show that the Plaintiff received some benefit from these purchases. There was no such evidence put forward by the Defendants and as mentioned, mitigation was in any event not pleaded.

65     Accordingly, I allowed the Plaintiff’s 3rd Head of Claim in full and assessed the damages for the 1st Defendant’s breach of contractual and/or fiduciary duties in procuring the Plaintiff to make purchases from the 4th Defendant which were unrelated to the Plaintiff’s business referred to at \[1(a)(i)\] of the 7 Sep IJ at $41,511.35.

66     For completeness, in allowing the 3rd Head of Claim in full I had considered whether doing so would result in double recovery for the Plaintiff in circumstances where the Plaintiff had a separate remedy for an account of the 4th Defendant’s profits. I did not think so. The account to be taken was of (amongst others) “_profits made by the Fourth Defendant as a result of the diversion of the business to the Fourth Defendant_”.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) The account of profits was therefore for transactions with _third parties_ which the 1st and 2nd Defendants had caused to be diverted to the 4th Defendant, and not the same transactions which were the subject of the 3rd Head of Clam (being transactions _between_ the _Plaintiff_ and the _4th Defendant_). There would therefore be no double recovery for damages to be assessed on this head of claim.

## Plaintiff’s 4th Head of Claim

67     The Plaintiff’s 4th Head of Claim was for the sum of $146,229 being revenue of the 4th Defendant from the diversion of businesses from the Plaintiff to the 4th Defendant, and secret profits made by the Defendants in 2014 and 2015 from such diversion.

68     For the reasons explained at \[28\] to \[36\] above, having been granted judgment and/or having elected for an account of profits, the Plaintiff was not entitled to any damages or equitable compensation in respect of this head of claim.

## The Rule Against Double Recovery

69     For the reasons given above, the aggregate sum I had assessed as damages for the Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd and 3rd Heads of Claim was $95,611.35.

70     This, however, was not the end of the matter because the Plaintiff had already received $35,000 from each of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (against whom the suit had discontinued) in full and final settlement of the claims against them.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) This raised the issue of double recovery should the Plaintiff be allowed to recover the full amounts assessed in these proceedings, and the Defendants urged me to take the settlement sums into account. The Plaintiff chose not to address the issue of double recovery at all in its closing submissions, even though the matter was raised during cross-examination.

71     The rule against double recovery is well established. The basic rule is that in assessing the plaintiff’s loss, any gain received by the plaintiff which he would not have received but for the injury or breach should _prima facie_ be taken into account: see _The MARA_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 31</span> at \[26\]. More generally, the concern of preventing double recovery is a matter of _fairness_ and a “_general concern throughout the law_”: see _Miao Weiguo v Tendcare Medical Group Holdings Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tian Jian Hua Xia Medical Group Holdings Pte Ltd) (in judicial management) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] 1 SLR 884</span> (“**_Miao Weiguo_**”) at \[176\] and \[177\]. The bottom-line is that damages should not be awarded twice over for what is substantially the same claim: see _Miao Weiguo_ at \[183\]. The manner in which this can be achieved is varied and depends on the circumstances of the case.

72     In this case, the Plaintiff’s claims against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were closely intertwined and substantially overlapping with its claims against the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants:

> (a)     In respect of the 1st Head of Claim, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the 1st and 2nd Defendants, as _de facto_ directors of the Plaintiff, caused and/or authorised the Plaintiff to make “_improper payments_” to the 3rd Defendant;[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61)

> (b)     In respect of the 2nd Head of Claim, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the 1st and 2nd Defendants, as _de facto_ directors of the Plaintiff, caused and/or authorised the Plaintiff to make “_unauthorised purchases_” using funds from the Plaintiff’s bank account;[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) and

> (c)     In respect of the 3rd Head of Claim, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the 1st and 2nd Defendants caused the Plaintiff to enter into “_unauthorised transactions_” with the 4th Defendant and made “_unauthorised payments_” to the 4th Defendant.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

73     In respect of the 3rd Head of Claim, the trial judge specially found that the 1st and 2nd Defendants together arranged for the Plaintiff to purchase goods from the 4th Defendant which were unrelated to the Plaintiff’s business, thereby causing loss to the Plaintiff.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

74     The foregoing meant that at least in respect of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Heads of Claim, the Plaintiff was claiming against _both_ the 1st and 2nd Defendants for the same loss. In these circumstances, I was of the view that the rule against double recovery was engaged and the settlement sum which the Plaintiff received from the 2nd and 3rd Defendants should be accounted for. Otherwise, the Plaintiff would be compensated twice over for what is substantially the same claim and for the same loss.

75     That having been said, the application of the rule against double recovery had to be tailored in this case to the specific claims and losses at hand. In respect of the 2nd and 3rd Heads of Claim, these had nothing to do with the 3rd Defendant. The 2nd and 3rd Heads of Claim related to unauthorised payments which the 1st and 2nd caused and/or procured the Plaintiff to make, and these payments were _not_ made to the 3rd Defendant. There was therefore no reason to take the settlement payment received from the 3rd Defendant into account in considering the sums to be awarded to the Plaintiff for these heads of claim.

76     Accordingly, I made the following deductions:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="42.0315936812638%"><col width="18.0163967206559%"><col width="22.5354929014197%"><col width="17.4165166966607%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Head(s) of Claim</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount(s) Initially Assessed</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount(s) Prohibited by Rule against Double Recovery</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Final Damages Allowed</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1<sup>st</sup> Head of Claim</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(improper payments to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$26,800</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$35,000</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(settlement payment from 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$0</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2<sup>nd</sup> Head of Claim</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(unauthorised purchases from third parties)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$27,300</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$35,000</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(settlement payment from 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$0</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3<sup>rd</sup> Head of Claim</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(unauthorised payments made to the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$41,511.35</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$7,700</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(being $35,000 less $27,300 of the settlement payment from 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$33,811.35</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

77     After taking into account the amounts reduced to prevent double recovery, the final damages assessed in respect of the 3rd Head of Claim was **$33,811.35**. The Plaintiff was not entitled to further damages in respect of the 1st and 2nd Heads of Claim.

78     Given that the 3rd Head of Claim related to payment made to the 4th Defendant in breach of the 1st and 2nd Defendant’s duties and interlocutory judgment was given for damages to be assessed against the 4th and 5th Defendants for “_knowingly assisting the 1st and 2nd Defendants in breach of their fiduciary obligations_”,[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) the obligations of the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants in respect of the 3rd Head of Claim should be joint and several.

## Interest

79     The Plaintiff sought interest on the damages assessed at the rate of 5.33% per annum from date of the writ of summons (i.e. 5 August 2016) to the date of judgment.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66) Ironically and rather generously, the Defendants submitted that the computation of interest (also at the rate of 5.33% per annum) should commence from 6 January 2015, being the date on which the first transaction for a competing product was made by the 4th Defendant.[^67]

80     Since this was the Plaintiff’s claim and since damages were in any event not assessed in respect of the transactions diverted to the 4th Defendant, I ordered that the Plaintiff be allowed interest on the final sum awarded (i.e. $33,811.35) at the rate of 5.33% per annum from date of writ (i.e. 5 August 2016) to the date of my decision.

## Costs

81     After giving my decision on damages, I directed parties to file further brief written submissions on costs. With the parties’ consent, the issue of costs was subsequently determined by me by way of a documents-only hearing, based on those written submissions.

82     The Plaintiff sought costs of $42,000 (excluding reasonable disbursements)[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) while the Defendants submitted that costs should be fixed at $9,000 (including reasonable disbursements).[^69] According to the Plaintiff, I should award costs _as if_ the Plaintiff had succeeded on a $95,611.35 claim, because I should disregard, for the purposes of costs only, the amount “_deducted_” pursuant to the rule against double recovery.[^70] This was a bare assertion with no authority cited and in which I saw no merits. The point was that the Plaintiff only obtained a final award of damages in the sum of $33,811.35. Whether that was a result of deductions having been made pursuant to the rule against double recovery, or because (for example) the Plaintiff failed to prove the quantum damages claimed was irrelevant in terms of considering the proportionality of the costs to the amount awarded.

83     On the Defendants’ part, the Defendants made yet another curious and unsubstantiated submission that any costs order I make “_shall be made against the three (3) Defendants separately_”.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) There was no elaboration on this bare submission and I could not discern any basis for this. The liability of the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants for the final amount assessed were joint and several and I did not see why costs should be ordered against each of these Defendants separately. Accordingly, I rejected this submission.

84     Having considered the matter, I ordered that costs of the proceedings (including the trial on liability) be paid by the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants jointly and severally to the Plaintiff fixed at $12,000 plus GST (if applicable). As the parties made no submissions on the quantum of disbursements, I further ordered that the Plaintiff’s reasonable disbursements for the trial and for the assessment of damages proceedings be paid by the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants jointly and severally, with the sum to be taxed if not agreed.

85     In coming to my decision on costs, I considered that the Plaintiff succeeded entirely against the 1st, 4th and 5th Defendants in the trial on liability, and the issues which arose there were intensely factual and of moderate complexity. Nonetheless, I awarded the Plaintiff costs on the lower end of the scale because I was of the view that significant times and costs had been wasted in these assessment proceedings by protracted submissions (from all parties) on the claim for an account of profits. For the reasons explained above, the remedy of an account of profit was not part of these assessment proceedings. The Plaintiff and the Defendants, despite having legal representation, failed to appreciate that an account of profit was a _different_ remedy from an award of damages. However, this was ultimately the Plaintiff’s claim. I was therefore of the view that the Plaintiff ought to bear the larger responsibility for the costs wasted in connection with the pursuit of the Plaintiff’s account of profit remedy in these assessment of damages proceedings.

86     To be clear, the costs ordered here were costs of the trial on liability and the assessment of damages proceedings before me. The costs of any proceedings for the taking of accounts is to be determined by the registrar or judge presiding over the taking of accounts proceedings.

## Conclusion

87     The Plaintiff’s action was commenced in 2016 and interlocutory judgments were given in 2018. After more than 5 years of litigation and despite having succeeded in full at the trial on liability, the Plaintiff only managed to obtain final judgment for but a mere fraction of its claims. The main thrust and the bulk of the Plaintiff’s claims relating to the diversion of businesses to the 4th Defendant and account of profits remained unresolved. Had some thought be given by any of the parties involved to the issue of _remedies_ earlier, this unfortunate situation would likely have been avoidable. But that, as the saying goes, was the way the cookie crumbled.
