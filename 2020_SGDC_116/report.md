Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Striking out

English Law – Applicability

5 May 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:

## Introduction

1       This pair of related Registrar’s Appeals concern the striking out of pleadings. They involve claims by Alexandra Hospital (“AH”) and National University Hospital (“NUH”) (collectively, “the Hospitals”) against a foreignworker for charges in connection with medical treatment. Registrar’s Appeal No 7 of 2020 concerns a claim by AH for $82,972.99.[^1] Registrar’s Appeal No 8 of 2020 is in respect of a claim by NUH for $213,258.85.[^2] The two cases turn on the same issues of facts and law. The parties agreed that they should be dealt with together. The two cases raised an interesting issue regarding the common law principle of necessitous intervention. It is a rather obscure principle of law, and there are no local authorities on this common law principle.

2       The first defendant, Janaed was an employee of the second defendant, Newtec Engineering Pte Ltd (“Newtec”). The first defendant was a foreign worker and Newtec was his work permit employers. On 8 November 2018, the first defendant was assigned to carry out works at Westgate Tower No. 1, Gateway Drive, Singapore 608531. While he was carrying out his task, he fell from a height of about three metres and landed on the floor of the chiller room in which he was working. He suffered substantial injuries. He was sent to NUH for medical treatment. He was subsequently transferred to AH for further medical care. It is not disputed that the first defendant was hospitalised for 91 days at NUH and 152 days at AH. The Hospitals each commenced proceedings[^3] against the first defendant and Newtec to recover the costs of medical treatment. Newtec did not enter appearance to either of the actions and judgments in default have been entered against Newtec by the Hospitals.

3       The Hospitals’ claims are based on the common law principle that in an emergency, provided the plaintiff has acted reasonably and _bona fide_ in the interests of the defendant, in order to protect the defendant’s property, health or other important interests, the plaintiff may recover the expenses he had incurred and reasonable remuneration for his services. It is a condition for recovery that it was impracticable to obtain the defendant’s instructions or authority. This is generally known as the common law principle of necessitous intervention. I will discuss this common law principle in detail further below.

4       The first defendant’s pleaded defence is that the Hospitals have no right of action against him in respect of the medical expenses and their right of action lies solely against Newtec. The first defendant contends as follows:[^4]

> (a)     The Hospitals had proceeded to treat the first defendant on the understanding that the full amount of the medical expenses would be paid for by Newtec and not by the first defendant.

> (b)     Newtec signed letters of guarantee in favour of the Hospitals, which implied that the first defendant would not have to bear any of the medical expenses.

> (c)     The invoices issued by the Hospitals were addressed solely to Newtec for payment.

> (d)     The first defendant has statutory privileges under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed), s 14 and the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (S569/2012), Fourth Schedule, Part III, Condition 1, which constitute a defence to the claims.[^5]

5       The Hospitals took out applications under the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), O 18 r 19(1) (“O 18 r 19(1)”) to strike out the first defendant’s defence. The first defendant’s answer to the applications was essentially that he has a good defence as Newtec his employers should be solely liable for the claims. In this regard, he relied on the contentions as stated above.

6       The learned Deputy Registrar disagreed with the first defendant. He found that the first defendant has no reasonable cause of defence to the claims. He struck out the first defendant’s defences filed in the Hospitals’ suits and entered judgment against the first defendant on the claims. In doing so, he also accepted the Hospitals’ submissions that there is a common law principle in respect of emergency medical treatment.[^6] The first defendant appealed and the Registrar’s Appeals were argued before me.

## Issues to be determined

7       The issues to be determined are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the first defendant has a reasonable cause of defence.

> (b)     Whether the common law principle of necessitous intervention applies in Singapore.

## The first issue: whether the first defendant has a reasonable cause of defence

8       The law on striking out pleadings is uncontroverted. To successfully strike out a pleading or endorsement under O 18 r 19(1), one of the following limbs must be satisfied:

> (a)     it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;

> (b)     it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;

> (c)     it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or

> (d)     it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.

9       The Hospitals relied on O 18 r 19(1)(a), O 18 r 19(1)(b) and O 18 r 19(1)(d) in the hearing before the learned Deputy Registrar.[^7] The legal principles in respect of these limbs of O 18 r 19(1) are generally accepted as trite, and I will touch on them only briefly.

10     In respect of the ground of no reasonable cause of action or defence under O 18 r 19(1)(a), the test which must be satisfied before pleadings can be struck out is stringent: _Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin and others \[1997\] 3 SLR 649_ (“_Gabriel Peter”_). In _Gabriel Peter_, it was held that the power to strike out should only be exercised in plain and obvious cases and should not be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case in order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. A reasonable cause of action was defined as one that has some chance of success when _only_ the allegations in the pleading are considered. It is also said that so long as the statement of claim or the particulars disclose some cause of action, or raise some question fit to be decided by a judge, the mere fact that the case is weak, and not likely to succeed, is no ground for striking it out: _Singapore Civil Procedure_ vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 2018) at \[18/19/10\]. The above was articulated in reference to a cause of action, but would apply in the same manner to a cause of defence.

11     As regards pleadings that are said to be scandalous, frivolous or vexatious under O 18 r 19(1)(b), it was held in _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 546</span>, (“_Bunga Melati_”) at \[32\] & \[33\], that the test is whether a party’s action is “plainly unsustainable or obviously unsustainable”. The Court of Appeal in _Bunga Melati_ further explained at \[39\] that unsustainability can be in one of two forms. One is legal unsustainability, in which case it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy he seeks. The other is factual unsustainability, where it is possible to say with confidence before trial the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance. In other words, the phrase “plainly or obviously unsustainable” is ascribed two meanings. The Court of Appeal applied a fact-law distinction in this regard. Unsustainability can be either on a legal ground or on a factual ground.

12     As for O 18 r 19(1)(d), it is generally accepted as a residuary ground. It gives the court in circumstances not covered in the first three limbs of O 18 r 19(1) the express power to strike out an action (or a defence). It confers powers which the court might exercise under its inherent jurisdiction where there appears to be an abuse of process. The commonly accepted test in respect of this limb is whether the action or defence was for an ulterior or collateral purpose.

13     The Hospitals are proceeding only on the basis of the first limb of O 18 r 19(1)(a) at the hearing before me.[^8] The question before me in respect of the first issue is thus whether the first defendant has a reasonable cause of defence.

14     At the outset, I note that the first defendant does not deny that he had received medical treatment from the Hospitals. He took the same position at the hearing before the learned Deputy Registrar. The first defendant’s case however, was that the medical expenses were only incurred because Newtec, the employers gave letters of guarantee to the Hospitals that they would pay for the medical expenses. The first defendant contended that it was always on the basis that Newtec would pay for his medical expenses that the Hospitals proceeded with treatment. In this regard, the first defendant relied heavily on the letters of guarantee given by Newtec to show that the Hospitals had all along expected Newtec to pay for the medical expenses.[^9] The first defendant therefore submitted that the Hospitals should not be looking to him for payment of the medical expenses.

15     The first defendant’s further contended that the invoices for the medical expenses was directed to Newtec. The first defendant argued that as such, there was nothing to indicate that the first defendant was to be liable for the medical expenses he had incurred. The first defendant submitted that there was nothing in his Defence that contradicted the documents, namely the letters of guarantee and the invoices for the medical expenses.[^10]

16     The first defendant further referred to statutory provisions which he said clearly imposed a duty on Newtec, his employers, to be responsible for their employees’ medical expenses. In particular, the first defendant submitted that the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (S569/2012), Fourth Schedule, Part III, Condition 1 is relevant on the facts of this case as it stipulated that:[^11]

> 1\. Except as the Controller specifies otherwise in writing, the employer is responsible for and must bear the costs of the foreign employee’s upkeep (excluding the provision of food) and maintenance in Singapore. This includes the provision of medical treatment…

17     The first defendant asserted the above provision created a non-delegable statutory duty on the employers to provide for his medical treatment. This in turn, according to the first defendant, meant that he should not be the party to pay for his medical treatment.[^12]

18     It would be seen that the arguments the first defendant laid before the learned Deputy Registrar as set out above pivot on which party should be liable to pay the Hospitals for his medical expenses. The first defendant argued that Newtec was the party which should pay instead of him. I will now examine each of the first defendant’s contentions in this regard.

19     I turn first to the argument that it was on the understanding that the full amount of the medical charges would be paid for by Newtec that the Hospitals had proceeded to treat the first defendant. I do not see how that is an answer to the question of whether the first defendant is liable for the medical expenses. The Hospitals might have proceeded to treat the first defendant with the expectation that Newtec would pay for the medical expenses incurred. However, there is no reason why they could not claim the expenses from the first defendant. Simply put, even if the Hospitals had proceeded to treat the first defendant on that assurance by his employer, it does not follow that the Hospitals cannot look to the first defendant for the medical expenses. It is not a matter that the first defendant could use as a defence to the claim against him.

20     Further, and in any event, it would appear that the first defendant’s assertion that the Hospitals had proceeded to treat him on the understanding that the full amount of the medical expenses would be paid for by Newtec, remains just that. It is an understanding attributed to the Hospitals by the first defendant. It is unilateral. There is no basis offered by the first defendant to support his assertion.

21     I turn next to the letters of guarantee provided to the Hospitals by Newtec. Similarly, that there were such letters do not imply that the first defendant would not have to bear any of the medical expenses. The letters of guarantee gave the Hospitals the _option_ of looking to Newtec for the costs of treating the first defendant. They do not however _prevent_ them from recovering any unpaid medical expenses from the first defendant. The first defendant is conflating the two different questions.

22     The next contention concerns the invoices for medical expenses issued by the Hospitals being addressed solely to Newtec for payment. In my view, this is plainly neither here or there. I fail to see in what way on its own it raises a defence. That the Hospitals had invoiced Newtec does not mean they have no claim against the first defendant. The first defendant’s contention appears to be another way of saying that there can be no claim against the first defendant for the medical expenses without the Hospitals first having invoiced him. I see no merit in this proposition. It is not a defence to the Hospitals’ claims.

23     Finally, in respect of the various statutory provisions that impose a duty on Newtec, as employers, to be responsible for the first defendant’s medical expenses, these provisions concern the duty owed by Newtec to the first defendant in regard to costs of medical treatment. They do not address the question of the liability of the first defendant to the Hospitals for the medical expenses. The first defendant is conflating his obligations to the Hospitals with the obligations to _him_ by his employers for the medical expenses. These are two different obligations in law. His employers’ obligations to him for his medical expenses is not a defence to the claims against him by the Hospitals. The first defendant cannot rely on these obligations in answer to the claims against him. He remains liable to the Hospitals for the medical expenses. By the same token, the first defendant fulfilling his obligations to the Hospitals for the medical expenses would not obviate Newtec’s obligations to him for the said medical expenses.

24     It follows from my analysis of the first defendant’s contentions above that I find no merits in any of them. I disagree with the proposition that just because Newtec might be liable for the first defendant’s costs of medical treatment that it would follow that the first defendant is not liable. In my view, the first defendant had failed to make out such a case. In this regard, I am in complete agreement with the learned Deputy Registrar, who had come to the same conclusion. The first defendant’s defence has no chance of success. There is no question to be decided at a trial. Applying the principles in _Gabriel Peter_ referred to above, I find that the first defendant has no reasonable cause of defence.

## The second issue: whether the common law principle of necessitous intervention applies in Singapore

### The Hospitals’ Statements of Claim

25     I have discussed the first defendant’s defence in the foregoing. I have found that the first defendant does not have a reasonable cause of defence. As the matter before me concerns the striking out of the first defendant’s pleadings, that would have been the end of the matter. However, as alluded to above, there is the question in relation to the common law principle of necessitous intervention. The Hospitals’ cause of action is premised on this common law principle. As such, it necessitates me to turn first to their pleadings, before discussing the common law principle of necessitous intervention.

26     In regard to the Hospital’s pleadings, I note that the Hospitals did not in their Statements of Claim refer expressly to the common law principle of necessitous intervention. The first defendant’s counsel made the same observation at the hearing before me. I note however that the Hospitals made it clear at both the hearings before the learned Deputy Registrar and before me that their cause of action is based on necessitous intervention. They also made submissions in writing on the common law principle for both the hearings. There are two related points in this regard.

27     The first is that whilst the ROC states that a party _may_ by his pleading raise any point of law, it does not _require_ points of law to be pleaded _per se_: ROC, O 18 r 11. The common law principle of necessitous intervention is strictly speaking a legal principle. In my view therefore, there is no requirement for it to be specifically pleaded in a statement of claim.

28     The second point, which is related to the first, has to do with the meaning of a “cause of action”. There has been uncertainty surrounding the definition of a “cause of action”. It has often been conflated with legal principle, and in some instances, with relief and remedy. The Court of Appeal rendered the much needed clarification on what constitutes a “cause of action” in_Multistar Holdings Ltd v Geocon Piling & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 1</span>. The Court of Appeal held at \[34\] that “cause of action” simply means the essential factual material that supports a claim. In the present case, whilst the Hospitals’ Statements of Claim are brief, in my view, they contained the essential facts of the first defendant having received medical treatment from the Hospitals, and the costs of the medical treatment, in support of their claims against the first defendant. In my assessment, the Hospitals’ cause of action premised on the common law principle of necessitous intervention has been adequately pleaded. I find therefore that the Hospitals’ Statements of Claim are in order.

### The common law position

29     I turn now to the issue of the principle of necessitous intervention. In this regard, there was an intimation by the first defendant at the hearing before the learned Deputy Registrar that it could be an issue in these related cases. It was however, in the form of no more than a mention in passing, in a single sentence, in the first defendant’s written submissions filed for the hearing before the learned Deputy Registrar. The first defendant had merely asserted that the Hospitals had not discharged their burden of proving that the common law principle of necessitous intervention is applicable in Singapore.[^13] I note that the first defendant did not raise any legal argument in this regard. More importantly, I also note that the first defendant did not plead any _factual_ matrix in support of any argument on the inapplicability or the improper application of the said common law principle. No argument was raised at the hearing before the learned Deputy Registrar against the Hospitals’ cause of action in necessitous intervention.

30     However, at the hearing before me, the first defendant presented arguments for the first time, that the common law principle of necessitous intervention does not apply in Singapore. In fact, the first defendant questioned whether necessitous intervention is recognised under English law. I will now examine these two related questions of firstly, whether necessitous intervention is a legal principle recognised under English law; and secondly, whether it is applicable in Singapore. As mentioned above, there are no local authorities on the common law principle of necessitous intervention.

31     Generally speaking, the principle of necessitous intervention involves a claim by a stranger for expenses incurred in the necessary intervention by him in the affairs of a person for his benefit, and in situation where the person is unable to give express consent to the intervention. It would appear that English law does recognise the legal principle of necessitous intervention as a cause of action, at least in cases involving medical treatment. This is so despite the fact that English law is still in a state of flux in this regard, and the basis for the principle remains unclear.

32     I will begin my analysis by first turning to the cases referred to by the first defendant in support of his contention that English law does not recognise the principle of necessitous intervention. The first defendant refers to three cases for this purpose.

33     The first case the first defendant refers to support the proposition that the common law principle of necessitous intervention in not recognised by the English courts is the case of _The Goring_ \[1987\] 2 W.L.R 1151 (“_The Goring”_). In _The Goring_, a small passenger vessel was seen by the claimants drifting down a non-tidal stretch of the Thames. The claimants, on their own accord, decided to haul the vessel, thereby securing it to a vacant mooring. The claimants commenced an action for salvage services against the owners of the vessel. The English Court of Appeal held that there was no established right to recover a salvage reward for services rendered to vessel in not-tidal waters of England. In the judgment at 1162H, Ralph Gibson LJ made a comment that common law has never recognised any general doctrine of necessitous intervention. The first defendant relies on this statement. In my view however, there are two matters to note about the case. Firstly, the case concerned salvage services rendered and the issue was whether the salvors were entitled to salvage awards for salvage in non-tidal waters of England. It is plain that the issue before the court was narrow and specific. A perusal of the judgment will reveal that the discussion centred on the scope of admiralty jurisdiction and the extension of the jurisdiction to non-tidal waters in England. Second, and more importantly, Ralph Gibson LJ himself entertained the possibility of the doctrine of necessitous intervention applying to recovery of expenses reasonably incurred and to claims for remuneration in cases of professional services. This was the backdrop against which he gave his view that the doctrine did not extend to salvage claims. In my view therefore this case does not stand for the proposition advanced by the first defendant.

34     The next case that the first defendant refers to is the case of _Allen v Waters and Company_ <span class="citation">\[1935\] 1 KB 200</span>. The case involved an action by a tenant against his landlord in respect of injury to the tenant’s wife caused by the breach of the landlord’s duty to keep the premises in repair. The lower court awarded the tenant a sum for damages which included an amount claimed by the county council for the wife’s expenses at a hospital provided by them. The English Court of Appeal upheld the decision for the landlord to pay the hospital expenses to the tenant, and for the payment to be paid over to the county council. The English Court of Appeal relied on statutory powers under local government legislations, which imposed a liability on the patient, or anyone who had a duty to maintain the patient, to pay the county council. The first defendant seeks to use this decision to support the proposition that “in England in 1932, the liability for the patient to pay his medical expenses is a statutory liability rather than common law liability”.[^14] In my view, there are several difficulties with the first defendant’s contention. Firstly, I do not see how the case can be authority for the proposition suggested. Plainly, that in the case the court has relied on statutory provisions to impose a liability in respect of hospital expenses does not imply that there is no co-existing common law liability. Second, the facts of the case were centred on liability to the county council under local government legislations. No general proposition of law could be drawn. More importantly, nowhere in the judgment is there any support for the contention that the principle of necessitous intervention is not recognised in English law. I do not see how the case can assist the first defendant.

35     The last case which the first defendant relies on in support of his contention is the House of Lord decision in _Hunt v Severs_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 2 A.C. 350</span>. The first defendant’s reliance on this case can be addressed shortly, without the need to refer to the facts of the case. The first defendant refers to a single sentence in the judgment at p 358F: “The law with respect to the services of a third party who provides voluntary care for a tortuously injured plaintiff has developed somewhat erratically in England”. On the basis of this statement, the first defendant asserts that it remains unclear whether the common law principle of necessitous intervention has been adopted in England.[^15] I do not see how this statement supports the first defendant’s assertion and I disagree that the case is authority for the proposition advanced by the first defendant. If at all, the case supports my allusion above to English law still being in a state of flux in regard to the concept of necessitous intervention.

36     I will now discuss the case where the common law principle of necessitous intervention in the context of medical treatment was first articulated. This is the decision of the House of Lords in _Managers of The Metropolitan Asylum District v Federick Hill and others_ <span class="citation">(1881) 6 App Cas 193</span> (“_Metropolitan_”). The Hospitals in their further submissions[^16] referred to a passage by Lord Blackburn at p 204, which states as follows:

> Those who have the charge of a sick person, if he is helpless (whether the disease be infectious or not) are, at Common Law, under a legal obligation to do, to the best of their ability, what is necessary for the preservation of the sick person. And the sick person, if not helpless, is bound to do so for his own sake.

37     In the context of the facts of the case, the above passage was made in respect of the duties of a manager of a workhouse who had charge of a sick person with an infectious disease. The House of Lords held that there was a common law obligation on a manager with custody of such a sick person to avoid spreading the infection in order to protect the public. However, it should be noted the words “whether the disease be infectious or not”, were specifically added. It was plainly intended to put forward the proposition that the same principle applies even where the sickness is not infectious. Further, and importantly, by stating the rationale for the duties as “necessary for the preservation of the sick person”, the passage alluded to the requirement of necessity, which is a key element of the principle of necessitous intervention. In my view however, the most pertinent reference is to the helpless state of the sick person and that if not so helpless, the sick person is bound to do what is necessary for his own sake. The allusion here is to the inability of the sick person to agree to the medical intervention, which would be in his interest. The inability of the recipient of medical intervention to agree to treatment is another key feature of the concept of necessitous intervention. I will return to this aspect further below.

38     Next, I turn to the Canadian case of _Matheson v Smiley_ Vol 40, Man. R. 247. The Canadian Court of Appeal awarded medical expenses claimed by a surgeon who unsuccessfully treated a man who intentionally shot himself. The executrix of the man’s estate was ordered to pay the medical expenses, despite the finding that the wounded man was in such a condition that it could not be construed that he requested or even acquiesced in being treated. The Canadian Court of Appeal at p 249 relied on the passage above from _Metropolitan_, noting that “common law takes notice of such emergencies and declares to be a duty what is almost invariably done as human impulse”.

39     The Canadian Court of Appeal also averred as follows at p 249:

> I think it is not within reason that even in such circumstances as are revealed here a person in such a plight should simply be allowed to die without an effort being made by those in contact with him and without resort to all reasonable means to secure his recovery that may be at hand to them. And surely the person to pay should be the person for whose benefit the service is rendered. I hardly think it an answer to say in any case there was no hope. In such circumstances no one gives up while a spark remains.

40     In awarding the medical expenses claimed by the surgeon, the Canadian Court of Appeal made it clear that it was not on the basis of any implied contract. Rather, the obligation to pay was based on necessity.

41     In considering the two cases involving medical treatment above, what would be discernible is the notion of intervening to provide medical treatment in a situation of emergency, where the recipient of the medical treatment is incapable of affirming the provision of the treatment. This is the central concept of the common law principle of necessitous intervention.

42     It would be seen that at the heart of the principle is necessity. It appears that necessitous intervention has its roots in the defence of necessity: see generally, Duncan Sheehan, “Negotiorum Gestio: A Civilian Concept in the Common Law?” (2006) 55 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 253. Necessity provided a defence to any intentional torts committed by the intervener in the course of intervention. Pivoting on necessity as an unjust factor, the defence of necessity is then extended to provide a cause of action to the intervener to recover his expenses and any loss suffered during the intervention. This is manifested in the form of necessitous intervention, particularly applicable in situations of medical emergency, where the intervention to provide medical treatment is borne out of necessity.

43     The principle of necessitous intervention addresses some of the traditional concerns in imposing liability on the person who received medical treatment in such situations. These concerns would include the imposing of liability without the agreement or knowledge of the person treated, the lack of opportunity for the person treated to decline treatment, the infringement of the personal autonomy of the person treated and the intervener acting in his own interest. In response to these concerns, the overarching requirement under the principle of necessitous intervention is necessity. The other requirements would include not acting against the known wishes of the person treated and the treatment must be in his interest.

44     Distilling the various requirements, I suggest that the elements of the common law principle of necessitous intervention in the context of medical treatment to be as follows:

> (a)     There must be a reasonable necessity to intervene to provide the medical treatment.

> (b)     The intervention must be reasonable and in the interest of the recipient of the medical treatment.

> (c)     The intervention should not be against any express wish of the recipient.

> (d)     It must be impractical to communicate with the recipient regarding the treatment.

45     The four elements address the disparate concerns discussed, including questions of imposing liability without agreement or knowledge, infringement of personal autonomy and the intervener acting in his own interest.

46     Returning to the question posed by the first defendant in respect of the principle of necessitous intervention, in view of the foregoing, I therefore hold that there is indeed such a common law principle recognised in English Law. Whilst necessitous intervention does not fall easily into any of the traditional heads of claim, the authorities support the view that it has been part of the common law of England, in particular in respect of medical treatment.

47     As for the related question of whether the principle of necessitous intervention is applicable in Singapore, the answer follows that it forms part of Singapore law pursuant to the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed), s 3(1):

> 3(1) The common law of England (including the principles and rules of equity), so far as it was part of the law of Singapore immediately before 12th November 1993, shall continue to be part of the law of Singapore.

48     Recognising the principle of necessitous intervention in Singapore is consistent with public policy considerations. We should not impose a legal burden on a hospital to obtain from a patient who is sent to their emergency department, both the consent to the treatment and the agreement to pay, before rendering medical treatment, particularly when the patient is taken to the hospital unconscious.

49     The above deals with the interesting question of whether necessitous intervention is a valid cause of action in Singapore. I have answered the question in the affirmative. To re-cap, that is the question raised by the first defendant in response to the Hospitals’ application to strike out his defence. For completeness, I will also add that the elements of the principle of necessitous intervention I have proposed above are satisfied on the facts of the case. Given the circumstances under which the first defendant was admitted to the Hospitals, there can be no dispute that the treatment was necessary and in the interest of the first defendant. There can be no dispute too that it was impractical to communicate with the first defendant regarding the treatment, or that the treatment was not against any express wish of the first defendant. There is also no basis to believe that the Hospitals’ intervention was unreasonable in any way. In this regard, the first defendant has raised the question of the reasonableness of the costs of the medical treatment at the hearing before me. There are however no facts pleaded by the first defendant in this regard. As I have noted earlier, the first defendant in fact did not plead any facts in support of any argument on the inapplicability or the improper application of the common law principle. There is no basis for me to make any finding that the costs of the Hospitals’ medical treatment, or their intervention, was in any way unreasonable.

## Conclusion

50     In conclusion, in view of all of the foregoing, I find that the first defendant does not have a reasonable cause of defence. I further hold that the common law principle of necessitous intervention applies in Singapore and the Hospitals have a valid cause of action against the first defendant. In the premises, I dismiss both of the Registrar’s Appeals. Parties are to file short written submissions on the question of costs (including quantum), limited to 5 pages, within 14 days hereof for my consideration.

51     That the issue of necessitous intervention raised an interesting question does not detract from the fact that this is a tragic case. I am mindful of the consequences this decision might have on the first defendant, who suffered severe injuries in a foreign land after having left home and country to seek a better life. He is now facing the liability for a large amount of money. However, I am bound to decide in accordance with my findings on the facts and law.
