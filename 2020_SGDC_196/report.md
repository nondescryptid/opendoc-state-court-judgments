### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Introduction

> (a)     **DAC-935180-2017 – 1st Charge**

> …are charged that you, on 29 September 2016, in Singapore, did dishonestly receive stolen property namely, a sum of USD 88,000, equivalent to SGD 118,360 (Singapore Dollars One hundred and eighteen thousand three hundred and sixty), into your Citibank account no: XXX, which you had reason to believe was stolen property and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 411 (1) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).

> …are charged that you, sometime in 2017 in Singapore, being concerned in an arrangement, to wit, you provided your Maybank bank account no. XXX to one David Bay, having reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, the retention by the said David Bay of his benefits of criminal conduct is facilitated, and having reasonable grounds to believe that the said David Bay has engaged in criminal conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 44(1)(a) and punishable under section 44(5)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A.

The accused also consented to have 16 charges for offences under ss 44(1)(a), 47(2)(b) and 47(3) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”) in DAC-919469-2018, DAC-919471-2018 to DAC-919483-2018, DAC-935182-2017 and DAC-935184-2017 taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentence.

2       As the accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification, I imposed the following sentences on her:

3       Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012), I ordered the sentences for two charges, namely DAC-935180-2017 and DAC-919470-2018 to run consecutively. The sentences for the remaining two charges namely DAC-935181-2017 and DAC-919468-2018 were ordered to run concurrently. Her global sentence was 20 months’ imprisonment.

4       The accused then sought a deferment of the commencement of her sentences to 17 August 2020 to settle her personal affairs. I ordered her imprisonment term to commence on 17 August 2020 and extended her existing agency bail. Nevertheless, on 13 August 2020, she filed a notice of appeal against the sentences. The accused has since surrendered herself on 17 August 2020 to commence serving her sentences.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Statement of Facts

6       The accused had admitted the following facts:

> 1    The accused is Ng Koon Lay.

> FACTS RELATING TO DAC-935180-2017 & DAC-935181-2017

> 2    Sometime in March 2015, the accused got acquainted with an unknown person known as ‘Greg L Johnson’ through Facebook. They stayed in contact over Facebook and phone.

> 3    As the accused was in some financial difficulty, she requested for a loan from Greg. Sometime in August 2016, Greg told the accused that a friend of his was willing to provide a $9,000 loan to the accused. However, the accused was to provide her bank account to receive some funds. She was to forward the funds to a designated bank account, and was allowed to deduct the loan sum from the monies she received. The accused then provided a UOB bank account (XXX) to Greg. A sum of $71,000 was received in the UOB account, and the accused transferred $62,000 to another bank account as instructed.

> 4    On 22 September 2016, the accused received a call from the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”), asking her to attend an interview on 23 September 2016. Over the phone, the accused was given a warning not to receive any more monies in her bank account as her bank account had been used to receive illegal funds.

> 5    The $71,000 received in the UOB account was transferred by the victim of an e-mail spoofing scam. The victim had received an e-mail, purporting to be from his employer, to transfer $71,000 from the company’s bank account to the UOB account.

> 6    On 23 September 2016, the accused attended the CAD interview and was again warned not to use her bank account to receive funds from unknown persons, and to stop contacting Greg. The accused was also told that if she received any further funds from Greg, she was to report the matter to the Police. The accused then surrendered her Facebook account to CAD.

> 7    After the 23 September 2016 interview, she set up a second Facebook account in order to keep in contact with Greg, despite CAD’s warnings. The accused then asked Greg for a further loan. Greg asked the accused to receive another sum of money in her bank account, and in exchange, she would get a $6,500 loan.

> 8    On 29 September 2016, the accused received USD88,000 (approximately $118,360) in her Citibank account (XXX). Using this money, she then transferred $89,860 to a bank account belonging to a company, Pak Multi Metal Pte Ltd (DBS XXX) on 30 September 2016 at about 2. 13 p.m. The company belonged to one Muhammad Sabir Malik.

> 9    The accused also transferred $22,000 to a bank account belonging to one Ong Siew Cheng Gina. The accused retained $6,500 which she used for her own purposes.

> 10    The complainant, Piers Gerald Bennett, is the director of Accelero Holdings Limited (Accelero). Accelero is a company registered in Singapore and had an OCBC bank account. A staff member of Accelero had received an e-mail, purporting to be from the complainant, instructing the staff member to transfer USD88,000 to the accused’s Citibank account. The complainant did not send the e-mail. Being so deceived, the staff member complied with the instructions and transferred the USD88,000 to the accused’s Citibank account.

> 11    The USD88,000 that the accused received in her bank account were thus stolen property, being the proceeds of a s. 420 Penal Code offence. The Second Schedule to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”) includes s. 420 Penal Code offences as a serious offence, which constitutes “criminal conduct” as defined in s. 2 of the CDSA. The funds were thus benefits of criminal conduct.

> 12    Given CAD’s warnings to the accused on 22 and 23 September 2016, the accused had reason to believe that the USD88,000 she received in her Citibank account was stolen property, and correespondingly, she had reasonable grounds to believe that the $89,860 which she transferred to the Pak Multi Metal’s DBS account were another person’s benefits of criminal conduct.

> 13    By reason of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s. 411 of the Penal Code when she received the USD88,000 in her Citibank account and an offence under s. 47(2)(b) and punishable under s. 47(6) of the CDSA, when she transferred $89,860 from the Citibank account to Pak Multi Metal’s DBS account.

> FACTS RELATING TO DAC-919468-2018 & DAC-919470-2018

> 14    Sometime in 2015, the accused got acquainted with an unknown person known as ‘David Bay’ online. They stayed in contact over Whatsapp.

> 15    Sometime in 2017, David contacted the accused and told her that he needed her to provide bank accounts to receive funds. The funds were purportedly to pay for David’s hospitalisation fees and for his business. In return, the accused would be allowed to use some of the funds she received for David. The accused agreed to help David. Pursuant to this, the accused opened the following bank accounts:

>> a.    Maybank XXX (“Maybank account”) on 4 August 2017; and

>> b.    CIMB XXX (“CIMB account”) on 14 August 2017.

> 16    After opening the bank accounts, the accused mailed the ATM cards and their PIN to a Malaysian addressed that David provided. 17 When opening the CIMB account, the accused had also applied for internet banking.She thus retained control of the CIMB account through internet banking, despite mailing the ATM card overseas.

> 18    Between 4 September 2017 and 18 September 2017, 4 victims of internet love scams had transferred a total of $47,050 into the Maybank account.

> 19    Between 18 August 2017 and 27 August 2017, a victim of an internet love scam had transferred a total of $174,750 into the CIMB account.

> 20    The monies that were transferred into the Maybank and CIMB accounts were mostly withdrawn via ATM overseas. The accused used part of the funds transferred into the CIMB account for her own purposes.

> 21    The 5 victims were thus victims of s. 420 Penal Code offences. The Second Schedule to the CCDSA includes s. 420 Penal Code offences as a serious offence, which constitutes “criminal conduct” as defined in s. 2 of the CDSA. The funds that were received in the Maybank and CIMB accounts were thus benefits of criminal conduct.

> 22    By opening the Maybank and CIMB accounts and sending the ATM cards to David in Malaysia, the accused had entered into arrangements with David. She had reasonable grounds to believe that by these arrangements, she would have facilitated David’s retention of his benefits of criminal conduct.

> 23    At the material time, the accused had already been given repeated warnings by CAD not to provide her bank accounts to receive funds from unknown persons, and was in fact under 2 separate sets of investigations when she opened the Maybank and CIMB accounts. Despite this, she agreed to help David, whom she had never met before. The accused was also aware that David had lied to her, as David had continued to correspond with the accused over Whatsapp, despite claiming to be incarcerated in prison. The accused thus had reasonable grounds to believe that David was a person who engaged in criminal conduct.

> 24    By reason of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s. 44(1)(a) and punishable under s. 44(5)(a) of the CDSA.

> 25    At present, a sum of $2,600.74 remains in the Maybank account.

## Antedecents

7       The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

8       The Prosecution had sought a global custodial sentence of at least 22 months’ for the four proceeded charges.

#### s. 411 Penal Code offence (USD88,000)

9       It was submitted that a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed in respect of the charge under s 411 of the Penal Code. It was highlighted that the maximum sentence for s. 411(1) offences is five years’ imprisonment.

#### Aggravating factors

10     It was the Prosecution’s case that the present case involved the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     Significant sum involved;

> (b)     She ignored CAD’s specific warning about Greg and maintained contact with Greg even after surrendering her Facebook account;

> (c)     Multiple offences were taken into consideration.

11     In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution had relied on the following sentencing precedents as set out below:

#### s. 47(2)(b) CDSA offence ($89,860)

12     It was submitted that a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed in respect of the charge under s. 47(2)(b) CDSA. The maximum sentence for this offence under s. 47(6) CDSA is ten years imprisonment.

13     The aggravating factors were as listed above at \[10\] above as the tainted funds transferred came out of those funds that were received under the s. 411 of the Penal Code offence.

14     It was highlighted that her co-accused Muhammad Sabir Malik, the second layer money-mule was convicted on a corresponding charge for receiving this sum of money and was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment. He had faced only two charges in total _ie_ only one instance of receiving the money and subsequently handing it over to an unknown person.

15     It was the Prosecution’s case that the starting point should therefore be seven months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the accused was more culpable given the higher number of TIC offences. Given that, an slight uplift to eight months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

#### s. 44(1)(a) CDSA offences ($47,050 and $174,750)

16     It was the Prosecution’s case that a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment and 14 months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed in respect of the charges under s. 44(1)(a) CDSA on account of the tainted funds in each bank account. The Prosecution had urged the Court to adopt the harm-culpability matrix sentencing framework in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_:

![]([2020] SGDC 0196_Image/[2020] SGDC 0196_image1.png)

17     Based on the sums involved, it was submitted that the harm ought to be in the slight to moderate range and the culpability ought to be in the medium range. It was highlighted that the point of divergence was that the Defence had pegged it as low culpability while the Prosecution had pegged it at medium culpability.

18     It was the Prosecution’s case that she was given a direct warning by CAD, she was under investigations by CAD that she was receiving funds from criminals and that she had been receiving the funds in her bank account. Yet she repeatedly chose to ignore these warnings and continued doing what she did. It was submitted that this was not a case of an accused doing it for the first time.

19     It was further submitted that the charges were framed under the “reasonable grounds to believe” limb as opposed to the “knowing” limb. Therefore, as a starting point, the culpability of the accused logically should be assessed as lower than that of an accused who was charged under the “knowing” limb.

20     In the present case, as the accused had repeatedly ignored CAD’s specific warnings and was at least partly motivated by pecuniary gain, it was the Prosecution’s case that the culpability of the accused ought to be assessed at the lower end of the medium category. It was further submitted that the starting point should thus be ten months’ imprisonment (for the charge involving $47,050) and 18 months’ imprisonment (for the charge involving $174,750) for claim trial cases.

21     As the accused had pleaded guilty, a sentencing discount could be applied. Balancing the sentencing discount for pleading guilty against the TIC charges, it was submitted that the sentences should be adjusted to eight months’ imprisonment and 14 months’ imprisonment respectively.

#### Global Sentence

22     It was submitted that as the accused had been convicted and sentenced on four charges, at least two sentences must run consecutively: s. 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. It was submitted that the sentences for DAC- 935180-2017 and DAC-919470-2018 should run consecutively as the offences involved the accused laundering criminal proceeds for two different online personas. The total sentence should therefore be 22 months’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation and Defence’s submissions on sentence

23     In his written plea in mitigation, it was highlighted that the accused’s highest educational standard is a Bachelor of Arts in History from Nanyang University in 1977. She was unemployed after graduation and looked after her elderly parents until she was employed by the People’s Association from March 1982, working as an administrative staff in a community centre for 35 years until 10 April 2018. This was after CAD informed the People’s Association that she was charged and her employment was thereby terminated. Prior to her being charged, she last held the post as a Constituency Manager with People’s Association earning about $5,000 per month. The accused worked as a clerk earning only a meagre salary of $1,500 per month since October 2019.

24     The accused is single. She currently resides with her handicapped 71-year old elder sister, Mdm Ng Wuat Lay who is suffering from schizophrenia, depression, incontinence and is wheel-chair bound. The accused is the primary caregiver of her elder sister since 1980 for about 40 years.

### Brief Facts leading to offences

#### Charges involving Greg Johnson (DAC 935180/2017 & DAC 935181/2017)

25     The accused had befriended Greg since 2015 through Facebook and they communicated through calls, emails and Facebook Messenger. Although she had never met Greg before, her constant communications with him led to her believing that he was a 58 year old gentleman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Greg wooed her love and she fell prey to his courtship.

26     According to her Counsel, Greg told her that he was a sailor and to avoid privacy problems, he wanted to deliver some documents and substantial money in a luggage to her safekeeping so that they can marry and live together in comfort. However, Greg’s luggage was apparently detained in delivery transit at Malaysia and Mdm Ng was contacted by a Malaysian company Transworld Delivery & Security Company Sdn (“Transworld”), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

27     The accused was contacted by one Ms Siti Binti Halina Abidi of Transworld who informed her that Greg’s luggage was detained by Malaysian Customs as it contained more than US$1 million cash. She was told by Siti and Greg that she needed to pay monies to Malaysian Customs through a Halifax Bank account before the luggage can be released to her. As part of the ruse to let her believe the authenticity of the claim, she visited the Transworld office at Kuala Lumpur from 7-8 November 2014 whereby she was introduced to a Malaysian Customs officer and shown the luggage containing the cash.

28     It was submitted that believing Greg and Transworld into becoming a victim of the love scam, the accused had transferred substantial sums of money over a period of time totaling more than $160,000. To finance these transfers, she had sold her 3-room HDB flat, borrowed from friends and relatives and incurred unsecured loans from credit cards.

29     It was further submitted that despite these substantial transfers, Transworld told the accused that she was required to transfer further monies. She was also facing several demands for repayments of her debts including credit card debts etc. At her moment of loss and desperation, Greg told her that he was able to secure a loan of US$88,000 from his friend whereby the accused could obtain a loan of $6,500 from Greg’s friend if she helped to effect some money transfers for the business purpose of Greg’s friend.

30     According to her Counsel, agreeing to help Greg, she had deposited $89,860 to the DBS account of a local company Pak Multi Metal Ltd and $22,000 to the DBS account of an Ms Ong Siew Cheng Gina. Although the accused had told Greg that she only needed a loan of $5,000 to pay her credit card debt, Greg insisted that she took a loan of $6,500.

#### Charges involving David Bay (DAC 919468 & DAC 919470/2018)

31     It was submitted that the accused had befriended David since 2015 through Facebook and they communicated through calls, emails and WhatsApp. Although the accused had never met David before, her constant communications with him led to her believing that he was a 54 year old gentleman from Switzerland.

32     It was submitted that David impressed her by claiming that his occupation was in oil trading. He had wooed the accused’s love and told her that he intended to reside in Singapore by buying a Singapore property and starting an oil trading business in Singapore. He wanted to marry her and settle down with her in Singapore. For this purpose, David told her he would be bringing US$2 million from Switzerland and will marry her.

33     Subsequently, David told the accused that he was detained by Singapore Customs for failing to declare the large amount of cash that he was bringing into Singapore. According to her Counsel, David had led her to believe that he needed to pay $280,000 to the authorities before he can be released. At the same time, David also told her that he had a luggage of cash that was in Singapore and pleaded with her to visit his friend in Malaysia who would show her the luggage with cash. He also told her that his friend James Fadil in Malaysia was willing to start up an oil business in Malaysia but David needed Singapore bank accounts in order that the business can be carried out.

34     It was submitted that David had given her numerous assurances that he was engaging in legal oil business. She complied with his requests to assist by providing her bank account details and sending the ATM cards to James Fadil in Malaysia.

### Mitigating Factors

#### The accused was the vulnerable victim of crime

35     It was the Defence’s case that the charges mounted currently against the accused ignored the fact that she was truly a victim of Greg and David, who had through cloaks of anonymity, manipulated her through elaborate weaves of lies and seductive love into committing acts to further their criminal intentions.

36     It was submitted that as a lonely single woman who carried a burden of looking after her mentally and physically disabled sister, she was a perfect vulnerable victim that Greg and David could easily exploit. She had already paid a severe price for her blinded love by losing her livelihood, her flat and her savings.

#### Remorse and Low Likelihood of Re-offending

37     According to her Counsel, the main reason for her blind love stemmed out of ignorance and loneliness. Although she hails from a family whereby she has six siblings (three elder brothers and three elder sisters), she had scant contact with them other than the sole mentally and physically disabled sister that she is the primary caregiver to.

38     After the criminal charges were preferred against her, she had shared her woes with her relatives who support her financially and emotionally. After opening up to her relatives, she realized her folly of falling prey to the love scams.

39     She was deeply remorseful for carrying out the wishes of Greg and David and resolved never to even think of entering into a love relationship. According to her Counsel, she would consult and remained in close contact with her relatives who had helped her during this difficult period to ensure that she does not repeat her follies.

#### Clean Record and Good Character Reference

40     It was highlighted that the accused had a totally clean criminal record.

41     It was submitted that although she is not well off and in poor health, she continued to generously help the elderly and had touched them. In support of this assertion, her Counsel had provided a number of character references in her plea in mitigation.

#### Personal Hardship

42     It was highlighted that as the accused is 64 years old, she suffers from a plethora of health problems including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and severe diabetes. She also underwent both knee operations (one was July 2017) which kept her knees painful. She also suffers from frequent headaches and fainting spells due to her high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes conditions. Her eyesight is also poor due to diabetes.

43     It was submitted that she was especially worried that she would not be able to take care of her handicapped elder sister if she was incarcerated.

#### Remorse

44     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had learnt this lesson and promised that she would cherish the chance to repent and not reoffend ever again.

45     It was submitted that her plea of guilt clearly indicated her deepest remorse and regret. Her plea of guilt had prevented this matter from being dealt in a protracted manner.

#### Full cooperation with the Authorities

46     Her Counsel submitted that he was instructed that the accused had cooperated fully with the CAD throughout the whole investigations.

### Appropriate sentence to be imposed

#### s 411 Penal Code charge (DAC 935180/2017)

47     It was the Defence’s case that the main aggravating factor in the present case was the quantum of money (USD88,000 ie S$118,360) received by the accused. According to her Counsel, she had gained a relatively small amount of $6,500 for her role despite the amount withdrawn.

48     It was submitted that as a broad range of cases fall under s 411, her Counsel had prepared a table of reported sentencing precedents where the factual scenarios were more comparable to her case and had relied on the following reported cases:

50     It was submitted that given the mitigating factors in favour of the accused and the unfortunate circumstances leading to her commission of the offence, a proportionate and appropriate sentence to be imposed for the s 411 offence should therefore be six months’ imprisonment.

#### CDSA charges (DAC 935181/2017, DAC 919468/2018 & DAC 919470/2018)

51     It was the Defence’s case that given the similarities between the offences in s 44(1)(a) and s 47(2)(b) of the CDSA and the maximum prescribed punishments, similar sentencing considerations feature.

52     It was highlighted that in the recent case of _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 606</span> (“_Huang Ying-Chun”_) the High Court had developed a sentencing framework for s 44(1)(a) CDSA offences involving cash laundering offences. The sentencing framework involved the application of five steps:

> (a)     The first step was to consider the offence-specific factors, and classify whether the level of harm was slight, moderate or severe; and whether the level of the offender’s culpability was low, medium, or high.

> (b)     The second step was to identify the applicable indicative sentencing range.

> (c)     The third step was to identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range.

> (d)     The fourth step involved making adjustments to the starting point to account for offender-specific factors.

> (e)     The fifth step involved making further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

53     It was submitted that the relevant sentencing considerations espoused by the High Court in _Huang Ying-Chun_ at \[98\] were as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0196_Image/[2020] SGDC 0196_image2.png)

54     It was the Defence’s case that the harm in the present case fell between the slight and moderate category. It was submitted that while fairly substantial amounts were involved and the funds were withdrawn overseas, there was no evidence that it involved a syndicate or harm done to the confidence in public administration or vulnerable victims as in _Huang Ying-Chun._ It was also important to note the High Court’s guidance in _Huang Ying-Chun_ at \[55\]:

> “…although the amount cheated is an important consideration, it should not be the sole or overriding metric by which harm is assessed.”

55     It was further submitted that the accused’s culpability was properly categorised as low. Her role was to open bank accounts and mailing ATM cards to David. She had no knowledge of the underlying predicate offence and there was no abuse of position or breach of trust. There was no premeditation or planning on her part and her role was unsophisticated. The duration of offending was also short and she was heavily influenced by misguided love as evidenced by her WhatsApp with David to assist him.

56     She was also not in Singapore for the purpose of committing the crime and she was as every much also the victim of a carefully crafted money laundering crime of which she did not design. She has no knowledge whatsoever of the underlying predicate offence (see \[87\] of _Huang Ying-Chun)_. There was also no prospect of a large reward for her role (see \[93\] of _Huang Ying-Chun)_.

57     It was highlighted that the sentencing ranges set out by the High Court in _Huang Ying-Chun_ at \[102\] are as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0196_Image/[2020] SGDC 0196_image3.png)

58     It was submitted that the second and third stages was to identify the applicable indicative sentencing range and the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range. It was the Defence’s case that given the slight-moderate harm and low culpability, the starting point within the indicative sentencing range should be between a fine and/or a short custodial sentence of 10 to 13 months’ imprisonment for the present case.

59     Her Counsel had highlighted that the premise of the sentencing framework was that the offender would contest his charge, see \[52\] of _Huang Ying-Chun_. Therefore, given the accused’s early plea of guilt, it was submitted that appropriate mitigating weight should be given in her favour for a lower jail sentence. She had wanted to plead guilty early but the matter was long delayed due to the previous pending Court of Appeal decision in _PP v Osborne Yap Chen Hsiang_.

60     In the premises, it was further submitted that a six months’ jail sentence should appropriately be imposed for each of the proceeded CDSA charges.

#### Global sentence

61     Her Counsel invited the court to run two of the sentences to run consecutively making a total of 12 months’ imprisonment.

## Defence’s Reply to the Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

#### Accused plea of guilt

62     In response to the Prosecution’s address on sentence for the s 411 of the Penal Code charge, it was highlighted that in _PP v Ambrose Dionysius_ as the accused had claimed trial, the sentence should be higher than the present accused who had pleaded guilty. The offender also had three other s 411 Penal Code offences involving astronomical amounts including sums of up to $3.3 million. Similarly in _PP v Lim Chih Ming John_, the accused had claimed trial to charges for various amounts from $32,000 to $180,000 and the sentences imposed ranged from four to 14 months’ imprisonment. The court was thus invited to take this into consideration and to calibrate the accused’s sentence downwards.

#### Co-accused’s sentence

63     In respect of the CDSA charges, it was highlighted that the Prosecution had relied on the sentence of the co-accused Muhammad Sabir Malik, a second layer money-mule who was given seven months’ imprisonment. It was highlighted that as it was an unreported decision, it was unclear what were the specific sentencing considerations for this co-accused person. For instance, it was not known if he had antecedents and whether there were aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Her Counsel urged the court not to place too much weight on this case.

#### Lack of knowledge of amounts deposited

64     For the remaining s 44(1)(a) CDSA charges, it was submitted that for the amount deposited although these were relatively large amounts, the accused was not aware that these amounts were deposited into her account. According to her Counsel, they were deposited without her knowledge.

65     It was submitted that while the Defence agreed with the Prosecution that _Huang Ying-Chun_ should be the authority, it was submitted that the culpability should be between slight and moderate range.

#### The CAD stern warnings

66     It was highlighted that the Prosecution had submitted that the culpability should be on the medium range because of the previous stern warning and that had influenced the Prosecution’s submissions. Her Counsel responded that he was unsure how the stern warnings were administered _ie_ whether oral or written and what were the exact terms that were delivered to her on dealing with these criminals that were preying on her and taking advantage of her blind love towards them. It should therefore not be treated as an aggravating factor as it is quite established law from the recent High Court decisions that they are not be treated as antecedents. It was submitted that the accused got into these offences because she herself was a victim of a love scam. Unfortunately she had gone further and became part of the crime also.

## The Prosecution’s Reply to the Defence’s Address on Sentence

#### Specifically warned by CAD

67     In response to the Defence’s argument that the warnings should not be treated as an aggravating factor, it was submitted that it has been well-established in case law that they do not have any legal effect. Instead it was the Prosecution’s case that these warnings went towards the _mens rea_ of the accused. As compared to an offender who had reason to believe because of suspicious circumstances, the accused had been presented with certain red flags. These offenders would generally be on the lower end of the culpability range but the accused was not such an offender.

68     On top of these red flags she was presented with, the suspicious circumstances, she was very specifically warned by CAD that what she was doing was already receiving tainted funds from crimes that were committed. She had been given a chance as the CAD had not taken further action on those earlier investigations but she proceeded to repeat what she did despite these warnings. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was in these circumstances that this was aggravating and not the mere fact that she was giving a warning per se.

#### Control over bank accounts

69     It was highlighted that her Counsel had stated she did not know that there were these funds were coming into the bank accounts she had provided to David. It was the Prosecution’s case that the fact of the matter was when she provided the accounts to David, she simply just did not care what he did with the bank accounts. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was going to be used to receive whatever amount of tainted funds he would have made arrangements to be transferred in and she would have to just bear the consequences of whatever had happened.

70     It was submitted that this was not a case of her telling David that he could put $1,000 or $2,000. She had simply turned over control of the entire bank account in that sense and allowed David to carry on doing what he did and thus she should bear the full consequences of the amounts that came into the bank account.

## Sentence

#### Prescribed Penalties

71     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 411 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both.

72     In addition, the prescribed punishment for offences under ss 44(1)(a) and 47(2)(b) CDSA is a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or to both.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

73     The accused had faced multiple offences which ranged from a charge for the receipt of stolen property under s 411 of the Penal Code to 19 money laundering related charges under ss 44(1)(a), 47(2)(b) and 47(3) CDSA. For offences involving such a factual matrix, it is clear that the paramount sentencing consideration is one of general deterrence. It is also clear for such offences, custodial sentences would generally be appropriate particularly when the quantum involved is significant and where multiple offences were committed. In the present case, both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement on this aspect and the divergence of views was only on the appropriate length of each sentence as well as the global sentence.

74     I was mindful that this was also a case where the accused had been specifically warned by the CAD over the telephone on 22 September 2016 not to receive any more monies in her bank account as her bank account had been used to receive illegal funds. In addition on 23 September 2016, when she attended a CAD interview, she was again warned not to use her bank account to receive funds from unknown persons and to stop contacting Greg. She was also told that if she received any further funds from Greg, she was to report the matter to the police.

75     Despite these warnings from the authority, the accused persisted in keeping in contact with Greg, to ask for a further loan of $6,500. In exchange for the loan, she agreed to receive another sum of money in her bank account and on 29 September 2016, she received USD88,000 (approximately $118,360) in her Citibank account which formed the subject matter of the charge under s 411 of the Penal Code in DAC 935180-2017.

#### s 411 Penal Code offence (USD 88,000)

76     In my determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the charge of dishonestly receiving stolen property, I was guided by the similar sentencing precedents tendered by both the Prosecution and the Defence as set out at \[11\] and \[48\] above. In particular, I was mindful that in both _PP v Lim Chih Ming John_ and _PP v Ambrose Dionysius_, the High Court had dismissed the appeals against the sentences for the s 411 Penal Code charges by the accused persons.

77     The Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment in view of the aggravating factors present. In contrast, it was submitted by the Defence that given the mitigating factors and the unfortunate circumstances leading to her commission of the offence, a sentence of six months’ imprisonment should be imposed.

78     In sentencing the accused, I took into account her plea of guilt and the fact that she was a first offender. I also took into account the aggravating factors present _ie_ the significant sum involved (the equivalent of SGD 118,360), the specific warnings from CAD and the existence of multiple offences that were taken into consideration. I did not accept her Counsel’s submissions that the charges mounted currently against her had ignored the fact that she was a victim of Greg and David, who had manipulated her through their lies into committing acts to further their criminal intentions.

79     I agreed with the Prosecution that despite the red flags she was presented with, the suspicious circumstances and the specific warnings by the CAD not to use her bank account to receive funds from unknown persons and to contact the police if she received any further funds from Greg, she ignored these warnings still went on to dishonestly receive the USD88,000 in her bank account as requested by Greg.

80     Accordingly, after a careful consideration the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct, I was of the view that a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for DAC 935180-2017 was just and appropriate as a form of general deterrence in the circumstances. In my view, the sentence of six months’ imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately addressed the overall criminality of her conduct nor act as a form of specific deterrence to her.

#### s. 47(2)(b) CDSA offence ($89,860)

81     The Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment in respect of the charge under s. 47(2)(b) CDSA on the basis of the significant sum involved, the specific warnings from CAD and the existence of multiple offences that were taken into consideration. In addition, it was highlighted that the tainted funds that she transferred came out of those funds that were received under the s. 411 Penal Code offence.

82     The Prosecution had relied on the sentence received by her co-accused Muhammad Sabir Malik, the second layer money-mule who was convicted on a corresponding charge for receiving this sum of money and sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment. It was the Prosecution’s case that the starting point for the present charge should therefore be seven months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the accused was more culpable given her higher number of TIC offences and sought an slight uplift to eight months’ imprisonment.

83     In contrast, for the present charge the Defence had relied on the sentencing framework in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_’s for s 44(1)(a) CDSA offences given the similarities between the offences in s 44(1)(a) and s 47(2)(b) of the CDSA and the maximum prescribed punishments. It was submitted that given the slight-medium harm and low culpability, the starting point within the indicative sentencing range should be a short custodial sentence of up to 10 months’ imprisonment for the present case.

84     It was further submitted that as the premise of the sentencing framework was that the offender would contest his charge, given the accused’s early plea of guilt, appropriate mitigating weight should be given in her favour for a lower sentence. Her Counsel had argued against reliance on the co-accused’s sentence as it was unclear what were the specific sentencing considerations for this co-accused person, it was not known if he had antecedents and whether there were aggravating and mitigating circumstances. It was the Defence’s case that a six months’ jail sentence should appropriately be imposed for each of the three proceeded CDSA charges.

85     After a careful consideration the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct and the significant quantum involved _ie_ $89,860, I was of the view that a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment for DAC 935181-2017 was just and appropriate as a form of general deterrence in the circumstances. I took into account the fact that a lesser quantum of the tainted funds from the s 411 of the Penal Code charge had been transferred out to the co-accused and that merited a downward adjustment from the eight months’ that I had imposed for the charge in DAC 935180-2017. Similarly, I was of the view that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately addressed the overall criminality of her conduct nor act as a form of specific deterrence to her.

#### s. 44(1)(a) CDSA offences ($47,050 and $174,750)

### Step one – identify the level of harm and level of culpability

86     In respect of the remaining two charges under s. 44(1)(a) CDSA, I had applied the harm-culpability sentencing framework as set out by the High Court in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_. I agreed with both the Prosecution and the Defence that based on the significant sums involved, the level of harm ought to be in the slight to moderate range.

87     I agreed with the Prosecution that her level of culpability was not low as the accused was given specific warnings by CAD shortly before the commission of these offences, she was aware that she was under investigations by CAD that she was receiving funds from criminals and that she had been receiving the tainted funds in her bank account. Despite these circumstances, she chose to ignore these warnings from the authorities and went on to commit the offences. I further agreed with the Prosecution that this was not a case of an accused who had received tainted funds in her bank account from an unknown source for the first time. In addition, I also took into account the fact that the accused was partly motivated by pecuniary gain.

88     From the facts as well as her own plea in mitigation, an inference can be drawn that a criminal syndicate appears to be involved in the present case as substantial amounts were involved from victims of internet love scams and the funds were withdrawn overseas. This would have a harmful impact on Singapore as a whole, and accordingly increases the harm of the accused’s actions. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that her culpability ought to be in the medium range and not low as suggested by the Defence.

### Step two: Identify the applicable sentencing range

89     In determining the applicable sentencing range, as the level of harm had been assessed as slight to moderate and the level of culpability as medium, I was of the view that the applicable sentencing range would be a custodial sentence of up to ten months’ to 30 months’ imprisonment.

### Step three: Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range

90     The next step was for me to determine the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range. I was mindful that the charges were framed under the “reasonable grounds to believe” limb as opposed to the “knowing” limb. Therefore, in determining the starting point, the culpability of the accused should be assessed as lower than that of an accused who was charged under the “knowing” limb.

91     I agreed with the Prosecution that as the accused had repeatedly ignored CAD’s specific warnings and was at least partly motivated by pecuniary gain, the culpability of the accused ought to be assessed at the lower end of the medium category. I agreed with the Prosecution that the starting point should thus be ten months’ imprisonment (for the charge involving $47,050) and 18 months’ imprisonment (for the charge involving $174,750) for claim trial cases. I disagreed with the Defence suggestion that the starting point should between a fine and/or a short custodial sentence of 10 to 13 months’ imprisonment in respect of both the s. 44(1)(a) CDSA charges or that it should be similar in light of the vast difference in the quantums involved.

### Step four: Make adjustments to the starting point to account for offender- specific factors

92     As the accused had pleaded guilty, a sentencing discount could be applied. Balancing the sentencing discount for pleading guilty against the TIC charges, I was of the view that the sentences should be adjusted to eight months’ imprisonment (for the charge involving $47,050) and 14 months’ imprisonment (for the charge involving $174,750) respectively.

### Step five: Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle

93     On account of the totality principle, I was of the view a further downward adjustment should be made and that the the sentence for the charge in DAC 919468-2018 should be adjusted to six months’ imprisonment and the charge in DAC 919470-2018 to 12 months’ imprisonment respectively.

### Global sentence

94     After having decided on the individual sentences, the next step was to decide on the global sentence. By virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), when a person is convicted and sentenced for at least three distinct offences, the court must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

95     The Prosecution had submitted that as the accused had been convicted and sentenced on four charges, the sentences for DAC- 935180-2017 and DAC-919470-2018 should run consecutively as the offences involved the accused laundering criminal proceeds for two different online personas and that the total sentence should therefore be 22 months’ imprisonment.

96     In contrast, after submitting that the individual sentences ought to be six months’ imprisonment in respect of the four charges, the Defence had urged the court to run two of the sentences to run consecutively making a total of 12 months’ imprisonment.

97     After having regard to the totality of the offender’s conduct, I was of the view that a global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in respect of the proceeded charges as a form of general deterrence. In my view a global sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately reflected the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct. I had ordered the sentences for DAC- 935180-2017 and DAC-919470-2018 to run consecutively as the offences involved the accused laundering criminal proceeds for two different online personas with the remaining two charges in DAC-935181-2017 and DAC-919468-2018 to run concurrently. In my view, the global sentence was just and appropriate in order to achieve the objectives of both general and specific deterrence.
