Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Motor Vehicle (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9261/2021/01.\]

26 November 2021

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Yee Leh Kheong, a 50 years-old male Singapore Permanent Resident had pleaded guilty to the following charge:

1 st Charge

> are charged that you, on 5th November 2020 at about 12.02 pm at Seletar Expressway, Singapore, did used a motor car SJL4572H without insurance coverage when there was not in force in relation to the use of the said vehicle such a policy of insurance in respect of Third-Party Risks as complies with the requirement of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (the “MVA”) in contravention of Section 3(1) of the MVA, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(2) and 3(3) of the said Act.

2       The accused was first charged in court for the present offence on 15 July 2021. The matter was subsequently adjourned for representations to be made by Defence Counsel to the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) on its sentencing position.

3       On 11 November 2021, as the Prosecution maintained its sentencing position, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. After carefully considering the accused’s written plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and its reply, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $600 in default three days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from date of conviction.

4       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence and order of disqualification on 11 November 2021. He has paid the fine of $600 and the commencement of the disqualification order has been stayed pending the hearing of his appeal.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

6       The informant is one Muhammad Ikhwan bin Zahran, an Enforcement Officer with the Enforcement Division, Land Transport Authority (LTA).

7       On 5 November 2020 at about 12:02pm at the Seletar Expressway, the informant stopped the motorcar SJL4572H (“motor car”) for checks. Upon checking, it was discovered that the accused drove the car without a valid insurance coverage in force.

8       The registered owner of the motor car SJL4572H is Wong Liang Swee. He is the director of Promech Service Pte Ltd. The accused works as a project manager for Promech Services Pe Ltd. When Wong Liang Swee bought the motor car, he handed the motor car over to the accused for usage for his work.

9       In November 2019, the accused renewed the insurance policy with Direct Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd for a premium amounting to $1326.81. The accused opted to pay the premium by monthly instalment to be deducted from the accused’s bank account. The insurance policy period was from 27 November 2019 to 26 November 2020. The full premium amounting to $1326.81 was thereafter reimbursed to the accused by Wong Liang Swee.

10     The first payment of the premium was $221.21 and the subsequent monthly payments of $110.56 will be debited from the accused’s bank account. However, in the month of June 2020, the deduction was unsuccessful as there was insufficient funds in the accused’s bank account. The insurance policy was thereafter cancelled by the insurance company on 27 June 2020.

11     As such, there was no such policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks as complied with the requirements of the Motor Vehicle (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 when the said motor car was used on 5 November 2020.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

12     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

### Antecedents

13     The accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

14     The Prosecution sought a fine of $600 with the mandatory 12 months’ disqualification for all classes of vehicles.

### Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

15     In his written plea in mitigation, it was submitted that the car was registered to Mr Wong Liang Swee but used exclusively by the accused. When the previous insurance coverage and road tax was about to expire, the accused without Mr Wong’s knowledge went to renew the road tax and decided to change the insurer to Direct Asia Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Direct Asia”). A new certificate of insurance was obtained from Direct Asia for the period 27 November 2019 to 26 November 2020. The accused arranged to pay the insurance premium by monthly deductions from his OCBC account. Mr Wong was not aware that the car was insured with Direct Asia or that the premium was being paid by monthly instalments.

16     It was further submitted that the accused’s OCBC account statements showed that the sum of $110.56 was deducted for the months of December 2019 to April 2020. The accused did not monitor the balance in his OCBC bank account and was unaware that the balance had fallen low. He only realised that his balance had fallen to $16.56 in October 2020 and on 16 October 2020 transferred $2,000 into his OCBC account. It was highlighted that this account was operated using a debit card, was only used for the payment of insurance premium and nothing else and hence was not actively monitored by the accused.

17     It was the Defence’s case that unknown to the accused, Direct Asia had cancelled the certificate of insurance due to there being insufficient funds in the accused’s OCBC account which had fallen to $24.55 by May 2020. When direct Asia sent text messages and emails about the deduction problem, this was not sent to the accused but to Mr Wong. Mr Wong however deleted the emails thinking it was junk emails. He also deleted the SMS as he had thought it was sent in error as his car was insured with Great Eastern and not Direct Asia. Moreover, the emails and text messages did not state the car licence number that would have alerted Mr Wong that the messages were in relation to the car.

18     It was submitted that the accused did not know that he had insufficient funds in his OCBC account to cover the monthly premium deductions. He is a Malaysian who first came to Singapore in 1998 to work. Between 1998 and 2002, he had rented a room in a unit at Blk 65 Yung Kuang Road and when he opened his bank account with OCBC bank this was the address given to the bank. The accused moved out of his residence in 2002 and has lived at various locations and subsequently commuted from Malaysia to Singapore daily for work. He however did not update OCBC on his subsequent addresses. From his bank statements from December 2019 to October 2020, the statements have the Yung Kuang Road address. His NRIC shows that on 28 December 2018, he had changed his address to a unit at Block 894A Tampines St 81 which is Mr Wong’s address. He would occasionally stay at Mr Wong’s address. It was submitted that the accused’s main bank account is with POSB and he had assumed that he was insured as he had the certificate of insurance valid for the relevant period.

#### Special Circumstances

19     It was submitted that in _Sriekaran s/o Thaka Samy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“Sriekaran”), the appellant was charged with driving a motor vehicle without an insurance policy in respect of third-party risks being enforced and was fined and sentenced to 12 months disqualification. The appellant had argued that he believed that his cheque had been accepted by the insurance company and that he had been validly insured at the material time. His appeal was dismissed by the High Court and Yong Pung How CJ stated at \[3\]:

> …In fact, given that the appellant’s first cheque had been dishonoured, and hence no valid insurance coverage applied to his car, it would have been reasonable to expect the appellant to ensure his second cheque was properly processed if indeed he genuinely sought to be covered by insurance. He made no effort to do so.

20     It was further submitted that Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) said in _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> that _Sriekaran_’s appeal was dismissed as the appellant’s belief that he was insured was not based on reasonable grounds. Tay J said at \[35\]:

> _Sriekaran_ therefore does not stand for the proposition that an offender operating under the mistaken impression that he has been insured can never amount to “special reasons” under s 3(3) of the MVA. Rather, what was held in _Sriekaran_ was that in pleading a mistaken belief, an offender must first show that he had reasonable grounds for such belief and that he had exercised reasonable diligence.

21     It was highlighted that Tay J stated at \[38\] that when an offender seeks to come within the special reasons exception under s 3(3), he must have the facts to back up such circumstances to be proven to the satisfaction of the Court.

22     It was the Defence’s position that the accused was issued with a certificate of insurance for the relevant period and did not know that the certificate of insurance was cancelled as he did not receive any notification of the cancellation. It was submitted that once Direct Asia had issued the certificate of insurance, it was reasonable for the accused to believe that he had complied with the law. He was also unaware that his bank balance had dropped so low that there was insufficient money to cover the monthly deductions for the premiums as the statements did not reach him.

23     According to the Defence, the accused was genuinely mistaken into believing that he had a valid certificate of insurance and there were reasonable grounds for such belief. He had also exercised due diligence by having the car insured, obtaining the certificate of insurance and arranging to pay the premiums by monthly deductions from his OCBC account. It was submitted that this was an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its discretion not to impose the disqualification order due to the unusual facts present in this case.

#### Fine

24     It was submitted that a fine of $600 would be appropriate. Reference was made to _Public Prosecutor v Liew Yee Long_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 37</span> where a fine of $500 was imposed and _Public Prosecutor v Olivero Rachel Marie_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 86</span> where a fine of $600 was imposed.

### Prosecution’s Reply

25     In response to the plea in mitigation, the Prosecution had highlighted that the present charge is a strict liability offence.

26     It was submitted that the accused’s present circumstance was similar to that in _Sriekaran_ where the appellant had also not made payment for his insurance policy because his cheque bounced. It was held that there was no reasonable ground to believe that the insurance policy would be in force as he had made no effort to ensure that his cheque was properly processed (see: _Sriekaran_ at \[3\]).

27     It was further submitted that an offender pleading mistaken belief had to show reasonable grounds for such belief and that he had exercised reasonable diligence.

#### The accused was not notified of the cancellation of the policy

28     It was submitted that the accused despite being the one who renewed the insurance policy with Direct Asia Pte Ltd, knowingly chose to fill in the contact details of Mr Wong. He did so without informing Mr Wong of the change of insurer.

29     It was further submitted that the accused did not conduct any reasonable diligence in ensuring that he would be kept updated on the status of the insurance policy. The accused cannot rely on his own wilful ignorance to say he was later unaware that the policy was cancelled, when he made no effort to be contactable by the insurers or inform the contact recipient that such messages from the insurer should be forwarded to him.

#### The accused was unaware that the GIRO had insufficient funds

30     It was submitted that it is the usual process for an insurance company to cancel the insurance policy due to non-payment. The accused did not conduct reasonable diligence in ensuring that there were sufficient funds in the OCBC account that was used for the monthly payments of the insurance.

31     Although the accused upon realising that his bank balance in his OCBC account had fallen to $16.56 in October 2020 and on 16 October 2020 transferred $2,000 into the account, this was 3½ months after his policy had already been cancelled on 27 June 2020.

32     It was further submitted that the accused made no effort to check with the insurance company whether there had been any failed GIRO deduction and unpaid premium over the last few months before his usage of the car or if even that his policy was still active. Thus, he had no reasonable grounds to believe that his insurance policy would be in force at the material time.

33     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused, similar to the appellant in _Sriekaran_, made no effort to confirm if payments were made and would have continued to drive the motorcar with the excuse that he did not receive notice of the cancellation of the policy had he not been stopped by the enforcement officer. It was submitted that it was only fortunate that no accident had occurred as the motorcar was not covered by an insurance policy. It was highlighted that the accused had already used the vehicle for more than four months without insurance when he was stopped on 5 November 2020.

34     In conclusion, it was submitted that there were no special reasons given the facts of the case for the Court not to impose the mandatory disqualification on the accused. The accused’s belief that the insurance policy was valid was not reasonable since he did not conduct any reasonable diligence on his part to ensure that it was. It was further submitted that the accused’s lack of knowledge that the motorcar’s insurance policy had been cancelled would at best be a mitigating factor that would reflect on the amount of fine imposed under s 3(2) of the MVA but would not amount to a special reason for the Court not to impose the mandatory disqualification.

## My decision on sentence

### S 3(1) of the MVA

35     The sentence for an offence under s 3(1) of the MVA for a first offender is usually a fine ranging from $600 to $800 and the mandatory disqualification for a period of for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

36     The meaning of “special reasons” was considered by the High Court in the cases of _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 116</span> (“Muhammad Faizal”) and _Prathib s/o M Balan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1066</span>. The High Court held that the phrase “special reasons” has a narrow meaning. Only reasons connected to the offence and not reasons related to the offender are to be considered.

37     Both the Prosecution and the Defence had relied on the High Court decision in _Sriekaran s/o Thaka Samy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> in support of their respect positions. Nevertheless, it was clear from _Muhammad Faizal_ cited by the Defence that in pleading mistaken belief, an offender must first show that he had reasonable grounds for such belief and that he had exercised reasonable diligence.

38     In the present case, I had considered the motor car was used exclusively by the accused although the registered owner was Mr Wong. The accused had acted without Mr Wong’s knowledge in changing the insurer to Direct Asia Insurance. As Mr Wong was the registered owner of the vehicle, the accused should have informed Mr Wong when he changed insurers from Great Eastern to Direct Asia as Mr Wong would be the one contacted on all matters relating to the motor car. Additionally, as the motor car was used exclusively by him, the accused should have made reasonable efforts to be contactable by Direct Asia by providing his current contact details when he applied for the insurance policy from them.

39     In addition, the accused had opted to pay the insurance premium by monthly instalment to be deducted from his OCBC bank account. By opting for such a mode of payment, the onus was on the accused to ensure that that there were sufficient funds available to ensure that the monthly deductions were successful. Further, as an account holder of a bank, he should have ensured that his contact particulars is always current and updated. It was unreasonable for him claim that he was unaware that he had insufficient funds in his OCBC account to cover the monthly premium deductions when he made no effort to remain contactable by the bank or that he checked to ensure that the monthly deductions were successful. At the very least, he should have provided a mailing address or mobile telephone number where he could be contacted by not only the bank but all the relevant authorities in Singapore.

40     As with any contractual agreement, the insurance coverage in respect of the vehicle would be conditional upon the full payment of the insurance premium. Direct Asia was entitled to revoke the insurance policy for non-payment of its premium and once the policy is revoked, the vehicle would not have the necessary insurance coverage for its use.

41     His Counsel had argued that the accused had assumed that he was insured as he had the relevant certificate of insurance for the relevant period. In my view, the argument does not hold water and would not assist him in his case as by his own conduct as set out above, he did not have reasonable grounds for such belief and that he had not exercised reasonable diligence.

42     Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were no special reasons present in the case for me not to make the disqualification order pursuant to s 3(3) of the MVA. I disagreed with Counsel that the accused was genuinely mistaken into believing that he had insurance coverage in respect of the use of the vehicle and that he had exercised due diligence based on the above.

43     In the present case, the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to the charge. As the fine proposed by both the Prosecution and the Defence were within the normal tariff, I imposed a fine $600 in default three days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months from the date of his conviction.
