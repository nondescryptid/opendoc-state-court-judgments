Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9528/2020/01.\]

11 August 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused in person.

2       The Accused, then represented by counsel, pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed (“MDA”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (‘PC”) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

3       On 28 March 2017, at about 1013 hrs, at Block 412 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #XXX (“the AMK Flat”), together with one Ramendra Krishnan (“Ramendra”) had in their possession for the purposes of trafficking, 35 blocks of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain not less than 463.92 g of cannabis without authorisation under the MDA of the Regulations made thereunder.

## The Facts

4       The Accused admitted to Joint Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification.

5       On 28 March 2017, acting on intelligence received, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) staked out a drug transaction at Marsiling MRT Station. Sligtly after 1835 hrs, the CNB officers observed the Accused, Ramendra and one Lavinder Shanmuganathan (“Lavinder”) board a taxi together. Lavinder alighted the taxi after a short distance and began walking back towards Marsiling MRT station. He was subsequently arrested.

6       CNB officers continued to follow the taxi. Along Neram Road, Ramendra alighted from the taxi, ran towards the canal, threw a black backpack into the canal and continued running. He was arrested shortly after. The black backpack was retrieved from the canal and drug exhibits was found in the backpack. The Accused herself was also arrested in the taxi shortly thereafter.

7       At about 2213 hrs, Ramendra and the Accused were escorted the AMK Flat where 35 blocks of vegetable matter were recovered. These exhibits were subsequently sent to the Health Science Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. A total of 33 amended certificates were issued under s 16 of the MDA and in total, the seized exhibits contained not less than 463.92 g of cannabis.

8       Investigations revealed that the Accused was working in Singapore as a domestic helper. However, she was allowed to live on her own. She rented a room in the AMK Flat where she lived with Ramendra with whom she had a romantic relationship. She was aware that Ramendra was involved in selling cannabis and allowed him to keep the cannabis in the room at the AMK Flat. Ramendra would re-pack the blocks of cannabis that was stored in the AMK Flat in her presence. She would, on occasions, received money from Ramendra that she knew had come from the profits from selling cannabis.

9       The Accused had also assisted Ramendra with his drug activities, for example, by delivering payment to a “runner” of his drug supplier on one occasion and helping Ramendra to deliver the cannabis to his customers on a few other occasions.

10     The Accused therefore knew that the exhibits seized contained cannabis. Accordingly, the Accused and Ramendra were in possession of the cannabis in the room at the AMK Flat for the purposes of trafficking.

11     I found the Accused guilty and convicted her on the single charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA read with s 34 of the PC and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

## Antecedents

12     The Accused has no antecedents.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

13     The Prosecution’s submitted that the indicative starting sentence in the present case was in the range of 26 – 29 years’ imprisonment. Adjusting for the Accused’s culpability, and the relevant mitigating factors, it was submitted that a sentence of at least 26 years’ imprisonment was appropriate.

14     This was based on the guidelines laid down in _Vasentha d/o Joseph vs Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”) and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> (“_Suventher_”) at \[28\]-\[31\], in particular at \[29\] where the Court set out the indicative starting point for the unauthorised import or trafficking of cannabis:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="47.64%"> <col width="52.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Weight of Cannabis</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">330 to 380g</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">20 to 22 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">381 to 430g</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">23 to 25 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">431 to 500g</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">26 to 29 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

15     First, looking at the weight of the cannabis, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point should be in the middle of the third band, ie a sentence of 27 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

16     The second step was to consider the Accused’s culpability. Although the Accused had made occasional deliveries of cannabis and had even made payment on one occasion to Ramendra’s drug supplier on his behalf, the Prosecution recognised that none of the factors listed in _Vasentha_ as an indication of higher culpability were present here and she had acted under Ramendra’s instructions. Accordingly, the Prosecution submitted a slight downward adjustment in the indicative starting sentence to 26 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

17     There were no aggravating factors in the case.

18     With regard to the mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that only a minor reduction in sentence would be appropriate. Although the Accused had pleaded guilty and had co-operated with the authorities, the drugs had were found in the AMK Flat were within the room she rented and shared with Ramendra. For example, in _Vasentha_, the accused had also co-operated with the authorities in their investigations but Court was of the view that only a modest adjustment was required: _Vasentha_ at \[82\] and \[85\].

19     Therefore, the Prosecution’s final sentencing submission in the present case was that the Accused’s sentence should be at least 26 years’ imprisonment.

### Mitigation plea

20     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the sentencing framework for the trafficking and importation of cannabis has been laid out in _Suventher._ Both parties also agreed that the indicative starting point was 27 years and 6 months’ imprisonment based of the weight of drugs. However, the Defence submitted that an overall sentence in the region of 21-22 years’ imprisonment would be fair and just in light of the mitigating factors and precedent cases cited.

21     The following is a summary of the mitigating factors put forward by the Defence.

> (a)     Genuine and extreme remorse. The Accused’s early plea of guilt was an indication of her genuine remorse, contrition and regret.

> (b)     Culpability. While she had assisted Ramendra in his drug trafficking activities, her involvement in the trafficking operation was small. She was doing this as Ramendra’s girlfriend, rather than as his associate. She was also never involved in the packing or re-packing of any of the drugs. When she did assist him, it was her way of demonstrating her love for him.

> (c)     Benefit obtained. The Accused did not directly profit from the trafficking operation. However, it was conceded that she might have indirectly benefitted when Ramendra, using the profit from his drug activities, paid rent on her behalf or when he casually gave her monies to buy groceries, food etc.

> (d)     Misguided love and loyalty. The Accused was ultimately in love with Ramendra. She continued to give him love and support despite his shortcomings. She did not have the heart to report him to the authorities even when he cheated on her.

> (e)     Fear of being reported. Although the Accused was in Singapore as a domestic helper, she was allowed to live on her own and work additional jobs on her own time. This was an illegal arrangement and was worried about getting her employer into trouble.

> (f)     Simple minded and trusting. The Accused is a young and immature woman. She was easily trusting of and emotionally attached to Ramendra. Furthermore, Ramendra was the closest thing to a family she had in Singapore.

22     A summary of the cases cited by the Defence in \[55\]-\[70\] of the Plea in Mitigation are shown below.

23     The Defence sought to show that not only was the Accused’s culpability much less than the accused persons in the cases cited, but that the weight of the drugs involved was also much less. Therefore, a significant downward adjustment from the region of a 26 years’ imprisonment term was justified.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law

24     For the weight of cannabis of between 330 gm and 500 gm, the offence attracts a mandatory minimum of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane with the maximum sentence being 30 years’ imprisonment or life and 15 strokes of the cane.

### Arriving at the appropriate sentence

25     In _Suventher_, the Court of Appeal endorsed the sentencing framework in _Vasentha_. This is as follows[^1]:

> (a)     determining the indicative starting point based on the quantity and type of controlled drug;

> (b)     make necessary upward or downward adjustments based on the offender’s culpability and any relevant aggravating of mitigating factors; and

> (c)     taking into account the time spent in remand, where appropriate.

#### The indicative starting point

26     Based on the weight of cannabis in the present case, the indicative sentencing range was therefore between 26 and 29 years’ imprisonment. At 463.92 gm, both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the starting point in the instant case was in the middle of the band, being 27 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.[^2]

#### Culpability of the accused

27     As highlighted by the Prosecution, her involvement in Ramendra’s drug operations involved the occasional delivery of cannabis to others and on one occasion, had even made payment to the runner of Ramendra’s drug supplier on his behalf. She knew that the monies that she received from him, be it to help out in the payment of the rent or for food and groceries, were from the profits that he made in selling cannabis. In my view, she was more involved in Ramendra’s drug activities than how the Defence has sought to characterise it, even if she was assisting him purely in her capacity as his girlfriend.

28     I agreed with the Prosecution that none of the indications of culpability as listed in _Vasentha_ were present here, and that only a slight downward adjustment to the Accused’s indicative starting sentence. However, I was of the view that this downward adjustment to be slightly more than what the Prosecution had submitted and adjudged it to be in the region of 15-18 months’ imprisonment.

#### Aggravating and mitigating factors

29     The Prosecution conceded that there were no aggravating factors in the present case.

30     While there were mitigating factors in this case, in my opinion, however, it was not so exceptional as to warrant a significant downward adjustment of the sentence to the 21 – 22 year imprisonment range submitted by the Defence.

31     The Prosecution has cited _Vasentha_ to support their submission that any downward adjustment for her plea of guilt and co-operation with the authorities should not be significant. I agreed with this. The Accused had been effectively caught red-handed with the drugs found in the room that she shared with Ramendra. However, I noted that the “modest adjustment” of three months in _Vasentha_ was against the backdrop of the nine-year imprisonment term imposed in that case. In the present case, the indicative starting point was 27 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. Hence, this “modest adjustment” must be calibrated accordingly and I adjudged that a downward adjustment of ten to 12 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

32     While I accept that the Accused committed this offence because of her misguided loyalty and love for Ramendra and that she feared of being reported to the Ministry of Manpower for contravening the conditions of her work permit as relevant mitigating factors, I nonetheless did not think that these warranted such a steep sentencing discount as submitted by the Defence.

33     Likewise, I did not think that the characterization of the Accused’s actions as being one of youthful folly or that she was simple minded and trusting was accurate. The Accused is no youthful offender. She is 37 years old and had worked in Singapore previously. Despite being described as simple minded, she was nonetheless able to make the necessary arrangements to obtain the full benefit of her stay in Singapore by working in places outside what was stated in her work permit to earn a larger income. Whilst she may have been trusting of Ramendra, being his girlfriend, she was no “babe in the woods”.

34     I was of the view that a total downward adjustment of 24 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. This would include the ten – 12 months downward adjustment at \[32\]. Accordingly, the indicative sentence would now be 24 years’ imprisonment.

#### Caning

35     As a female, caning cannot be administered on the Accused. This was addressed in _Suventher_, where the Court of Appeal at \[29\] held that,

> “……. Where an accused cannot be caned because of gender or of age, the court should also consider the option of imposing a term of imprisonment of not more than 12 months in lieu of caning (see s 325(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).”

36     Accordingly, I was of the view that an uplift of 12 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in the present case to account for this.

#### Precedent cases

37     Having determined that the appropriate final sentence in this case was a sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment, I proceeded to review the sentences that were imposed on the accused persons in the precedent cases cited by both the Prosecution and the Defence to determine if there should be any further adjustments to the final sentence. There were none. I concluded that the final sentence was in line with the precedents cited and there was no necessity to adjust the sentence further.

## Conclusion

38     All considered, I was of the view that the following sentence was the appropriate sentence to impose in the present case and therefore sentenced the Accused to 25 years’ imprisonment. I further ordered that this sentence was to commence with effect from 30 March 2017, the date she was first remanded into custody.

39     The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against it. She is presently serving sentence.
