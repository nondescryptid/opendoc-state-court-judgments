\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9885/2020/01.\]

30 July 2021

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Background

1       The accused, Zareena Begum, a 50-year-old female Singaporean, claimed trial to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to PW5 Shafarudin Bin Ahmad (“the victim”), a 47-year-old male Singaporean, by means of a heated substance under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the accused guilty as charged and I convicted her accordingly. I sentenced her to four years’ imprisonment for the offence.

3       The accused, who was represented, being dissatisfied with her conviction and sentence has appealed against my decision. She is currently on bail pending her appeal.

4       I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The charge

5       The charge that the accused claimed trial to read as follows:

>     DAC-912092-2018 (exhibit C1A)

CHARGE (Amended)

>     You, are charged that you, on 5 July 2017, at or about 1.30am, at Blk 22 Hougang Avenue 3 #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Shafarudin Bin Ahmad by means of a heated substance, to wit, by pouring hot water on the said Shafarudin Bin Ahmad’s groin area, causing him to suffer hot water burns over 12% of his total body surface area and be unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for more than 20 days, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Issue before the court

6       The accused and the victim were boyfriend and girlfriend. At the time of the incident, they had been in the relationship for about 11 years. On 4 July 2017, the victim went to the accused’s flat for dinner. At or about 1.30am the next morning, there was an incident involving hot water where the victim was badly scalded (“the hot water incident”). It was not in dispute that the victim suffered grievous hurt or that the grievous hurt was caused by means of a heated substance namely hot water. The dispute was over how the hot water incident occurred. According to the victim, he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room when the accused poured hot water on his groin area. According to the accused, the incident happened in the kitchen where the hot water in a mug she was holding accidentally spilled onto the victim’s groin area when he pulled her arm. Who was telling the truth?

7       There issue before me was whether the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had intentionally poured hot water onto the victim’s groin area while he was asleep thereby causing his burn injuries.

## Undisputed facts

8       The accused was a divorcee. She worked as a customer service agent with Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS). The victim was a “service man” who carried out services for HDB flats which required repairs, wiring jobs, and plumbing works. The accused met the victim in 2006[^1] through a colleague when she needed some works done at her flat. The victim then started asking the accused out on dates. The accused knew that the victim was married with children, but the victim told her that his marriage was on the rocks and that he was in the process of divorcing his wife. They thus began their romantic relationship and started having sex six months after they met.

9       It was a tumultuous relationship during which the victim promised to divorce his wife and marry the accused, but it did not materialise. They broke up several times but after a while, they would patch up because they loved each other very much. During the victim’s on and off love affair with the accused, he divorced his wife and re-married her. The marriage search results from the Registry of Muslim Marriages at Defence exhibit D9 as at 20 June 2019 showed that the victim registered his marriage to his wife twice, the first time in September 1999 and the second time in September 2007.

10     The accused was residing with her two sons while the victim was staying at his mother’s place. The couple did not live together during their relationship. The victim would visit the accused at her flat and she would cook for him at times. The victim would go home at about 10pm or 11pm. Sometimes he would leave at about 2am and he would not wake the accused if she were asleep. If he were to sleep over which was rare, usually he would sleep at the sofa in the living room.

11     On 4 July 2017, at about 10pm, the victim went to the accused’s flat for dinner. They were the only ones in the flat. What happened that night before the victim fell asleep at the sofa in the accused’s living room was not disputed. What was in dispute was what happened after the victim fell asleep at the sofa and when he awoke in the morning at about 1.30am on 5 July 2017 during which the hot water incident occurred.

12     As a result of the hot water incident, the victim suffered 12% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) of hot water burns over his bilateral upper and medial thigh with extension to left lateral buttock and perianal region, upper torso, left hand palm and finger tips which required a trial of artificial skin and split skin grafting. He was hospitalised for 26 days from 5 July 2017 to 31 July 2017 and given medical leave for 39 days from 5 July 2017 until 12 August 2017. During this period, he was not able to perform his normal pursuits. His injuries would lead to permanent scarring (see medical report at exhibit P2 and Inpatient Discharge Summary at exhibit P1).

13     The victim did not lodge any police report regarding the hot water incident. It was Singapore General hospital (“SGH”) which warded the victim for his burns that reported the case to the police on 5 July 2017 at 5.54pm (see the Case Summary Form at exhibit P8).

14     After the hot water incident, there was no contact between the victim and the accused until 21 August 2017, one and a half months later, when they reconciled. They eventually ended their relationship and stopped contacting each other altogether after 21 January 2019 as shown by the last call entry in the call records obtained from the accused’s handphone in exhibit D8, page 12[^2].

15     In the meantime, the accused was arrested on 19 March 2018 for committing an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code in relation to the hot water incident (see arrest report in exhibit P7). The accused was charged in court on 23 March 2018. On 5 July 2018, the police visited the accused’s flat to take photographs of the scene. There were 26 photographs taken (see the photographs in exhibit P4(1) to (26)).

## The victim’s evidence

16     The victim testified that on 4 July 2017, after he finished his work at about 10pm, he went over to the accused’s flat. They sat at the sofa in the living room and watched some movies on the television together. He felt sleepy and fell asleep on the sofa. He could not recall what time he dozed off. He awoke when he felt pain at his groin and lap. He testified that he felt very hot and was in pain and it seemed like something was on his lap and groin. He saw that his pants and groin part were wet. When he touched his groin area, his hands became wet and red as if they had been scalded by hot water. He immediately stood up and jumped all over the place to try to clear the excess liquid on his lap. He then removed his pants and saw redness on both his thighs. He thought it could be due to either hot water or acid although he believed it was more likely to be hot water. The victim said that he had experienced the feeling of hot water before but the pain he was going through felt like “acid pain” which he had also encountered previously in the service industry. He described the pain as “way too much” and the “feeling is very bad”. He was wearing light colour pants that day and the liquid on his groin was colourless and had no smell.

17     The victim said that as he was sleeping, he did not know how the accused poured the colourless odourless liquid on his groin. He told the court that when he was woken up by the pain, he saw the accused standing near the sofa, so to him, it was the accused who had poured the liquid on his groin. The victim identified the sofa he was sleeping on as the black sofa shown in the photographs in exhibits P4(4) to (6). He told the court that he was sleeping flat on his back on the sofa, facing the ceiling with his legs stretched out towards the main door. He testified that the accused was standing just beside the sofa where his legs were[^3]. The victim could not recall the facial expression on the accused. He said that after he removed his pants, he asked the accused, “Why you do this to me?” but he could not remember her response[^4].

18     After the victim had removed his pants and underwear, he went out of the flat to grab a towel that was hanging outside to cover himself as he was naked. He then returned to the flat to grab his belongings before he ran to the roadside to hail a taxi to bring him to SGH. At SGH, the victim told the doctors that his girlfriend poured hot water on him and he was in pain and would need painkillers. The nurses gave him three injections for his pain.

19     The victim said that he was in such great pain that he was more concerned about himself than about the accused and what she was thinking of. He said that he could not recall why the accused would pour hot water on his groin.

20     The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) then applied under s 161 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) to refresh the victim’s memory by showing him the statement he gave to the police about two weeks after the hot water incident when he was still in the hospital. After refreshing his memory, the victim told the court that when he asked the accused, “Why you do this to me?”, her reply was, “Serve you right”. He understood it to mean that maybe he was at fault and that he had done something to hurt her.

21     Having refreshed his memory, the victim told the court that it seemed that the accused had seen the messages his friend, Linda sent him and she was unhappy about them which was why she poured hot water on his groin[^5]. The victim did not know what kind of messages the accused could have read because when he left for the hospital, his handphone was still in her flat. When he later asked the accused about the whereabouts of his handphone, she claimed that she did not take it and did not know where it was[^6].

## The accused’s evidence

22     The accused told the court that she and the victim were very much in love. About three years into their relationship, the victim brought her to meet his parents in Johore Bahru where they talked about marriage plans. In 2012, the victim met the accused’s father at his residence in Malaysia and they also discussed her marriage to the victim. The victim wanted to get married in Batam but the accused wished to be married in Singapore instead. Ultimately, the marriage did not take place.

23     The accused testified that they had many problems between them over the years, starting from 2011. If the victim were to get angry with the accused, and she did not answer his telephone calls, he would call her at her office number repeatedly to ask for her or he would go to her office at Changi Airport and hide behind the pillar to wait for her until she finished work. Most of the time he would go to her void deck at about 4.30am to waylay her as he knew that was the time she would leave for work and offer her a lift. If he went to her flat and she refused to open the door, he would slam the window panels and once he broke the glass. During their relationship, the victim told the accused that he had divorced his wife in 2014. He claimed to her that he had stopped seeing his wife and was only seeing the children. When his wife kept calling him, he said it was because she was asking him for maintenance.

24     The accused told the court that she had two major quarrels with the victim in January 2017. The first major quarrel was on 12 January 2017 at Harbourfront Ferry Terminal over a woman called Linda. The accused suspected that the victim was having an affair with Linda and on that day, she caught the victim coming back from Batam with Linda. They had their second major quarrel one or two weeks after 12 January 2017 when this time round, the victim saw the accused coming back in her former male schoolmate’s car. There were no other big quarrels between them after January 2017 and they continued to see each other and go out together.

25     On 4 July 2017, the accused went to work in the morning, between 5.30am and 9.30am. The victim called her after she finished her work and said that he would be going to her place for dinner once he had settled his matters at the customer’s house and he requested her to cook black squid for him. So, the accused did her marketing and went home to prepare dinner for the victim.

26     The victim reached her flat at about 10pm. They ate their dinner at the sofa in the living room and watched television together for about an hour. The accused then went to wash the dishes and clean the kitchen while the victim dozed off on the sofa. At about 11.15pm, accused went to her bedroom to sleep.

27     The accused got up at about 1am to use the toilet. She then woke the victim up and asked him to show her his handphone as she wanted to find out if Linda was still sending him messages after midnight when the victim was not with the accused. The accused said that the victim’s handphone was in the silent mode and he would always lock it. The accused testified that the victim showed her a message from Linda asking him, “Where are you?”. The accused recognized Linda’s WhatsApp profile picture. The accused said that the victim was holding tightly onto his handphone and he showed the message to the accused “just for a while”.

28     The accused then started telling the victim, “Why not you just stay on with that girl. Just leave me alone. No need to come and see me. Don’t disturb my life, you know. Stop coming and, uh, coming and disturb me. I---I have my own life too, you know, to continue with, you know. I want to find a good husband. I don’t want to---I don’t want to go with a man, you know, like, no happy ending, no marriage, as I’m looking for a husband, not a boyfriend.” The accused said that the victim was unhappy with what she was saying, and he told her “no, no, no” and that he would still love her.

29     Their argument took place at the sofa and it went on for about half an hour when the accused decided to boil some hot water to drink. She said she was the type to drink hot water all the time. She was talking to the victim as she walked to the kitchen, telling him to leave and to go back. The accused stood in front of the microwave oven where she boiled some water in the white flask/electric kettle that was placed on top of the microwave oven (see the photographs in exhibits P4(9) and (10)). The victim followed the accused into the kitchen and sat on a stack of stools while he faced the back of accused. Their respective positions in the kitchen were as indicated by the accused in the photograph in exhibit P4(8).

30     The accused said that she poured the boiling hot water into a J.CO mug (see the photograph in exhibit P4(14)) she was holding in her left hand. She was turning left to return to the living room when the victim pulled the upper part of her left elbow forcefully to tell her that he did not want to go back, that he still loved her and wanted to be with her.

31     The accused said that the victim pulled her left elbow while he was seated. That was when the “boiling hot water”[^7] in the mug the accused was holding tightly in her left hand spilled onto the victim and landed on the victim’s groin area. The victim was wearing a shirt and tailored pants. The accused testified that the victim quickly stood up and pulled down his pants. He showed her his burns and she saw that “all the skin”[^8] had come off. She offered to bring him to the hospital, but the victim told her that there was no need since she was working the next day and said that he would go to the hospital on his own. The accused said that the victim left her flat within five minutes after looking for his handphone and bag. Before he left, he asked, “Hey, why---why---why you did this to me?” The accused said that the victim was accusing her of pouring hot water on him. The accused said that she clarified with the victim that it was accidental by replying, “No, you spilt the hot water.”

32     The accused told the court that she loved the victim and she would never intentionally pour hot water on him to jeopardise herself. She said that the spilling would not have happened if the victim did not pull her arm and that the victim was the one who caused the hot water spillage on himself.

33     That night on 5 July 2017 at about 11pm, the accused said that she received a call from the victim’s brother, Marwan, who was not called as a witness. Marwan alleged during the call that the accused had poured hot water on the victim which she denied. The accused said that Marwan told her to wait for the police to call her. On 6 July 2017 at about 11.18am, the accused went to lodge a police report about the hot water incident and her telephone conversation with Marwan (exhibit D2). The accused testified that she wanted the police to know the truth and she was not afraid of exposing herself to investigations.

34     On 7 July 2017, PW4 Investigation Officer (“IO”) Inspector Lim Ying Xieng called the accused down to Ang Mo Kio Police Division to record her first statement (exhibit D1) regarding the hot water incident. On 24 August 2017, the IO recorded a second statement from the accused as the IO was investigating into the whereabouts of the victim’s handphone which he claimed she had taken. The accused denied stealing the victim’s handphone. She said that on 5 July 2017, after she checked the messages on the victim’s handphone, he took it back and kept it in his bag. She said that when the victim left for the hospital that morning, he took his bag with him. The accused told the court that subsequently, the victim requested her to return him his handphone which he claimed he had left behind in her flat, but she told him that she had not seen it around. The accused testified that she was never charged for the theft of the victim’s handphone.

35     After the hot water incident on 5 July 2017, there was no contact between the accused and the victim until 21 August 2017. During this period, the accused said that she tried to call the victim but his handphone was turned off. She did not know if he was admitted into any hospital although she thought that should be the case. She explained that she and the victim’s family members did not have each other’s handphone numbers and she did not know who else to call.

36     On 21 August 2017, the victim called the accused on another handphone of hers and said he wanted to meet her. In that telephone conversation, the accused enquired after the victim’s wounds and told him that applying aloe vera would help his wounds heal faster. When the victim requested the accused to help him get the aloe vera, the accused suggested that he should get his new girlfriend to get it for him. The victim however said that he wanted the accused to get the aloe vera for him. In the end, the accused agreed to get it for him, and she went to Sheng Siong Supermarket and bought two aloe vera for the victim. Later that day, the victim went to the accused’s flat to collect the aloe vera. The accused said that initially she did not want to open the door. She was going to pass the aloe vera to the victim through the gate, but the victim wanted to go into her flat. He then wanted to have sex. The accused said that she pointed out to the victim that he was in pain and his groin area still bandaged but the victim said it was okay. The accused told the court that they then had sex and they did not encounter any issues. On that day, they did not talk about the hot water incident.

37     The accused said that in fact, the victim “never” asked her why she intentionally poured hot water on him. There was only one occasion around July 2018 which was after the accused had been charged in court, that the victim asked her why she did not inform him about it. He claimed to the accused that he knew somebody who was “higher than the judge” who could stop the case. The accused also testified that the victim told her that he would not be changing his statement otherwise he would go to jail however he did not tell the accused what statement he gave to the police. On her part, the accused found no reason to bring up the hot water incident because her conscience was clear since it was an accident.

38     The accused and the victim continued to see each other after 21 August 2017. The next day on 22 August 2017, the victim visited the accused and they went out for lunch. On 18 October 2017, they went to Hillion Shopping Mall where the accused treated the victim to dinner because he said he had no money. On 12 November 2017, they attended the CelebFest at Suntec City which was like a fair. On 17 November 2017, the pair went for a durian buffet at the Goodwood Park Hotel. In December 2017, they patronised a carnival. The accused tendered photographs extracted from her handphone at exhibit D6 which showed the happy couple at these events and they were hugging in some instances. The accused could not recall all the dates, but she said that they could have gone out on more than 20 occasions. Their last outing was on 30 December 2018 where they checked into Hotel 81 at Lavender and had sex. I noted that the accused had initially told the court that the date was 29 December 2018, but she later accepted that the date should be 30 December 2018 based on police investigations.

39     The accused gave evidence that between 21 August 2017 to 30 December 2018, the accused and the victim would have sex once or twice a week either in hotels such as Hotel 81, Fragrance Hotel and Madras Hotel or at the back of his van. The accused testified that the victim was able to “perform as a normal man”. She said that they would usually meet outside as since the hot water incident, she did not allow him to go to her flat.

40     On 30 December 2018, after they had sex at Hotel 81, when she was at the mirror area, the accused caught the victim videoing her with his handphone and she was naked. She scolded him and he deleted the video recording. They then continued to have sex. After the incident on 30 December 2018, they telephoned each other once or twice but later when the accused tried to call the victim, she said that she could not get through to him. She had wanted him to return her stuff, but he simply ignored her calls and messages. After that, they stopped calling and seeing each other. 30 December 2018 was the last time that they met[^9].

## The law on assessing credibility of witnesses

41     In _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ \[2001\] 3 SLR (R) 592 at \[9\], the High Court held that that a judge could make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

> (a)     His demeanour.

> (b)     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence.

> (c)     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

## The court’s findings

### The victim was a truthful and credible witness

42     I found the victim to be a truthful witness who had given a credible account of the hot water incident. After a careful evaluation of the evidence adduced during the trial, I accepted his testimony of the incident for the following reasons.

#### The victim’s account was internally consistent

43     In my view, the victim gave a vivid and compelling account of how he sustained the hot water burns on his body. His evidence that he initially thought the liquid on his groin could be acid and how he got up immediately and jumped about to try to shake off the excess fluid was consistent with his description that he had been sleeping supine on the sofa. He was frank in admitting that he did not catch the accused in the act of pouring hot water over his groin and that he could not recall her facial expression or whether she was holding anything in her hand as he was in pain. Although he did not witness the accused committing the act, I agreed with the Prosecution that the logical inexorable inference had to be that she was the culprit. She was the only other person present in the flat at that time and she was standing next to the sofa when the victim awoke. She even told the victim, “Serve you right” when he looked to her for an answer for what she had done to him. All the evidence pointed to the accused as being the perpetrator.

44     The Defence argued that the victim was being inconsistent by initially claiming that he could not recall why the accused had poured hot water on him to later explaining to the court after refreshing his memory with his previous statement that the accused had poured hot water on him because she was unhappy over certain phone messages which Linda had sent him. I did not consider the change in the victim’s evidence as a material inconsistency. I regarded it as an elaboration by the victim after he had the chance to read his previous statement. We would remember that the victim did not lodge any police report against the accused regarding the hot water incident. It was SGH that alerted the police about it. Given the close nature of the relationship they were in, it would be fair to infer that the victim was a reluctant witness in this trial and his unwillingness to tell the court that the accused had uttered incriminating remarks at the scene was not surprising.

45     The Defence also contended that the victim’s account was irrational since according to the victim, he did not have any quarrels with the accused on the day of the hot water incident so there was no reason for the accused to want to hurt the victim.

46     On the facts before me, it was clear that there was a triggering event that morning even though things were peaceful prior to the hot water incident. The victim said that the accused was always going on about Linda and that she had the idea that the victim had a close or secret relationship with Linda. The accused confirmed in her evidence that she did not like the victim to have any contact with Linda because she had heard from Linda’s uncle back in 2014 that the victim was having an affair with Linda. The victim said that one week after he was hospitalised, his family members told him that they had received anonymous messages regarding his relationship with Linda. The accused admitted in court that she had sent messages to the victim’s family members complaining about his relationship with another woman after his hospitalisation[^10]. Therefore, in my view, there was basis for the victim to believe that the accused must have seen the text messages Linda sent him which made her so unhappy that she poured hot water on his groin area[^11].

47     The victim’s belief that the accused must have seen Linda’s messages was borne out by the accused’s own testimony. The accused told the court that on 5 July 2017, she saw that Linda had texted the victim asking him, “Where are you?”. According to her own evidence, the innocuous message nonetheless affected and agitated her so much that she claimed she had a heated argument with the victim and she even told him to leave her flat because she wanted to end their relationship. While I did not accept the accused’s version of how the victim came to sustain his injuries, it was clear that the hot water incident did not happen without rhyme or reason. Linda’s phone message or messages to the victim was the catalyst for the hot water incident.

48     For the above reasons, I found the victim’s evidence to be coherent and internally consistent with a ring of truth to it.

#### The victim’s account of the hot water incident was materially consistent with his accounts to others

49     The victim’s account that the accused had poured hot water on his groin while he was sleeping was also materially consistent with the accounts that he provided to the medical team at SGH. PW3 Dr Christina Ng Hui Lee and PW1 Dr Chew Khong Yik were involved in the victim’s inpatient care. PW3 Dr Christina Ng testified that the victim told her that he was sleeping when his girlfriend poured boiling water on his groin. PW1 Dr Chew testified that the victim recounted to him that his then girlfriend threw hot water onto the victim’s groin area while he was sleeping. The details are as set out below.

50     PW3 Dr Christina Ng was the Plastics Medical Officer on duty at the Accident & Emergency Department on 5 July 2017 when the victim arrived at SGH. As noted in PW3 Dr Christina Ng’s case record at exhibit P6, she assessed and examined the victim at around 2.50am during which he told her that he was sleeping and his girlfriend poured boiling water on him over the groin at two o’clock in the morning. PW3 Dr Christina Ng also documented the information given by the victim in his Inpatient Discharge Summary at exhibit P1 dated 31 July 2017. At exhibit P1, page 2, PW3 Dr Christina Ng recorded under “Clinical Summary” that the victim “was involved in an **_argument_** with girlfriend and she threw hot water on his lap while he was sleeping on the couch.”

51     The victim maintained that he did not tell PW3 Dr Christina Ng that he was involved in an argument with his girlfriend. It was unclear how PW3 Dr Christina Ng came to state in the victim’s Inpatient Discharge Summary at exhibit P1 that the victim “was involved in an argument with girlfriend” as she was not queried about it during the trial. I noted however, that the Inpatient Discharge Summary at exhibit P1 was completed by PW3 Dr Christina Ng on 31 July 2017, the day that the victim was discharged. In her earlier case record dated 5 July 2017 at exhibit P6, there was no mention of an argument between the victim and his girlfriend. In my view, PW3 Dr Christina Ng could have made an erroneous entry in respect of the “argument”. Be that as it may, it was crucial to note that the consistent message from the victim was that he was sleeping when the hot water incident happened.

52     PW1 Dr Chew was a consultant plastic surgeon at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burns Unit at SGH. He specialised in plastic and reconstructive surgery including burns treatment and burns surgery and had been in practice for 17 years. He was the principal doctor of the medical team in charge of the victim’s case. PW3 Dr Christina Ng was part of PW1 Dr Chew’s team. PW1 Dr Chew told the court that he recalled the victim mentioning to him that the victim’s injury “was as a result of his then girlfriend throwing hot water onto his ..groin area while he was sleeping”[^12].

53     What the victim told the medical team at SGH was also captured in exhibit P8, the Case Summary Form lodged by a staff nurse with the Central Police Divisional HQ on 5 July 2017 at 5.54pm. SGH reported that on 5 July 2017 at about 2am, “… patient was at his girlfriend’s house when she poured boiling water on his groin while he was sleeping. He suffered burns on his thighs, left upper limbs and buttock area. He proceeded to SGH by himself. That’s all.”

54     As set out above, the victim had been materially consistent in his accounts as to how he suffered the thermal burns.

#### The victim’s evidence was corroborated by objective medical evidence

55     The victim’s evidence was corroborated by independent objective medical evidence from at least two doctors, namely PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok Yee Onn. Both PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok testified that it was most likely that the victim was lying down in a supine position when the hot water incident happened. Both doctors also told the court that the volume of the hot water required to cause the burn injuries in question would likely be 200 to 300 millilitres or more. This indicated that almost all or if not all the hot water in the mug the accused was holding ended up on the victim’s groin area. PW1 Dr Chew further opined that it was a direct pour onto the victim’s groin, which was consistent with the victim’s account that the incident was not an accident.

56     For completeness, I summarise below the material evidence of PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok.

##### (1)   Evidence of PW1 Dr Chew Khong Yik

57     As the principal doctor, PW1 Dr Chew was ultimately responsible for the care of the victim. He made the main clinical decisions to admit the victim for the first surgery on 5 July 2017 at 8.10am and later for the victim’s admission to the Burns Unit for treatment. PW1 Dr Chew decided on the victim’s subsequent two surgeries on 21 July 2017. He also made the decision to discharge the victim on 31 July 2017 after consultation.

58     PW1 Dr Chew performed all the three surgeries on the victim. The first surgery involved scrubbing down and removing the superficial skin layer that had been burned away and applying Biobrane onto the raw wounds to act as an artificial skin replacement. Not all the wounds were healing well, and further procedures were necessary. Hence, on 21 July 2017, at about 1.10pm, PW1 Dr Chew performed two similar surgeries in the same session on the victim, one on his left groin and the other on his left thigh. PW1 Dr Chew dissected the dead skin and carried out “Split-Thickness Skin Graft” (SSG). The SSG was harvested from the healthy area of the victim’s left thigh and applied to his groin and upper thigh to replace the removed skin.

59     In this case, PW1 Dr Chew diagnosed the victim as having suffered thermal burns or hot water burns. PW1 Dr Chew said that “thermal injury” implied that the burn injury was sustained from the transfer of heat from an object to the patient, such as contact burns from liquid and solid objects. PW1 Dr Chew stated that any assessment of a burn injury would involve the body surface area and the thickness of the burn injury. PW1 Dr Chew explained that one per cent body surface area was represented by the palm size of the individual. PW1 Dr Chew testified that the victim sustained burns over 12% of his TBSA which was equivalent to about 12 palm sizes of the victim. The 12% body surface area involved the victim’s bilateral upper and medial thighs with extension to the left lateral buttock and perianal region, upper torso, left hand palm and fingertips. PW1 Dr Chew said that anything above 10% of the body surface area if it involved the mucosa membrane like the face or the perianal area which encompassed the genitals, the region between the genitals and the anal area, and the area slightly above the genital area where there was hair distribution would be considered a major burn injury. He added that most people also included the inner thigh and buttock area as the perianal region. PW1 Dr Chew further explained that the thickness or severity of the burn injury in layman’s terms was divided into first degree, second degree and third degree burn, third degree burn being the most serious. In this case, PW1 Dr Chew Khong Yik diagnosed the victim as having sustained second degree severity burn injuries some of which converted into third degree burns[^13].

60     PW1 Dr Chew estimated the volume of hot water or fluid required to inflict the extent of burn injuries sustained by the victim to be around a cup size, around 200 to 300 millilitres. He further estimated the liquid to have a temperature of at least 90 to 100 degrees centigrade[^14].

61     There were eight photographs taken of the victim’s injuries during his admission at SGH (see exhibits P3(1) to (8)). Due to the personal nature and sensitivity of these photographs, I granted the Prosecution’s application under s 7 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) not to have these photographs published or circulated. The Defence had no objection.

62     The photographs in exhibits P3(1) to (8) were taken on different days. The first five photographs in exhibit P3(1) to (5) were taken during the first surgery on 5 July 2017. The sixth photograph in exhibit P3(6) was taken 7 days after the surgery, on 12 July 2017. The last two photographs in exhibits P3(7) and (8) were taken on 31 July 2017 prior to discharging the victim.

63     PW1 Dr Chew told the court that based on what he saw during his physical examination of the victim on the day of the first surgery on 5 July 2017, in his experience, he would say that the hot liquid was poured directly onto the victim’s groin or left upper thigh region[^15]. Based on the distribution of the burn injuries as captured in the photographs, the indication was that the hot water was poured while the victim was lying down, which was consistent with the history given by the victim[^16]. PW1 Dr Chew’s reasons were as follows:

> (a)     PW1 Dr Chew told the court that when a hot liquid was poured onto an area with sufficient speed and the liquid jumped from the initial injury onto another part of the body, splash injury would occur. The initial injury would be the primary injury while the splash injury would be the secondary injury, away from the primary injury[^17]. In this case, PW1 Dr Chew identified the burn injuries on the victim’s upper thighs, the area above his groin, the penis and scrotum as the primary injuries[^18]. PW1 Dr Chew stated that there was an absence of splash injury due to gravity. If the patient were to be standing up or sitting down and hot water poured onto his groin, he would expect the fluid to leak downwards onto the patient’s knee, calf, foot and even the toes. In this case, PW1 Dr Chew said that no injury was evident on the victim’s lower thigh, knee, and calf areas on 5 July 2017[^19].

> (b)      Another indication to PW1 Dr Chew that the victim was lying down when he sustained the injuries was the left buttock extension of the victim’s burns. He said that the victim’s left buttock had a distribution that was contiguous with the groin burns[^20]. The photograph in exhibit P3(3) showed that the victim’s left buttock injury was a big surface area burn which suggested that the fluid probably flowed from his groin down into the buttock in a front to back fashion. If the patient were standing up or sitting down, PW1 Dr Chew would expect the fluid to flow downwards into the thigh rather than into the buttock itself. In the present case, PW1 Dr Chew stated that if a person were lying down and hot liquid were poured onto his groin, his injury would be consistent with what was shown in the photograph in exhibit P3(3).

> (c)     PW1 Dr Chew said that the victim suffered splash injuries to his upper torso, lower chest, flank and abdomen which were the result of sudden splashes from the liquid poured onto the victim’s groin or left upper thigh region. In his opinion, the splashes that occurred further up on the victim’s torso could be explained if the victim were in a sleeping position and they were consistent with injuries sustained while the victim was lying down in a supine position[^21].

64     PW1 Dr Chew further testified that the burn injuries to the victim’s left palm and fingers (see the photographs in exhibit P3(4) and (5)) were also consistent with the victim’s history that he tried to remove his garment which was soaked in hot liquid with his left hand thus sustaining those injuries[^22]. PW1 Dr Chew explained that garments would tend to absorb a significant amount of fluid especially if the patient was wearing multiple layers. Although no hot water was poured onto the victim’s left hand, the victim suffered one per cent body surface area of second degree burns to his left palm and fingers from coming into contact with his soaked garment.

65     During his cross-examination, PW1 Dr Chew agreed with the Defence that while he could not rule out the possibility that the victim could have been sitting down or standing up when he suffered the hot water burns, in his opinion, it was an “unlikely” scenario[^23]. PW1 Dr Chew also agreed that he could not rule out the possibility of accidental injury according to the Defence’s version[^24].

66     During his re-examination, PW1 Dr Chew clarified that of the three scenarios as to whether the victim was sitting, standing or lying down when the hot water incident happened, based on the photographs and his clinical examinations, he was “more inclined” to think that the victim’s injuries were sustained while he was lying down[^25]. He said that lying down would be the “most likely scenario” based on the physical evidence and history given by the victim[^26].

##### (2)   Evidence of PW2 Dr Kok Yee Onn

67     PW2 Dr Kok was a senior resident or plastic surgery training doctor at SGH at the material time. He was not involved in the victim’s inpatient care. After the victim was discharged from SGH on 31 July 2017, PW2 Dr Kok saw the victim once in the outpatient clinic on 7 August 2017. Thereafter the victim defaulted in his follow up.

68     As the doctor who last saw the victim, PW2 Dr Kok wrote the victim’s medical report dated 18 August 2017 at exhibit P2. He issued a clarification report about a year later, on 18 July 2018 at exhibit P5 in response to certain queries by PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim. In his clarification report, in answer to the IO’s question as to whether the burn splatters were more in keeping with a lying or a sitting position, PW2 Dr Kok replied at \[2c)\] in exhibit P5 that “both were possible, unable to differentiate”.

69     PW2 Dr Kok told the court that since he was not involved in the initial care of the victim, he did not see the photographs in exhibit P3 until a few days before the trial[^27]. At the time he issued the clarification report at exhibit P5 stating that the victim’s injuries were possible with both a lying and a sitting position and that he was unable to differentiate between these two positions based on the injuries, PW2 Dr Kok explained that he did not have the benefit of the photographs at exhibit P3. Further, when he last examined the victim on 7 August 2017, almost 90% of the victim’s wounds had healed so the burns pattern was not obvious to him. Therefore, at the time of the clarification report, he was not able to differentiate whether the victim had sustained the injuries in a sitting or a lying down position. PW2 Dr Kok further explained that generally the doctors would not state anything damning or conclusive in writing unless they were 100% certain[^28].

70     With the benefit of the photographs in exhibit P3, PW2 Dr Kok told the court that, of the three scenarios, whether the victim was standing up, sitting down or lying down when he suffered the burn injuries, he was of the opinion that standing was not usual. He would still say that lying and sitting were both possible positions, but the most likely scenario was that the patient was lying down in a supine position[^29]. His reason for picking the lying down position over the sitting position was that normally for a sitting position, there would not be a “random patch high up on the chest wall”[^30]. He said that normally in a sitting position, the upper left chest wall burns would not be that common because that was a kind of a splash pattern. Secondly, the burns would extend lower to the lower thigh just above the knee[^31], which were not present in this case.

71     During his cross-examination, PW2 Dr Kok said that the amount of hot water involved to cause the injuries in question would be at least 200 to 300 millilitres if not more. He agreed with the Defence that he could not rule out the possibility that the victim was in a sitting position when he sustained the burns. Neither could PW2 Dr Kok rule out that the injuries were caused by an accident. Nonetheless he maintained in re-examination that lying supine was the most likely scenario because the burns pattern would be slightly different most of the time as the lower thigh just above the knee would probably be involved. In other words, the mid and lower thigh would usually be involved in a sitting position[^32].

72     I was aware that during her cross-examination, PW3 Dr Christina Ng said that she could not rule out the possibility that the victim sustained the burn injuries accidentally[^33]. Nor could she rule out the possibility that the victim sustained the injuries according to the version of events by the Defence[^34]. PW3 Dr Christina Ng was not a specialist in burns. She told the court that she was a medical officer “passing through” the Department of Plastic Surgery at the material time. As such, I was of the view that the evidence of PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok should carry more weight, particularly that of PW1 Dr Chew who was the principal doctor of the victim and involved in the victim’s inpatient care while PW2 Dr Kok only saw the victim once as an outpatient. In any case, PW3 Dr Christina Ng’s evidence was general and given in the context of mere possibilities.

#### The victim had no reason to frame the accused

73     I found that the victim had no reason to frame the accused by falsely claiming that she poured hot water on his groin while he was sleeping. My reasons were as follows.

74     If the victim really wanted to exact revenge on the accused for causing him the burns, he could have easily lodged a police report against her, but he did not. The police were alerted about the hot water incident only through the Case Summary Form filed by SGH on 5 July 2017 (see exhibit P8). The accused acknowledged that this proved just how much the victim loved her[^35].

75     The victim was in a medical emergency. He was in extreme pain from his thermal burns. He rated the pain to be 10 out of 10. He was in such pain that he felt “like it seems I want to die”. It was therefore highly unlikely that he was in the state of mind to concoct lies against the accused at SGH, particularly when he was seeking urgent medical treatment. On the contrary, he would want to tell the medical team the truth as soon as possible so that the doctors could make prompt proper diagnosis and treat him immediately.

76     The victim’s actions after the hot water incident showed that he had forgiven the accused despite what she did to him and that it was not his plan to get her into trouble. It was not in dispute that the accused did not visit the victim at the hospital nor speak to him during his hospitalisation. During his cross-examination, the victim told the court that he was very angry with the accused when the hot water incident happened which was why he asked her then, “Why you do it to me?”. During his hospitalisation of 26 days, he managed to calm down and reflected on the many years they had been together. He also felt sorry for the accused that her eldest son died some years ago. The victim therefore decided to put the hot water incident behind him since it had already happened, and he still loved her at that point of time[^36]. In fact, when he was in the hospital, he tried calling the accused as he had missed her[^37]. Thus, after his discharge from SGH, the victim was the one who initiated contact with the accused by calling her on 21 August 2017 and requesting her to buy aloe vera for him. If he were still angry with the accused, he would have confronted her over the incident and reproached her for not visiting him in hospital. He did none of that as he wanted to make up with her.

77     In this regard, there were some disputes as to the events on 21 August 2017. Initially, the victim told the court that it was his brother who collected the aloe vera from the accused on his behalf. The next day, he clarified in court that after checking with his brother, he confirmed that he was the one who went to the accused’s flat on 21 August 2017. The victim said that on 21 August 2017, he collected the aloe vera which the accused left on the shoe rack outside her flat and she was not home. He denied meeting the accused that day. According to the accused, the victim not only collected the aloe vera from her, they also had sex at her flat that day.

78     I was prepared to accept that the victim met up with the accused on 21 August 2017, but I doubted that the victim had sex with the accused in her flat as she had claimed. The victim last saw PW2 Dr Kok on 7 August 2017 at the outpatient clinic and he did not return to the clinic for follow-up after his medical leave ended on 12 August 2017. PW2 Dr Kok testified that had the victim not defaulted on his review, the victim’s medical leave could possibly have been extended[^38]. The accused verified that the victim was in pain on 21 August 2017 and that his groin area was bandaged. Given these facts, it was unlikely that the victim would insist on having sex with the accused that day.

79     In any event, I was of the view that it was inconsequential whether the victim had met the accused at her flat on 21 August 2017 or whether they had sex that day. What was noteworthy and undisputed was the fact that it was the victim who re-established contact with the accused on 21 August 2017 because he wanted to patch up with her and that the couple reconciled after that.

80     The Defence was not able to pinpoint why the victim would want to falsely incriminate the accused. During her cross-examination, the accused admitted that she was not sure why the victim would want to make false allegations against her[^39]. She offered three possible motivations on the victim’s part for making false accusations against her[^40].

81     First, she said that the victim could have been angry with her for not giving him a $5000 loan to buy a van. According to the accused, the loan incident happened between 2009 and 2014[^41]. I doubted that the victim would frame the accused over an event that happened years ago which did not appear to have affected their relationship.

82     Secondly, the accused suggested that the victim could have framed her to stop her from breaking up with him. In my view, this did not make sense. How would implicating the accused falsely for a serious crime help to keep her by the victim’s side? If anything, it would only succeed in pushing or driving her away.

83     Lastly, the accused suggested that the victim could have been jealous and possibly did it to get back at her for going out with her former male colleague. The victim denied the existence of such an incident.

84     I was doubtful that this incident happened for the reasons set out below (see \[105\] to \[108\]). Even if I were to accept that it took place, according to the accused’s evidence, the couple subsequently made up and until the hot water incident, they had no major issues between them. I was therefore not persuaded that the victim was out to malign the accused due to this remote episode.

85     It was therefore clear from the evidence that the victim had no apparent or plausible reason to frame the accused.

### Other issues raised by the Defence

#### No burns marks on the sofa

86     The Defence claimed that there should have been burn marks on the leather sofa if the hot water incident had occurred there and since there were none, it meant that the victim was untruthful. The Defence did not adduce any expert evidence in support of its assertion. It sought to rely on the evidence of PW3 Dr Christina Ng during cross-examination where she said that she would expect the sofa to display signs of damage, burn or scarring if someone were to pour hot water on it[^42] to submit that the hot water incident did not happen at the sofa.

87     In re-examination, I noted that PW3 Dr Christina Ng conceded that she was not qualified to comment on burn marks on sofas. During cross-examination, the accused admitted that she herself was not an expert on sofas and she was not sure whether pouring boiling hot water on a leather sofa would cause scar marks or any marks for that matter[^43]. In this regard, I was also inclined to agree with PW1 Dr Chew’s observation that leather seats would have been treated chemically to withstand a certain degree of damage or tear and wear and he would think that a treated leather sofa would be more resistant to hot water than the human skin[^44].

88     Besides, given PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok’s evidence that the volume of hot water was likely around 200 to 300 millilitres if not more to cause the victim’s thermal injuries, it would be fair to infer that most of the water from the mug was absorbed by the victim’s clothing even if there was seepage to the sofa. As PW1 Dr Chew had pointed out, by the time the hot water travelled to the sofa from the front of the victim’s abdomen and seeped to the side down to the victim’s buttock, the temperature of the hot water would have reduced and the amount of contact with the sofa would probably be much less compared to the initial contact with the victim’s anterior abdomen and groin[^45].

89     Having regard to the above, I was of the view that the absence of burn marks on the sofa had no real bearing in this case.

#### Whether the accused took the victim’s handphone on 5 July 2017

90     According to the victim during his cross-examination, he had two handphones with him when he went to the accused’s flat on 4 July 2017. One handphone which was unlocked belonged to him and the other handphone which was locked belonged to his friend[^46]. He said that his handphone was new as he just bought it two days ago and he did not have the time to set up a lock code[^47]. When he fell asleep on the sofa on 5 July 2017, the handphones were in his bag beside the sofa[^48]. The victim said that when he subsequently asked the accused about the whereabouts of his handphone, the accused only returned him his friend’s handphone and claimed that she did not take his new handphone or did not know its whereabouts.

91     The accused denied taking the victim’s handphone. Her version was that on 5 July 2017, she had woken him up and got him to show her Linda’s messages on his handphone. She also claimed that he would lock his handphone which implied that she could not have access to Linda’s messages unless the victim unlocked his handphone and allowed her to read them. The Defence also pointed out that the accused was not charged for stealing the victim’s handphone which could only mean that the victim lied about the accused taking his handphone.

92     I was inclined to believe the victim’s evidence that the accused must have taken and accessed his new unlocked handphone on 5 July 2017 and read Linda’s message(s) to him during the time he was asleep. It was clearly not an afterthought for the victim to surmise that this was what had transpired. I noted that the victim informed PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim early on that the accused had taken his handphone. PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim specifically recorded a second long statement from the accused on 24 August 2017 (see exhibit D4) for the purpose of ascertaining whether she had taken the victim’s handphone and failed to return it to him[^49]. The accused also admitted in her statement in exhibit D4 that the victim had claimed that he left his handphone in her flat after the hot water incident, but she had told him that she did not see his handphone. As regards the fact that the accused was not charged for any offence relating to the victim’s handphone, it was neither here nor there.

#### Why would the victim reconcile with the accused if the hot water incident had been intentional?

93     The Defence submitted that the victim would not have reconciled with the accused if it were true that the accused had intentionally poured hot water on his groin. In my view, this submission cut both ways. It could be equally argued that if it were true that the victim had falsely implicated the accused, the accused would have ended their relationship and not continue to be intimate with him especially after she had been charged in court on 23 March 2018 for the offence. We would recall that they only ceased all contact with each other after 21 January 2019.

94     As the victim and the accused had both testified, the fact of the matter was that they were in a long-term relationship. Despite the hot water incident, out of love, they had decided to stick by each other. After all, they had been together for more than a decade and were contemplating marriage. During the victim’s cross-examination, he said that he could not recall if he subsequently probed to find out from the accused as to why she had poured hot water on his groin. He felt that it would have made no difference whether he asked the accused this question[^50]. He also could not recall whether the accused queried him on why he falsely reported against her[^51]. Where the accused was concerned, she told the court that they totally did not broach the subject of the hot water incident. The accused felt that there was no need for her to raise it with the victim as her conscience was clear. Which meant that she also did not confront the victim for purportedly maligning her to his brother, Marwan, that she had poured hot water on him which led to the accused lodging a police report on 6 July 2017 (exhibit D2).

95     Both the victim and the accused plainly deemed it unimportant and unnecessary to dwell on the hot water incident even though it was a life changing event for them. They patched up despite what the other person had done and were not keen to pursue the matter between them. Therefore, the fact that they had reconciled clearly had no bearing on whether the elements of the offence in this case had been made out.

96     For completeness, I shall deal with exhibit D7, which were screenshots of the accused’s WhatsApp conversation with the victim for the period 12 July 2018 to 8 August 2018. It showed that on 12 July 2018, the victim had sent the accused a YouTube video of the song “Hard to say I’m sorry” from the movie, “Jerry Maguire”. Initially the accused said that she understood from the song that the victim was saying sorry to her, but she did not know what he was saying sorry for. Exhibit D7 showed that the accused replied, “I forgive u long time ago. Jus b happy wf yr life”. From exhibit D7, some days later, the accused WhatsApp the victim and asked him, “Y say sorry”. The victim replied with a “Sorry” and a crying emoji. The accused responded with “Im out of job bcos of u”, “Im sure u r happy”. The accused explained to the court that she lost her job due to the victim’s claim that she poured hot water on him[^52]. The accused’s purpose of producing these messages in court was to demonstrate that the victim was saying sorry to her for causing her to lose her job with his false allegations[^53].

97     The victim denied that he was apologising to the accused in the WhatsApp conversation for having given false accounts about the hot water incident. He clarified that he was apologising to her for an unrelated matter[^54]. The hot water incident happened on 5 July 2017, about a year back. It was not unreasonable that the victim should be apologizing to the accused for a different matter. I noted that in exhibit D7, after the accused’s messages, “Im out of job now bcos of u”, “Im sure u r happy”, the victim had replied, “I did not do anything”, “What happened?”, “Where are you?”, “I’m here”. In my view, these WhatsApp responses by the victim supported his evidence that he was not referring to the hot water incident. In contrast, his responses suggested that he was clueless as to what the accused was trying to say.

98     Further, without a proper context and more background to these vague messages in exhibit D7, I would be slow to impute to the victim that he was expressing his regrets to the accused for lying about her involvement in the hot water incident. To be clear, the accused was not certain either what the victim was apologising for as she said that “maybe” the victim was saying sorry for “putting me in a situation like that”, where she ended up being charged for the offence . Given the ambiguous WhatsApp messages in exhibit D7, I did not find it to be a useful or relevant piece of evidence.

#### Whether the victim lied about not having sex and checking into hotels with the accused

99     The victim maintained that he did not have sex with the accused after the hot water incident because he was having problem with his penis as the skin would pull and it was painful. He clarified that he did not have erectile dysfunction but said that he felt a “lesser urge”. He also claimed that he did not check into any hotels with the accused after his discharge from hospital. The accused’s version was that they had sex on the very first day on 21 August 2017 when they saw each other again after the hot water incident. Thereafter, she said they would have sex once or twice a week in a hotel or at the back of the victim’s van.

100    In respect of the hotel visits, during the trial, the Defence invited the Prosecution to conduct investigations as to whether the victim and the accused had checked into Hotel 81 at Lavender Street on 29 December 2018, the date initially given by the accused, as the last occasion she met the victim and they had sex in the hotel. The learned DPP subsequently informed the court that further investigations revealed that the accused and the victim checked into Hotel 81 Violet on 30th December 2018 at 5:12pm and checked out at 7:13pm[^55]. The Defence accepted that the date should be 30 December 2018 instead of 29 December 2018. Given the outcome of the investigations, the Defence submitted that the victim was not a credible witness as he had clearly lied in his evidence.

101    I was prepared to find that the victim had lied when he said that he did not have sex with the accused at all and that he did not check into hotels with her after the hot water incident. It was unclear why the victim would need to lie about these matters, but we must bear in mind that he was a reluctant witness to begin with. Notwithstanding, it did not mean that the victim’s entire testimony should be rejected. In _Ng Kwee Leong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> at \[15\], the High Court held that even if a witness was found to have lied on a point, it did not necessarily affect his credibility as a whole, nor was it necessary for the court to reject the whole of his evidence. In this case, I was satisfied that it was nonetheless safe to accept the victim’s evidence of the hot water incident as a truthful account for the reasons I have set out above particularly the fact that it was materially corroborated by objective medical evidence.

#### The first major quarrel on 12 January 2017 over Linda

102    The accused told the court that she had a major quarrel with the victim on 12 January 2017 over Linda. The victim had told her that he was going to Batam alone, but she caught him at Harbourfront Ferry Terminal coming back from Batam with Linda. The accused stated that she confronted the victim there and then and questioned him as to why there was this girl with him. The victim replied that they met when they were over at Batam. The accused mentioned that the police was involved, and Linda went back on her own. The accused said that the victim then wanted to talk to her “personally”, so they proceeded to a hotel at Lorong 11 Geylang. At the hotel, the accused claimed that the victim was violent to her. The accused lodged a police report the next day on 13 January 2017 (see exhibit D5) in respect of the events on 12 January 2017.

103    According to the victim, Linda was just a friend and he had gone to Batam to visit her family members. While he agreed that there was a confrontation at Harbourfront Ferry Terminal, the victim denied that he subsequently checked into a hotel with the accused where he assaulted her physically.

104    As with the earlier issue relating to whether the victim had sex with the accused and checked into hotels with her after the hot water incident, even if I were to accept the accused’s account of what happened on 12 January 2017 as true and that the victim had lied about it, it did not mean that the victim lied about the hot water incident. I maintained my finding that it was safe to believe his evidence of the hot water incident as a reliable account.

105    In my view, the incidents relating to Linda were more relevant to show that the accused had a motive to inflict hurt on the victim.

#### The second major quarrel in January 2017 after the victim allegedly caught the accused coming back in her former male schoolmate’s car

106    According to the accused, she and the victim had their second major quarrel about one or two weeks after 12 January 2017 incident. It happened between 14 January 2017 and 16 February 2017[^56]. She had gone out with her former male schoolmate and ignored the victim by not answering his phone calls. The victim apparently waited for her at her void deck. When she came out of her former male schoolmate’s car, the victim grabbed her bag, took out her handphone and smashed it against the pillar. He later threw away her handphone. He also took out the jewellery that they had shopped for together from her bag and threw them away. The accused told the court that she did not lodge any police report in respect of this incident because the victim had some savings with her which was a few hundred dollars, so she used his money to buy herself a new handphone. The victim denied that there was such an episode.

107    The accused turned out to be untruthful because she had lodged a police report in respect of this incident which the Defence did not tender as an exhibit. It was ironic that the defence had somehow furnished a copy of the police report in question to the Prosecution and the learned DPP in turn used it to cross-examine the accused. During her cross-examination, the accused admitted that on 2 May 2018, she lodged a police report regarding the smashed handphone and jewellery incident[^57]. She acknowledged that if she had wanted the police to know that the victim had been violent to her, she would not have waited for more than a year to report him to the police[^58], especially after she had been charged in court on 23 March 2018 for the hot water incident.

108    Having regard to the stark inconsistencies in the accused’s evidence and the long delay in lodging the police report, it was dubious as to whether the smashed handphone and jewellery incident happened. The alleged incident and belated police report appeared to be afterthoughts to create the notion that the victim was a jealous man and that this was one possible reason why he would frame her for the hot water incident.

109    Similarly, even if I were to accept the accused’s account that the victim had displayed jealous rage towards her in this incident and that the victim had lied by claiming that it did not happen, it did not mean that the victim was untruthful about the hot water incident. Likewise, I maintained my finding that it was safe to believe the victim’s evidence of the hot water incident as a reliable account.

#### Other inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence

110    The Defence cited other inconsistences in the victim’s evidence such as the victim initially saying that he stopped seeing the accused because he no longer wanted a relationship with her to claiming that he broke up with her finally because he saw pictures of her with other men on her Facebook. Suffice it for me to restate that I did not regard the inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence to be material to the issue before the court. I reiterate my finding that I found it safe to accept the victim’s evidence of the hot water incident as a truthful account for the reasons given above including the fact that it was strongly corroborated by objective medical evidence.

### The accused was not a credible witness

111    Conversely, I did not the find the accused to be a credible witness. Her evidence pertaining to the hot water incident was riddled with inconsistencies and highly unbelievable. I rejected her version of the incident for the following reasons.

#### The accused’s account was internally inconsistent

112    In my view, the accused gave a contrived and internally inconsistent account of the hot water incident as set out below.

113    The accused stated in her long statement in exhibit D1 at \[2\] that she started suspecting that the victim was having an affair with Linda two years ago. She and the victim even had a big row over Linda on 12 January 2017 when she spotted them coming back together from Batam. On 4 July 2017, the victim was at the accused’s flat since 10pm. If the accused really wanted to confront the victim about Linda, she had plenty of time and opportunity to do so that night rather than wait until 1am after the victim had fallen asleep, to purposely wake him up to talk about Linda.

114    The accused gave an elaborate description of how she came to read Linda’s message on the victim’s handphone. She said that the victim held on to his handphone tightly with parts of his fingers covering the handphone screen while he showed her Linda’s messages[^59]. The accused who required reading glasses and found it “a bit tough” to read without them, was not wearing her spectacles that morning[^60]. Yet she claimed that she could read the messages on the victim’s handphone which he was holding at more than one arm’s length away[^61] with the screen partially obscured clearly. Her account was not credible.

115    The accused declared that she was the type to drink hot water all the time[^62] and even when she went to a restaurant or food court, she would ask for hot water and not just hot water but “very hot water, boiling water”[^63]. She emphasized that she “love boiling water” and that she “drink boiling water”[^64]. She was clearly embellishing her evidence to justify why she was boiling water in the middle of the night, during “a heated argument”[^65] with the victim.

116    According to the accused, the victim followed her into the kitchen, sat very close behind her as she boiled water in the kettle and picked the very moment after she had poured boiling hot water into the mug she was holding in her left hand to tug at the same arm to beg her not to break up with him. Her evidence implied that the victim had acted recklessly with no regard for both their safety. I found the accused’s evidence doubtful. The victim would have known that his angry girlfriend who was demanding that he get out of her flat as well as her life was handling boiling hot water which could be dangerous should there be an inadvertent spillage. It was therefore unlikely that the victim would carelessly choose that instant to pull her left arm. In this regard, when PW1 Dr Chew was cross-examined on whether the accused’s version was possible, he testified that in his experience, if a patient were conscious and alert, even in a case of accidental spillage, there would be some defensive reactions such as attempting to block the water or hold one’s arm over it[^66]. Such natural reactions which could reasonably be expected from the victim were missing in the account according to the accused.

117    It was astonishing that the accused who had filled the mug almost to the brim with boiling hot water was totally unscathed from the hot water incident. Not a drop of the hot water fell on her while the victim suffered second and third degree burns over 12% of his TBSA and he had to undergo a few surgeries including skin grafting. The accused claimed that she was unharmed because she was wearing “covered sandals” which covered her whole feet[^67] and that she “moved back”[^68]. I found her evidence hard to believe.

118    The accused preposterously claimed that she offered to bring the victim to the hospital, but the victim declined her gesture saying that she was working the next day. The victim had rated the pain to be 10 out of 10 and felt like he wanted to die. His evidence was that he was more concerned about himself than what the accused was thinking, and he could not even recall her expression as she stood next to the sofa. He dashed out of the accused’s flat naked, covered with only a towel. I doubted that the victim would be attentive and considerate towards the accused in his dire situation. In my view, the accused came up with this absurd excuse to justify why she failed to accompany him to the hospital when she knew the seriousness of his injuries since she saw that all the skin had come off.

119    The accused explained that she did not try to seek out the victim during the time he was hospitalised as she did not possess a guilty conscience since she did not pour hot water on him. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that any person in her position with a clear conscience would have made attempts to visit and show concern for her boyfriend of 11 years who had suffered horrendous injuries[^69]. Her explanation was also inconsistent with her evidence that she offered to bring the victim to the hospital. She obviously knew that he required medical attention and was worried enough to volunteer to bring him to the hospital. Hence, her subsequent uncaring attitude and conduct was at odds with the earlier picture she had painted. The more probable explanation was that she had intentionally poured hot water on the victim and did not care that he was being hospitalised.

120    In view of the foregoing, the accused’s account of the hot water incident was clearly illogical and implausible.

#### The accused contradicted herself materially in her police report, statement and instructions to her counsel

121    The accused contradicted herself materially in many instances. The main discrepancies are set out below.

122    In her police report dated 6 July 2017 (exhibit D2), the accused stated that on the day in question past midnight, she and her boyfriend had a verbal argument with some scuffle and at one point of time when she was pouring hot water from her flask into her cup, suddenly the victim pulled her left hand which was holding the cup and some of the hot water spilled onto his lower abdomen. In her long statement dated 7 July 2017 at exhibit D1 at \[2\], page 2, she stated that they went from the living room to the kitchen where they continued their argument and he held on to her hand but she pushed him away after which she poured boiling hot water into a mug. In court, she did not say that they had a scuffle or that he had held on to her hand but she pushed him away before she poured boiling water into the mug. The impression that the accused gave in court was that the forceful tug by the victim at the accused’s left arm which led to the severe spillage was the only physical contact between them during their quarrel.

123    In the accused’s police report exhibit D2, she did not state that the victim was sitting down and for that matter that he was seated on a stack of stools. The first time she disclosed that the victim was sitting down where she also referred to the stack of stools was in her long statement exhibit D1 when she was called up by the IO for investigation. In my view, this was a significant inconsistency as the accused’s case was that the victim was seated when the hot water accidentally spilled onto his groin.

124    In both the accused’s police report exhibit D2 and her long statement exhibit D1, she did not state that she boiled the water before the hot water incident happened. In court, she testified that she decided to boil some hot water to drink and then the hot water incident happened. In my view, this was a pertinent omission as according to the burns specialist PW1 Dr Chew, he estimated the temperature of the hot water to be at least 90 to 100 degrees centigrade for it to cause such severe burns.

125    In the accused’s police report exhibit D2, she stated that she was holding a cup with hot water. In her long statement exhibit D1, she stated that she was holding “a big Starbucks mug” which was fully filled with boiling hot water. In court, it became a J.CO mug that she was holding as shown in the photograph in exhibit P4(14), which was taken on 5 July 2018, a year later. It was strange how the cup she was holding evolved into a big Starbucks mug and finally a J.CO mug. During the victim’s examination-in-chief, after he was given his previous statement to refresh his memory, he recalled that something dropped on the floor and shattered but he could not remember the details. The evidence seemed to suggest that something broke during the hot water incident and the accused might not have been holding a J.CO mug. Be that as it may, the crucial point here was not so much which cup or mug the accused was using but the fact that she changed her evidence in this aspect three times for reasons best known to herself.

126    In court, the accused testified that before the victim left for the hospital, the victim blamed her for pouring hot water on him by asking her, “...why you did this to me?”. The accused told the court that she replied to the victim, “I did not. Accidentally.”[^70] Going by the accused’s oral testimony in court, at the scene itself, the victim had already alleged that she poured hot water on him. It was glaring that the accused failed to mention this fact in both her police report exhibit D2 and her long statement exhibit D1. On the contrary, according to her police report exhibit D2, it seemed that the first time she learned that the victim was blaming her for pouring hot water on him was when Marwan, the victim’s brother, called her at 11pm on 5 July 2017 to warn her to wait for the police to look for her for pouring hot water on the victim. The accused went on to state in her police report exhibit D2 that she then tried to call the victim to clarify the situation but his handphone was turned off. Thus, her police report also seemed to suggest that this was the first time that she attempted to clear up the misunderstanding with the victim. which contradicted her oral testimony that she had clarified with the victim at the scene that it was an accident. These were serious discrepancies which went to the root of the issue as to whether the hot water incident was intentional or accidental. Importantly, the accused’s evidence in this regard also materially corroborated the victim’s testimony that he had asked the accused at the scene why she did this to him.

127    According to the victim, when he asked her, “Why you do this to me?”, she retorted, “Serve you right.” In court, the accused denied giving such a reply. She said that she replied, “I did not. Accidentally.” I noted that PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim interviewed the accused and recorded her statement exhibit D1 on 7 July 2017 before PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim had a chance to interview the victim. PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim said that she did not visit the victim at the hospital immediately on 5 July 2017 as the victim was scheduled for an operation that day. The victim told the court that the police recorded a statement from him at the hospital ward about two weeks later[^71]. This meant that the victim would not have had the opportunity to tell PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim that the accused had told him “serve you right” when PW4 (IO) Inspector Lim recorded the accused’s long statement exhibit D1 on 7 July 2017. Therefore, it was rather mysterious as to how the accused came to know that the victim would be claiming in his statement to the police that she allegedly told him “serve you right” for her to declare the information in her long statement exhibit D1 at the end of \[2\] that “I did not say “serve you right” to him when the hot water spilled onto him”. Her long statement did not tally with her oral testimony because there was no evidence before the court to indicate that she had somehow learned by then that the victim had alleged that she told him “serve him right”. Even if we were to assume that she had heard it from Marwan or other sources, the accused would have failed to reveal it in her police report, statements and in court. In my view, the discrepancy in her long statement exhibit D2, “I did not say “serve you right” to him when the hot water spilled onto him” was glaring and self-incriminating.

128    The accused gave instructions to her counsel which were contrary to her evidence. During the cross-examination of the victim, the learned counsel put it to the victim that the accused had asked him why he made a false report against her[^72]. The put was inconsistent with the accused’s oral testimony that she and the victim did not talk about the hot water incident at all[^73]. Her counsel also put it to the victim that it was due to the accused’s “persistent” questioning as to why he had made a false report against her that the victim conveyed his apologies to her for what he had done by sending her the YouTube video of the song “Hard To Say I’m Sorry”[^74]. The put was inconsistent with the accused’s evidence that she saw no necessity to discuss the matter with the victim as her conscience was clear[^75].

129    In the Prosecution’s end of trial submissions, it enumerated other inconsistencies in the accused’s evidence in relation to the hot water incident. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions at \[35(a), (c), (e), (g), (i), (k), (o) and (p)\].

130    As set out above, the accused’s evidence was materially different in the critical aspects of her defence and I had grave doubts about her credibility.

#### The accused’s evidence was against the weight of objective medical evidence

131    As I have set out at \[55\] to \[72\] above, while the doctors could not exclude the possibility that the burn injuries suffered by the victim could have been caused accidentally, in the expert opinion of the burns specialists namely PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok, the most likely scenario was that the victim was lying down when he sustained his burn injuries. The accused’s account as to how the hot water incident happened was thus contradicted by or against the weight of objective medical evidence. I therefore rejected her evidence that the hot water incident was an accident.

#### The accused had a motive to hurt the victim

132    The accused had been unhappy with the victim for not keeping his promise to marry her. She believed that he was two-timing[^76] her and his ex-wife. Besides his ex-wife, she also suspected that the victim was having an affair with Linda since 2015[^77]. She caught them red-handed coming back together from Batam on 12 January 2017. According to the victim, the accused was so incensed on that occasion that she pulled Linda’s hair[^78] and the police had to split them up. On 5 July 2017, when she saw Linda’s WhatsApp message to the victim, it confirmed her suspicions that the victim and Linda were contacting each other which made her believe that the victim was having an affair with Linda. This was apparent from her long statement exhibit D1 where she referred to Linda as “his affair”. Linda’s message to the victim was thus the last straw for the accused.

133    What the accused claimed were the things that she allegedly said to the victim during the non-existent heated argument were likely the emotions and thoughts that she was having that morning. How she had devoted so many years of her life to the victim but was still waiting in vain for him to marry her. Instead he had rewarded her love for him and the sacrifices she made by being unfaithful to her and cheating on her. I agreed with the Prosecution that she became so furious with the victim that she decided to teach him a lesson that he would never forget. She went to the kitchen to boil water before emptying a mugful of hot water directly on his groin while he was sound asleep on the sofa. She announced to him, “Serve you right” when the puzzled victim asked her “why you do this to me?”

134    The accused’s fury regarding the victim’s affair was also demonstrated through the messages which she admitted she sent to the victim’s family members, to complain about his relationship with another woman after his hospitalisation[^79]. Rather than showing concern for the victim who was in hospital for severe burn injuries, she was more interested to display her displeasure about his liaison with Linda by dragging the victim’s family members into the picture. When the victim met up with her for the first time on 21 August 2017 after the hot water incident and requested her to get aloe vera for him, she taunted him to ask his “new girlfriend” to do it for him. It was clear from her conduct that she had not gotten over his affair.

135    In view of the above, there was ample evidence to prove that the accused had the motive to commit the offence.

#### Other inconsistences in the accused’s evidence

136    I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused vacillated on when and why her relationship with the victim ended[^80]. For instance, she told the court that she caught the victim making a video of her naked when they were in Hotel 81 on 30 December 2018. After she rebuked the victim, she said that he deleted the video and they continued to have sex[^81]. She testified that the victim’s act of secretly videoing her naked was most probably the reason why she decided to break up with the victim[^82]. If what the victim did was deplorable enough for the accused to consider breaking up with him, it was incomprehensible why she would continue having sex with him at the hotel on 30 December 2018. Her counsel had also put it to the victim that after the accused caught him videoing her naked, there was a big dispute as she objected to what he was doing and she told him clearly, “Do not call me anymore. I don’t like what you are doing” and from that day onwards, they ceased all communications[^83]. Her counsel’s put to the victim clearly contradicted the accused’s testimony that she carried on having sex with the victim after she saw the victim deleting the video.

137    While the Prosecution did not dispute that the couple checked into Hotel 81 on 30 December 2018 even though the victim denied it, it was questionable as to whether the victim really took a video of the accused naked, given the inconsistencies highlighted above. Having said that, what happened at Hotel 81 on 30 December 2018 was not material to the charge, but it reflected on the extent of the accused’s untruthfulness.

## Conclusion on the hot water incident

138    On the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt that she had intentionally poured hot water on the victim while he was sleeping thereby causing his burn injuries. I therefore found her guilty as charged and convicted her accordingly.

## Antecedents

139    The accused was a first offender.

## Prescribed Punishment for s 326 of the Penal Code

140    The punishment for committing an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code was mandatory imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and a fine or caning.

## Sentencing principles and approach

141    The relevant sentencing principles for offences under s 326 of the Penal Code would be that of deterrence and retribution.

142    The sentencing approach for offences under s 326 of the Penal Code has been laid down by Justice Valerie Thean in the High Court decisions of _Public Prosecutor v Miya Manik_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 164</span> (“_Miya Manik_”) at \[119\] and _Public Prosecutor v Azlin bte Arujunah_ and another <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 168</span> (“_Azlin_”) at \[196\]. Justice Thean drew reference from Menon CJ’s decision in _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> at \[12\] which dealt with s 324 of the Penal Code. As s 324 of the Penal Code stood in relation to s 323 of the Penal Code in a similar manner as s 326 stood in relation to s 325, Justice Thean therefore adopted the following sentencing approach:

> (a)      **Step 1:** To consider the indicative sentence if the charge had been under s 325 of the Penal Code, having regard only to the harm caused.

> (b)      **Step 2:** To consider an uplift for the dangerous means used; and

> (c)      **Step 3:** To adjust the sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating factors.

## Parties’ positions on sentence

143    The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least five years’ imprisonment after applying the sentencing approach as follows:

> (a)     Step 1: Indicative starting sentence of at least 3 years’ imprisonment.

> (b)     Step 2: Uplift of at least 1 year and 6 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     Step 3: Further uplift of at least 6 months’ imprisonment.

144    The Defence submitted that the sentence should be no more than two years’ imprisonment. It proposed that that the indicative starting point should be 14 months’ imprisonment based on the unreported case of _PP v Lin Lin Htwe_ (SC-902998-2020) (“_Lin Lin_”). As regards steps 2 and 3 of the sentencing approach, it disagreed with the Prosecution’s position on the uplifts. The Defence submitted generally that taking into account “whatever factors”, like the accused had claimed trial, a sentence of two years’ imprisonment would serve the ends of justice

## Sentence imposed by the court

145    In sentencing the accused to four years’ imprisonment in this case, I had considered the following.

### Step 1: Indicative starting sentence if the case had been one under s 325 of the Penal Code, having regard to only the harm caused

146    The Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> (“_BDB_”) at \[56\] and the High Court in _Azlin_ and _Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 199</span> (“_Arumugam Selvaraj”)_ established the following indicative starting sentences where the grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code offences took the following forms:

> (a)     Death – around eight years’ imprisonment (_BDB_ at \[56\]).

> (b)     Multiple fractures (viz, fractures to the left elbow, left calf, and left 8th to 11th ribs), around three years and six months imprisonment; (_BDB_ at \[56\]).

> (c)     Life-threatening burn injuries – around four years’ imprisonment (_Azlin_ at \[200\]).

> (d)     Middle finger fracture and bruising over face and shoulder – six months’ imprisonment (_Arumugam Selvaraj_ at \[13\]).

147    In submitting that the indicative starting sentence should be three years’ imprisonment, the Prosecution pointed to the medical evidence adduced before the court. To recap, the victim suffered burn injuries over 12% of his TBSA, mainly at his groin area. According to PW1 Dr Chew’s expert opinion, anything above 10% of TBSA that involved the perianal area which encompassed the genitals would be considered a major burn injury. Therefore, the victim suffered major burn injuries. Due to the hot water incident, the victim was hospitalised for 26 days from 5 July 2017 to 31 July 2017 and given medical leave for 39 days from 5 July 2017 until 12 August 2017. The medical report (exhibit P2) confirmed that meanwhile the victim was not able to perform his normal pursuits. His injuries would lead to permanent scarring. PW2 Dr Kok had also told the court that if the victim had not defaulted in his review, his medical leave was likely to have been extended.

148    In respect of the severity of the victim’s burn injuries, the Prosecution submitted that based on the medical evidence, the victim had suffered second and third degree burns. The Prosecution also highlighted the victim’s evidence that he found the burns to be “very painful”, being a “10 over 10” on a pain scale which made him “want to die”. According to the victim, he could not work for six months because he could not move normally. His scars really affected his confidence until today.

149    The Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s indicative starting sentence of at least three years’ imprisonment for three main reasons. First, although the Defence did not deny that the victim sustained second degree burns, it contended that it was “far-fetched” for the Prosecution to say for certain that the victim suffered third degree burns as even the doctors could not agree amongst themselves. In this regard, it pointed to PW1 Dr Chew’s evidence and submitted that PW1 Dr Chew had emphasized that the victim suffered second degree severity injuries. The Defence also highlighted that PW2 Dr Kok was not 100% sure if the victim suffered third degree burns.

150    In respect of the severity of the burn injuries, a careful review of PW1 Dr Chew and PW2 Dr Kok’s evidence would confirm the following:

> (a)     At the beginning of his examination-in-chief, PW1 Dr Chew told the court that the victim sustained 12% TBSA of second degree severity injuries[^84].

> (b)     PW1 Dr Chew explained that second degree burns were usually consistent with hot scalding injury as compared to other forms of injury, for example flame burns which tended to present third degree burns where the burns were usually leathery and did not blanch or show any blanching reflex on pressure. PW1 Dr Chew said that hot water burns usually consisted of liquid that was about 90 to 100 degrees Celsius which tended to give rise to second degree burns. Notwithstanding, PW1 Dr Chew made it clear that the extent of or severity of burns was also a function of the time of contact, so if a liquid burn was sustained by the patient for a prolonged period of time, it could still lead to third-degree burns[^85]. PW1 Dr Chew added that the patient’s health status would also affect the presentation of the burn injury. In this case, he observed that the victim did not have any significant medical history that affected the severity of the burns.

> (c)     PW1 Dr Chew pointed out that the photograph in exhibit P3(6) which was taken seven days after the victim’s first surgery, showed discolouration on some parts of the victim’s left upper thigh and left groin, in particular orange and yellow discolouration that was different from other regions. PW1 Dr Chew testified that the discolouration indicated that there were either unhealthy tissues or in this case, “most likely \[a\] conversion from a second degree to a third degree burns” for the victim’s left groin and left upper thigh region[^86].

> (d)     As documented under “Clinical Summary” of the victim’s Inpatient Discharge Summary exhibit P1, PW1 Dr Chew told the court that 15 days after the victim’s first surgery, there were areas of the victim’s wounds which were still unhealthy. Specifically the left groin and penile base were not healing as well. PW1 Dr Chew explained that his findings indicated that “the burns wounds probably converted to third degree burns[^87]” which necessitated a further procedure which included skin grafting which was performed on 21 July 2017.

> (e)     PW2 Dr Kok testified that based on the photographs in exhibit P3, the victim suffered second degree burns in the pink areas while the whiter areas were possibly third degree burns. However, he clarified that he could not be 100% sure from just looking at the photographs as he would need to actually touch the wound[^88].

151    From the foregoing, it was clear from PW1 Dr Chew’s evidence that some of the victim’s burn injuries had deteriorated from second degree to third degree severity burns. I noted that PW2 Dr Kok held a similar opinion except that he qualified it by saying that his observations were based on the photographs and not on actual examination therefore he could not be 100% certain. In the circumstances, I accepted PW1 Dr Chew’s evidence that the victim suffered both second and third degree burns.

152    The second reason why the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s indicative starting sentence was that it took issue with the Prosecution’s submissions regarding the extent of the victim’s pain and suffering. The Defence argued that evidence had been adduced to show that the victim, upon his discharge from hospital, had contacted the accused and they had gone out together over the course of a few months. Therefore, the Defence contended that the victim’s pain and suffering had been called into question and that it was “far from the truth” that the victim had to go through extreme pain and suffering.

153    In my view, given the major burn injuries suffered by the victim primarily at his groin area, the surgical procedures undertaken and his medical leave of 39 days, it would be fair to say that he had suffered great pain. I noted that the Defence did not challenge the victim’s evidence insofar as his pain and suffering was concerned. The fact that the victim went to meet the accused and went on dates with her did not necessarily mean that he was not in pain or had fully recovered. The victim told the court that he missed the accused which explained why he went to look for her as soon as he could do so. The accused also testified that she observed the victim to be in pain on 21 August 2017 before they allegedly had sex. I therefore accepted that the victim suffered considerable pain because of the hot water incident.

154    Lastly, the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s indicative starting sentence because it argued that the Prosecution was wrong in using the factors mentioned in _BDB_ as a yardstick. It pointed out that the victim in _BDB_ was a child, 2 years and five months old, who had suffered multiple fractures and other injuries as compared with the victim in the present case.

155    In my view, the Defence appeared to have misunderstood the application of _BDB_ in this case. The Court of Appeal in _BDB_ has laid down at \[56\] a general indicative starting sentence of around three and a half years’ imprisonment where the grievous hurt was multiple fractures, such as to the left elbow, left calf, and left eight to eleventh ribs and to consider imposing six to 12 strokes of the cane at \[76\].

156    I disagreed with the Defence that the indicative starting sentence should be 14 months’ imprisonment. The Defence had relied on the unreported case of _Lin Lin_ which involved a lesser offence under s 324 of the Penal Code which was punishable with a maximum jail term of seven years as compared with a maximum jail term of 15 years’ imprisonment under s 326 of the Penal Code in coming up with its indicative starting sentence. In _Lin Lin_, the offender was a domestic helper who was agitated that she had to cook and look after the baby at the same time. She moved the 16-month-old baby’s hand towards a pot containing hot water causing the baby to suffer second degree burns of the left hand specifically blisters over her forearm, left third finger, left thumb, proximal interphalangeal joint and shaft of left fifth finger. I noted from the Statement of Facts tendered that the baby did not undergo any surgery but was attended to as an outpatient and her wounds were fully healed ten days later. It was clear that the injuries there were far less serious than the ones in the present case.

157    Aside from what has been set out above, there were other distinguishing factors in _Lin Lin_ as highlighted by the Prosecution in its further submissions on sentence dated 24 November 2020. Crucially, there were no reasoned grounds published for _Lin Lin’s_ case and it carried limited weight as a precedent.

158    Having regard to the harm caused in the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the indicative starting sentence should be substantially higher than six months’ imprisonment but lower than three years and six months imprisonment. All considered, I determined that the appropriate indicative starting sentence in this case was around two years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

### Step 2: To consider an uplift for the dangerous means used

159    In _Azlin_, the High Court held that an appropriate uplift was two years’ imprisonment for several reasons. It noted that not an insignificant volume of water above 70 degrees Celsius was indiscriminately thrown onto the five-year-old child which affected vulnerable parts of his body including the face and genitals. The High Court considered that a child had thinner skin and the hot water would cause deeper burns on a child than it would to an adult. The High Court also emphasized the importance of sending a deterrent message and a clear condemnation of the use of dangerous means in the context of discipline and against children.

160    The Prosecution submitted that while the hot water used in the present case (90 to 100 degrees Celsius), was likely of a higher temperature than the water used in _Azlin’s_ case, the volume of the water used in _Azlin_ was likely greater than that that in the present case (200 to 300 millilitres). _Azlin’s_ case also involved a young child who was more susceptible to burn injuries by virtue of his thinner skin. Therefore, the Prosecution calibrated the uplift for the dangerous means used in the present case downwards from the two years’ imprisonment given in _Azlin’s_ case to 1 year and six months’ imprisonment.

161    The Defence did not submit on what would be an appropriate uplift except to refer to the unreported case of _Lin Lin_.

162    I agreed with the Prosecution that a lower uplift than the two years’ imprisonment in _Azlin’s_ case was warranted here. In my view, the circumstances of the offence in _Azlin’s_ case were far more serious. I therefore determined that an uplift of one year’s imprisonment was adequate.

### Step 3: To adjust the sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating factors.

163    I shall deal with the mitigation plea first. The Defence urged the court to consider the following:

> (a)     The accused was a divorcee who had three sons. One son died from a traffic accident. Another son aged 26 years old was working and residing with his grandparents whom he was supporting financially. Her younger son aged 25 was a student with SIM and residing with the accused. The accused’s parents had passed away. She had two brothers, one of whom was bedridden. The accused worked part time with SATS as an administrative assistant and was the sole breadwinner. She baked cookies to supplement her income. Her highest education was “N” levels.

> (b)     This was a tragic story. The accused and the victim had known each other for a long time.

> (c)     The accused deserved compassion and leniency as her whole family would suffer tremendous trauma and hardship if she was dealt with too harshly. They were a close-knit family and have already sunk into the depths of despondency.

> (d)     The accused was a first-time offender and the fear she had received from her arrest, the police investigations and court attendances had shell shocked her. She would never dare be anything less than a law-abiding citizen.

164    In my view, there were no real mitigating factors in this case. The accused had showed no remorse. She told the victim at the time of the hot water incident, serve him right, that he deserved to be punished. Until today, she denied committing this deed against the victim. There was also nothing exceptional regarding her personal circumstances which would count as mitigating, as explained in _Lai Oei Miu Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[10\].

165    As regards the aggravating factors in this case, I agreed with the following aggravating factors as highlighted by the Prosecution.

> (a)     The accused’s act of pouring hot water on the victim was a cold calculated act because she first had to boil the water in the kitchen, fill the mug with it, before moving to the living room to pour it onto the victim’s groin area;

> (b)     The victim was vulnerable and defenceless as he was sound asleep. Since he was sleeping supine, his body was facing up. The accused obviously took advantage of the situation and easily poured the hot water directly onto his groin area.

> (c)     The accused targeted the victim’s groin area including his genitals, which were vulnerable parts of the body.

166    To account for the aggravating factors, I imposed a further uplift of six months’ imprisonment.

167    To sum up, after I applied the sentencing approach as laid down by the High Court for s 326 offences, I concluded that the appropriate sentence in this case was four years’ imprisonment.

### Caning

168    S 325(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) stipulated that women shall not be punished with caning. Notwithstanding the exemption, s 325(2) of the CPC empowered the court to impose a term of imprisonment of not more than 12 months in lieu of the caning.

169    The Prosecution reasoned that if the accused had been a male, she would have likely received at least six strokes of the cane. Therefore, it submitted that an enhancement of at least three months’ imprisonment was warranted to compensate for the retributive effect of caning. The Defence argued it was wrong in principle to order caning in lieu of imprisonment when the accused was exempted from caning.

170    The three-judge High Court in _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 904</span> (“_Amin_”) at \[59\], held that certain factors may warrant an enhancement of the sentence of an exempted offender. These factors included the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning that was lost by reason of the exemption. The High Court in _Amin_ clarified at \[60\] that there should also be an assessment as to whether there were any factors which could militate against the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment. These factors included medical grounds and old age.

171    On the facts of this case, I was of the view that a sentence of four years’ imprisonment would commensurate with the culpability and criminality of the accused’s actions and serve as sufficient punishment. I therefore did not find it necessary to impose an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning.

## Precedents

172    The Prosecution had cited some precedents under s 326 of the Penal Code where the dangerous means used ranged from hot water to acid and fire to assist the court. These cases were decided before _BDB, Miya Manik_ and _Azlin_. I noted that the maximum punishment for the precedents cited was only ten years imprisonment as compared to the maximum punishment of 15 years’ imprisonment for the present case. None of the precedents involved burns to the groin area. I do not intend to go into the details of these precedents. Having regard to these precedents while bearing in mind that the penalty had since been enhanced, I was of the view that the four years’ imprisonment term I imposed in this case was fair.

## Compensation

173    The court was required under s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to consider whether or not to make a compensation order and if it was of the view that such an order was appropriate, the court had a further duty make the order. In this case, when I raised the issue, the Prosecution informed me that it was not seeking any compensation as the victim had not furnished the Prosecution with any details. In the circumstances, I did not make any compensation order.

174    The accused is on bail bailing appeal.
