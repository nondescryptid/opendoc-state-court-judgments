Criminal Law – Statutory Offences – Employment of Foreign Manpower Act – Receiving cash as a condition of continued employment

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9253/2021/01.\]

31 May 2022

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused is Ali Rahmat, a 46-year-old male Bangladeshi national. At the material time, he was working as a manager with Bengal Scaffolding & Construction Pte Ltd (“the Company”). He claimed trial to two charges of receiving moneys separately from two foreign employees as a condition for their continued employment as construction workers in the Company, an offence under s 22A(1)(b) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A) (“EFMA”). The case proceeded as a joint trial pursuant to s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Rev Ed 2020) (“CPC”) as the alleged offences formed part of a series of offences of the same nature[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). At the conclusion of the trial, I acquitted the accused of both charges. The Prosecution being dissatisfied with my decision has appealed against the acquittal.

2       I now give my reasons for acquitting the accused.

## The charges

3       The charges that the accused claimed trial to are set out below.

## The statement of agreed facts

4       The Prosecution and the counsel for the Defence agreed to the following amended statement of agreed facts (“SOAF”) pursuant to s 267(1) of the CPC.

> 1.    The accused is Ali Rahmat (FIN: XXX) of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. At the material time, he was a manager at Bengal Scaffolding & Construction Pte. Ltd. (UEN: 201018913H) (“the company”) and gave work instructions to the construction workers employed by the company. His employment with the company commenced sometime in October 2012. The accused left the employment of the company sometime in November 2017.

> 2.    During the material period, one Md Nurul Islam (NRIC No. XXX) was the listed director of the company.

> 3.    The following workers reflected in the table below, were at the material time employed by the company as construction workers. Their work passes to be employed by the company were first issued on the dates reflected below in the “Work Pass Issue Date” column. Thereafter, their work passes to be employed by the company were first renewed on the month listed in the “Work Pass First Renewal Month” column below.

> 4.    The two workers listed in the table above worked for the company until 9 March 2018. They were not aware that their work passes were cancelled since 1 March 2018. They then walked into the Ministry of Manpower on 12 March 2018 to file a complaint on non-payment of salaries.

> **AGREED BUNDLE OF EXHIBITS**

> 5.    Parties agree to the admission of the following exhibits:

5       In respect of \[4\] of the SOAF, it was not in dispute that a total of 14 workers from the Company walked into the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) on 12 March 2018 to complain about unpaid salaries. Their complaint was initially handled by the Labour Relations Workplace Division. When some of the workers stated that they had paid moneys for the purpose of employment or continued employment in the Company, the matter was then referred to the Foreign Manpower Management Division at MOM for separate investigations. That was how the alleged offences against the accused came to light.

## Section 22A of the EFMA

6       The relevant provisions under s 22A of the EFMA are reproduced below for easy reference:

> 22A.—(1) A person must not deduct from any salary payable to a foreign employee, or demand or receive, directly or indirectly and whether in Singapore or elsewhere, from a foreign employee any sum or other benefit —

>> (a)    …..

>> (b)    as consideration or as a condition for the continued employment of the foreign employee, whether by that person or any other person; or

>> (c)    …..

> (2)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

> (3)    …..

## The issue before the court

7       The Prosecution’s case was that the accused collected a total of $3000 each from PW1 Nizam between April 2017 to September 2017 in respect of the first charge and from PW2 Kadir Abdul between December 2016 to April 2017 in respect of the second charge as a condition for renewing their work permits in the Company. The accused denied asking PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul for such moneys or collecting moneys from them for such a purpose.

8       There was no documentary evidence of the transactions. It was the word of PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul against the word of the accused that they had each paid the accused a total sum of $3,000 (altogether $6,000) to renew their work permits so that they could continue working in the Company.

9       The issue before the court was whether the Prosecution had proven both charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt based on the oral testimonies of PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul.

## The material evidence adduced from PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul

10     The Prosecution led evidence from a total of four witnesses as shown below.

11     As the Prosecution had accurately summarised the material evidence of PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul in its closing submissions, the relevant extract is reproduced below[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) (emphasis in bold mine).

> 12.    PW1 testified that before his “second permit” was renewed on 25 May 2017, the accused had informed him sometime in April 2017 that if he wished to work in the company, he will need to renew the work permit and the company will need to “buy quota” from the MOM. As such, PW1 was asked to pay $3,000. PW1 testified that he paid $1,000 in cash to the accused in April 2017, $700 in June 2017 and **cannot remember the rest of the payments** but that the total amount was $3,000.

> 13.    The first payment was made somewhere in Rangoon Road near the accused’s residence. The accused had asked PW1 to go to Rangoon Road to collect his salary and make the payment for the renewal of PW1’s work pass. PW1 testified that the accused was standing outside the car whilst PW3 was in the same car at that time. The accused passed PW1 his salary slip and asked PW1 to sign on the same slip before paying PW1 his salary. PW1 was then asked to make the first payment for the renewal of his work pass amounting to $1,000, and he did so.

> 14.    PW1 testified that he made payment of $700 in June 2017, and the rest of the payments were made in the subsequent months between July to September 2017. PW1 testified that these payments were mostly made to the accused in Geylang where PW1 resided, and that **the payments were made right after salaries were paid to him by the accused**.

> 15.    PW1 testified that the monies paid were for the purpose of renewing his work pass, and that the accused informed him that he would be sent back home if he did not pay the monies. He also testified that a number of workers had been sent back home before and that PW2 had witnessed him paying money to the accused before. **PW2 also testified that he saw PW1 paying money to the accused before but he was not aware of the actual purpose of the payment**.

> 16.    PW2 testified that the accused told him that he had to pay $3,000 for the renewal of his work permit. Sometime in December 2016, the accused called PW2 again and asked if he wished to renew the work permit. If so, PW2 will have to bring money. PW2 informed the accused that he will need to discuss with his family and that he will confirm later. The accused called PW2 again and informed that if he wished to renew the permit, it has to be done by January 2017. PW2 agreed and borrowed $1,500 from his friend, Sumon, to make the first payment.

> 17.    After the first payment was made in cash to the accused in Bengal’s office, PW2’s work permit was renewed. The accused then requested for the remaining portion of the renewal fees and PW2 made the second payment of $1,000 in February 2017 in Race Course Road after receiving his salary. The remaining $500 was paid to the accused at the time when PW2 received his salary from the accused at either Rangoon Road or Race Course Road in March 2017. PW2 testified that the accused informed him that the monies were for the purpose of renewing the work pass, and that if he did not pay the sum of $3,000, PW2 will be sent back to Bangladesh.

> 18.     **PW2 testified that he had previously informed PW1 that he made payment to the accused for renewal of his work pass. PW1 confirmed that PW2 had previously informed him that PW2 paid renewal monies, and that PW2’s work pass was renewed before PW1’s work pass.**

> 19.    PW1 and PW2’s work passes were renewed as reflected in the statement of agreed facts (SOAF) and exhibits P4 and P5. The renewal dates of their work passes are not disputed. They also confirmed that the accused was in charge of renewing their work passes in Bengal.

## The material evidence adduced from the accused

12     The Defence called a total of four witnesses as follows:

13     The material evidence of the accused may be summarised as follows.

14     The accused was employed by the Company over two periods of time. He first joined the Company in 2012 and left a year later. He re-joined the Company sometime in 2014 or 2015 at the invitation of its director, PW3 Nurul Islam. The accused’s position was a construction site supervisor overseeing scaffolding works. He testified that he was not responsible for paying salaries to the workers. It was the boss, PW3 Nurul Islam, who would withdraw money from the bank to pay the workers their salaries in the office. In PW3 Nurul Islam’s absence, one staff named Zarina Begum would be the one giving the workers their salaries. The accused collected his salary together with the other workers in the office[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). For one or two workers who were working overtime and could not make it to the office, their supervisors would go to their dormitories to pass them their salaries[^4]. The accused said that besides himself, there were three other supervisors at that time[^5].

15     The accused told the court that initially he had a good relationship with the boss, PW3 Nurul Islam and the Company was thriving. The accused even accepted PW3 Nurul Islam’s offer and became a shareholder of the Company. PW3 Nurul Islam later employed a Singapore permanent resident as a manager of the Company and from then on, the relationship between the accused and PW3 deteriorated. Subsequently, PW3 Nurul Islam told the accused to leave the Company because he said he could no longer afford the accused’s high salary and he cancelled the accused’s S Pass. PW3 Nurul Islam also removed the accused as a shareholder of the Company

16     The accused said that he left the employment of the Company towards the end of 2018. In this regard, I believed the accused was mistaken that the year was 2018 as parties had agreed that he left the Company’s employment in November 2017[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). I noted that the accused continued to use 2018 mistakenly as his reference point in the rest of his court testimony.

17     The accused started work with another company called Z Green Construction Pte Ltd in January 2019[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) (should be 2018, see \[16\] above). Subsequently the accused received a call from PW4 IO Jimmy Wong requesting him to go for an interview. PW4 IO Jimmy Wong told the accused that workers from the Company had complained against him. The accused was shocked as he was respected by the workers as an elder brother in the Company. PW4 IO Jimmy Wong did not disclose the names of the workers who had complained against the accused.

18     When the accused next heard from PW4 IO Jimmy Wong, the IO revealed that PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul were the two persons who had complained against him. PW4 IO Jimmy Wong served the accused some court papers and told the accused to attend court. The accused told PW4 IO Jimmy Wong that PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul were his “brothers” and that they also called him “brother”.

19     The accused testified that when PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul were new in Singapore, they used to borrow money from him. They would also borrow $100 to $200 from the accused when their salaries were delayed. Given their close relationships, the accused did not understand why they would lodge false complaints against him.

20     The accused told the court that he was particularly close to PW2 Abdul Kadir and PW2’s brother i.e., DW2 Bashar Abul. Around the time when he left the Company’s employment and before he went home to Bangladesh for a visit, he had learned that DW2 Bashar Abul was in a romantic relationship with PW2 Kadir Abdul’s sister-in-law i.e., PW2’s wife’s sister. This led to friction between the brothers (PW2 and DW2), and they stopped talking to each other. PW2 Kadir Abdul even went to the accused and expressed his objections to the brothers marrying the sisters in the same family. The accused had pointed out to PW2 Kadir Abdul that it was a matter of the hearts. Then the accused left for Bangladesh. DW2 Bashar Abul went on to marry PW2 Kadir Abdul’s sister-in-law which caused PW2 to be very angry with the accused for not exerting influence over DW2 Bashar Abul to stop the marriage. In hindsight, the accused thought that PW2 Kadir Abdul could have complained falsely to MOM about him because PW2 was upset with the accused for not helping him out.

21     The accused offered another possible reason why PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul had falsely implicated him. He had heard that workers who complained to MOM would be offered better paying jobs under “TJS”. TJS was a Temporary Job Scheme provided by MOM for migrant workers who were issued Special Passes due to cancellation of their work passes to source for temporary jobs to sustain them during the period of investigation.

22     The accused emphasized that he had not taken any money from any workers for the purpose of renewing their work permits. He said that renewal of work permits was done by PW3 Nurul Islam. Besides PW3 Nurul Islam, there was “Lisa” from the employment agency and office staff Zarina Begum who were involved in renewing the work permits. The accused denied threatening PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul or offering them a sum of $5,000 each to settle this case. He said that they had been lying from the start.

## The law relating to the Prosecution’s burden of proof

23     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Prosecution only needs to establish a prima facie case which, if uncontradicted by the defence, would justify a conviction: _Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 716</span> (“_Liew Kim Choo_”) at \[58\] where Yong Pung How CJ quoted Lord Diplock in the leading case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ \[1981-1982\] SLR(R) 133. The Prosecution’s burden of proof is however different at the end of the trial. It is required to go beyond the standard of a prima facie case and the evidence it adduced must be subjected to the highest and not the lowest level of scrutiny: \[59\] of _Liew Kim Choo_. The Prosecution must satisfy the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person is guilty.

24     The Court of Appeal reiterated in _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Mohammed Liton_”) that the burden lies squarely with the Prosecution to prove the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and where there is a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused person: at \[34\].

25     As to what constitutes proof “beyond a reasonable doubt”, the Court of Appeal in _Mohammed Liton_ endorsed the description of “reasonable doubt” as “reasoned doubt” which in turn requires that all doubt, for which there is a relatable reason which is supported by the evidence present, be taken into account in favour of the accused. The Court of Appeal accepted that reasonable doubt might also arise due to lack of evidence which is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt. It also approved the following meaning of the standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt”, as adopted by the trial judge in _Mohammed Liton_ (No 2) at \[35\]:

> What this means is that unlike a civil case, the court’s verdict might not merely be determined on the basis that as between two competing stories, which version was the more plausible one. In a criminal case, the court may find … the complainant’s story to be more probable than that of the accused person’s version, and yet, be convinced that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused’s person’s story could be true. If that were the case, the court’s duty is to acquit. **Unlike a civil case, the court need not make a decision by concentrating on which one of the two versions was more probable. In a criminal trial the court must remind itself to break away from any habitual inclination to contemplate the question of the burden of proof on the basis of a civil case, and instead, ask itself whether there is a reasonable possibility that the accused person’s version was true.** (emphasis mine)

## Reasons for acquitting the accused

26     Having set out the legal principles relating to the Prosecution’s burden of proof, I now explain why I was of the view that the Prosecution had failed to prove both charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

### First charge relating to PW1 Nizam

27     The evidence against the accused in respect of the first charge came primarily from PW1 Nizam himself. There was no documentary evidence to support PW1 Nizam’s assertions that he had paid a total of $3,000 to the accused for the purpose of renewing his work permit in the Company. That being the case, his evidence ought to be clear and certain as to how he had made the various payments to the accused. PW1 Nizam was however unable to provide the details. He could only say that he paid the first sum of $1,000 in cash to the accused on either 1st or 2nd April 2017 at Rangoon Road, second cash amount of $700 to the accused on either 4 or 5 June 2017 and the rest of the payments between July and September 2017. He could not recall the precise amount that was paid nor the date and location of these subsequent payments. As PW1 Nizam’s evidence was sorely lacking in detail and clarity, I found his evidence to be deficient.

28     It did not help the Prosecution’s case that it had to amend the first charge relating to PW1 during the trial. The first charge initially stated that accused had received kickbacks from PW1 Nizam “sometime in May 2017 to June 2017”[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). As a result of PW1’s testimony in court, the Prosecution decided to amend the first charge to state that the accused had received kickbacks from PW1 Nizam “between April 2017 to September 2017”[^9]. As such, I disagreed with the Prosecution that PW1 Nizam was clear and consistent in his evidence.

29     PW1 Nizam’s vague and hazy evidence was not boosted in any way by PW2 Kadir Abdul’s evidence. PW2 Kadir Abdul testified having seen PW1 Nizam passing money to the accused, but PW2 clarified that he was not aware of the purpose behind the payment. In this regard, it was not in dispute that the accused would extend loans to the workers to help them cover their essential needs when their salaries were delayed. PW1 Nizam was not asked specifically about taking loans from the accused for this purpose. PW2 Kadir Abdul was cross-examined on it, and he told the court that he would borrow money from the accused to buy food when he had yet to receive his salary and that the accused would deduct these loans from his salaries[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). The important point here was that the payment which PW2 Kadir Abdul had witnessed between PW1 Nizam and the accused could have been for other purposes. Therefore, there was no material corroboration by PW2 Kadir Abdul that PW1 Nizam had paid the accused money to renew PW1 Nizam’s work permit.

30     According to PW1 Nizam, on the first occasion where he handed over the cash of $1000 to the accused at Rangoon Road, PW3 Islam Nurul was also present. PW1 Nizam saw PW3 seated in a BMW which was driven by the accused. At that time, the car door was opened, and the accused was standing outside the car. PW1 Nizam claimed that PW3 Nurul Islam saw him signing the salary voucher upon receiving his salary from the accused and that PW3 Nurul Islam had also seen him handing over the sum of $1,000 to the accused[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). PW1 Nizam’s evidence was however, contradicted by PW3 Nurul Islam’s evidence. PW3 Nurul Islam told the court that he could not recall the date but there was one occasion when he was in the car while the accused was having a discussion with PW1 Nizam outside the car. PW3 Nurul Islam said that he did not know what they were discussing, and he also did not see PW1 Nizam making any payment to the accused[^12]. Even if I were to accept that since PW3 Nurul Islam was inside the car and might not know what transpired between PW1 Nizam and the accused, what was significant was that PW1 Nizam’s evidence regarding this first payment remained unsubstantiated.

31     The Prosecution argued that PW1 Nizam had no reason to falsely implicate the accused. For one, it stressed that when the group of 14 workers including PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul first went to MOM, it was to complain about non-payment of salaries. Since the chief grievance of the 14 workers was about unpaid salaries, the Prosecution submitted that it was baseless for the accused to allege that the motive behind PW1 Nizam (and PW2 Kadir Abdul) stating that the accused had collected kickbacks from them was so that they could stay in Singapore and earn more money through TJS.

32     It would suffice for me to say that the absence of any motive on the part of PW1 Nizam (or PW2 Kadir Abdul) to testify falsely against the accused was quite a separate consideration from whether the Prosecution had discharged its burden of proof.

33     For the reasons above, I did not find it safe to convict the accused on the first charge.

### Second charge relating to PW2 Kadir Abdul

34     In respect of the second charge, the evidence against the accused emanated mainly from PW2 Kadir Abdul. PW2 Kadir Abdul testified that he borrowed $1500 to make the first payment to the accused in December 2016 which took place in the office. PW2 stated that he made his subsequent two payments during the time when he received his salaries from the accused. His second payment of $1000 to the accused took place at Race Course Road in February 2017. His third (and last payment) of $500 to the accused occurred again at the corner of Race Course Road in March 2017.

35     We would remember that PW2 did not have any documentary evidence to prove the payments he had made to the accused. In this regard, there was greater certainty in PW2 Kadir Abdul’s testimony as compared to PW1 Nizam’s in that PW2 Kadir Abdul was able to tell the court he made a total of three payments to the accused and the specific amounts involved. He could also recall the locations where the payments took place. Nonetheless, I found PW2’s evidence to be unsatisfactory.

36     First, PW2 Kadir Abdul claimed that he had borrowed $1,500 from his friend, Sumon, to make his first payment to the accused. Sumon was not called as a witness to corroborate his evidence. As for his second and third payments, PW2 Kadir Abdul initially said that he had made these payments to the accused at Race Course Road. He then became confused and could not be sure whether the payments had happened at Race Course Road or Rangoon Road. When he was asked by the Defence counsel to sketch the location, he drew Balestier Road[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). The discrepancies in PW2 Kadir Abdul’s evidence cast doubt on the accuracy of his memory or recollection of the events.

37     PW2 Kadir Abdul also claimed that PW1 Nizam saw him (PW2) giving money to the accused, but PW2’s evidence was not supported by PW1 Nizam's evidence. PW1 Nizam did not tell the court that he saw PW2 Kadir Abdul making payment to the accused. Rather, PW1 Nizam's evidence was that PW2 Kadir Abdul told him that he (PW2) had paid the accused money for work permit renewal.

38     In view of the above, I found it unsafe to convict the accused on the second charge.

39     I shall briefly deal with both PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul’s evidence that after they complained to MOM about the kickbacks the accused collected from them, the accused had offered them through a third person $5,000 each to drop the charge. In PW1 Nizam’s case, he heard of the offer from one Jahangir. In PW2 Kadir Abdul’s case, he learned about the offer through his sister. Suffice it for me to say that their evidence in this regard was hearsay.

## Other unsatisfactory aspects of the Prosecution’s case

40     Aside from what I have set out above, I also found the following aspects of the Prosecution’s case to be unsatisfactory. The evidence related mainly to the identity of the person who was in charge of handing the salaries to the workers.

### PW3 Nurul Islam’s evidence ought to be treated with caution

41     PW3 Nurul Islam testified when he became the sole director of the Company in 2015, he left the Company to the accused to manage as the accused was familiar with the operations of the Company and he trusted the accused. PW3 Nurul Islam’s role was to sign the Company documents and withdraw cash from the bank to pass it to the accused so that the accused could give the workers their salaries. PW3 Nurul Islam said that there were more than 25 workers in 2016 and 2017 and the accused was the one giving instructions to the workers and overseeing the renewal of their work permits. In this regard, PW3 Nurul Islam confirmed the evidence of PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul that the accused was their “boss” who assigned them their tasks, handed them their salaries and took charge of their work permit renewals. Nonetheless, I was of the view that we ought to treat PW3 Nurul Islam’s evidence with caution for the following reasons.

#### Both PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul implicated PW3 Nurul Islam as also having sought work permit renewal fees from them

42     PW3 Nurul Islam told the court that he had never instructed anyone in the Company to collect moneys from the workers as a condition for renewing their work permits nor had he taken moneys from the workers for such a purpose. It was only after he had sacked the accused that he came to know that the accused had been collecting kickbacks from the workers as a condition for their continued employment in the Company.

43     Ironically, PW3 Nurul Islam himself was implicated by both PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul of committing the same deed as the accused, namely asking them for work permit renewal fees. According to PW1 Nizam, before his work permit was due for renewal in May 2017, he said that “boss”, PW3 Nurul Islam told him to pay work permit renewal fees to the accused[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14). According to PW2 Kadir Abdul, after PW3 Nurul Islam and the accused “split”, PW3 Nurul Islam called PW2 Kadir Abdul one day and asked PW2 Kadir Abdul for $4,000 work permit renewal fees which was $1,000 higher than what the accused had asked for. PW2 Kadir Abdul said that he told PW3 Nurul Islam that he was unwilling to renew his work permit for $4,000. Two days later, PW2 Kadir Abdul received another call from PW3 Nurul Islam on the same matter. PW2 Kadir Abdul told PW3 Nurul Islam that he could not afford $4,000 but was willing to pay an amount between $2,500 to $3,000, which was what PW1 Nizam and another worker called Alauddin had paid. PW3 Nurul Islam then claimed that these workers had “free quota” which PW2 Kadir Abdul did not have. PW3 Nurul Islam told PW2 Kadir Abdul that if he were to return to Bangladesh and should he want to come back to work in Singapore again, at that time he would have to incur a higher work permit fee of between $5,000 to $6,000. PW2 Kadir Abdul also told the court that PW3 Nurul Islam said he did not receive PW2 Kadir Abdul’s previous payment of $3,000 which was given to the accused[^15].

44     Although PW3 Nurul Islam denied that he had sought work permit renewal fees from PW2 Kadir Abdul or from any other worker for that matter, it was disturbing that both PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul had incriminated PW3 Nurul Islam in connection with collecting kickbacks from the workers as a condition for continued employment in the Company. Given PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul’s evidence against PW3 Nurul Islam, there was ground to believe that to absolve himself, PW3 Nurul Islam might not be truthful in court.

#### PW3 Nurul Islam had a major fallout with the accused over the Company

45     It was noteworthy that PW3 Nurul Islam had a major fallout with the accused over the affairs of the Company. PW3 Nurul Islam testified that he had taken large bank loans for the Company’s operations but towards the end of 2017, he discovered that despite entrusting the accused with the moneys, the workers’ levies and salaries were not paid[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16). The Company was also not making money and PW3 Nurul Islam was in huge debts. He became “very angry” with the accused and their relationship turned “bitter”[^17]. He later cancelled the accused’s S Pass. On 20 November 2017, he lodged a police report against the accused alleging that between April and September 2017, the accused was issued with Company cheques to pay the contractors but instead, the accused had encashed the cheques and misappropriated the Company’s moneys amounting to $90,000[^18]. PW3 said that he became a bankrupt and the Company closed in February 2018[^19]. Despite his unhappy relationship with the accused, PW3 maintained that he had no reason to lie in court.

46     On the accused’s part, he told the court that when PW3 Nurul Islam asked him to leave the Company, PW3 Nurul Islam had given the accused a piece of paper to sign failing which PW3 Nurul Islam threatened to create problems for the accused so that the accused would not be able to stay in Singapore. As such, the accused signed the piece of paper and PW3 Nurul Islam then removed the accused as a shareholder of the Company. The accused said that PW3 Nurul Islam told him that he would not be able to refund the accused the moneys the accused had paid for his shares. The accused also told the court that arising from PW3 Nurul Islam’s police report, the police called him up for an interview and afterwards informed him on 28 March 2018 that they had decided not to take further action against him[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20).

47     From the evidence, it was clear that PW3 Nurul Islam and the accused had parted ways on acrimonious terms. Coupled with the fact that PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul had implicated PW3 Nurul Islam in the illegal conduct of seeking kickbacks for continued employment in the Company, I was of the view that it would be prudent to treat PW3’s evidence with caution and attach it less weight.

48     Further, I found it hard to believe PW3 Nurul Islam’s evidence that he had no knowledge at all as to how and where the accused paid the workers their salaries. PW3 Nurul Islam was aware that PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul were workers of the company. He knew that it was the accused who had renewed their work passes. Aside from his specific knowledge relating to PW1 and PW2, PW3 Nurul Islam was cognizant that the accused worked with Lisa, an agent employed by the Company to renew the workers’ work passes. By his own account, PW3 Nurul Islam had followed the accused in the Company’s car “several times” to “many places” when the accused was meeting the workers although PW3 clarified that he did not speak to the workers and remained in the car. The important point was that PW3 Nurul Islam was present physically when the accused was meeting the workers.

49     Exhibit P4 was a journal table reflecting PW1 Nizam’s work permit renewal record with the Company. It showed that PW3 Nurul Islam’s individual Singpass account was triggered for the purpose of renewing PW1 Nizam’s work permit on 25 May 2017. As exhibit P4 was tendered in court after PW3 Nurul Islam had finished giving his evidence, he was not asked about P4. Be that as it may, at no time during PW3 Nurul Islam’s testimony did he mention that he allowed the accused to use his Singpass account to renew the work permits.

50     The Prosecution argued that exhibit P4 at best indicated who the account holder was but did not determine who made the work permit application. While that might be the case, all the facts taken together showed that PW3 Nurul Islam was more acquainted with the Company’s business and operations than the hands-off picture he had painted. Therefore, I was not inclined to believe PW3 Nurul Islam’s evidence that he had no clue at all as to where and how the accused paid the workers their salaries. In my view, the fact that PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul had regarded the accused as the “boss” and were unaware that PW3 Nurul Islam was the Company director until much later did not mean that PW3 Nurul Islam was ignorant as to the Company’s operations.

51     For the reasons above, I did not find PW3 Nurul Islam to be a neutral and objective witness.

### The missing salary slips/vouchers

52     PW1 Nizam’s evidence was that all the payments that he made to the accused occurred during the time when he was receiving his salaries from the accused. In PW2 Kadir Abdul’s case, except for the first payment of $1,500 which he borrowed from a friend, his second and third payments to the accused also took place when he was receiving his salaries from the accused. They said that the accused would either deduct the work permit renewal fees from their salaries before he handed over the balance to them or he would hand over their salaries first after which PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul would pass the accused the work permit renewal fees from the salaries they just received. Both PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul also testified that before receiving their salaries from the accused, they would sign and acknowledge receipt on a salary slip or voucher.

53     It was not in dispute that one Zarina Begum was the clerk in charge of the office administration. PW3 Nurul Islam testified that her job was to prepare the salary slips/vouchers and other paperwork. Regrettably she passed away two years ago and was not able to help shed light on whether the workers were paid their salaries in the office or that it was the accused who was responsible to meet the workers outside the office to hand them their salaries.

54     In these circumstances, the salary slips/vouchers which the workers had to acknowledge and sign when they received their salaries might have been a crucial piece of evidence. However, no salary slips/vouchers were produced in court to assist the two material witnesses (PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul) to recall, confirm or corroborate the dates, amounts and/or locations where they had paid the accused cash to renew their work permits. Neither did the Prosecution lead any evidence as to the whereabouts and relevance of these salary slips/vouchers and whether they could have helped to pinpoint the identity of the person in the Company who was responsible for handing the salaries to the workers.

## The Defence had raised a reasonable doubt

55     Turning to the case for the Defence, the accused denied asking for work permit renewal fees from both PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul. He also denied that he was the one paying the workers their salaries. His evidence was that the workers would collect their salaries from the office and that the work permit renewals were done by the office staff, Zarina Begum and PW3 Nurul Islam. The accused’s evidence was substantiated by three witnesses that he called.

56     DW2 Bashar Abul (PW2 Kadir Abdul’s brother) testified that it was PW3 Nurul Islam who paid him and the other workers in his group their salaries in the office when DW2 was working at the Company between 2015 to Jan 2018.

57     DW3 Sahabuddin worked in the Company for more than two years from 2016. His evidence similarly supported the accused's version that it was the office and not the accused who was in charge of work permit renewals and that payment of salaries was generally done in the office.

58     DW4 Rabban who worked at the Company for two years in 2016 and 2017 also confirmed the accused's evidence that the accused had nothing to do with the work permit renewal process and that it was PW3 Nurul Islam who was in charge and responsible for paying the workers their salaries in the office.

59     Clearly, the Defence witnesses had raised a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case.

## Conclusion

60     For the foregoing reasons, I found that the Prosecution had failed to meet the requisite standard of proof which was to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that PW1 Nizam and PW2 Kadir Abdul had each given a total sum of $3,000 to the accused as a condition of their continued employment in the Company during the periods stated in the charges. Furthermore, the Defence had raised a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. Accordingly, I acquitted the accused of both charges.
