8       The Public Prosecutor, being dissatisfied with the sentences imposed, has since filed an appeal in respect of both Jia and Synnex.

## Facts of the Case[^2]

9       Both Complainant Counsel and Respondent Counsel agreed on the following:-

> a)     copyright subsisted in the copyrighted cable programmes and cinematograph films, as set out in each of the charges at Annex A;

> b)     the said copyrighted cable programmes and cinematograph films were wilfully infringed to a significant extent and was done so to obtain a commercial advantage;

> c)     the ISD were used to make unauthorised copies of the cinematograph films comprising the said copyrighted cable programmes and cinematograph films.

##### Use of Illicit Streaming Devices (ISD)

10     Illicit streaming devices (“ISDs”) are devices that operate on an operating system, such as the Android operating system. They are typically pre-installed with subscription-based applications, such as “MyIPTV”, “Huat88TV” and “HDTV” (collectively, the “applications”). The subject applications require a yearly subscription and provide end users access to several unauthorised live television (“TV”) channels and video-on-demand content. The Synnex TV Boxes sold by the Respondents are such ISDs.

11     To activate the ISDs in order to view the live TV channels and video-on-demand content available on the ISDs, including the copyrighted-subject matters in these charges:

> a)     An end user purchases an ISD from Synnex. This ISD comes pre-installed with one or more applications of the end user’s choice;

> b)     An end user also purchases a fixed-term subscription (typically for one year) from Synnex to access the applications. This subscription allows the end user to access the applications and the content available via these applications for as long as the subscription is ongoing;

> c)     When an end user selects an application, the ISD contacts the command and control server, which will then validate that the subscription is valid. This authentication is done using preconfigured credentials and a password provided by Synnex through its employees, which are then keyed in by the end user;

> d)     Once the end users credentials are validated, a menu appears with a list of channels;

> e)     The end user may then select a channel airing the pirated content, including the copyrighted subject-matters, which is provided by the streaming servers; and

> f)     Upon selection of the relevant channels, the copyrighted subject-matters are then transmitted by streaming servers and streamed onto the end user’s viewing device for viewing, by the Rights Holders and/or copyright owners.

12     The ISDs permit the end user to infringe the copyrighted subject-matters. Whilst streaming content, including the copyrighted subject-matters, the end user’s ISD automatically stores copies of the copyrighted subject-matters in its random access memory (“RAM”). Such copies are required for the viewing of and speeds up the loading of the content. The copies stored, which are transient / incidental, amount to reproduction of the copyrighted subject-matters under Section 81(2) of the Copyright Act; and such reproduction constitutes copyright infringement under Sections 83(a) and 85(1)(a) of the Copyright Act.

##### Sample Purchases

13     The Complainant instructed the following investigators to, on his behalf, make sample purchases of the ISDs from Synnex on 3 separate occasions:

> a)     1 ISD for S$369 on 4 May 2017 (the “May Sample Purchase”) by Mr. Ho Zhong Sheng;

> b)     1 ISD for S$369 on 3 August 2017 (the “August Sample Purchase”) by Ms. Keong Sing Ling; and

> c)     2 ISDs for S$469 each on 11 September 2017 (the “September Sample Purchases”) by Ms. Keong Sing Ling.

##### Facts relating to MSC 904499/2017 (against Synnex)

14     On 4 May 2017, Mr. Ho Zhong Sheng (“Mr. Ho”) of Commercial Investigations LLP visited Synnex. The ISDs were openly displayed and offered for sale. Mr. Ho purchased 1 ISD, the May Sample Purchase, for S$369.

15     During Mr. Ho’s visit, one of Synnex’s employees who identified himself as “Benny” conducted a demonstration of how an ISD worked and introduced the features of an ISD. He told Mr. Ho the following:

> a)     The ISDs were not illegal and an end user accessing content via the ISDs would not get caught;

> b)     There was an application available for installation on the ISDs named “HDTV”, which required an annual subscription fee of S$95. Any purchase of an ISD would include a one-year subscription to the “HDTV” application;

> c)     Renewal of the “HDTV” application could only be done at Synnex, and not online;

> d)     The “HDTV” application offered more than 300 live channels, while the “Huat88TV” application only offered more than 200 live channels. Full subscriptions to Singtel and StarHub would offer less than 100 channels;

> e)     An end user could watch the latest movies via the ISD, including “camera versions” through an application named “Kodi”. An end user could add a “Kodi” application to the Product for a one-time fee of S$40;

> f)     An end user could watch sports channels, including soccer matches, on the ISD;

> g)     an end user had to bring the ISD back to Synnex to update his or her applications.

16     “Benny” installed the applications “HDTV” and “Kodi” into the May Sample Purchase, and activated these applications for Mr. Ho.

##### Facts relating to MSC 904500/2017 (against Synnex)

17     On 3 August 2017, Ms. Keong Sing Ling (“Ms. Keong”) of Commercial Investigations LLP visited Synnex. The ISDs were openly displayed and offered for sale. Ms. Keong purchased 1 ISD, the August Sample Purchase, for S$369.

18     During Ms. Keong’s visit, one of Synnex’s employees who identified himself as “Benny” conducted a demonstration of how an ISD worked and introduced the features of an ISD. He told Ms. Keong the following:

> a)     The ISDs used Astro Malaysia’s network to stream content to an end user;

> b)     Renewal of the “Huat88TV” and “MyIPTV” applications could only be done at Synnex;

> c)     An end user should terminate her existing Singtel and StarHub subscriptions after purchasing an ISD;

> d)     An end user could watch the latest movies via the ISD, including “HD” and “CAM” versions, through an application named “Kodi”. An end user could add the “Kodi” application to the Product for a one-time fee of S$40;

> e)     The ISD came with a 1-year warranty, which allowed users to exchange a defective ISD for a new ISD. Users could only exchange their faulty ISDs at Synnex.

19     Another Synnex employee named “Bernard” installed the applications “MyIPTV” and “Huat88TV” into the August Sample Purchase and activated these applications for Ms. Keong.

##### Facts relating to MSC 904501/2017 (against Synnex)

20     On 11 September 2017, Ms. Keong visited Synnex. The ISDs were openly displayed and offered for sale. Ms. Keong purchased 2 ISDs, the September Sample Purchases, for S$469 each.

21     During Ms. Keong’s visit, one of Synnex’s employees who identified himself as “Ah Wei” installed the applications “Huat88TV” and “Kodi” into the September Sample Purchase and activated these applications for Ms. Keong.

22     Following each sample purchase, the Complainant examined the purchased ISD(s), and was able to use the ISD(s) to stream the copyrighted subject-matters. He verified with the Rights Holders that they / the copyright owners did not authorise the streaming of the copyrighted subject-matters via the ISDs, nor the manufacturing, sale and supply of the ISDs.

##### Facts relating to MSC 904502/2017 (against Synnex)

23     Pursuant to Search Warrant No. 21 of 2017, a raid was conducted by members of the Intellectual Property Rights Branch of the Singapore Police Force on 23 May 2017 at the Synnex premises, where 255 ISDs and some documents were seized.

24     The Complainant examined the seized ISDs and found that 104 ISDs were pre-installed with the “MyIPTV”, “Huat88” and “HDTV” applications. 104 of these seized ISDs were specifically adapted for making infringing copies of copyrighted works, as they had each been pre-loaded with at least one application which enabled the end user to directly access unauthorised content. As the seized ISDs were not sold, they had not been activated by the command and control server and the Complainant could not access the applications. Based on the Complainant's previous examinations of ISDs which were pre-installed with the “MyIPTV”, “Huat88” and “HDTV” applications, the end user would be able to stream content including the copyrighted subject-matters once the ISDs had been properly activated. Synnex ought reasonably to have known that the ISDs were to be used for this purpose.

##### Facts relating to MSC 904483/2017 to MSC 904486/2017 (against Jia XiaoFeng)

25     Synnex’s acts, as contained in its charges, were committed with the connivance of Jia. As mentioned, Jia was the controlling mind of Synnex at all material times:-

> a)     He was the sole shareholder of Synnex since its incorporation on 4 May 2015;

> b)     Prior to the date of incorporation of Synnex, Jia was the sole proprietor of Synnex Trading (UEN No. 53293660D) from 8 April 2015 to 15 May 2015, when it was terminated;

> c)     Before he became the sole director of Synnex on 29 June 2017, he had at all material times acted for Synnex in the capacity of a director of Synnex.

## The Appropriate Sentence

26     In mitigation, Respondent Counsel briefly informed the Court of the background of both the Respondents and asked for a fine to be imposed on Jia on all charges[^3]. He also fully accepted Complainant Counsel’s sentencing submissions.

28     In sentencing, I was mindful that that both the Respondents had pleaded guilty, although the plea of guilt had come in late in the day (plea of guilt was recorded on 30 October 2019; both cases were fixed for a 4-day trial on 4 November 2019). They also had no antecedents.

##### Offences under section 136(3A), Copyright Act

29     The punishment prescribed for an offence under 136(3A) of the Copyright Act, Chapter 63, was a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both in the case of a first offender (for which both Synnex and Jia were).

30     Complainant Counsel informed the Court that there has only been one decision concerning an offence under section 136(3A) of the Copyright Act for the sale of ISDs.

31     In the unreported decision of _Neil Kevin Gane v Abdul Nagib bin Abdul Aziz_ (PS-900070-2017), the court meted out a fine of $1,200 against the respondent for one charge under section 136(3A) of the Copyright Act, arising from the sale of 1 ISD. In that case the offender had indicated his remorse and stopped trading in ISDs upon receiving a cease and desist letter from the rights holders in question[^5]. This was the only precedent available in respect of infringement of copyrighted cable programmes and cinematograph films through the sale and use of ISDs. It was also fairly recent, the sentence having been meted out on 24 April 2019.

32     I took my guidance from the fine imposed in _Nagib’s_ case. In imposing a slightly higher fine of $1,400 on Synnex for the selling of 1 ISD on the 2 occasions in May 2017 and August 2017, I took into consideration the fact that whilst the sale of 1 ISD had taken place on a single occasion in each month, Synnex had sold and offered ISDs for sale since 2015, as compared to the period of approximately 9 months that the respondent in _Nagib_. Synnex was also the company who supplied the ISDs to third parties, including the respondent in _Nagib_. for a commission[^6]. For the sale of 2 ISDs in September 2017 which took place on a single occasion, I was of the view that a fine of $2,000 would be sufficient.

#### Against Jia

33     For Jia, I chose to impose a higher quantum of fine on similar charges. Relying on _PP v St. Hua Private School Pte Ltd, Song ChunWei_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 342</span>, Complainant Counsel submitted that in that case, the sole director and shareholder Ms Song was sentenced to a higher fine of $20,000 (St Hua PSPL was fined $18,000) even though they faced similar charges under section 136(3A) of the Copyright Act for infringing copyright in the NX Software, when the court had regard to the “_major role_” that she had played in the matter[^7].

34     In this case, Jia was the controlling mind of Synnex at all material times. As submitted, Jia had been put on notice as early as August 2016 that Synnex’s dealings in ISDs constituted copyright infringement. However, he continued to allow Synnex to deal in ISDs until June 2019.[^8] Jia played a key role in relation to the acts of Synnex and how Synnex was run. I agreed with Complainant Counsel that there was a basis to impose a higher quantum of fine on Jia.

##### Offences under section 136(4), Copyright Act

35     For the offence under section 136(4) of the Copyright Act, the offender would be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 for each such article in respect of which the offence is committed or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

36     In the case of _Yu Peng Hsueh-Shu v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1083</span>, the offender possessed hard disks which contained infringing copies of visual recordings and song titles. The charges were under section 136(2)(b) of the Copyright Act, for possessing these articles for the purpose of distributing the articles for the purpose of trade. These hard disks were embedded in karaoke players which were sold for a profit of $100 to $250 each. At \[9\], the Court noted that the usual tariff where there is a small number of infringing items is between $400-$600 per article. However, because the profit margin for distributing each article was in the range of $100 to $250, the Court was of the view that the fine imposed per article “_must be substantially higher_”. On appeal, the offender’s jail term was set aside[^9] and she was fined a sum of $4,000[^10] per hard disk.

37     Whilst section 136(4) of the Copyright Act may embody different ingredients of the offence, I find that the profit of margin derived from the sale of ISDs specifically adapted for making copies of copyrighted cable programmes and cinematograph films was a relevant factor in sentencing. Investigations in this case revealed that the cost price of each ISD (hardware only) as of 2 March 2017 was USD2.90. Synnex sold each ISD to the investigators for S$119 to S$159[^11]. There was a huge profit margin derived by Synnex for the potential sale of every such ISD. Based on Synnex’s cash register records seized from Synnex premises during the raid, Synnex had raked in an average of $134,053.24 per month from March 2017 to May 2017[^12].

38     Complainant Counsel also highlighted the widespread use of ISDs in Singapore as a “_worrying trend_”. He added that “_unlike legitimate service providers, ISD retailers like Synnex do not pay licence fees to secure rights to a buffet spread of content available on the ISDs. Such retailers prey on the public’s demand for the ISD due to its low cost_”[^13], as compared with paying monthly subscription fees to various legitimate service providers and possibly, to watch only certain cabled programmes and cinematograph films.

39     Bearing the above in mind, the fine of $1,500 imposed on each ISD which Synnex had in possession was an appropriate one. The maximum fine prescribed for each article under section 136(4) of the Copyright Act was $20,000, with no cap on the aggregate fine. There was a total of 104 articles seized in this instance – not a small quantity. I was of the view that the fine of $156,000 on this charge alone and the aggregate fine of $160,800 on all the 4 charges, did not breach the totality principle.

#### Against Jia

40     Jia was highly culpable in this entire enterprise. As mentioned, he was the sole director, shareholder and mastermind behind Synnex. He had control over Synnex’s operations and it would follow, supervision over Synnex’s employees who had made representations to the investigator-purchasers that the ISDs were not illegal[^14]. Part of Synnex’ business was also to supply ISDs to third parties for a commission.

41     What was aggravating was Jia’s attitude and conduct. He persisted in selling ISDs through Synnex even after[^15]:

> a)     Being put on notice by way of cease and desist letters from Fox and Singtel Global in August 2016 and October 2016 respectively that Synnex’s dealings in ISDs constituted copyright infringement;

> b)     The raid on Synnex premises on 23 May 2017;

> c)     Bering served with the charges in the instant proceedings in December 2017;

> d)     After the Singapore High Court ordered internet service providers to block access to the pre-loaded applications allowing an end user to stream pirated content through the very same ISDs;

> e)     The ministry of Law’s announcement of the intended enactment of new laws criminalising the sale of ISDs in January 2019;

> f)     The offender in _Nagjb_ had pleaded guilty and was sentenced.

42     Trial dates (for 4-7 November 2019) for both Respondents were taken on 27 March 2019. In a lawyer’s letter dated 3 October 2019, the Respondents proposed to plead guilty to the charges and requested the Complainant to make certain concessions in relation to the charges as well as sentencing. In return, the Respondents claimed that Jia would provide an undertaking not to deal in the ISDs or any similar devices and also publish a Facebook post that he no longer deals in ISDs. This offer was reiterated in a second lawyer’s letter of 9 October 2019[^16].

43     However, on 18 October 2019, when the Rights Holders’ investigators visited Synnex, they were still able to purchase 1 ISD pre-installed with 2 infringing applications. The Rights Holders’ representatives were able to access pirated content through this ISD. Evidence was also obtained that the Respondents were still brazenly marketing and offering the ISDs for sale to the public[^17].

44     None of these facts mentioned in the sentencing submissions were challenged or objected to by Respondent Counsel.

45     In truth, there was little display of genuine remorse on Jia’s part. Apart from his increased culpability considering his key role in Synnex, it was clear from his conduct in this entire proceeding that he did not have the intention to comply with copyright laws despite them being brought to his notice. Jia brazenly continued Synnex’s selling of the ISDs from late 2016, right up to the time of his plea of guilt. There was no sincerity in Jia’s offer to stop his infringing activities. Given these facts, I was satisfied that the custodial threshold had been crossed and a short custodial sentence was called for.

46     In reliance on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Low Meng Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGMC 2</span>[^18], and considering the specific facts and circumstances in Jia’s case, including the number of infringing articles seized, I sentenced him to 12 weeks imprisonment. In the case of _Low Meng Guan_, the offender who had in his possession 3 infringing articles (2 Sony memory sticks and 1 scandisk micro SDHC) was sentenced to 8 weeks’ imprisonment under section 136(4) of the Copyright Act.

47     Upon the conclusion of the case against Jia and Synnex, it subsequently came to my attention that a fine of $10,000 (in default 8 weeks’ imprisonment) was imposed by the High Court on the offender/appellant in _Low Meng_ Guan, in lieu of the original sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment[^19]. No written grounds were furnished by the High Court in this respect.

48     Jia’s imprisonment term as well as all payment of fines have been stayed pending the hearing of this appeal. Jia is currently on bail.
