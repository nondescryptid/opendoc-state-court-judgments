### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       Zackeer Abbass Khan’s (“Zackeer”) enmity towards Liakath Ali s/o Mohamed Ibrahim (“the victim”), his former business partner, transcends a long-standing hundred-year-old business rivalry between the neighbouring Zam Zam (“Zam Zam”) and Victory (“Victory”) restaurants. On 22 August 2015, following a complaint to the authorities purportedly made by the victim against Zam Zam’s employees for alleged touting, Zackeer threatened the victim aggressively in Tamil, “in one week, I will do you”. [^1]

2       After making the threat, Zackeer contacted his long-time friend, Anwer Ambiya bin Kadir Maideen (“Anwer”) to procure an attack against the victim. When Anwer refused to participate in the attack directly, Zackeer suggested recruiting a mutual friend and reputed gangster, Joshua Navindran s/o Surainthiran (“Joshua”) for the job. Anwer called Joshua, who agreed to conduct the attack for a fee of $2000.00. Through Anwer, Zackeer specified that the victim had to be “slashed in the face” within a week. Subsequently, on 26 August 2015, Joshua attacked the victim with a knife. As a result, the victim sustained a “5 cm depressed upper lip scar traversing the vermillion border”, [^2] which is a permanent disfigurement.

3       However, at the trial, Zackeer claimed that he merely instructed Anwer to inform Joshua to give the victim “a verbal warning”. He denied procuring the attack on the victim. Anwer and Joshua both supported Zackeer in their oral testimonies. Thus, the central issue disputed is a narrow one – whether Zackeer was one of the abettors to the conspiracy, and if so, the scope of the conspiracy.

4       Having considered all the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against both accused persons. Accordingly, Zackeer and Anwer were both convicted after a trial of an offence of abetment by conspiracy to cause grievous hurt with a weapon to the victim under Section 326 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, (Cap 2008, Rev Ed).

5       Zackeer, who was 49 years old, was sentenced to a global sentence of 6 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. Anwer was sentenced to a global sentence of 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. No caning was imposed as he was above 50 years old.

6       Zackeer is now appealing against both his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the appeal.

7       Anwer is appealing only against his sentence. He is currently on bail pending the appeal.

## Charges

8       The accused persons claimed trial and were jointly tried on the following charges:

![]([2020] SGDC 0138_Image/[2020] SGDC 0138_image1.png)

## Undisputed Facts

9       Zackeer is the business owner of a successful restaurant, Zam Zam. Zackeer and the victim were former business partners. In 2005, following a failed business venture, Zackeer was sued. He also felt “cheated” of $80,000 from the proceeds of the sale of the said business. Zackeer held the victim responsible for his misfortunes. Subsequently, the ill will between Zackeer and the victim intensified, when the victim joined Zam Zam’s rival restaurant, Victory. The victim continued to create trouble for Zackeer, by allegedly pulling customers away and reporting his staff to the authorities. Employees of Zam Zam and Victory frequently touted in the vicinity outside their restaurants for customers. Consequently, the police were also frequently in the vicinity to advise employees of both restaurants to refrain from touting along the road.[^3]

## The Case for the Prosecution

### Incident on 22 August 2015

10     The Prosecution’s case was that Zackeer’s grudge against the victim climaxed on 22 August 2015, when the police approached the employees of both restaurants to advise against touting along the road. Two of Zam Zam’s employees, Koleth Navas (“Navas”) and Koleth Abdul Nasir (“Nasir”), had complained to Zackeer that the victim had reported Zam Zam employees to the police. Prior to the complaint to Zackeer, Navas had earlier threatened the victim Ali stating, _“I have your phone---I have your photo in my phone.”[^4]_ Nasir had also threatened the victim stating, “_This last time, should do you but you escaped. This time round, (we) will do you, watch out_[^5]

11     Upon hearing the complaint from his two employees, the enraged Zackeer threatened the victim loudly in Tamil “_in one week, I will do you_**”**.[^6] At the material time, Zackeer was standing at the entrance of Zam Zam and the victim stood about five to six feet away at Victory’s entrance.[^7] Zackeer also threatened Edikilakath Gazali (“Gazali”), a senior manager at Victory Restaurant and the victim’s boss that he would make it difficult for Gazali to carry on his business. Gazali testified that he was afraid.

12     Zackeer’s aggressive demeanour and actions were captured on CCTV footage from 7.06pm to 7.08pm in P12, albeit without audio recording.[^8]

13     After being threatened, the victim was afraid. On 24 August 2015, two days after the incident, the victim, accompanied by a colleague, lodged a police report of the incident (P4). This incident therefore formed the subject matter of the criminal intimidation charge.

### The Conspiracy to cause Grievous Hurt

#### Zackeer’s personal grudge against the victim

14     Zackeer was the only conspirator who bore a personal grudge against the victim Ali. Both Anwer and Joshua barely knew the victim.[^9] Zackeer and the victim knew each other for almost 15 years.[^10] However, their relationship soured in 2005, following a failed business venture, which resulted in a civil suit. Whilst Zackeer eventually settled this sum through instalments, the victim Ali paid nothing. After the business was sold to Victory restaurant, Zackeer later discovered that the business was sold for $180,000 instead of $100,000. Thus, Zackeer felt that the victim had “cheated him of $80,000” in the sales proceeds. In fact, Zackeer also candidly admitted he _“did not have a problem with Victory Restaurant, \[he\] only had some personal problem with \[the victim\]”_.[^11]

#### The Conspiracy

15     The Prosecution’s case rested entirely on the statements of the co-conspirators, Anwer and Joshua, Zackeer’s employee Nasir, and WhatsApp messages between Anwer and Joshua (P27).

16     A chronology of the key events leading to Joshua’s attack on the victim is reflected in the table below:

#### The victim suffered permanent disfigurement

17     As a result of the attack, the victim sustained a 7 cm laceration over his right upper lip extending to his right cheek.[^53] The wound eventually healed but left a 5 cm depressed upper lip scar traversing the vermillion border, which is a permanent scar, which qualifies as permanent disfigurement. The victim’s scar involved visible scarring and abnormal pigmentation, and therefore met the criteria for a 1% disfigurement within the Class 1 impairment rating under the American Association of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery (“AAOMS”) Guidelines.[^54]

## Close of the Prosecution’s Case

18     At the Close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence invited the Court to dismiss the case on the ground that there was no case to answer. The Defence submitted that the charge under Section 326 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code was defective as Zackeer merely intended to warn the victim and did not personally attack the victim. Instead, Joshua had panicked and acted on his own accord to slash the victim. The Defence further submitted that none of the Prosecution witnesses, including the victim, were able to confirm that Zackeer was involved in the conspiracy. Alternatively, the Defence urged the Court to amend the charge to that under Section 324 of the Penal Code on the basis that there was no permanent disfigurement of the victim’s face. The Defence did not submit that there was no case to answer for the charge under Section 506 of the Penal Code.

19     In response, the Prosecution submitted that Joshua had no personal grudges against the victim. Joshua had slashed the victim in the face because he was commissioned for the job by Anwer, who in turn was instructed by Zackeer. Together, the common objective of the trio was to inflict a slash on the victim Ali in the face. Shortly, after the attack, Anwer had asked for Joshua’s bank account. WhatsApp messages between Anwer and Joshua indicated that Joshua was primarily motivated by financial reward. The Prosecution also submitted that there was medical evidence to confirm that the victim had suffered permanent disfigurement.

20     I do not propose to discuss the merits of parties’ submissions at the close of the Prosecution’s Case as the same issues were canvassed at the end of the trial. I was however satisfied that there was _prima facie_ evidence to support the key elements of the charges at the close of the Prosecution’s Case. Accordingly, I called on both accused persons to give their defence to their respective charges.

## The Case for the Defence: Zackeer

### No threats made

21     Zackeer denied that he had threatened the victim. He claimed that he never spoke to the victim[^55] and that the victim Ali was not in his view at the material time.[^56] Zackeer claimed that after he was informed by his employees that the victim had reported to the police that Zam Zam employees were touting, he had called Gazali to inform Gazali to stop Victory’s employees from touting. Otherwise, Zackeer would respond in a similar fashion. Zackeer claimed that he spoke to Gazali “normally”.[^57]

### No conspiracy to cause grievous hurt

22     Zackeer’s defence to the conspiracy charge was essentially one of bare denial. He claimed that there was no mutual understanding between Anwer, Joshua and himself to cause grievous hurt to the victim with a weapon. Zackeer also claimed that he had only asked Anwer to give the victim a warning as the victim kept “disturbing him”.[^58] Zackeer stated that in fact, Anwer had on his own initiative informed Zackeer that he would arrange for someone to deliver a warning to the victim. There was no discussion of when and how the warning would be carried out, nor was there any discussion of any reward or payment.[^59]

23     Zackeer also claimed that he did not know Joshua personally and that Anwer did not formally introduce Joshua to him. Zackeer also claimed that he did not give Joshua any money to warn the victim and was not involved in the discussions between Anwer and Joshua.[^60] He was also not aware that Joshua had procured a knife and had slashed the victim.[^61] When queried about the money which Anwer had transferred Joshua, Zackeer claimed that it was payment for Joshua’s medical bills.[^62]

24     Finally, Zackeer claimed that Joshua had acted on his own in procuring a knife at the eleventh hour. Joshua had slashed the victim instead of delivering a verbal warning because he panicked.[^63]

25     During the trial, both Anwer and Joshua’s oral testimonies supported Zackeer’s claims. I will deal with this aspect later in this judgment.

### A permanent scar is not a permanent disfigurement

26     The Defence argued that a permanent scar does not equate to a permanent disfigurement. Primarily, the Defence relied on the evidence of Dr Chong Wai Yip’s medical report stating that the victim’s scar was not highly visible. There was also no perceivable permanent disfigurement or permanent disability to his face.[^64]

## The Case for the Defence: Anwer

27     Anwer is not appealing against his conviction. Nevertheless, for completeness, Anwer’s defence was essentially that Zackeer had asked him to give the victim a verbal warning. As Anwer was on friendly terms with the victim Ali, Anwer informed Zackeer that he would get another person to deliver the verbal warning. Anwer eventually contacted Joshua and requested Joshua to deliver a warning to the victim not to interfere with other people’s business. Anwer claimed that there was no discussion between Zackeer, Joshua and himself to procure a knife to slash the victim in the face. He had showed Joshua a picture of Ali, obtained from Zackeer’s employee, Navas. Joshua agreed, even though no payment was involved. Anwer gave Joshua $200 as Joshua was in financial difficulty. On 26 August 2015, Anwer later discovered that Joshua was injured in a scuffle with the victim. As Joshua had requested for money for his medical bills, Anwer took a photo of Joshua’s hand and sent it to Zackeer. In turn, Zackeer gave $2000 in cash to Anwer. Anwer then transferred $1,700 to Joshua.

## Decision on Conviction

### Criminal Intimidation

28     Zackeer’s threats to the victim form the genesis of the subsequent conspiracy to inflict a slash on the victim’s face. Although Zackeer claimed that he did not speak to the victim and that the victim was not present in his view at the material time, I found that the victim’s testimony was inherently logical and coheres with extrinsic evidence.

29     First, prior to Zackeer’s threat, the victim Ali had already been threatened by both Navas and Nasir. Navas threatened the victim that he had a photo of the victim in his phone. Nasir also threatened the victim that “\[_t\]his last time, should do you but you escaped. This time round, (we) will do you, watch out.”_[^65] Nasir himself had earlier been charged, convicted, and sentenced for this threat against the victim (see P32). Shortly after this threat by Nasir, Zackeer also threatened the victim loudly, **_“_**_I see how you will work here and_ _within one week__I will poodu you_**”**.[^66] The Tamil word, “poodu”, may be translated into “hit or kill”.[^67] The victim stated that Zackeer had repeated the words continuously.[^68] The victim stated that Zackeer was angry when he threatened him

30     Second, the victim’s testimony of the events leading to Zackeer’s threat was corroborated by CCTV footage (P12). The sequence of events captured in P12 is reflected in the table (P13) below:

![]([2020] SGDC 0138_Image/[2020] SGDC 0138_image2.png)

31     Significantly, at about 19:05:34pm in P13, the time at which the victim states that Zackeer started threatening him,[^69] Zackeer can be seen angrily gesticulating in the victim’s direction. The victim was at the time standing at the entrance of Victory at the 5-foot way, a few metres away.

32     Third, whilst the victim did not outwardly show fear, it was clear that he was shaken by Zackeer’s threat. Gazali had testified that when the victim spoke to him, he appeared “_very tensed_”.[^70] Zackeer had also threatened Gazali stating, “_I’ll see how you all will conduct your business_.”[^71] I therefore accepted the Prosecution’s submission that this threat mirrors Zackeer’s earlier threat to the victim Ali.

33     Fourth, although Zackeer’s Defence Counsel had submitted that the victim Ali could not have been intimidated because he did not exhibit any fear when threatened on 22 August 2015, the victim’s conduct subsequent to the threat belies his actual and belated distress. This was not surprising as the victim only discovered later that Zackeer intended to carry out the threat, when he noticed two persons (Joshua and his friend) following him at Little India Station on 23 August 2015. I find it also significant that on 24 August 2015, the victim, accompanied by his colleague, immediately lodged a police report. In his police report, the victim identified Zackeer as the prime suspect. Whilst there were minor discrepancies with respect to the threat made, the victim clarified at trial that he used the word, “_poduvaen_”, which meant “slashing or cutting” on any part of the body.[^72] The victim also clarified that his colleague had assisted him with the translation, as he was not fluent in English.

34     In _Muthusamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1948\] MLJ 57</span>, Taylor J observed that:

> Minor differences are attributable mainly to differences in interpretation and the way in which the statement was taken and sometimes to differences in recollection. A perfectly truthful witness may mention a detail on one occasion and not remember it on another. A mere omission is hardly ever a discrepancy. The police statement is usually much briefer than the evidence. Both the statement and the evidence are usually narratives reduced from question and answer. **_The witness is not responsible for the actual expressions used in either, and all the less so where he does not speak English_****.**

> {Emphasis added)

35     In view of the above, I was satisfied that the victim’s account was consistent with Zackeer’s threat that he will be “_poodu_” in a week. Further, I accept that the victim’s fear of Zackeer’s threat was genuine. The victim clearly took Zackeer’s threat seriously, when he had armed himself on 26 August 2015 and only struck out in self-defence.

36     Fifth, Nasir had implicated Zackeer. In P35, Nasir affirmed that Zackeer got angry and shouted towards Victory Restaurant where the victim was standing. Zackeer shouted in Tamil towards him, “_you don’t create trouble here and I will not spare you_.” In P36, Nasir confirmed that Zackeer shouted at the victim whilst he was standing outside Victory, that he should watch out and that he would not spare the victim. The weight to be attributed to Nasir’s statements will be discussed later in this judgment.

37     Finally, Zackeer’s threat was not an idle threat. On 26 August 2015, four days after the threat was made, Joshua attacked the victim and had inflicted a slash on his face.

38     For completeness and given that the charge involved a threat of violence, I gave careful attention when the victim was testifying. Ali had impressed me in the simple manner that he gave his evidence. He was soft-spoken and did not come across as over-eager to implicate Zackeer. He also did not embellish his evidence in any way. I was satisfied that he was a credible and reliable witness. Further, his testimony also had that ring of truth surrounding it.

39     In view of the above, I found that the victim was a credible witness and accepted his evidence that Zackeer had threatened to hit or kill him. I also accepted the victim’s evidence that this threat was eventually carried out.

40     I now move on to consider the alleged conspiracy to cause grievous hurt to the victim with a weapon.

### The Law of Abetment by Conspiracy

41     The essence of a conspiracy is an agreement. Section 107(b) of the Penal Code defines abetment by conspiracy as “a person abets the doing of a thing, who engages… in a conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing.”

42     The essential elements of abetment by conspiracy are set out in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 619 at \[76\] as:

> (a)     the person abetting must engage with one or more other persons in the conspiracy;

> (b)     the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and

> (c)     an act must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.

43     It is not necessary for the abettor to have agreed or arranged directly with all the other conspirators or even the person who commits the offence. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed: Explanation 5 to Section 108, Penal Code and accompanying illustration.

44     Further, although there must be knowledge of a common design, it is not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed as to the details. However, they must be at least aware of the general purpose of the plot and that the plot must be unlawful. The test of guilt is whether having regard to the immediate object of the conspiracy, the act done by the principal is one which according to ordinary experience and common sense, the abettor must have seen as foreseeable: _Nomura Taji v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 259</span> at \[110\].

45     An agreement between the parties may be inferred from the words and actions of the parties. Whilst these actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy, they constitute evidence of the conspiracy: _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_ \[1993\] 3 SLR (R) 302.

46     Finally, Section 111 of the Penal Code also provides that an abettor may be liable for abetting an act even when a different act is done:

> When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had directly abetted it:

> Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed … in pursuance of the conspiracy, which constituted the abetment.

### Assessment of Anwer, Joshua, Nasir and Ramge’s statements

47     The key evidence that implicates Zackeer as the mastermind and financier of the attack on the victim Ali rests on the confessions provided in Anwer, Joshua, Nasir and Ramge’s statements to the police. At trial, Joshua, Nasir and Ramge had turned hostile.

48     At the same time, in light of other objective evidence adduced, this case essentially turns on whether the oral evidence of Anwer and the key Prosecution witnesses, Joshua, Nasir and Ramge, or their confessions provided in their statements to the police, should be preferred. Having carefully considered all the evidence before me, I find that the statements were voluntarily made and full weight should be accorded to the said statements.

49     I now set out the evaluation of the evidence for my findings below.

#### Anwer’s statements (P45, P48 and P49)

50     Anwer had confessed in his statements that Zackeer’s instructions were to give the victim a slash on the face. These instructions were in turn communicated to Joshua. Anwer further admitted that on 25 August 2015, Zackeer had called Anwer to inform Joshua to get the job done before his return to Singapore on 26 August 2015.[^73] Anwer’s confession was therefore evidence that the agreement between all the parties was to inflict a slash on the victim’s face.

51     In _Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 1166</span>, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) held at \[21\]-\[22\] that an accused person can still be convicted on his retracted confession if the court is satisfied that it was made voluntarily. Whilst the accused person should be given an opportunity to explain his change of position, the explanation can be rejected if it is found to be untrue. Further, if the explanation for the retraction is unsatisfactory, this may cast doubt on the entire evidence of the accused person: _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[87\].

#### (1)   Voluntariness of P45, P48 and P49

52     Anwer had challenged the voluntariness of his statement in P45 claiming that he was threatened before the recording of the statement and he had given his confession in an oppressive environment.[^74] First, Anwer claimed that police officers, ASP Thinagaran s/o S. Krishnasamy (“ASP Thinagaran”), DSP Burhanudeen Haji Hussainar (“DSP Burhanudeen”) and Investigation Officer Ang Ghim Sing Ray (“IO Ray Ang”) had threatened him. Specifically, due to his secret society links, the police officers had threatened to detain him and also with the loss of custody of his son in adoption proceedings, if he did not cooperate with investigations. Second, Anwer also claimed that he was handcuffed behind his back, made to strip naked and squat at the corner of a room. This lack of dignity, coupled with the earlier threats of detention with trial and loss of custody of his son constituted oppressive conduct, which sapped his will. He claimed that this was the background to the confession he made in his statement in P45.

53     At the end of the first ancillary hearing, I found that Anwer’s statement P45 was made voluntarily and admitted P45 into evidence. I was satisfied that there was no threat, inducement or promise, or any oppressive conduct, which would have rendered P45 involuntary and inadmissible.[^75] I also accepted the evidence of ASP Thinagaran, DSP Burhanudeen and IO Ray Ang. I found that the police officers were direct, candid and forthright.[^76] I also found that DSP Burhanudeen had no motive to fix or threaten Anwer.[^77] On the other hand, I found that Anwer’s testimony tendered to shift and bordered on incoherence and incredulity. I therefore rejected his bare allegations.[^78]

54     Anwer had also challenged the voluntariness of his statements P48 and P49. He had claimed that IO Ray Ang had threatened that he would lose custody of his son, he would be detained without trial and he would be made the mastermind if he did not implicate Zackeer.[^79] He also alleged that Inspector Mohd Zahid Bin Mohd Noor (“Inspector Zahid”), who had served the charge under Section 14(3) of the Societies Act, (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed), had threatened him with detention without trial if he refused to cooperate.

55     During the second ancillary hearing, IO Ray Ang and Inspector Zahid denied making the alleged threats to Anwer. Both police officers also stated that Anwer was cooperative during investigations.

56     At the end of the second ancillary hearing, I found that the police officers had given their evidence in a frank and consistent manner. In contrast, Anwer’s evidence was inconsistent and selective where it suited his own interest. I found that Anwer was not credible in respect of the alleged threats made.[^80] Accordingly, I found that both P48 and P49 were voluntarily made. Both statements were admitted into evidence.

#### (2)   Anwer’s explanation for his change of position is untrue

57     When confronted by his statements in P45, P48 and P49 in the main trial, Anwer was unable to provide a valid explanation for his change of position. He continued to maintain the involuntariness of the said statements. He further alleged that ASP Thinagaran and IO Ray Ang had fabricated portions of his statements. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that these bare assertions were contrary to Anwer’s earlier allegations that he had confessed due to threats made by the same police officers.[^81] Accordingly, I accorded full weight to Anwer’s positive statements in P45, P48 and P49 and rejected his oral evidence at trial.

#### Weight of Nasir’s statements (P34 to P37), Joshua’s statements (P19 to P21), and Ramge’s (P41) statement

58     The Prosecution witnesses, Nasir, Joshua and Ramge had turned hostile during the trial. In _G Ravichander v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 167</span> (“_Ravichander_”) at \[12\], Yong Pung How CJ stated that:

> … just because \[a witness\] turns hostile on the stand and proffers evidence in favour of the accused person cannot of itself prove the accused person’s innocence of the charge facing him. In any case, it is **not unusual for victims or other prosecution witnesses to turn hostile in court**. They may do so for any of a number of reasons. For example, they may **fear the repercussions, real or imagined, of testifying against the accused**, or they **may have changed their minds** about pursuing justice through the criminal courts. Another possibility could be of course be that the accused is really innocent. **The bottom line is that the \[witness’\] testimony is but a part of the totality of the evidence that the trial court must weigh** in order to decide if the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

> (Emphasis added)

59     At trial, the Prosecution had applied to impeach the testimonies of Nasir, Joshua and Ramge under Section 147 (3) of the Evidence Act, to substitute their oral evidence in court with their statements. I agreed that there were material discrepancies between the oral testimonies of Nasir, Joshua and Ramge and their statements. I also found that their statements were made voluntarily. Accordingly, I allowed the application and admitted their statements into evidence.

60     A successful impeachment of a witness’s credit under Section 157 of the Evidence Act goes only to the weight of his oral testimony in court and not to its admissibility: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 144</span> at \[24\]. It does not mean that all his oral testimony will be expunged. Yong CJ stated that:

> … the fact that the credit of an accused person or a witness has been impeached does not necessarily mean that all his evidence must be disregarded. The court must **carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded**.

61     In _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 619 (“_Chai Chien Wei_”) at \[71\], the CA had held that the weight to be accorded to the prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts.

#### (1)   Nasir’s statements (P34 to P37)

62     In his statements, Nasir implicated Zackeer as the mastermind behind the attack to inflict a slash on the victim’s face. On 22 August 2015, Nasir stated that Zackeer had informed him that he intended to get someone to teach the victim a lesson. On 27 August 2015, after Nasir informed Zackeer that the police had arrived at Zam Zam and were looking for him, Zackeer told Nasir that he had arranged for someone to hurt the victim the night before (26 August 2015) and the assailant was injured.[^82] Thereafter, Zackeer informed Nasir to “act dumb” regarding the information disclosed.

63     However, at trial, Nasir sought to exonerate Zackeer and disclaimed his statements, P35 to P37, which had implicated Zackeer. This was entirely not surprising at all. I note that Nasir was an employee of Zackeer. He had worked with Zam Zam restaurant for 15 years and continued to work with Zackeer, even at the time of the trial.[^83] Moreover, Nasir also shares a close relationship with Zackeer. This is evident from Nasir’s Facebook profile P38. Nasir’s Facebook profile picture features Nasir posing with Zackeer’s Ferrari car in Zackeer’s house.[^84]

64     In essence, Nasir asserted that his statements were made involuntarily as he was threatened with imprisonment and possible deportation. Nasir also claimed that the police officers had subjected him to physical abuse and to “full torture”[^85]. He also asserted that he was not fluent in English.

65     These were striking allegations. Further, the reference to being subjected to “full torture” is both startling and yet totally incredulous. I find that Nasir’s explanations for his dramatic change of position was totally unsatisfactory and lacking in credibility. I proceed to explain. His statements P34 to P37 were made contemporaneously. They were also _negative_ statements in which Nasir denied threatening the victim. As such, there was no reason for the police officers to resort to threats, as Nasir did not incriminate himself in any way. Apart from bare assertions, Nasir did not provide any medical evidence of the alleged physical abuse. With respect to Nasir’s English language ability, it was clear that Nasir sought to selectively downplay his language ability, especially on the portions of his statement, which incriminated Zackeer. Nasir’s conduct in court demonstrably showed his total allegiance to Zackeer.

66     Accordingly, I found that Nasir’s statements P34 to P37 were voluntarily made. I also had no hesitation in agreeing with the Prosecution that full weight ought to be accorded to the evidence in the said statements. I therefore rejected Nasir’s oral testimony at trial. Given Nasir’s close relationship with Zackeer and continued employment at Zam Zam, it was abundantly clear that Nasir’s testimony was the inevitable consequence of a natural desire and zeal to exonerate Zackeer and disclaim all parts of his statements, which could possibly incriminate Zackeer.

#### (2)   Joshua’s statements (P19 to P21)

67     Joshua had unequivocally admitted in his statements (P19 to P21) that Anwer had told him to slash the victim in the face. That was the sole reason why Joshua had bought a knife. In return, Joshua would be paid for the job. Joshua also stated that the job was commission at Zackeer’s behest and that Zackeer was the sponsor.[^86]

68     At trial, Joshua resiled from his statements. He now claimed that Anwer had directed him to warn the victim not to interfere with other people’s business. He was not promised any money but Anwer informed him that he would he would try to get money for about $1,500 to $2,000.[^87] On 23 August 2015, Anwer had not given him $250 as pre-payment for the job. He was however unable to give an explanation for the money paid. On 26 August 2015, Joshua claimed that he bought a knife at Phoon Huat on his own initiative as he became afraid that the victim had stared at him on 23 August 2015. This is in spite of the fact that Joshua was a known gangster and had secret society affiliations. He stated that he was unaware that the job was commissioned at Zackeer’s behest. He had only assumed that Zackeer was involved as the request related to Zam Zam. He also claimed that he was coerced into pushing all the blame to Zackeer during statement recording. Joshua also denied his brother Joel’s involvement in the attack.

69     Joshua asserted that his statements (P19 to P21) were made involuntarily as he was forced to agree with the contents of the statements, which were allegedly fabricated by the statement recorder, ASP Arun. Specifically, Joshua claimed in his letter to ASP Arun (P24), that ASP Arun had informed him that if he pushed the blame to Zackeer, ASP Arun would persuade IO Ray Ang to recommend a reduced charge for Joshua. At trial, ASP Arun rebutted Joshua’s claims and stated that he never told Joshua that he would try to influence IO Ray to drop the charge to an offence to one under s 324 of the Penal Code.[^88]

70     I found that ASP Arun’s evidence in court was compelling. He gave his evidence simply and in a candid manner. ASP Arun had testified that he had recorded a full contemporaneous record of the events that transpired from Joshua’s arrest to the recording of his statements. Furthermore, between the recording of P19 and P20, on 22 September 2015, after ASP Arun was informed of prior communication between Joshua and Zackeer in the lock up, ASP Arun recorded his conversation with Joshua in his field book. ASP Arun also testified that Joshua had stated that Zackeer told Joshua that he (Zackeer) will vehemently deny to the police his involvement in the case. Joshua also signed on the field book and initialled on the entry dated 23 September 2015 before 11.45am.[^89] Further, Joshua was given the opportunity to make amendments to his statements and he did clarify portions of his statements during statement recording.

71     It is apposite here to make some observations. At the commencement of the trial, Joshua’s brother Joel, was also facing a similar slashing conspiracy charge, just like Zackeer and Anwer. (_Half way through the trial, Joel was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal and subsequently detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act)_. Joshua himself had earlier already been convicted and sentenced for his own role in slashing the victim. Further, the court was also aware that several times while he was giving his testimony, Joshua was trying to make eye contact and pass ‘silent’ messages to his brother Joel. In addition, there were also several requests by the mother of Joshua and Joel, to see and talk to Joshua during the court recess, while Joshua was still testifying. These requests of the mother were denied.

72     I was mindful of the above events which transpired in court. Further, I was acutely aware that Joshua had every incentive to depart from his earlier statements. First, Joshua would want to absolve his brother, Joel, from any involvement in the slashing conspiracy. Second, Joshua would also be inclined to shield Anwer, who was from the same secret society as himself. Third, Joshua had admitted in P21 that Zackeer had promised to take care of him once he was released from prison. In my view, Joshua would be fully aware that Zackeer, as a man of substantial means, would be well able to fulfil this promise.

73     I noted further that in his statements, Joshua clearly attempted to absolve his brother Joel, from any involvement in the conspiracy. In P20, when given an opportunity to amend his earlier statement in P19, Joshua claimed that he was the one who approached the victim whilst “Joel was waiting from across the road from where the assault took place.[^90] Joshua was also keen to shield Anwer, who was from the same secret society as himself. Further, I note that in P41, Ramge had stated that Anwer was the headman of the “Ang Kun” gang and was Joshua’s leader. [^91]

74     Finally, in P21, Joshua also stated that after his arrest, whilst he was in the cell beside Zackeer, Zackeer had promised to take care of him once Joshua was released from prisons. Joshua was now made fully aware that Zackeer, being a man of means, was more than capable of keeping his promise.

75     Accordingly, I found that Joshua’s statements in P19 to P21 were voluntarily made and agreed with the Prosecution that full weight should be accorded to the statements. Further, I also rejected Joshua’s oral testimony insofar as it sought to exonerate Zackeer or Anwer.

#### (3)   Ramge’s statement (P41)

76     Ramge’s role was to act as a lookout for Joshua, when the latter attacked the victim. Ramge’s statement lends credence to Joshua’s account that Anwer had directed Joshua to inflict a scar on the victim’s face.

77     However, at trial, Ramge attempted to downplay his role in the conspiracy. He refused to testify that Joshua had informed him that Anwer had directed Joshua to inflict a scar on the victim’s face. Instead, he claimed that the phrase, “_Anwer said one scar on the face will do_”, was added by the statement recorder.[^92] Ramge did not challenge the voluntariness of his statements.

78     I found that the evidence of ASP Tan, the statement recorder, was coherent and credible. Pertinently, ASP Tan had given Ramge the opportunity to amend P41 and Ramge did so. Ramge cancelled two lines in \[2.1\] of his statement.[^93] This indicated that Ramge was not susceptible to ASP Tan’s suggestions. It is also telling that Ramge did not raise any issue with the rest of his statement, except the phrase implicating Anwer. Accordingly, I accorded full weight to Ramge’s statement.

### Issues to be Determined

79     It is undisputed that Joshua had attacked the victim with a knife and had caused injury resulting in a permanent scar on the victim’s face. The primary factual issue to be determined at trial was a narrow one – whether Zackeer was one of the abettors to the conspiracy, and if so, the scope of the conspiracy. In particular:

> (a)     whether Zackeer was the mastermind and financier of the conspiracy;

> (b)     whether the conspiracy was one to slash the victim in the face or only to issue a verbal warning to the victim; and

> (c)     whether the scar of the victim’s face amounted to permanent disfigurement.

### Zackeer was the mastermind and financier of the conspiracy

#### Zackeer was implicated by his co-conspirators and Nasir

80     I accepted the evidence in the statements of Zackeer’s co-conspirators, Anwer and Joshua, that Zackeer was the mastermind of the conspiracy. Anwer stated that Zackeer had approached him to procure an attack on the victim. When Anwer refused to conduct the attack personally, Zackeer had specifically suggested to Anwer to choose Joshua for the job because Joshua was in financial difficulty.[^94] I rejected Zackeer’s evidence that he was not acquainted with Joshua. Joshua had affirmed that Zackeer knew him, as he was a patron of Zam Zam. The fact that Zackeer was aware of Joshua’s financial difficulty and was able to exploit this weakness to his advantage, clearly shows that Zackeer and Joshua were not strangers with each other.

#### Zackeer had promised payment for the job

81     I note that the evidence adduced disclosed that Zackeer had exploited Joshua’s financial difficulty. This clearly indicated that he intended to pay Joshua for the job, once Joshua had completed the job. On 22 August 2015, in Zackeer’s presence, Anwer had called Joshua to ask if Joshua was willing to do the job for $2000. Joshua agreed.[^95] After the attack, Zackeer passed $2000 in cash to Anwer’s employee, who in turned handed the money to Anwer.[^96] Anwer later transferred $1,700 to Joshua’s account.[^97]

82     I turn next to other evidence before the court. There was also contemporaneous objective evidence in the form of WhatsApp messages between Anwer and Joshua. These messages confirmed that Joshua had attacked the victim Ali at Zackeer’s behest for financial reward:

83     In his defence, Zackeer claimed that the sum of $2000 was for Joshua’s hand injury. I rejected Zackeer’s defence. It is abundantly clear from the context of Anwer’s and Joshua’s messages that the sum of $2000 was a promised payment for the attack on the victim. The actual sum of $1,700, which was eventually transferred to Joshua, was due to an initial payment, which Joshua had earlier received for the job.[^98]

84     I pause here to note that it is not disputed that Joshua had suffered a hand injury during the attack on the victim. As such, I find it incredulous that Zackeer would pay a huge sum of money, $2000, for a mere laceration. Further, Joshua’s last message to Anwer in the table above, suggested that Joshua was negotiating for more payment for completion of the job on account of the injury sustained, rather than for the injury _per se_.

85     Finally, it was also Zackeer’s defence that Joshua had acted independently to inflict a slash on the victim’s face. If this were so, Zackeer would have had no obligation at all to pay such an exorbitant sum to Joshua, especially if he had gone off on a frolic of his own. This would be clearly illogical. I therefore rejected this tepid defence.

#### Zackeer closely monitored the progress of the attack

86     Contrary to his denials at trial, Zackeer closely monitored the progress of the attack on the victim. Zackeer was the one who had provided Anwer with information on the victim’s routine at Victory Restaurant. Anwer also worked closely with Navas, an employee of Zam Zam, to obtain the victim’s photograph on behalf of Joshua on 23 August 2015 and 26 August 2015. Navas had previously taken a photograph of the victim on 22 August 2015:

87     Zackeer’s behaviour preceding the attack on the victim indicated that he displayed great personal interest in the progress of the procured attack. Prior to his departure for his business trip to Malaysia on 24 and 25 August 2015, Nasir stated in his statement that Zackeer repeatedly informed Nasir that he would arrange for an attack on the victim.[^99] On 25 August 2015, prior to his return from Malaysia, Anwer stated that Zackeer had called him to check on the progress of the attack. When he discovered that the attack had not been completed as the victim was not at his workplace,[^100] he instructed Anwer to get the job done prior to his return from Malaysia.[^101]

88     Significantly, when Zackeer returned to Zam Zam restaurant on 26 August 2015 at about 3pm, Nasir stated that his first query was whether the victim was at his workplace.[^102] After Nasir confirmed that the victim was present, the messages in paragraph \[86\] above between Anwer and Joshua, clearly showed that Zackeer was pressuring Anwer and Joshua to complete the job the same night. This is also consistent with and explains Joshua purchase of the knife at 8pm at Phoon Huat[^103] and the attack on the victim shortly thereafter. On 27 August 2015, post-attack, Zackeer had confidently informed Nasir that he had arranged for someone to hurt the victim and the assailant was injured.[^104] If Zackeer was not involved in the conspiracy, he would not have had possession of such inside information. The fact that he further instructed Nasir to “act dumb” after disclosing the said information betrays his deep involvement and culpability. Joshua also related in his statement P20, that Zackeer was unhappy at Joshua’s choice of the attack location, for fear that it being a crowded place could lead to Joshua being easily caught and that the conspiracy would then be exposed.[^105]

89     In view of the above, I find that the accounts of Anwer, Joshua and Nasir in their statements were consistent and corroborated each other and also Zackeer’s own behaviour. Further, I accepted that the objective documentary evidence – Zackeer’s ICA records and Anwer’s call records – further corroborated Anwer’s and Joshua’s statements that Zackeer and Anwer were communicating on the progress of the attack between 23 August 2015 and 26 August 2015.[^106]

90     Accordingly, I find that Zackeer was the mastermind and financer of the conspiracy.

### The conspiracy was to slash the victim in the face

91     I also rejected Zackeer’s defence that he had only intended to give a verbal warning to the victim. In my view, there was ample evidence indicating that the object of the conspiracy was to inflict a slash attack on the victim’s face.

#### Zackeer’s instructions were to slash the victim in the face

92     Anwer and Joshua both confirmed that Zackeer’s instructions were to inflict a slash on the victim’s face.[^107] Joshua stated that Anwer’s specific instructions were in Tamil were “_Avan Mnujileh rendu moonu keeru pottaah pothum_” which means, “slash the guy on his face two to three times will be enough.”[^108] For this reason, Joshua stated that he bought a knife in preparation for the attack.

93     Ramge, who was roped in to act as a lookout for Joshua also mentioned in his statement P41 that Joshua had informed him that Anwer’s instructions was “one slash in the face will do.”

94     Finally, there was contemporaneous objective evidence in the WhatsApp messages between Anwer and Joshua on 26 August 2015 confirming that the objective of the conspiracy was to slash the victim in the face:

#### Zackeer’s instructions were aligned to his threat on 22 August 2015

95     Zackeer’s instructions to Anwer and Joshua were very specific. Further and more significantly, the instructions were in line with his earlier threat to “poodu” the victim “within a week”. It was not disputed that the attack was conducted within a period of four days from 23 August 2015 to 26 August 2015. This is significant and most telling conduct on the part of Zackeer.

#### Zackeer’s behaviour upon receiving a photograph of Joshua’s injured hand

96     In evidence before the court, Anwer had stated that after he had taken a picture of Joshua’s injured hand, he had sent the picture to Zackeer. Zackeer’s immediate response was “whose hand was this?” Anwer had replied that the hand was Joshua’s hand.[^109] In my view, Zackeer’s reaction upon receiving the photograph of Joshua’s injured hand is most telling. His reaction clearly implied that he was expecting the injury to be inflicted on the victim’s face – not on the hand.

#### Behaviour of the co-conspirators

97     The behaviour of the co-conspirators, Anwer, Joshua and Ramge also implied that the object of the conspiracy was to inflict a slash on the victim’s face. Anwer initially had refused to do the job personally because he knew that there would be serious consequences if the conspiracy was exposed.[^110] Ramge had expressed his concerns when he asked Joshua if Anwer could be trusted and eventually sought to distance himself from the attack.[^111] Joshua also stated that he only decided to take on the job for monetary reward since he needed the money to pay for his mother’s medical bills.[^112]

98     In view of the above, I rejected Zackeer’s evidence that he intended to only issue a verbal warning to the victim. On the basis of the evidence before the court, I was of the view that the objective of the conspiracy was clearly to inflict a slash on the face of the victim Ali.

### The victim sustained permanent disfigurement

99     It is not disputed that the victim sustained a permanent scar on his face. Counsel for Zackeer however had submitted that a permanent scar does not amount to a permanent facial disfigurement amounting to grievous hurt.[^113]

#### Legal Definition of Grievous Hurt

100    Section 320 (f) of the Penal Code states that “permanent disfigurement of the face” is designated as “grievous hurt”.

#### Medical evidence of Dr Ho

101    I accepted the evidence of Dr Samuel Ho, a specialist doctor in the field of plastic surgery that the laceration on the victim’s face which had healed into a permanent scar, amounts to a permanent disfigurement under the AAOMS guidelines (P43). Dr Ho had examined the victim on 13 October 2016 (P42). Dr Ho explained that in order to be classified under the Class 1 impairment rating, what was required was facial abnormality involving only subcutaneous structures with a highly visible scar and/or abnormal pigmentation. It was not required for the victim’s activities of daily living to be affected. In the present case, the victim sustained both visible scarring and abnormal pigmentation in that his scar was lighter than the surrounding skin.[^114] The criteria for 1% disfigurement was thus met. During cross-examination, Dr Ho confirmed that the victim’s 5 cm depressed scar was permanent. Even with plastic surgery, the scar could only diminish but not disappear.[^115]

#### Medical evidence of Dr Chong

102    On the other hand, I rejected the evidence of the Defence’s expert witness, Dr Chong Wai Yip. First, under cross-examination, Dr Chong agreed with Dr Ho’s classification of the victim’s scar as a 1% disfigurement according to AAOMS guidelines.[^116] Second, unlike Dr Ho, Dr Chong did not obtain the victim’s consent for a proper clinical examination. In fact, he had covertly observed the victim without his consent at his workplace, whilst the victim was in motion and concluded that the victim’s scar was not highly visible. Dr Chong also stated that examining the victim whilst in motion was not ideal for an assessment.[^117] I note that this was actually inconsistent with his own testimony that he could see the victim’s scar from an arm’s length. Finally, in my judgment, Dr Chong’s evidence was clearly lacking in objectivity and was also partisan and contrived. In court, he also stated that he owed a duty of care to his client, Zackeer and Zackeer’s Counsel.[^118] Thus, I find that it is unsafe to rely on Dr Chong’s evidence and his expert opinion. In making this finding, I am guided by the recent case of _Public Prosecutor v Chia Kee Chen and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 249</span> at \[5\], where the Court of Appeal held that:

> …Experts are duty-bound to be neutral and independent, and to assist the court rather than to advocate for a cause in a partisan manner. This remains the case regardless of how sincerely the expert may sympathise with the cause of his client.

103    Having reviewed the evidence of both Dr Ho and Dr Chong, I agreed with the Prosecution that the victim had sustained a permanent scar, which amounts to a permanent disfigurement. Accordingly, I am satisfied that he had sustained grievous hurt pursuant to Section 320 (f) of the Penal Code.

## Verdict

104    Having considered the totality of all the evidence before the court, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt for:

> (a)     the offence under Section 326 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code against both Zackeer and Anwer; and

> (b)     the offence under Section 506 of the Penal Code against Zackeer.

105    Accordingly, I found both accused persons guilty and convicted them of their respective charges.

## Decision on Sentence

### Sentences sought by the Parties

106    The Prosecution sought the following sentences for the accused persons[^119]:

> (a)     Zackeer

>> (i)       Section 326 r/w Section 109, Penal Code – 6 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane; and

>> (ii)       Section 506 (1st limb), Penal Code – 3 months’ imprisonment ( to run concurrently)

> (b)     Anwer

>> (i)       Section 326 r/w Section 109, Penal Code – 5 years and 3 months’ imprisonment (in lieu of caning); and

>> (ii)       Section 14(3) of the Societies Act – 4 months’ imprisonment term (to run consecutively).

107    Defence Counsel for Zackeer sought the following sentences[^120]:

> (a)     Section 326 r/w Section 109, Penal Code – 3 years and 3 months’ imprisonment term; and

> (b)     Section 506 (1st limb), Penal Code – a fine.

108    Defence Counsel for Anwer sought the following sentences[^121]:

> (a)     Section 326 r/w Section 109, Penal Code – 4 years imprisonment; and

> (b)     Section 14(3) of the Societies Act– 2 months’ imprisonment term.

109    Both Zackeer and Anwer had appealed against their sentences.

### Prescribed Punishment

110    An offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon under Section 326 of the Penal Code is punishable with a term of imprisonment, which may extend to 15 years. The offender is also liable for caning or a fine. Pursuant to Section 109 of the Penal Code, the abettor shall be punished with the _same punishment_ as the principal offender. Accordingly, as abettors, Zackeer and Anwer are liable for the same punishment as Joshua, even though they did not personally attack the victim.

### Sentencing principles for co-accused persons:

111    In _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>_ at \[49\], the High Court held that the principle of parity of sentence operates as follows:

> (a)     the starting premise is that co-accused persons who could have been convicted of the same sentence should _ipso facto_ receive the same sentence; and

> (b)     the sentence for each offender may then be calibrated upwards or downwards to account for relevant differences in their respective degrees of responsibility and/or personal circumstances.

112    At the same time, while the principle of parity ensures that the sentencing of co-offenders is broadly consistent and fair, this principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner:

> it is not the law that every co-offender in a common criminal enterprise must be identically charged or sentenced. Rather, the court will have to consider all the circumstances of each case before arriving at the appropriate sentence.

113    In the present case, whilst Zackeer and Anwer did not personally inflict the slash on the victim’s face, they each played an important role in directing the conspiracy as the mastermind and coordinating the conspiracy as the middleman, respectively. Thus, I am of the view that their respective culpabilities are materially determined by their respective roles in the conspiracy.

#### Culpability of Masterminds

114    As a matter of principle, the mastermind of a conspiracy should receive a harsher sentence as compared to his co-conspirators.[^122] The Court of Appeal (“CA”) held in _Public Prosecutor v Chia Kee Chen_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 249</span> at \[137\] that:

> …one who hires an assassin to kill another or who otherwise controls a killer, **cannot be less culpable** than the one who does the killing.

115    Similarly, in _Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kutty v Public Prosecutor_ \[2003\] 1 SLR (R) 617, the CA held at \[58\] that where the accused person is the mastermind of the conspiracy, a harsher sentence meted out on the mastermind is appropriate.

#### Culpability of the Middleman

116    Like masterminds, in _Wang Chin Sing v Public Prosecutor_ \[2009\] 1 SLR (R) 870, V.K. Rajah JA (as he then was) held at \[6\] that “the middleman’s role, as a matter of sentencing policy, \[should\] be accorded prominence”. Whilst the role of a middleman can vary in a conspiracy, the culpability of the middleman hinges on his conduct and the precise role he played in the conspiracy.

### Sentence for the Abetment by Conspiracy charge

#### Adaptation of the sentencing framework in Public Prosecutor v BDB <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>

117    Currently, there is a dearth of precedents for cases involving a procured attack to cause permanent disfigurement to the victim. For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that I have declined to rely on _Public Prosecutor v Lim Hong Liang_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 127</span> as the case is, at the time of writing this judgment, pending appeal. I note further that no sentencing framework has as yet been pronounced by the High Court for offences under Section 326 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.

118    The Prosecution had proposed adapting the sentencing framework set out in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (_“BDB_ sentencing framework_”_), for offences under Section 325 of the Penal Code to the present case. The _BDB_ sentencing framework operates as follows:

> (a)     First, the seriousness of the injury should be considered to derive an indicative starting point or range for sentencing. In doing so, the Court should have regard to considerations such as the nature and permanence of the injury (“Step 1”); and

> (b)     Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider any necessary adjustments based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors (“Step 2”)**.**

#### Limitations of the BDB sentencing framework

119    Given that the inherent mischief underlying an offence under Section 325 of the Penal Code is grievous hurt, the factor which guides the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing is the seriousness of the hurt caused to the victim. The nature of the weapon used does not appear to feature in this framework, though it may be considered an aggravating factor in Step 2.

120    Further, any adaptations to the BDB sentencing framework should also take into account –

> (a)     the wider sentencing range prescribed for an offence under Section 326 of the Penal Code;

> (b)     the gravamen of the charge is the danger posed by the weapon or means utilised, in addition to the grievous hurt caused; and

> (c)     care should be taken to avoid double counting the use of the weapon in Step 2.

#### Application of the BDB framework to Section 326 Penal Code offences

121    The _BDB_ framework has been applied to an offence under Section 326 of the Penal Code in _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Faizal bin Mohamed Salleh_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 115</span> (“_Faizal_”). The District Judge had extrapolated the following starting points:

![]([2020] SGDC 0138_Image/[2020] SGDC 0138_image3.png)

122    Having considered the injuries sustained by the victim and the length of her hospitalisation, the District Judge made a _value judgment_ of an indicative starting point of 4 years. In imposing an uplift of 1 years’ imprisonment, the District Judge took into account “the sudden attack on the victim with a knife”. In addition, 8 strokes of cane was also imposed to give effect to the retributive principle and in light of the fact that a knife had been used.

#### Adapting the BDB sentencing framework to Section 326 r/w Section 109 Penal Code offences

123    The Prosecution had proposed a sentencing framework based on the _BDB_ sentencing framework as adapted in _Faizal’s_ case, and had applied the said proposed framework in assessing Joshua’s sentence to be 5 years and 6 strokes of the cane. Thereafter, the Prosecution had applied the principle of parity enunciated in _Chong Han Rui_, and proposed sentences for Zackeer and Anwer, in accordance with their respective culpabilities. The proposed sentences are set out above in paragraph \[106\].

124    Given that pursuant to Section 109 of the Penal Code, the abettors to a conspiracy face the same punishment as the principal offender, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the _BDB sentencing framework_ as adapted in _Faizal_ can be adapted for use in determining the appropriate sentence for abettors.

#### (1)   Injury sustained (Step 1)

125    Applying the BDB sentencing framework as adapted in _Faizal_ to the present case, in my judgment, for Step 1, the indicative starting sentence of 5 years imprisonment term is appropriate because of the permanence of the injury sustained. The victim had sustained a 5 cm depressed upper lip scar traversing the vermillion border, which constitutes 1% disfigurement according to AAOMS guidelines. Dr Ho had testified that the scar was permanent and was unlikely to improve with appearance, even with plastic surgery. On the other hand, whilst the victim in _Faizal_ had sustained multiple lacerations, she did not sustain any permanent disfigurement.

#### (2)   Culpability of Zackeer and Anwer (Step 2)

126    For the avoidance of doubt, in assessing Zackeer’s and Anwer’s culpability, I declined to apply the adapted _BDB_ sentencing framework to Joshua’s sentence, as suggested by the Prosecution. First, Joshua’s sentence is an unreported decision and no grounds of decision were released. Second, it appears from the court papers that Joshua’s sentence was determined based on the prevailing sentencing precedents at the time of Joshua’s sentencing mention. As Joshua had received his sentence prior to the case outcomes in _BDB_ and _Faizal_, it would be inappropriate to re-apply the _BDB_ sentencing framework to a sentence that has already been meted out.

(A)   Zackeer

127    As the mastermind and as a matter of principle, Zackeer’s sentence should be higher as compared to the sentence imposed for Joshua. I therefore disagreed with the Defence’s submission which is based on the sentences meted out to the principal offenders. My reasons are as follows. First, there was a high degree of pre-meditation involved. Zackeer had orchestrated the attack with specific instructions to inflict a slash on the face of the victim Ali. The entire affair was well-coordinated and completed within a week, to give effect to an earlier threat in which Zackeer had threatened Ali “..._in one week, I will do you_.”

128    Second, there was also difficulty in detecting the offence. As the mastermind, Zackeer was one-step removed from Joshua, the principal offender, who had attacked the victim. Joshua, who was hired for the job, was a complete stranger to the victim. I therefore accepted the Prosecution’s submission that in these circumstances, extensive police investigations were required to uncover the conspiracy.

129    Third, I also agree with the Prosecution that there was general public disquiet. Zam Zam and Victory restaurants are household names in Singapore. Further, this case has its origins in business rivalry. The fact that Zackeer, the owner of Zam Zam, could have blatantly hired a thug to target an employee of his business competitor, would have created a deep sense of unease among the general public. The deliberate procurement of a violent criminal act, especially involving grievous hurt with a weapon for financial reward, must be deterred and strongly discouraged.

130    Fourth, in determining the appropriate uplift, I have considered that a knife was used as a weapon of choice to cause disfigurement to the face of the victim. I am guided by the principle set out in _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> at \[15\] that an appropriate uplift takes into consideration the means used (weapon of choice) and the manner in which the attack was carried out. Accordingly, I am of the view that an uplift of 1 years’ imprisonment is appropriate.

131    Finally, whilst I am mindful that the present offence is Zackeer’s first violence related offence, I agreed with the Prosecution that his conduct during the course of committing the offence and also at trial, indicates his utter lack of remorse. Applying the retributive principle, I impose an additional 6 strokes of cane. Thus, Zackeer’s sentence for the offence under Section 326 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code is _6 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane._

(B)   Anwer

132    The Defence had submitted for a sentence of 4 years imprisonment for Anwer. No precedents had been provided however to support its submission. Essentially, the Defence submitted that Anwer was less culpable than Joshua because Anwer’s violence related antecedents were few and dated. Anwer also did not benefit financially through his assistance.

133    As the middleman and as a matter of sentencing principle, Anwer’s sentence should be accorded “prominence” in accordance with the role he played in the conspiracy. In light of the victim’s injury, an indicative starting sentence of 5 years is appropriate.

134    At the outset, I pause here to note that there are presently few sentencing precedents relating to the culpability of a middle-man role in a conspiracy to cause grievous hurt with a weapon.

135    As such, I was compelled to take guidance from the recent decision in _Public Prosecutor v Lim De Mai Ron_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 96</span> (“_Lim De Mai Ron_”). Ron had pleaded guilty to an offence under Section 326 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to a 36 months’ imprisonment term and 4 strokes of the cane for his role as a middleman for his uncle, Lim Hong Liang. Ron’s sentence was significantly lower as compared to the principal offender, Irwan, who had conducted the attack. In meting out sentence, the District Judge considered that Ron’s sentence should be lower than Irwan’s given that Ron had no previous convictions and was not the perpetrator who had attacked the victim. However, at \[47\] of the decision, the District Judge also gave significant weight to the highly premeditated nature of the attack by a paid hitman and also Ron’s role in arranging the attack.

136    In my view, the present case should be distinguished from _Lim De Mai Ron_ in terms of the extent to which Anwer had facilitated the conspiracy. Ron’s role as a middle man was limited to acting as a go-between for his uncle, Lim Hong Liang and a known thug, Ong. He was a mere conduit who conveyed Lim Hong Liang’s instructions to Ong and who paid the thugs who carried out the attack.

137    On the other hand, Anwer had played an active and crucial role in coordinating the attack on behalf of Zackeer. First, he actively assisted to obtain a photograph of the victim from Zackeer’s employee Navas. He also had conveyed to Joshua, Zackeer’s specific instructions to inflict a slash on the victim’s face. Second, at Zackeer’s behest, Anwer had pressured Joshua to complete the job on 26 August 2015. Third, he had no qualms in exploiting Joshua’s financial difficulty. Fourth, he had assisted Joshua to negotiate for a higher payment amount for the completed job in the light of Joshua’s injury. Fifth, whilst I agree with the Defence’s submission that Anwer did not receive any direct financial benefit from the conspiracy, I am of the view that Anwer had indirectly benefited from the conspiracy. Critically, Anwer had agreed to participate in the conspiracy because Zackeer was funding his failing restaurant business at the material time. Finally, whilst I agree that Anwer’s violence related antecedents were few and dated, in my judgment, in light of his role in the conspiracy, his culpability is much higher as compared to Ron. All things considered, I am of the view that a sentence of _5 years’ imprisonment and 3 months (in lieu of caning)_ is appropriate.

### Sentence for Zackeer’s Criminal Intimidation charge

138    Where threats relate to aggravated forms of intimidation, the usual sentences for an offence under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code ranges from a 2 months to 6 months imprisonment term.

139    Whilst an offence under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code is also punishable with a fine, I declined to accept the Defence’s submission that a fine was appropriate in the present case.

140    First, Zackeer’s threat to the victim conveyed his intention to cause bodily harm to the victim. As explained in \[29\], the Tamil word, “poodu” means “to hit or to kill” in English.

141    Second, this threat was not a mere empty threat. The victim was put in fear after he was being followed by Joshua on 23 August 2015, one day after the threat was uttered. In fact, the victim was so fearful that he had even armed himself with a knife for self-defence. The threat was eventually carried out on 26 August 2015, four days after the threat was made and within a week, as Zackeer had promised. Accordingly, in my judgment, the custodial threshold had been crossed.

142    On the other hand, I disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a 3-month imprisonment term was appropriate. I have carefully reviewed the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents and the Criminal Intimidation charge preferred against Zackeer. A distinguishing feature of the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents was that the offenders wielded a weapon (a knife and a chopper) when uttering the threat. This aggravating factor is absent in the present case.

#### Sentencing precedents

143    Generally, the sentencing precedents suggest that where the threat made involves disfigurement of the victim’s face, a sentence of at least 1 month imprisonment is appropriate:

> (a)     In _Lim Pang Howe Harry v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 76</span> (“_Lim Pang Howe Harry_”), the offender was convicted after trial of two charges, one of which was a charge under Section 506 (1st limb), Cap 224. In the course of a dispute over relationship issues, the offender took a knife and threatened to disfigure the victim’s face. The threat was eventually not carried out. On appeal, the offender’s sentence was reduced from 4 months’ imprisonment to a 1 month imprisonment term.

> (b)     Similarly, in _Roger Stevenson Morgan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 92</span> (“_Morgan_”), the offender had pleaded guilty to an offence under Section 506 (1st limb), Cap 224. In the course of a business dispute, the offender had threatened to pay a Bangladeshi worker to splash acid on the victim’s face. The threat was eventually not carried out. In giving his reasons for meting out a sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment, the District Judge stated at \[7\] that:

>> The mental image of the severe burns that may be caused that is the splashing of acid on a person is one of horrific physical disfigurement and excruiating pain and suffering of a long-lasting kind…by specifying the face as the intended focus of the acid attack, it alluded to the horrendous injuiries that would be caused to such a vital and visible part of the victim’s person…the accused heightened the level of alarm his threat may cause…the punishment must of necessity reflect the stand that such acts cannot be tolerated so as to deter the accused from re-offending and to deter others from following in the accused’s footsteps.

144    In the present case, whilst Zackeer had threatened the victim with violence, he did not use any weapon when uttering the threat, albeit his behaviour was aggressive. However, unlike the above-mentioned precedents, Zackeer’s threat was not an empty one. In fact, it formed the blueprint for a later more serious offence of causing grievous hurt with a weapon to the victim.

145    Accordingly, I am of the view that a sentence of _2 months’ imprisonment_ is appropriate.

### Sentence for Anwer’s Societies Act charges

146    After the trial had concluded, Anwer had pleaded guilty to a charge under Section 14(3) of the Societies Act. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.

147    The sentencing benchmark for a senior member of a secret society of fighter rank is at least 3 months’ imprisonment term. I disagreed however with the Prosecution’s submission that a 4 month imprisonment term was appropriate, on account of the length of time in which the offender remained a secret society member:

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v Tui Chin Wee_ (SC-907127-2018) (unreported), the offender had pleaded guilty to a proceeded charge under Section 14(3) of the Societies Act. Two other similar counts were taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender was the co-accused of _Kwang Yeow Kit (SC-908843-2018_). The offender was recruited as a Senior member of the “Pek Kim Leng” secret society and had been a member for about 17 years since 2001. The offender led a group of secret society members who chanted secret society slogans and had thrown two glasses at patrons. The offender had tattoos signifying his allegiance to the secret society. He shouted “_108 Pek Kim Leng!”_, which is a slogan referring to the secret society. The chanting of the said slogan and tattoos are common ways for members of the secret society to flaunt their gang affiliations and to intimidate others who are aware of the significance of these practices. The offender admitted that he participated in the said practices, as he wanted to glorify the secret society. The actions of the group were captured on social media. The offender was traced with unrelated antecedents. He was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment on the proceeded charge; and

> (b)     In _Public Prosecutor v Kwang Yeow Kit_ (SC-908843-2018) (unreported), the offender pleaded guilty to a proceeded charge under Section 14(3) of the Societies Act. Two other similar counts were taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender also pleaded guilty to one count under Section 336 (a), Penal Code. The offender was the co-accused of _Tui Chin Wee (SC-907127-2018)._ The offender was recruited as a Senior member of the “Pek Kim Leng” secret society and had been a member for about 17 years since 2001. The offender led a group of secret society members who chanted secret society slogans such as “108 Pek Kim Leng!”, “1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 brother from 108”, and “Leng ah Leng, Pek Kim Leng”. The chanting of the said slogans was a common way for members of the secret society to flaunt their gang affiliation and to intimidate others who were aware of the significance of these practices. The offender admitted that he had participated in the said practice as he wanted to glorify the secret society. The actions of the group were captured on social media. The offender was traced with unrelated antecedents. He was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment on the proceeded charge.

148    In the decisions of _Tui Chin Wee_ and _Kwang Yeow Kit_, it was observed that a four-month imprisonment term was imposed as the offenders had actively declared their secret society affiliations as senior members of the “Pek Kim Leng” secret society for the purpose of flaunting their gang affiliation to intimidate others who were aware of these practices. Both offenders further admitted that their motive was to glorify their secret society. To make matters worse, the incident was captured on social media platforms. On the other hand, Anwer’s case should be distinguished from Tui Chin Wee and Kwang Yeow Kit. Apart from the fact that Anwer had been a secret society member for a longer period (25 years), there was no indication in the Statement of Facts that Anwer had openly and actively declared his secret society affiliations with the intention to intimidate others with his affiliations.

149    Accordingly, I am of the view that a sentence of _3 months’ imprisonment_ would be fair and appropriate.

## Global Sentences imposed

150    Having carefully considered the parties’ sentencing submissions, I imposed the following sentences on both accused persons as follows:

> (a)      **Zackeer**:

>> (i)       Section 326 r/w Section 109, Cap 224 –6 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane

>> (ii)       Section 506 (1st limb), Cap 224 – 2 months’ imprisonment (to run concurrently);

>> (iii)        Global sentence: 6 years and 6 strokes of the cane.

> (b)      **Anwer**

>> (i)       Section 326 r/w Section 109 , Cap 224 - 5 years and 3 months’ imprisonment;

>> (ii)       Section 14(3), Societies Act – 3 months’ imprisonment term (to run consecutively)

>> (iii)        Global sentence: 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment term

## Conclusion

151    The deliberate act of hiring a hit man for financial reward to procure a violent criminal attack, with the intention to cause permanent disfigurement to another person is a reprehensible act. Such heinous conduct causes public disquiet, especially in the context of a longstanding business rivalry amongst two well-known restaurants. Pernicious conduct of such a nature, if not quickly eradicated, may even be doubly insidious and further encourage organised crime, where hired thugs with links to secret societies (such as in the case of Anwer and Joshua), become willing pawns of criminal masterminds, when the price is right.

152    Having carefully considered the totality of all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case against both accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt. A conviction against both accused persons cannot therefore be said to be unsafe. Accordingly, I find the accused persons Zackeer and Anwer guilty of their respective charges and convict them accordingly.

153    In terms of sentence, for the above-mentioned reasons, in my judgment, the sentences meted out to the accused persons have been calibrated with sufficient care to ensure a just and proportionate punishment, in light of the compelling public interest to stem out procured attacks motivated by financial reward. In the final analysis, the sentences are not crushing for the accused persons and are in keeping with their past record and future prospects.
