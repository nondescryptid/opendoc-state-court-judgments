### District Judge Clement Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff claimed against the Defendants for breach of contract in connection with the sale and purchase of a Toyota HiAce Commuter GL 2.7A bearing registration number SKC1131C (the "**Vehicle**"). Specifically, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants failed to effect full transfer of title and ownership of the Vehicle to it, including by failing to ensure that the Plaintiff’s ownership interests could be registered in the Land Transport Authority’s (“**LTA**”) records, notwithstanding the full payment of the purchase price by the Plaintiff.

2       The Vehicle was owned by the 2nd Defendant and sold by the 1st Defendant on a consignment basis. At the time of the sale, the Vehicle was under financing by the Third Party. The Defendants denied that they had breached the terms of the sales agreement. In the alternative, the Defendants argued that their failure to effect transfer of title to the Vehicle, if any, was caused solely by the acts and/or defaults of the Third Party. In the event the Defendants were found liable to the Plaintiff, the Defendants sought an indemnity or contribution from the Third Party.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Defendants liable to the Plaintiff for failing to transfer full legal and beneficial ownership of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff. However, I found that the failure was caused by the third party in wrongfully failing to lodge a HPFLAS Form B (see below) to confirm that the Vehicle was no longer under any financing despite having received full payment of the outstanding sums under the hire purchase agreement. The third party was therefore liable to indemnify the Defendants for the damages and costs they were found to be liable to the Plaintiff.

4       The Third Party is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed the present appeal. The Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants did not file any cross-appeal.

## The parties

5       The Plaintiff, Toh Beng Hock (Zhuo Mingfu) t/a V-Tech Auto Service (the “**Plaintiff**” or “**PW1**”), is a sole proprietorship in the business of the repair and maintenance of motor vehicles, and the provision of passenger land transport.

6       The 1st Defendant, San Hup Bee (S) Pte Ltd (the “**1st Defendant**”), is a Singapore registered company. The 1st Defendant is in the business of purchase and sale of motor cars. The 1st Defendant sold vehicles they had purchased from third-parties in their own names, as well as other vehicles on behalf of third-parties on a consignment basis. The sole director and shareholder of the 1st Defendant is one Jaxon Toh Jun Sheng (“**Jaxon**” or “**DW2**”).

7       The 2nd Defendant, San Hup Bee Motor LLP (the “**2nd Defendant**”), is a Singapore registered limited liability partnership. The 2nd Defendant is also in the business of the purchase and sale of motor cars. The partners of the 2nd Defendant are one Mr. Toh See Leong and one Doris Chan Yun Zhen (“**Doris**” or “**DW1**”). Mr. Toh See Leong and Doris are the parents of Jaxon.

8       Mr. Toh See Leong was also the sole director and shareholder of another Singapore registered company called San Hup Bee Motoring Pte Ltd (“**SHB Motoring**”). Mr. Toh See Leong passed away in 2018.

9       The Third Party, Auto Lease Pte Ltd (“**Third Party**” or “**Auto Lease**”), is a Singapore registered company. The Third Party is a finance company and is primarily in the business of granting hire-purchase loans for the financing of vehicles.

## Background Facts

### The sale and purchase of the Vehicle

10     On or about 9 March 2018, the Defendants agreed to sell, and the Plaintiff agreed to purchase, the Vehicle at the price of $52,200 (the “**Purchase Price**”). A copy of the sales agreement dated 9 March 2018 (the “**Sales Agreement**”) entered into between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff is annexed at the Bundle of Affidavits (“**BA**”) at pages 10-11. It was not disputed that the Vehicle was sold on a consignment basis by the 1st Defendant for the 2nd Defendant.

11     It was further undisputed that the 2nd Defendant was the owner of the Vehicle at the material time of the sale, and that there was outstanding financing on the Vehicle in the amount of $49,200.86.

12     The Vehicle was financed by the Third Party, a financing company, under a Hire Purchase Agreement dated 29 September 2016 between the 2nd Defendant and the Third Party (the “**Hire Purchase Agreement**”)[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The Third Party was the only party in these proceedings that was a member of the Hire Purchase Finance and Leasing Association of Singapore (“**HPFLAS**”). Both the Plaintiff and the Defendants were not members of HPFLAS and were not privy to the workings of HPFLAS or any of their systems.

13     Given that the 2nd Defendant was the owner of the Vehicle, and the 1st Defendant was selling the Vehicle on the 2nd Defendant’ behalf on a consignment basis (_i.e._ as an agent), it might have been more accurate to regard the sale of the Vehicle as being between the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant based on agency principles. However, in both the pleadings and in the closing submissions, the circumstances surrounding, and the terms of, the agency relationship, if any, was never addressed by the parties. In fact, the parties proceeded on the basis that the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant were joint sellers of the Vehicle. Without the benefit of submissions by the parties on the agency issue, I shall for the purposes of these grounds of decision similarly treat the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant as joint sellers of the Vehicle when analyzing the issues and dispute between the parties. Nothing turned on whether the seller was the 2nd Defendant solely, or the Defendants jointly, given that the 1st Defendant was always acting on the 2nd Defendant’s behalf in the sale.

### The payment of the Purchase Price

14     Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the Plaintiff placed an initial deposit of $1,000 in cash with the 1st Defendant. As legal title of the Vehicle was held by the 2nd Defendant and the Vehicle was under financing by the Third-Party, the 1st Defendant requested the Plaintiff to make the cheque for the balance sums directly to the Third-Party. The remaining $51,200 was paid by the Plaintiff in the following manner:

> (a)     $1,999.14 by way of a cheque to the 1st Defendant; and

> (b)     $49,200.86 by way of a cheque to Third Party (the “**Balance Vehicle Financing Amount**”).

15     It was not disputed that the Third Party received $49,200.86, being the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount, and issued an official receipt dated 15 March 2018 to the 2nd Defendant with voucher no. RV201803-0230. The official receipt (the “**Receipt**”) bore the description “_SKC1131C – HP Loan Full Settlement for Toyota HiAce Commuter GL2.7A_”[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

16     In accordance with the Sales Agreement, the Plaintiff collected the Vehicle on or about 14 March 2018 from the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant also provided Plaintiff with the Transaction Pin and an endorsed LTA M01 Application form which were required to effect a transfer of ownership on LTA’s records to the Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant also sent a letter to the Third Party requesting the Third Party to release the Vehicle Registration Card and all relevant documents to the Plaintiff to allow the transfer of the ownership of the Vehicle to be effected.

17     Notwithstanding the receipt of the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount from the Plaintiff, the Third Party did not release a HPFLAS Form B confirming that the Vehicle was no longer under financing.

18     On or round 15 March 2018, the Plaintiff proceeded to effect transfer of the ownership and/or title of the Vehicle with the LTA, but was unsuccessful.

19     The Plaintiff sought the Defendants’ assistance, but continued to be unable to effect transfer of the ownership and/or title of the Vehicle on the LTA system to itself. The Plaintiff thereafter discovered that the Vehicle was still under financing by the Third Party as there was some remaining debt owed by the 2nd Defendant to the Third Party. This arose as the Third Party had attributed only $35,899.86 of the $49,200.86 received by the Third Party from the Plaintiff towards the Hire Purchase Agreement, with the balance sum of $13,301 being used by the Third Party to pay off a separate debt owed by SHB Motoring, a separate entity, to the Third Party. A sum of $13,301 therefore remained unpaid under the Hire Purchase Agreement. The Third Party accordingly held back the release of Form B, which was a necessary requirement for the transfer of ownership with LTA.

20     It was undisputed that although the Plaintiff had possession of the Vehicle since 14 March 2018, ownership of the Vehicle on LTA’s records was only transferred to the Plaintiff on or about 20 November 2020. The Vehicle was then sold by the Plaintiff on 20 February 2021 at a price of $25,000.

## Plaintiff’s case

21     The Plaintiff’s case was that having paid the Purchase Price in full, it was entitled to the legal title and/or ownership of the Vehicle, and to have the same duly reflected in LTA’s records. The Defendants had, however, neglected to ensure that all encumbrances over the Vehicle were removed so that legal title and/or ownership of the Vehicle could be duly transferred to the Plaintiff, including on LTA’s records.

22     According to the Plaintiff, the inability to transfer ownership of the Vehicle in LTA’s records was due to the Defendants’ failure to discharge the financing over the Vehicle in full. This resulted in the financing company (the Third Party) refusing to lodge form B under HPFLAS.

23     The Plaintiff averred that it was deprived of the benefit and the rental income of the Vehicle, and had suffered losses as a result of the Defendants’ breach of the Sales Agreement. In particular, the Plaintiff asserted that its purpose of purchasing the Vehicle was to rent it out for rental income. The Plaintiff stated that at the time of purchase of the Vehicle, it had already secured a ready customer (the “**ready customer**”) for the Vehicle who was prepared to lease the Vehicle for two years at $2,500 per month (the “**Alleged Lease**”). However, as the Plaintiff was not registered as the legal owner of the Vehicle on LTA’s records, it was unable to procure insurance for the Vehicle, and consequently could not proceed with the Alleged Lease.

24     The Plaintiff further averred that while it had possession of the Vehicle since 14 March 2018, it was unable to put the Vehicle to use for 31 months before the Vehicle was transferred to it in LTA’s records in November 2020. The Plaintiff claimed damages for loss of rental at the rate of $2,500 for 24 months (the period of the Alleged Lease), and thereafter at $2,355[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) for the balance 7 months, yielding a total amount of $76,485.

25     Alternatively, the Plaintiff submitted that if the court found that rental losses had not been adequately proven, the Plaintiff asked the court to award damages for loss of use based on the NIMA Benchmark Rates for Costs of Rental and Loss of Use as set out in Appendix F of the State Courts Practice Directions (the “**Appendix F Rates**”). Based on the engine capacity of the Vehicle, the loss of use rate per day is between $100-120. Using the mid-point of $110 per day of the benchmark rates, damages for loss of use would be $3,300 per month ($110 x 30 days). The total damages for loss of use over a 31-month period would be $102,300. As the damages for loss of use were significantly higher compared to loss of rental, the Plaintiff submitted that damages should be computed based on loss of rental, _i.e._ at $76,485.

## The Defendants’ case

26     The Defendants denied any liability to the Plaintiff. The Defendants put forward a joint Defence in which they averred as follows.

27     The Defendants first argued that the Plaintiff had not demonstrated how the Defendants had breached the Sales Agreement. The Defendants contended that the Plaintiff had failed to prove that the provision of the Transaction Pin and the M01 form were insufficient to transfer ownership of the Vehicle on LTA’s records. The Plaintiff also failed to point to any specific breaches of duties by the Defendants under the Sales Agreement, save to claim that as title to the Vehicle had not been transferred on LTA’s records, the Defendants must therefore have been in breach of the Sales Agreement.

28     The Defendants further argued that they had done all they could to effect transfer of title to the Vehicle. Specifically, the Defendants argued at the material time of the transfer attempted in March 2018, all that was required to transfer title to the Vehicle on LTA’s records were a Transfer Pin and a duly completed M01 form, both of which had been duly furnished to the Plaintiff. The transfer could then be done by the buyer or the seller. By PW1’s own testimony, the transfer was effected by his clerk, whom PW1 had failed to call as a witness at the trial. Accordingly, the Defendants contended that the Plaintiff had failed to prove that it had taken all proper steps to effect the transfer of ownership in LTA’s records.

29     Alternatively, the Defendants contended that the failure to effect transfer was caused solely by the Third Party. As mentioned, the Third Party was the only party in the present Suit who was a member of HPFLAS, and privy to the workings of HPFLAS. The services available to the Third Party as a member of HPFLAS included the ability to lodge a “**Form A**” to demonstrate the filer’s interest in a vehicle under financing. The Third Party, having previously financed the acquisition of the Vehicle by the 2nd Defendant pursuant to the Hire Purchase Agreement, had earlier lodged a Form A over the Vehicle. The net effect of the lodgment of a Form A with HPFLAS on any vehicle was that any subsequent transaction to transfer the title to the next owner in LTA’s records would be stopped. A “**Form B**”, which discharges the Form A lodged on the vehicle in question, had to be lodged by the finance company when financing over the vehicle had been fully paid off before the Vehicle could be transferred to a next owner under the LTA system.

30     The Defendants argued that there was no basis for Auto Lease to withhold the lodging of a Form B when Auto Lease had received the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount of $49,200.86 in full from the Plaintiff at the Defendants’ instructions. Indeed, the director of the Third Party, one Anthony Lim (“**TPW1**”), confirmed during cross-examination that the Third Party had received the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) and had issued a Receipt in respect thereof to the 2nd Defendant[^5]. In this regard, the Third Party confirmed they had used part of the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount received to pay off the debts owed by an unrelated entity of the Defendants, SHB Motoring, to Auto Lease[^6].

31     It was the Defendants’ case that Auto Lease had no legal basis to apply all or any part of the $49,200.86 received from the Plaintiff to pay down the debts owed by SHB Motoring, an unrelated entity, to the Third Party. Had the Third Party applied the $49,200.86 in discharge of the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount as it ought to, the financing of the Vehicle would have been completely discharged and the lodgment of a Form B would have followed. By wrongfully using part of the payment amounts to pay off the debt of SHB Motoring, and thereafter refusing to lodge a Form B over the Vehicle, the Third Party had thereby wrongfully prevented the transfer of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff on LTA’s records.

32     The Defendants contended that Plaintiff discovered the above when the Plaintiff spoke to LTA to seek their assistance in transferring title of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff. LTA indicated to the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff had to ask Auto Lease to release the HPFLAS Form B, failing which LTA would not be able to effect the transfer. The Plaintiff was thus aware that the hold up in the transfer was due to Auto Lease’s neglect in filing the Form B, and that the Defendants had provided the Plaintiff with all the documents they could to effect the transfer.

33     The Defendants next argued that even if the Plaintiff could prove that the Defendants should be liable for failure to transfer title of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff had not suffered any losses. In particular, the Plaintiff had not proven that it was intending to use the Vehicle for the purpose of rental. Crucially, there was no evidence before the court that Plaintiff was intending to rent out the Vehicle, nor that it had a ready customer who was willing to rent the Vehicle at $2,500 for two years as alleged by the Plaintiff[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). In fact, PW1 had driven the Vehicle and not disclosed the same. This was only discovered when the 2nd Defendant received a Road Traffic Act request for particulars due to a traffic violation[^8]. The Defendants posited that Plaintiff had no intentions of renting out the Vehicle, and had in fact utilized the Vehicle for his own use.

34     The Defendants also argued that even if Plaintiff had suffered any loss, it had failed to present adequate evidence in support of the quantum of damages claimed. There was no documentary proof adduced by the Plaintiff to show that it could have rented out the Vehicle at all to a “ready” customer, or could otherwise have been able to enjoy any rental proceeds given the circuit breaker during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Plaintiff called one Lee Kok Wai, William (“**PW2**”, or “**Mr. William Lee**”) to support its case that the Vehicle could have been rented out at between $2,500 to $2,700 per month. Mr. William Lee was, however, not an expert witness, and hence his testimony was inadmissible opinion evidence. No other credible evidence to prove the rental value of the Vehicle were adduced by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had further failed to mitigate its losses by leaving the Vehicle idle for more than two years.

35     In the event that the Plaintiff’s claims were borne out to any degree, the Defendants asserted that any failure to transfer the title of the Vehicle to Plaintiff was attributable solely to the acts of Auto Lease, the third-party in these proceedings. Specifically, the Third Party had issued the Receipt stating that full payments outstanding under the Hire Purchase Agreement had been received. However, the Third Party then refused to lodge and/or release Form B to prove that the Vehicle was no longer under financing. This in turn prevented the transfer of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff on LTA’s records. In the premises, the Defendants claimed against the Third Party a contribution or indemnity for all losses that the Defendants might be held liable to the Plaintiff.

## Third Party’s case

36     The Third Party’s case was that neither the Plaintiff nor the Defendants had proven that they had made any attempts to transfer the Vehicle during the entire period of time, with the only attempt being made on or around 30 November 2020, which had resulted in a successful transfer of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff.

37     In relation to the Plaintiff, the Third Party adopted the Defendants’ defence that Plaintiff had not shown that all necessary steps to transfer the Vehicle to the Plaintiff had been taken. In relation to the Defendants, the Third Party contended that the Defendants had similarly made no attempts as the registered owner to transfer the Vehicle on the LTA system. Given that it was the Plaintiff and the Defendants’ case that the Vehicle could not be transferred due to a Form A lodged on the Vehicle, the burden of proof lay on the Plaintiff and the Defendants to prove that this was in fact the cause of the inability to transfer ownership on LTA’s records. The Third Party argued that the existence of a Form A was not an impediment to the transfer of the Vehicle on the LTA system.

38     In this regard, the Third Party relied on the express terms of the HPFLAS Code of Conduct (“**HPFLAS Code**”) which suggested that the Form A would not have prevented a transfer of the registration of the Vehicle on the LTA system. The material portions of the HPFLAS Code were as follows:

> “1.1

> …

> (z) “VRLS Transactions” means the following Transactions which are carried out through the VRLS, namely:

>> (i)    online application to transfer ownership of the vehicle …..

> ….

> 5.3    When a member of the public purports to carry out a VRLS Transaction, VRLS will cause a search of the HPFLAS System to determine if a Form A, Pending Form A or Temporary Form A has been lodged in respect of the relevant vehicle.

> 5.4     _The lodgement of a Form A in the vehicle database will temporarily prevent the VRLS Transactions from being carried out and subject to the resolution procedure specified in Clause 7_. …..

> …..

> **7**.     **Procedure when VRLS Transaction Attempted for Vehicle Under Financing**

> ………

> 7.2    If the search made by the LTA on the HPFLAS System reflects that a vehicle is still under hire-purchase financing, then _the LTA will immediately alert HPFLAS of the VRLS Transaction via post and/or email through the HPFLAS System setting out the details of such VRLS Transaction_.

> 7.3    Once the HPFLAS System receives such an alert from the LTA, it will self-generate an alert and _forward such alert by email to the relevant Member_.

> 7.4     _The relevant Member who wishes to request the LTA to reject any future VRLS Transactions shall follow the LTA's prescribed procedure_ **_and submit an original, duly completed and signed Deed of Indemnity_** _….._ within the LTA's prescribed timeframe, to the LTA….., and comply with any other requirement prescribed by the LTA including without limitation the provision of a security deposit in the form of the Banker's Guarantee or cashier's order prescribed…...”

**……**

**Annex B**

> **Lodgement and Discharge Procedure**

> 2.2     Initial Suspension. If a Member has lodged a **Form A or Temporary Form A** in the HPFLAS System, the LTA will **TEMPORARILY** suspend the VRLS Transaction from taking place. The temporary suspension is _for an initial period of 5 calendar days._

> 2.3     No Steps Taken. _Within the 5-day period_, the Member who lodged the Form A must take active steps if the Member wants to extend the suspension period _otherwise the VRLS Transactions will be permitted to go through after the 5 days_ and the Form A or Temporary Form A will be discharged or deleted by HPFLAS accordingly.

> _(emphasis added)_

39     The Third Party asserted that, it was clear from the express wordings of the HPFLAS Code that a Form A would, at most, cause a temporary blockage of the VRLS Transaction (for five days at first instance), subject to the resolution procedure set out in the HPFLAS Code. Clause 7 of the HPFLAS Code further stated the transfer of the Vehicle after five calendar days would not have been prevented by the Form A unless the Third Party had taken the steps prescribed in the HPFLAS Code (_e.g._ by making a request supported by a signed Deed of Indemnity) to reject any future transactions. The Third Party had not taken any such steps in the present case.

40     The Third Party argued that the fact that the Vehicle was subsequently successfully transferred by the Defendants to the Plaintiff in LTA’s system on or around 30th November 2020, and that the Vehicle was subsequently successfully sold by the Plaintiff, showed that there was never an issue with the transfer of the Vehicle in the first place.

41     Based on the foregoing, the Third Party argued that it was not responsible for the failure to transfer ownership of the Vehicle in the LTA system in the first instance.

## Issues

42     Having reviewed the pleadings and closing submissions of the parties, the issues that arose for consideration in the present case were the following:

> As between Plaintiff and Defendants

> (a)     Was it a term of the Sales Agreement that the Defendants were under an absolute obligation to transfer title and ownership of the Vehicle (including on the LTA records) to the Plaintiff free from encumbrances?

> (b)     If so, did the Defendants breach their obligations under the Sales Agreement by failing to cause Plaintiff to be registered as the owner of the Vehicle in the LTA records? This encompassed the sub issues of: (i) whether the delay in transfer was due to any default or inaction on the part of the Plaintiff itself; and (ii) if not, what the actual cause of the delay in the transfer of title in the Vehicle to the Plaintiff was.

> (c)     If the Defendants were liable to the Plaintiff, what were the measure of damages that the Plaintiff was entitled to? This encompassed the sub-issues of: (i) whether the Plaintiff had adequately proven its losses; and (ii) whether the Plaintiff had fulfilled its duty to mitigate its losses.

> As between Defendants and Third Party

> (d)     If the Defendants were found liable to the Plaintiff, was the Defendants entitled to claim an indemnity or contribution from the Third Party?

## My decision

### Issue 1: Whether the Defendants were under an obligation under the Sales Agreement to deliver the Vehicle to Plaintiff free from encumbrances?

43     I found that it was a term of the Sales Agreement that the Defendants would procure and/or ensure the transfer of the legal ownership and title of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff free from any encumbrances. This would include enabling the Plaintiff to be reflected as the new owner of the Vehicle on LTA’s records upon full payment of the Purchase Price by the Plaintiff.

44     While such a term was not expressly specified in the Sales Agreement, such a term would clearly be implied into the Sales Agreement. The inability to effectively register the Plaintiff as the owner of the Vehicle in LTA’s records would present severe impediments to the Plaintiff in relation to the usage of the Vehicle, such as the ability to procure insurance coverage and financing for the vehicle. The implication of such a term into the Sales Agreement would meet the requirements under the business efficacy test as complemented by the officious bystander test: see _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Andrew Phang Boon Leong Gen Ed.) at \[06.112 – 06.143\].

### Issue 2: Whether the Defendants breached their obligations in failing to cause Plaintiff to be registered as the owner of the Vehicle on LTA’s records.

45     The burden of proof is on the Plaintiff to show that the Defendants had failed to fulfil their obligations to effect a transfer of the legal ownership of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff free from all encumbrances. This included ensuring that the LTA records were capable of being updated to reflect the Plaintiff as the new registered owner.

46     The evidence adduced at trial suggested that the Plaintiff took active steps to procure the transfer of ownership on LTA’s records. The police incident lodged by the Plaintiff on 24 September 2018[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) (the “**Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report**”) indicated that the Plaintiff took active steps to effect the transfer, including: (a) making repeated calls to LTA to seek assistance; (b) sending lawyer’s letters to the Defendants; and (c) lodging police reports seeking the police’s assistance in resolving this matter. Material sections of the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report dated 24 September 2018 were as follows:

> “I am writing this letter for seeking the serious assistance and support from LTA for the case as following:

>> On 09/03/2018, I bought a vehicle SKC1131C from San Hup Bee(s) P/L at the price of $52,200.00 …..

>> …..

>> On 14/03/2018 at 12PM, I collected the car and paid the full settlement $49,200.86 to Auto lease Pte Ltd … and balance $1,999.14 to San Hup Bee (S) P/L ….. I was advised that the car could be transferred after 5 days by a ESA. I made an effort to transfer ownership quite \[sic\] some times but not eligible to transfer. I called Auto lease Pte Ltd advised to ask San Hup Bee as Sales \[sic\] Agreement signed \[sic\] with them not with Auto lease ……

>> After many days of investigating, I found out ….. SKC 1131C was not belongs to San Hup Bee (s) Pte Ltd but under San Hup Bee Motor LLP which had some old debt with Auto Lease so that Auto lease didn’t release Form B what is necessary requirement for the transfer ownership. _I wished to make the police report at Jurong Police Station_ but were advised that the car was handovered to me by San hup bee so no report recorded. _I called LTA on 11/04/2018 (Mr Rizal) ), on 12/04/2018 (Ming Leong), 12/04/2018 (Rodnang Chua). All replied to wait till Ms Janet called me back and said that she couldn’t do anything as this is under finance company (Auto lease)._

>> With an disappointment, _I looked for the lawyer firm and summon letter sent to San Hup Bee on 06/06/2018, no reply from them, sent again on 30/08/2018 (writ of summons). San Hup Bee’s lawyer reply on 19/09/2018 that they already give me all the transfer document (PIN. form M01)_ and finished their duties for sales agreement. _So I called LTA on 20/09/2018 (Haz)_ at 11am said Officer will call back by 20/09/2018 but _I still not received any return calls so I called again on 20/09/2018 at 17.30pm and get the return call from Trina on 21/096/2018 10.30am . She was helpful and advised me that making a police report and \[sic\] email to LTA so that they can investigate the case. ………. she called Auto lease asked them to release form B by this Tue 25/09/2018 if not LTA will let the buyer (Me) to transfer._

>> _Why LTA need for 6 months to settle while San Hup Bee handovered the car for me 6 months ago without transferring ownership?_ and LTA didnt take any action on this? Why Auto lease got the right to cancel the full settlement amount and stop release form B while I already paid them? Is there any Law in Singapore??? ....

>> _Kindly take this case as serious matter, and support for the ownership transfer happened._”

>> (_emphasis added_)

47     Notwithstanding the steps taken by the Plaintiff, the immediate transfer of ownership on LTA’s records could not be effected because of a preexisting encumbrance over the Vehicle which had resulted in the HPFLAS Form B not being lodged by Auto Lease. _Prima facie_, the Defendants had breached their obligations in ensuring that legal title were transferred to the Plaintiff without any encumbrance.

#### Issue 2A: Whether the delay in the transfer of title in the LTA records was due to Plaintiff’s omissions or defaults

48     The Defendants, however, contended that the failure to transfer ownership could have been due to the Plaintiff’s omission in effecting the transfer of the Vehicle, or default in complying with LTA’s transfer procedures. The Defendants argued that PW1 had, by his own testimony, conceded that he did not personally handle the transfer. He further did not call his staff who dealt with the transfer as a witness to testify as to what steps were taken to effect the transfer, and why the transfer did not go through.

49     I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the failure to register the transfer was not due to any omission or default on the part of Plaintiff or its staff. I considered the following.

50     First, it was not disputed that the Plaintiff was in, _inter alia_, the car leasing business. It was highly unlikely that having paid good money for the Vehicle, the Plaintiff would have failed to take the requisite steps to effect transfer of registration of ownership to itself, and instead been content to leave the ownership of the Vehicle under another person’s name (here the 2nd Defendant) on LTA’s record. This would have made it difficult for the Plaintiff to procure insurance for the Vehicle (whether for rental purposes or for personal use), or to use the Vehicle for any floor stock financing. If Plaintiff encountered any difficulties in effecting the transfer of ownership, the evidence (_e.g._ the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report) showed that Plaintiff had actively sought the assistance of the Defendants and LTA.

51     Indeed, the 1st Defendant’ Jaxon confirmed that he was “always in contact with \[the Plaintiff\] about the transfer of the vehicle” and the “transfer issue”, including “calling the finance company, ….. \[and\] even going down to their office”. In short, Jaxon testified that he had at Plaintiff’s request done what he could “to help the buyer get his ownership of the vehicle”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) With two car dealers looking into the transfer procedures, it was highly unlikely that the failure to transfer was due to any omissions or errors on either or both their parts in complying with LTA procedures.

52     The Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report lodged by PW1 on 24 September 2018 (see \[46\] above) expressing his frustration and seeking LTA’s assistance in transferring ownership, further corroborated PW1’s story that he was keen to effect transfer of the Vehicle promptly. The Plaintiff was however hampered in its efforts as Auto Lease had refused to issue a Form B confirming that all financings over the Vehicle had been cleared. In my opinion, the failure by the Plaintiff to call its staff to testify as to what she did to attempt to effect the transfer was not material; that the Plaintiff made reasonable attempts to effect the transfer could be proven by the other objective evidence, such as those mentioned above. In my mind, the contention that a seasoned car dealer like Plaintiff would not have discovered and rectified any errors in the transfer process, if any, was highly unlikely, especially given the extensive assistance he sought on the transfer issue.

53     Having regard to all the above, I did not consider it likely that the delay in the registration of the Vehicle on LTA’s records was due to any default or omissions on the part of the Plaintiff.

#### Issue 2B: What the cause of the transfer issues was

54     I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the real reason for the transfer being rejected by LTA was the existence of a **Form A** in respect of the Vehicle on the HPFLAS System, which the Third Party had wrongfully allowed to remain by failing to execute a **Form B**.

55     Clause 6.1 of the “HPFLAS System – Code of Conduct and Regulations of Use” (the “**HPFLAS Code**”) clearly stipulated as follows:

> “A Member \[here, the Third Party\] shall discharge its interest in any vehicle …. immediately after a hirer’s \[here, D2\] satisfaction of the financing by submitting **Form B** based on the relevant information as set out in **Form A** on HPFLAS’s website not later than one (1) Business Day after a hirer’s satisfaction of the financing.” **(emphasis added)**

56     Based on the Receipt, it was clear that the financing under the hire purchase between the 2nd Defendant and the Third Party had been discharged when Plaintiff paid the sum of $49,200.86 directly to the Third Party on or around 15 March 2018 at the Defendants’ request. The Third Party ought to have executed a Form B to discharge the Form A, but deliberately chose not to do so.

57     Indeed, the Third Party’s Anthony Lim (“**TPW1**” or “**Anthony Lim**”) accepted that based on clause 6.1 of the HPFLAS Code, Form B should have been lodged, but was not done[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). He further accepted that there was no contractual basis for the Third Party to use part of the $49,200.86 paid by Plaintiff to offset any debts owed by SHB Motoring, a separate entity, to Auto Lease[^12].

58     In light of the above, and having regard to the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report, I found on a balance of probabilities that it was the Third Party’s conduct, which was in clear breach of the HPFLAS Code, that had prevented the Plaintiff from being registered as the rightful owner on or around 14 March 2018 in LTA’s system.

59     The Third Party, however, tried to rely on Clause 7 read with Annex B of the HPFLAS Code to argue that the non-lodgment of Form B would only lead to a _temporary_ suspension of the transfer for five days (see clause 2.2 of Annex B) (see \[38\] above), and would not prevent the transfer from being effected on LTA’s register after five days. So long as the prescribed steps in clause 7.4 of the HPFLAS Code were not taken by the Member (_i.e._ by the furnishing of a Deed of Indemnity, a Bankers Guarantee to LTA, _etc._, which was not done in this case), the Form A would be discharged and the transaction would go through after five days. The Third Party argued that the cause of the non-registration was therefore not attributed to Third Party’s conduct.

60     I am unable to accept this argument. Clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS Code states as follows:

> **Procedure when VRLS Transaction Attempted for Vehicle Under Financing**

> …..

> 7.2    If the search made by the LTA on the HPFLAS System reflects that a vehicle is still under hire-purchase financing, then the LTA will immediately alert HPFLAS of the VRLS Transaction via post and/or email through the HPFLAS System setting out the details of such VRLS Transaction.

> …..

> 7.4    The relevant Member who wishes to request the LTA to reject any future VRLS Transactions shall follow the LTA’s prescribed procedure and submit an original, duly completed and signed Deed of Indemnity ….. within the LTA’s prescribed timeframe ……

> 7.5    Each Member acknowledges and agrees that, _notwithstanding any other provision in this Code of Conduct and Regulations or the Memorandum, the LTA retains_ **_the sole and absolute discretion_** _to decide whether to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction_ and that _nothing in this Code of Conduct and Regulations or the Memorandum is intended to, and shall not, whether under contract, tort or any other theory of law:_

>> (_a_)     _impose any obligation on the LTA to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction…;_

> _(emphasis added)_

61     Clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS Code is clear in stating that the LTA retained _sole and absolute discretion_ to decide whether to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction, and that nothing in the HPFLAS Code imposed any obligation on the LTA to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction. The discretion vested in LTA to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction was very wide. The Third Party’s contention that the transaction would necessarily go through after five days was not a _guaranteed outcome_, especially when a Form A was still in place.

62     In this regard, I agreed with the Defendants’ Counsel that the HPFLAS Code was silent on the _practical_ implementation of the transfer procedures, in particular, the _interplay between the HPFLAS System and the LTA System_. PW1’s testimony, which was corroborated by the contents of the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report, supported the inference that in this particular instance, it was likely that the continued presence of Form A on the HPFLAS system had caused LTA to decline to record the transfer of ownership from the 2nd Defendant to Plaintiff (both before and after the five calendar days have passed). Given the Third Party was relying on the HPFLAS Code in support of its defence that the transfer would have gone through notwithstanding the failure to lodge a Form B, the burden was on the Third Party to call the relevant operators of the systems to substantiate this fact. This the Third Party failed to do[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

63     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Defendants had in the present case procured the Transaction Pin and transferred it and form M01 to the Plaintiff. _The transfer of ownership was however held up by a dispute between the 2nd Defendant and Third Party, for which the Plaintiff was not concerned with_. The Defendants, as I had noted above, were under a contractual duty to transfer the Vehicle to Plaintiff free of encumbrances. Having failed to do so, the Defendants had thus breached their contract with Plaintiff, and were liable to Plaintiff in damages.

### Issue 3: Measure of damages

64     I was of the view that the Plaintiff was not entitled to claim loss of rental under the Alleged Lease from the “ready customer” at $2,500 for 24 months. That there was a ready customer willing to lease the Vehicle on the alleged terms was based on no more than the Plaintiff’s bare assertions. No evidence of such a contract was adduced. The “ready customer” was not even identified.

65     The measure of damages that Plaintiff would be entitled to recover would be such amount as would place the Plaintiff in the position as if the contract had been performed. If the Sales Agreement had been performed, the Plaintiff would have had use of the Vehicle for rental purposes with effect from 14 March 2018. The appropriate measure of damages would be the market rental value of a Toyota HiAce of the same make and model and age as the Vehicle.

66     In this regard, I accepted that the Vehicle was purchased for rental purposes even though it was purchased under V-Tech Auto Service (Plaintiff’s sole proprietorship), and Plaintiff owned a related entity called V-Tech Leasing Pte Ltd that allegedly did most of the leasing transactions. The evidence showed that the Plaintiff, V-Tech Auto Service’s, registered business activities included the leasing of vehicles[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) - it had a fleet of vehicles, and fleet insurance had been taken out[^15]. Vehicle hiring agreements involving V-Tech Auto Service were also produced[^16]. The Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report also corroborated Plaintiff’s account by documenting Plaintiff’s complaint that he had bought the Vehicle “for business (renting)” and had lost revenue as a result (see \[46\] above).

67     I did not accept the Defendants’ contention that Plaintiff purchased the Vehicle for his personal use. The fact that the Vehicle was caught for a traffic violation - beating the red lights - on one occasion was insufficient to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Vehicle was purchased for Plaintiff’s personal use. The Plaintiff’s explanation that it had to take the Vehicle out for maintenance purposes occasionally was a plausible explanation.

68     In any event, whether the Vehicle was purchased by the Plaintiff for rental purposes or for personal use, this would not affect the measure of damages. If it were purchased for _rental purposes_, damages would be assessed based on lost rental earnings, which will in turn be calculated based on the market rental value of the Vehicle of the same model and make. Similarly, if the Vehicle were purchased for _personal use_, damages would be calculated by reference to the rental charges of a replacement vehicle of the same model to compensate the Plaintiff for _loss of use_. This will again be ascertained by reference to the market rent payable for such a vehicle.

69     Proof of the market rental value of the Vehicle was however extremely scant based on the evidence adduced before this court. The only witness called on this point was Mr. William Lee (“**PW2**”). I accepted the Defendants and Third Party’s argument that Mr. William Lee was not called as an expert witness. Indeed, his affidavit was not in a form one would expect from an expert witness. Accordingly, his opinion evidence that the Vehicle had a rental value of between $2,500 to $2,700 was inadmissible[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

70     This left us with the rental value of a Toyota Hariier Premium 2.0 CVT at $1,800/month as at November 2020 referred to by Mr. William Lee in his affidavit[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). The Plaintiff had initially wanted to called one Crystal Ann who would have testified as to the rental value of a Toyota Vellfire. The Plaintiff accepted at some parts of his testimony that a Toyota Vellfire is comparable to a Toyota HiAce – both are 7-seaters, save that a Vellfire did not have high roof[^19]. Crystal Ann was eventually not called by the Plaintiff for reasons best known to the Plaintiff. The rental value of a Toyota Vellfire which would have been a useful basis for comparison was therefore not available. Separately, I disregarded the rental prices of other vehicles adduced by the Plaintiff, which on their face did not serve as good proxies for the rental value of the Toyota HiAce, _e.g._ BMWs[^20], Lexus [^21], Mercedes Benz[^22], and Toyota Camry Hybrid[^23].

71     In _Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 623</span>, the Court of Appeal summarized the principles governing the proof of damages as follows:

> (a)    a claimant claiming damages must prove his case. To justify an award of substantial damages, he must satisfy the court both as to the fact of damage and as to its amount (at \[27\]);

> (b)     _the law however does not demand the plaintiff prove with complete certainty the exact amount of damage he has suffered_ (at \[28\]);

> (c)     _where it is clear that there has been actual loss which is difficult to prove in monetary terms, it is for the court to do its best to estimate; it is not necessary to have an absolute measure of damages in each case_ (at \[29\]);

> (d)    while the court adopts a flexible approach with regard proof of damages based on the facts of each case, the correct approach is that where precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to have it. _Where it is not, the court will do the best it can_ (at 30).

> _(Emphasis added)_

72     I considered the following in coming to a reasonable estimate of the rental value of the Vehicle:

> (a)     The Toyota Hariier Premium 2.0 CVT, with a rental value of **$1,800** per month as at November 2020 referred to by Mr. William Lee, was a 5-seater. It was contended by PW1 that the HiAce, a 7 seater, would fetch a higher rental value.

> (b)     PW1, however, testified that the Toyota HiAce, with its high ceiling, catered to a niche market[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24), and the market demand for the Toyota HiAce was lower. PW1 ventured to suggest that the height of the Toyota HiAce might cause the vehicle not to be able to enter certain multi-storey carparks[^25]. Indeed, none of his business “partners” whom he could call upon when he needed to loan a vehicle for leasing purposes had the Toyota HiAce as part of their fleet.

> (c)     While Mr. William Lee contended that the value of a Toyota HiAce could be obtained from SgCarmart, no such advertisements were produced in evidence. They were likely to be hearsay in any case. Instead, Mr. William Lee chose to opine on the rental vale of the Toyota HiAce based on 3 invoices he annexed, all of which were in respect of vehicles of very different models.

> (d)     The Benchmark Rates in Appendix F of the State Courts Practice Directions provided a further reference point for the purposes of estimating the rental value of the Toyota HiAce. I was cognizant of the fact that Appendix F applies “where the dispute involves a claim for damages _in respect of a motor accident_ for cost of rental of a replacement vehicle and/or loss of use”: see paragraph 37(3)(a) of the State Courts Practice Directions. The present case clearly was not a motor accident claim. Appendix F appeared to be more applicable in a motor accident claim scenario where a vehicle is unavailable for use due to repair works being carried out, _i.e._ it is more indicative of short term rental values. It is arguably less applicable where the deprivation of use arises out of a breach of contract where the unavailability of the vehicle may continue for an extended period of time. Thus, while Appendix F could be used as a further data point, it was by no means conclusive, and must be referred to with great circumspection. The “loss of use” benchmark at between $100-120 per day was, in my view, another potential reference point for present purposes. Adopting the lower end of the range, the loss of use per month would be $3,000. To that an appropriate discount must be applied to take into account the specific context the benchmark figures were intended to cater to.

73     As noted above, where precise evidence of value was not available, the court would do its best to estimate. Factoring all the available evidence, I would estimate the rental value of the Vehicle at $2,200/month. This figure represented a slight uplift from the rental of the Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT (a five-seater), but was significantly lower than the Appendix F benchmark rates.

### Issue 4: Duty of Mitigation

74     The Plaintiff was further under a duty to mitigate. Though the standard required of the innocent party in discharging its duty of mitigation was not high and would not be weighed on fine scales, this standard would be higher where the innocent party chose a path of inaction – see _The Asia Star_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 1154</span> at \[45\].

75     On our facts, while the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report suggested that the Plaintiff took active steps to procure the transfer of the title of the Vehicle to itself up to September 2018, there was very little evidence before me to suggest that the Plaintiff was equally proactive in seeking to effect the transfer of the vehicle after the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report of 24 September 2018 was filed. In the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report, Plaintiff stated that he was informed by LTA that if the Form B were not released by 25 September 2018, LTA would proceed to release the Vehicle to him. The reason why the Vehicle was not released on 25 September 2018, and indeed by end September 2018, was never properly explained.

76     Further, what the Plaintiff did by way of mitigation post 25 September 2018, when the Form A was supposed to be released by LTA, was also not apparent from the evidence. Based on the documentary evidence, there appeared to be _general inaction_ on the Plaintiff’s part after 25 September 2018, except for the commencement of various lawsuits – namely (i) MC 13861/2018 against the Plaintiff on 5 March 2019; and (ii) DC/OSS 38/2019 against Auto Lease on 5 March 2019 - which Plaintiff never followed through until the present writ action was filed in March 2020.

77     Further, in my mind, if the Plaintiff were really minded to lease out the Vehicle against the backdrop of a ready rental market for the Vehicle, various steps could have been taken by the Plaintiff to mitigate its losses arising from its inability to transfer the Vehicle to his own name in LTA’s records. For example, leasing out the vehicle with the assistance of the 2nd Defendant was one possibility. Afterall, by the Plaintiff’s own account, the 2nd Defendant had sought Plaintiff’s assistance in paying the road tax[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) - there was no reason why the possibility of leasing the vehicle with the 2nd Defendant’s assistance could not be explored. Any attendant expenses that had to be incurred to address operational issues (_e.g._ insurance premiums, _etc._) could be recovered from the Defendants by way of damages. This was an infinitely more reasonable course for the Plaintiff to take than to leave the Vehicle idle for more than 2.5 years.

78     Equally, the payment of a further sum of $13,301.00 by the Plaintiff to the Third Party to discharge the outstanding balance amounts under the Hire Purchase Agreement so as procure the transfer of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff who could then proceed to rent out the vehicle first, and thereafter claim any consequential losses from the Defendants, also did not appear to have been explored by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff knew from LTA that the transfer was blocked by Auto Lease because of an outstanding debt issue – see Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report. While it is trite that mitigation did not require an aggrieved party to “risk its money too far” (see _The Asia Star_ at \[46\]), it is always a question of fact what amounted to too great an expense for the aggrieved party to incur as part of mitigation (at \[47\]). In my view, paying the Third Party the $13,301.00 first to procure the transfer of the Vehicle, and thereafter recovering such payments from the Defendants as damages, was not a financially prohibitive option that was unreasonable for the Plaintiff to contemplate. There was no evidence of Plaintiff’s impecuniosity so as to cause Plaintiff to be unable to consider this mitigative measure. In the whole scheme of things, $13,301.00 was not a large sum relative to the amounts the Plaintiff could have earned by renting out the Vehicle over a 2.5 year period. There was no evidence that Plaintiff considered these options to minimize its losses. Instead, by the Plaintiff’s own account, the Vehicle was left idle for some 2.5 years.

79     There was also no documentary evidence to suggest that Plaintiff continued to proactively follow up with LTA to resolve the transfer issue post September 2018. Indeed, when asked during cross examination if active steps were taken to effect the transfer in late 2018, as well as in 2019, PW1’s reply was that he “could not remember”[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27).

80     As noted in _The Asia Star_:

> “Having said that, we are of the view that Lord Macmillan’s observations ….. _apply less strongly in a case where the aggrieved party rejected a reasonable opportunity to reduce its own loss._ In other words, while it may be a general principle of the law on mitigation that the court will not nicely weigh on sensitive scales the measures taken by an aggrieved party to mitigate its loss, _this principle will ordinarily apply more strongly in cases where the question before the court is whether the aggrieved party engaged in unreasonable action as opposed to unreasonable inaction. Once the defaulting party establishes that the aggrieved party had reasonable options before it, greater justification will usually be needed from the aggrieved party which, despite knowing that it must act reasonably to mitigate its loss, does nothing at all._ After all, the duty to mitigate encapsulates a policy consideration of the law that, _once a civil wrong has occurred, the aggrieved party should be encouraged to be self-reliant or proactive in attempting to reduce its loss, instead of pinning all its loss on the defaulting party …. (emphasis added)_

81     Based on the foregoing, I found that the Plaintiff had not adequately mitigated its losses. The Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report suggested that _up to_ September 2018, the Plaintiff _did_ take active steps to attempt to resolve the transfer issue. However, Plaintiff _did not_ continue with these efforts proactively post September 2018. I am of the view that after end October 2018, the _general inaction_ by the Plaintiff to take steps to mitigate its losses was no longer reasonable. The recovery by the Plaintiff would therefore be limited to a 7.5-month period from 15 March 2018 to 30 October 2018.

82     The losses Plaintiff is entitled to recover is therefore $2,200 x 7.5 months = $16,500.

83     Road tax and insurance premium charges are not recoverable as these would have to be incurred anyway if the Vehicle were put, or could have been put, on the roads to earn a rental income during this period.

## The third party proceedings

84     While I found the Defendants liable to the Plaintiff, the Defendants had commenced a third party action against the Third Party seeking a contribution or indemnity from the Third Party for the Plaintiff’s claim, the costs of the Defendants in defending the action, and the costs of the Third Party proceedings[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28).

85     I had found above that the Third Party acted in breach of the Hire Purchase Agreement when it proceeded to apportion $13,301 out of the $49,200.86 paid by the Plaintiff to settle outstanding amounts due under the floor stock financing agreement between SHB Motoring and Auto Lease: see \[57-62\] above. There was no basis for the Third Party to set-off $13,301 against any amounts owing by SHB Motoring, a non-related entity. Indeed, the set-off clause under the Hire Purchase Agreement only permitted set-offs involving the same hirer[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). Clause 20 of the Hire Purchase Agreement provided as follows:

> 20\. (1)    In addition to any right to whom the Owners may be entitled by the law, the Owners may at any time and without notice combine all or any of the _Hirer’s_ accounts with and liabilities to the Owners and set-off or transfer any sum or sums standing to the credit of any one or more of such accounts in or towards satisfaction of any of the _Hirer’s_ liabilities to the Owners on any other account or in any other respect whether such liabilities be actual or contingent, primary or collateral and several or joint.”

> “Owner” means … Auto Lease Pte Ltd, which expression shall where the context so permits include its successors and assigns;

> “Hirer” means … _San Hup Bee Motor LLP_ \[_viz._ the 2nd Defendant\] … which expression shall where the context so permits include his/its personal representative/ successor or assign) _(emphasis added)._

86     As the Third Party’s Anthony Lim conceded, San Hup Bee Motor LLP (the 2nd Defendant) and SHB Motoring were not identical nor related entities, and there was no basis to apportion monies due to 2nd Defendant to pay off SHB Motoring’s debts[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30). The Third Party, however, opportunistically and wrongfully used $13,301 of the Balance Vehicle Financing Amount paid by the Plaintiff to net-off debts owed to the Third Party by SHB Motoring as it had difficulties recovering full payment of the outstanding floor stock amounts owed by SHB Motoring after Mr. Toh See Leong’s passing[^31]. In wrongfully exercising such set-off rights and in failing to lodge a Form B despite having received the full Balance Vehicle Financing Amount from the Plaintiff, the Third Party had caused the Defendants to breach the Sales Agreement _vis-à-vis_ the Plaintiff. The Third Party must therefore indemnify the Defendants in full for any damages it may be liable to Plaintiff under the Sales Agreement.

87     The Third Party, however, contended that:

> (a)     The Plaintiff and the Defendants had not proven that they had made any attempts to transfer the Vehicle; and

> (b)     In any case, the express terms of the HPFLAS Code provided that the Form A would not have prevented a transfer of the registration of the Vehicle on the LTA system.

### Whether Plaintiff and Defendants had proven they had made proper attempts to transfer the Vehicle

88     As noted in \[29 - 32\] and \[46 -47\] above, considering the Plaintiff and the Defendants’ evidence in their totality, I found that the Defendants had discharged their burden of proof and shown that both Plaintiff and the Defendants had taken active steps to transfer legal title and beneficial ownership of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff up to the date of the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report. The Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report, for one, suggested that the Plaintiff had followed up with the LTA, the police and the Defendants on many occasions to attempt to transfer ownership of the Vehicle on LTA’s records to the Plaintiff, but to no avail. The 1st Defendant had, on his part, rendered assistance to the Plaintiff when required. The Plaintiff and the Defendants’ testimonies were consistent in this regard.

### Whether an unreleased Form A would have prevented a transfer of title on the LTA system?

89     Based on the Police Incident Report and the testimonies of the Plaintiff, Jaxon and Anthony Lim, I found that there was evidence that the non-lodgment of Form B was the cause of the failure to transfer title in the LTA system. The burden was then on the Third Party to prove its case that the non-lodgment of a Form B by the Third Party to discharge the Form A would not have prevented the transfer (see Third Party Defence at \[14\]).

90     The Third Party relied on the terms of the HPFLAS Code of Conduct to suggest that the presence of Form A would not have prevented a transfer of the Vehicle on LTA’s records. However, apart from citing the provisions of the HPFLAS Code which suggested that any blockage of the transfer was merely temporary, the Third Party failed to adduce satisfactory proof that the transfer of ownership would in fact take place after five days.

#### No proof of how the HPFLAS System interacted with the LTA System

91     I noted that that the Third Party did not provide any proof of how the HPFLAS system interacted with the LTA system, for _e.g._ by calling the HPFLAS officers, and/or LTA officers with knowledge of the interface between the two system to explain what LTA’s practice was when a vehicle sought to be transferred to a new owner had an undischarged Form A. Such testimony would have lent credence to the Third Party’s assertion, if true, that a Form A would only cause a temporary blocking of the transfer by the LTA system and would automatically be lifted after five days. In particular, I am cognizant that the LTA retained a residual discretion, as noted in \[60\] above, whether or not to register a VRLAS transaction. It therefore could not be gainsaid that LTA would have proceeded to register a transfer, even where a Form A were not discharged, after five calendar days.

92     Indeed, the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report noted that the Plaintiff had previously complained to the police that he was informed by LTA that it was the failure to issue the Form B by Auto Lease that was holding up the transfer from LTA’s perspective: see \[46\]. The Third Party’s assertion that the transfer on LTA’s system would automatically go through after five days if no Document of Indemnity were filed by the financier resisting the transfer thus did not cohere with the facts.

93     I should note that while the Police Incident Report made reference to out of court statements by various third party LTA officers, the document was being relied on as evidence of the fact that the complaints were being made by the Plaintiff to LTA and the police, and that certain responses were received from the LTA and the police. The Police Incident Report was not adduced as truth of the contents therein - it was _real evidence_ adduced to show that certain statements were exchanged between Plaintiff and LTA (irrespective of their truth). As such, it was not hearsay.

### Did the successful transfer of the Vehicle on 30 November 2020 indicate that the failure to transfer in March 2018 was due to the Plaintiff/Defendants’ default?

94     The Third Party also alleged that the fact the Vehicle was transferred successfully by the Defendants to Plaintiff on or around 30 November 2020 suggested that there was never an issue with the transfer in the first place. However, the Third Party failed to point out the article from SgCarmart which Mr. Anthony Lim, the Third Party’s key witness, had exhibited to his affidavit[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32). The SgCarmart article expressly alluded to the various changes to the LTA vehicle ownership transfer process which were introduced on 26 November 2018.

95     Under the changes LTA made to the vehicle ownership transfer process which took effect on 26 November 2018, a Form B would automatically be lodged eight days after an application for vehicle ownership transfer has been made, regardless of the Vehicle’s financial status. The only exception was where a Deed of Indemnity was issued by the financier to stop the transfer, which did not appear to be the factual matrix encountered in the present case. It followed that _after_ December 2018, had the seller (here the 2nd Defendant) made a transfer application, the new LTA vehicle ownership transfer system would have applied, and the ownership transfer would have gone through eight days after an application is made by the seller to transfer ownership even if Auto Lease did not issue a Form B.

96     While the SgCarmart article is technically hearsay, as mentioned above, it was annexed to the Third Party’s Mr. Anthony Lim’s affidavit, and was accordingly adduced with the consent of the Third Party: see s 32(k) Evidence Act. The probative value of the article was accentuated by Doris’ evidence that she was also aware of these changes introduced by LTA from “people in the trade” sometime in 2020, and she thereafter promptly initiated the transfer of the Vehicle to Plaintiff on LTA’s system[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33). Jaxon similarly confirmed that he was aware of the change in the LTA system that took effect on 26 November 2018[^34].

97     Thus, the fact that the transfer went through on 30 November 2020 did not without more suggest that the steps taken by the Plaintiff and the Defendants to transfer the Vehicle without a Form B prior to November 2018 (before the changes took place) would similarly have been successful. On a balance of probabilities, I found that the transfer on 30 November 2020 was successful due to the changes in the LTA system that took effect from late November 2018 onwards.

98     I am mindful that taking the SgCarmart article at face value, the Plaintiff might have been able to procure a transfer a transfer of the Vehicle from late November 2018. Why the Plaintiff did not do so, and indeed waited till December 2020, was not explored during the trial. In any event, I have awarded the Plaintiff losses for a 7.5 month period from 15 March 2018 to 30 October 2018 only. The fact that there was a change in the vehicle ownership system in end November 2018 did not change my analysis that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover damages from the Defendants on account of the loss of use for 7.5 months from 15 March 2018 to 30 October 2018. The Defendants were correspondingly entitled to claim an indemnity in the same sum from the Third Party.

## Conclusion

99     Based on the above, I therefore awarded judgement to the Plaintiff against the Defendants in the sum of $16,500 plus interest at 5.33% p.a. from the date of writ to the date of judgment. As the Plaintiff recovered substantially reduced damages due to their failure to mitigate their losses, I awarded costs to be paid by the Defendants to the Plaintiff for the main action fixed at $10,000 plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.

100    I ordered the Third Party to indemnify the Defendants to the full extent of the sums (including costs) ordered to be paid by the Defendants to Plaintiff. I further awarded costs of the Third Party Action to be paid by the Third Party to the Defendants fixed at $20,000 plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.
