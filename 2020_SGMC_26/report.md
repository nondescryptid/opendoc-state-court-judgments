3       When the Accused appeared before the court, he was unrepresented.

## Statement of Facts (“SOF”)

4       Briefly, these were the facts admitted by the Accused.

5       On 18/03/2019 at about 5.30 pm, the victim was riding his motorcycle (the "Motorcycle") with his wife as a pillion along Telok Blangah Road in the direction towards the Marina Coastal Expressway ("MCE"), Singapore.

6       The Accused was driving a lorry bearing registration number GZ1460D (the "Lorry") along Telok Blangah Road in the same direction towards the MCE. The Accused was with the co-accused as the front passenger seat.

7       At the material time, the Motorcycle was on the extreme right lane while the Lorry was on the adjacent lane on the Motorcycle's left. The Accused then made an abrupt lane change to the right, without turning on his signal indicator, and thereby encroached into the path of the Motorcycle, which was travelling straight on the extreme right lane. This caused the victim to swerve his motorcycle hard towards the right and narrowly avoided a collision with the lorry. The Accused had thereby drove his vehicle in a dangerous manner and had committed an offence under section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

8       Both vehicles then came to a stop on the road, with the Motorcycle beside the driver's side door of the Lorry. The victim then hit the driver's side door of the Lorry twice, to show his displeasure with the Accused's driving. The Accused was angered by the victim's actions. Suddenly, he did an act so rashly as to endanger the personal safety of others, by opening the driver's side door quickly and hitting the victim's Motorcycle causing the victim to lose his balance and thrown off the Motorcycle. Fortunately, the pillion rider managed to jump off the Motorcycle before it toppled to the ground. On the other hand, the victim experienced pain on his right knee.

9       Thereafter, the Accused alighted from the Lorry and engaged in a verbal dispute with the victim. The co-accused also alighted from the Lorry and retrieved a metal hacksaw (without blade, with frame measuring about 49cm and weighing 0.60 kg) (the "Hacksaw") from the back of the Lorry. The co-accused then used the Hacksaw to hit the victim once on his left wrist and once on the left shoulder. The victim then retaliated in self-defence by swinging his hands around to fend off the co-accused's attack.

10     While the co-accused and the victim were fighting, the Accused retrieved a crowbar measuring about 75 cm long and weighing about 1.65 kg, and charged towards the victim to attack him. However, the passers-by intervened to prevent the Accused from using the crowbar on the victim and stop the co-accused's attacks.

## Antecedents

11     In 2007, the Accused was convicted for drunk driving. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,600. He was also disqualified from holding all classes of driving licence for a period of 15 months.

## Submission on Sentence

12     The Prosecution submitted for a custodial sentence of 2 weeks for the offence under section 337(a) Penal Code ("section 337(a) offence"). The learned DPP highlighted that this sentence was in parity with the sentence meted out to the co-accused.

13     For the offence of dangerous driving, the Prosecution asked for a fine and a 10-month disqualification order. The learned DPP indicated that the usual fine imposed for the offence of dangerous driving was within the range of $1,000 to $2,500. There was no precedent submitted by the Prosecution to support his submission on the fine and DQ order.

14     For the section 337(a) offence, the Prosecution invited the court to consider it as a road rage. The learned DPP highlighted there was an element of danger in that there was a potential to cause harm when the traffic light turned green. The pillion could also have suffered injury if she had not taken the pre-emptive action.

15     The Prosecution also highlighted that the Accused had a TIC charge for a section 352 offence under the Penal Code.

16     In summary, in respect of the section 337(a) offence, it was submitted that the Accused's culpability was not lower than the co-accused's.

## Mitigation

17     In mitigation, the Accused informed the court that he was 66 years old. He indicated that he was on a long-term medication for his sleeping problem. He pleaded for leniency. He also tendered a note from IMH stating that he was being treated for anxiety disorder. He highlighted his wishes to continue working and mentioned that Covid-19 situation had affected the prospect of work. He also claimed that there was no premeditation.

## Sentencing Consideration

18     The punishment prescribed for a section 337(a) offence is an imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or with fine up to $5,000, or with both. On the other hand, the penalty for the offence of dangerous driving for a first-time offender is a fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both.

19     In my judgment, the rash act done by the Accused towards the victim took place after the Accused had abruptly and without signal, encroached onto the path of the Motorcycle causing the rider to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Besides being a case of dangerous driving, it escalated into a case of a road rage as the section 337(a) offence originated from differences arising through common road use. See _PP v Lim Yee Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 308</span> at \[21\].

20     It is trite that in the case of road rage violence the main sentencing consideration must be deterrence. See _Lim Yee Hua v PP_, supra, at \[21\]. Deterrence is also a primary sentencing consideration for dangerous driving. See _PP v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 240</span> at \[28\].

21     With this in mind, I proceeded to determine the harm caused and the culpability of the Accused. Apart from these parameters, I must also consider the mitigating and aggravating factors. See _Lim Yee Hua v PP_, supra, at \[27\]. See also _PP v Aw Tai Hock_, supra, at \[29\] where the court held that the two principal parameters of harm and culpability were relevant in deciding the appropriate sentence for dangerous driving.

22     In this case, I agreed with the Prosecution that a custodial sentence was warranted for the section 337 (a) offence.

23     It was noted that the harm caused to the victim was relatively minor. There was only pain felt by the victim. Nevertheless, as highlighted, by the Prosecution, there was clearly a potential harm caused to the pillion had no pre-emptive action was taken by the victim and pillion.

24     Next, the offence took place on a main road, namely, along Telok Blangah Road at about 5:30 pm. It must be a busy road during that time as there were passers-by who had intervened to prevent the escalation of the altercation. Clearly, there was evidence of the extent of disruption caused to public order.

25     In the circumstances, I was of the view that the harm caused was on the high end of the low harm.

26     In terms of culpability, the circumstances of the offence did indicate a significant culpability on the part of the Accused. I noted what the Accused did was the opening of the door which caused the victim to lose his balance and fall together with his Motorcycle. This, together with the facts of the TIC charge aggravated his culpability. The facts supporting the TIC charge were set out in the SOF and admitted by the Accused. I noted that not only the Accused alighted from the vehicle to charge at the victim; the co-accused had also alighted from the Lorry and retrieved a metal hacksaw from the back of the Lorry to hit the victim. While the co-accused and the victim were fighting, the Accused retrieved a crowbar weighing about 1.65kg and charged towards the victim to attack him. However, he was prevented by passers-by from using the crowbar on the victim.

27     As to the case of dangerous driving, it happened along a major thoroughfare at about 5:30 pm towards the direction of MCE. I noted that the Accused had made an abrupt lane change to the right, without any signal indication, and encroached into the path of the Motorcycle. It caused the victim to take evasive action to avoid the collision. It must have caused a scare to the victim that caused him to indicate his displeasure to the Accused. I also noted that the vehicle that the Accused drove was a lorry. In my view, the Accused had clearly driven his lorry dangerously without any regard for the safety of other road user and warranted a DQ order to be imposed for the dangerous driving.

28     Admittedly, the SOF lacked the details on the nature, condition, and use of the road including the amount of traffic at the material time. Nevertheless, it is well known that on a weekday at about 530pm and being a major road, one can expect a reasonable amount of traffic on the road. This might explain the presence of passers-by at the material time.

## Mitigating and Aggravating factors

29     The Accused was a not a first-time offender. Admittedly, his last antecedent was dated and unrelated to the current offences. Hence, I did not place any weight on this factor.

30     The mere allegation that the Accused's livelihood might be affected was not a mitigating factor. It was certainly not a good reason not to impose the DQ order.

31     Credit was given for the Accused's plea of guilt. It was a sign of his remorse.

32     I agreed that the assault took place on the spur of the moment and not premeditated. However, the Accused was persistent on wanting to attack the victim. It was through the timely intervention of passers-by that he was stopped from using the crowbar.

33     The Prosecution did not highlight any other significant aggravating factor that were not related to the commission of the offence per se besides the TIC charge which had already been duly considered and should not be factored again.

34     I also noted that the IMH note did not indicate any causal link to the offending behaviour displayed by the Accused.

## Conclusion

35     All considered, I sentenced the Accused to undergo 2 weeks' imprisonment for the section 337(a) offence. In respect of the road traffic offence, considering particularly the quality of the driving and the type of vehicles involved, he was ordered to pay a fine of $1,800. A DQ order was also imposed pursuant to section 42 of the Road Traffic Act.

36     On the day the Accused was sentenced, he applied for and was granted deferment of the sentence. During the period of deferment, he filed an appeal against sentence through his counsel. Subsequently, the Accused applied for and was granted a stay on the execution of the sentence and DQ order. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. The fine has been paid.
