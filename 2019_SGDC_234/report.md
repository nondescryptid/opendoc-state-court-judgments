### District Judge Samuel Hwa Kuan Chua:

## The Charge

1       Lee Yan Han (“the Accused”), a 22-year-old male Singaporean (Date of Birth 27 April 1997), pleaded guilty to one charge of Cheating under section 417 Penal Code. At the time he committed the offence, the Accused was serving his National Service as a Police Special Constable attached to Jurong Police Division. The charge states:

> “You, …, are charged that you, on the 2nd day of July 2018, at or about 6.20pm, at Block 845 Jurong West Street 81 #XXX, Singapore, did cheat one XXX, Female / 21 years old, to wit, by deceiving her into believing that you are involved in an operation to catch culprits involved in cases of “fake mirrors”, a fact which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you intentionally induced the said XXX to pose for you with her t-shirt lifted thus exposing her bra while having a Whatsapp video call with you and allowing you to take the screenshots of her, an act which the said XXX would not have done had she not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

## Statement of Facts

2       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

> **PERSONS INVOLVED**

> 1.    The victim is XXX XXX XX, Female 21 years old.

> 2.    The accused is Lee Yan Han, Male 21 years old, NRIC No.: XXX, Singapore Citizen. He is serving his National Service as a Police Special Constable officer. At the material time, he was attached to Jurong Police Division.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE**

> 3.    Investigation revealed that the victim and accused were acquainted as classmates in primary school. After graduating from primary school, they lost contact with each other.

> 4.    On 1 July 2018, the accused was added to a Whatsapp Group Chat which the victim was part of, by a mutual friend. Thereafter, on 2 July 2018, the accused initiated contact with the victim by sending a private message to her on Whatsapp. The victim responded to his message and started exchanging messages with him.

> 5.    During their conversation over Whatsapp, the accused informed the victim that he is serving his National Service in the Police Force. The accused told the victim to be careful of “fake mirrors” in changing rooms which had hidden cameras. He then told the victim that the culprits behind these “fake mirrors” would record females wearing certain types of bra in the changing rooms and thereafter upload the videos on the internet. He lied to the victim and told her, with words to the effect, that he was involved in the investigations of these cases and had arrested 3 out of the 6 culprits. He asked the victim about the type of bra she wore and requested to call her.

> 6.    At about 5.44 p.m. on the same day, the accused called the victim on Whatsapp. In that conversation, the accused told her that he was investigating into the “fake mirror” cases. He asked if she could help him by allowing him to take screenshots of her cladded in her bra during a video call. He told the victim that he intended to use the screenshots as “bait” by uploading them onto an online forum and lure the culprits of the “fake mirror” cases into having a conversation with him.

> 7.    The victim was initially unwilling to assist the accused. However, the accused persuaded her by telling her that he was investigating the “fake mirror” cases with 3 other colleagues but was left to work alone as his colleagues were overseas. He also informed the victim that he had female friends helping him in the same manner. At the end of the phone conversation, the victim felt pity for the accused and agreed to help him.

> 8.    At about 6.14 p.m. on the same day, after ascertaining from the victim that she was alone at home, the accused made a video call to her on Whatsapp. The victim was still uncomfortable with the accused’s request. However, he continued persuading her. Mid-way in the conversation, the video call ended abruptly as the victim’s father had given her a call on the handphone.

> 9.    At about 6.22 p.m. on the same day, the accused at Block 845 Jurong West Street 81 #XXX, Singapore, made another video call to the victim again on Whatsapp. By this time, the victim was persuaded to assist the accused and had changed into a bright pink bra and a slightly translucent striped-shirt. In the video call, the accused instructed the victim to do the following:

>> a.    Stand with her back facing the handphone camera and to lift up her shirt, exposing the back of her bra. She was told to hold the pose while the accused took a screenshot.

>> b.    Stand with her face facing the handphone camera and to pull the right sleeve down to the upper arm, exposing the right bra strap. She was told to hold the pose while the accused took a screenshot

>> c.    Stand with her face facing the handphone camera and to pull the left sleeve down to the upper arm, exposing the left bra strap. She was told to hold the pose while the accused took a screenshot

>> d.    Stand with her face facing the handphone camera and to lift up her shirt to expose her right breast with bra on. She was told to hold the pose while the accused took a screenshot

> 10.    The victim complied with the instructions of the accused and requested that he remove her face from the screenshots.

> 11.    At one point in the video call, the accused also asked the victim to remove her bra while wearing only her shirt. The victim did not accede to this request. The accused then told her to expose the back of her bra to the camera and to unhook the bra instead. The victim agreed and did as instructed.

> 12.    After the call ended, the victim felt uncomfortable and decided to confide in a friend about the incident. She was then advised by her friend to report the matter to the Police and the victim lodged a report on 3 July 2018.

> 13.    Investigations further revealed that the accused was not deployed to perform investigative duties. He had intentionally deceived the victim into believing that he was involved in an operation to catch culprits in an alleged series of cases concerning “fake mirrors”, a fact which he knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, he intentionally induced the victim to pose for him with her t-shirt lifted thus exposing her bra and allowing him to take the screenshots of her.

> 14.    The victim only agreed to assist the accused as she wanted to help in the cases concerning “fake mirrors”. She would not have complied with the instructions of the accused if she were not so deceived. After she learnt that the accused had deceived her, the victim felt betrayed and fearful as he had her pictures with him.

> 15.    A total of 4 screenshots of the victim in the poses described in \[9\] were later recovered from the accused’s iPhone 8. The victim’s face could be clearly seen in two of the 4 screenshots.

> 16.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence of Cheating punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Antecedents

3       The Accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

4       The Prosecution submitted for the Accused to be sentenced to at least three months’ imprisonment in view of the following factors:

> a.     The primary sentencing consideration was general and specific deterrence.

> b.     The Accused had abused his position as police officer to commit the offence. His offence would have adversely impacted public confidence in the Singapore Police Force.

> c.     There was abuse of trust between the Accused and the victim, who had trusted the Accused because he was a former primary school classmate and a police officer .

> d.     There was a high degree of premeditation by the Accused who had concocted the story of being tasked to investigate into “fake mirror” cases to persuade the victim to pose for him.

> e.     The Accused persisted in persuading the victim to pose for him even though the victim was initially uncomfortable with his proposition. When the victim eventually agreed to pose for him in her bra, he had tried to go further by asking the victim to remove her bra and to wear only her shirt, which the victim declined to do.

> f.     There was substantial impact on the victim, who felt betrayed by the Accused and fearful as the Accused had her compromising photographs in his possession.

> g.     Little weight should be accorded to the Accused’s decision to plead guilty since the evidence against him was overwhelming, in that four screenshots of the victim had been found in the Accused’s mobile phone.

5       The Prosecution tendered seven sentencing precedents in respect of police officers or auxiliary police officers who had committed various offences and where there was some nexus between their appointment as police officers or auxiliary police officers and the commission of the offences:

> g.      **_PP v Norazly Bin Joihani_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 13</span>

## Mitigation

6       Mr Terence Tan, who was appointed to represent the Accused under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”), tendered a written mitigation plea and highlighted the following factors:

> a.     The Accused (Date of Birth 27 April 1997) was 21 years and two months’ old when he committed the offence on 2 July 2018.

> b.     The Accused was a first-time offender.

> c.     The Accused felt deep and sincere remorse and had pleaded guilty.

> d.     The offence had been committed over roughly half an hour, and was not a premeditated or planned course of conduct.

> e.     The Accused had deleted the four screenshots on the same day or by the next day, as he had felt remorseful about what he had done almost immediately thereafter.

> f.     The Accused did not commit a financial crime, no property was involved, and there was no suggestion that the Accused had acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

> g.     Any harm caused to the victim would have been minimal.

7       In submitting for the Accused to be given 18 months’ Probation, Mr Tan submitted that:

> a.     The rehabilitative principle takes precedence when the Court is dealing with a young offender.

> b.     When considering Probation as a sentencing option, the Court is not restricted by the age of the offender, except in relation to offences with a specified or mandatory minimum sentence. The age of 21 is not a bright line beyond which Probation can never be granted.

> c.     The Accused falls within the archetype of the young, amateur, first-time offender.

8       Mr Tan highlighted the following cases:

> a.      **_PP v Tan Jian Yong_** DAC 2661-2013 and others;

> b.      **_PP v Chia Shu Xuan_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 369</span>

> c.      **_PP v Rachel Anne Preece_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 167</span>

> d.      **_PP v Koh Boon Hwee_** SC-909678-2016

> e.      **_PP v Felicia Goh Wen Yi_** SC-901443-2017

> f.      **_PP v Sri Nurraizah Binti Abdul Rahim_** SC-909182-2015

> g.      **_PP v Walden Lee Guo Quan_** SC-909474-2016

> h.      **_PP v Ang Teck Wee_** SC-909589-2016

> i.      **_PP v How Yan Jun Michelle_** SC-907594-2016

> j.      **_\[Name of Accused redacted\]_** SC-000619-2012

> k.      **_PP v Linda Soh Lin Ling_** SC-903470-2015

9       In the alternative, Mr Tan submitted for the Accused to be sentenced to a fine of $4,000 or for a seven-day Short Detention Order to be imposed.

10     I noted that throughout his written submissions, Mr Tan had ignored the fact that the Accused had committed the offence in relation to his appointment as a Special Constable police officer in the Singapore Police Force and had used his alleged involvement in the investigation of “fake mirror” cases to persuade the victim to expose her bra to him so that his screenshots of her could be used as “bait” to lure the culprits of the “fake mirror” cases into having a conversation with him online.

11     When queried by the Court during the hearing as to why he had not addressed what in my view was a very substantive fact, Mr Tan submitted that since the Accused was not an Investigating Officer and had not committed the offending act in the course of his duty as an Investigating Officer, there was no reason for a higher sentence to be imposed on the Accused.

## The Court’s Decision

12     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 417 Penal Code is up to three years’ imprisonment, a fine or both.

13     In my assessment, the following were the offence-specific aggravating factors in this case.

14     First, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had abused his position as a police officer to commit the offence, under the guise of having been assigned to investigate into “fake mirror” cases and needing the victim’s photographs to lure the culprits into having a conversation with him online. It was exactly because the victim believed that the Accused was a police officer that his story sounded credible to the victim and she believed what he had told her. I did not accept Mr Tan’s differentiation of the present case from cases in which police officers had committed offences in the course of their duties, for example, by committing forgery or by misappropriating or committing theft of exhibits which had come into their custody in the course of investigations. In my assessment, the Accused’s culpability was no different from the culpability of the police officers who had committed forgery or misappropriated or stolen case exhibits in the course of their duties, and was a material aggravating factor in sentencing. See **_PP v Gurmit Singh s/o Jaswant Singh_** at \[11\] and **_PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_** at \[33\] – \[34\], \[37\], \[40\], \[43\] and \[76\] - \[77\].

15     Second, to the extent that the Accused had concocted the elaborate story to deceive the victim into consenting to expose herself to him over the video call, I agreed that his offending was premeditated. In this regard, I did not accept Mr Tan’s argument that the Accused had committed the offence on the spur of the moment and in a moment of youthful folly. The Accused’s story was neither superficial nor simplistic but had included relevant details which enhanced the credibility of his story. He was also careful to include specific details in his story which played on the victim’s friendship, public-spiritedness and pity for him. See **_PP v Tan Fook Sum_** <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[28\], **_PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_** \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 334 at \[39\] – \[41\] and **_PP v Law Aik Meng_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[22\] and \[25(b)\].

16     Third, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had persisted in deceiving the victim, even when she had communicated her unwillingness and discomfort to him. He persuaded her and preyed on her pity by telling her that he was left alone to investigate these cases as his three other colleagues were overseas. He also attempted to add some credibility to what he had asked the victim to do by telling her that his other female friends were also helping him in the same manner. Even after his video call was terminated abruptly when the victim’s father called her mobile phone, the Accused did not have second thoughts about what he was planning to do and was not deterred. Despite achieving his original aim of obtaining screenshots of the victim in her bra, the Accused was not satiated. Instead, he was sufficiently emboldened by his initial success to ask the victim to remove her bra and to wear only her shirt.

17     Fourth, the Accused had taken the compromising screenshots of the victim with his mobile phone, which screenshots were thereafter stored in his phone. The use of a mobile phone to commit the offence brought with it the real propensity of harm to the victim should the Accused misuse the screenshots (two of which clearly showed her face) for purposes which she had not consented to or if his mobile phone was to fall into the wrong hands. While the Accused claimed to have deleted the four screenshots on the same day or by the next day, the fact remained that the four screenshots that he had taken of the victim still remained in his mobile phone. The use of such electronic devices which facilitated storage and dissemination of the screenshots has been accepted as an additional aggravating factor in cases involving the filming or photographing of women in ways that insulted their modesty. See **_PP v Chong Hou En_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> at \[65\]:

> … In addition, the ease with which videos can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this day and age further warrants the need for general deterrence. Unimaginable shame and distress to the victims may be caused if the videos are disseminated worldwide via the Internet. Although in this case no videos were uploaded and disseminated, the danger, which is not fanciful but very real, that it could have happened is sufficient to warrant a deterrent sentence. I am in full agreement that a strong message should be sent to those who harbour thoughts of abusing these advancements in technology.

18     I considered the offender-specific mitigating factors in the present case, namely, the Accused was untraced, was relatively young at the time of the offence and had pleaded guilty, thereby averting the need for the victim to testify in court.

19     Having considered the abovementioned factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that notwithstanding the Accused’s relative youth when he committed the offence, general and specific deterrence, instead of rehabilitation, remained the primary sentencing consideration. Having taken this position, I was not prepared to consider Probation or Community-based Sentences as a sentencing option in the present case, as both were fundamentally rehabilitative in nature. See _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span>, _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span> at \[12\] and _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[33\] - \[34\].

## Sentencing precedents and indicative starting sentence

20     The Prosecution had relied on sentencing precedents which involved police officers who had committed a variety of offences in relation to their official duties (referred to in this paragraph as “the police element”). In my view, since the sentences that were imposed in those cases would have depended on the specific factual matrices, the nature of the offences and their respective prescribed punishments, the total number of charges and the number of proceeded charges etc., the cases are relevant more for the proposition that the “police element” constituted an aggravating factor and triggered the deterrence principle in sentencing than the specific sentences that were imposed.

21     I also did not find the cases that Mr Tan had highlighted to be relevant or helpful notwithstanding that most involved section 417 Penal Code offences, as those cases involved money or money’s worth. It would be too superficial to conclude that because the accused persons in those cases had been ordered to undergo Probation despite being above 21 years old at the time of offending, the present Accused should be ordered to do the same.

22     This case was unusual in that the subject-matter of the Cheating offence was a series of sensitive screenshots that the victim had allowed the Accused to take of her in her bra, instead of the traditional cases of money or money’s worth that an accused had obtained from the victim through the deception. While in most cases the money value of the subject-matter would have been one of the most significant considerations in determining the sentence to impose on an accused for a Cheating offence (frequently regarded as a property-related offence), such a consideration did not feature in this case. For this reason, I was of the view that sentencing precedents that featured section 417 Penal Code offences involving money or money’s worth provided limited assistance in this case.

23     In my opinion, sentencing precedents in relation to insulting the modesty of women under section 509 Penal Code, in particular, cases involving the use of digital devices to film or photograph women in ways that insulted their modesty, were more relevant to determining the indicative starting sentence in this case.

24     At the same time, I was also mindful that a section 417 Penal Code offence (i.e. Cheating) is generally regarded as being more serious than a section 509 Penal Code offence (i.e. Insulting the modesty of a woman), as evidenced by the maximum prescribed punishment of three years’ imprisonment for the former offence and the maximum prescribed punishment of one year’s imprisonment for the latter offence.

25     In **_PP v Chong Hou En_**, the accused had pleaded guilty to five charges of filming women under section 509 Penal Code and one charge of being in possession of obscene films under section 30(1) Films Act. He had consented for ten other charges under section 509 Penal Code and one charge under the Films Act to be taken into consideration for sentencing. One proceeded charge involved taking an upskirt video, while four proceeded charges involved the more aggravated acts of filming women showering. The High Court sentenced him to 12 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the five charges, including the upskirt offence, and to four weeks’ imprisonment for the Films Act charge. The High Court ordered the sentences for one section 509 Penal Code charge and the Films Act charge to run consecutively, making a total of 16 weeks’ imprisonment. The High Court stated that the sentence would have been four months’ imprisonment if not for the fact that the accused had shown considerable remorse and had pleaded guilty, at \[78\]:

> On the facts of the present case, due to the presence of the aggravating factors mentioned above at \[14\], especially the fact that (a) there was a high degree of planning and premeditation; (b) the intrusion into the privacy of some victims was grave and at the home of the victims; (c) there were multiple victims and young victims; and (d) a miniature recording device was used, and given that the need for general deterrence is greater now than before due to the advancements in technology (see above at \[15\]), I am of the opinion that a term of four months’ imprisonment (which is approximately 18 weeks’ imprisonment) per charge under s 509 of the Penal Code is appropriate. However, because of the mitigating facts (see above at \[72\]) and in particular the fact that he had pleaded guilty and has shown considerable remorse with a keen desire not to commit the offences again and to be fully rehabilitated, I impose a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment per charge. …

26     As compared to **_PP v Chong Hou En_**, I noted that in the present case, the Accused faced a single charge (albeit involving the taking of multiple screenshots of the victim’s bra in largely the same sitting), the victim was not a minor, the victim had “agreed” for the Accused to take the screenshots of her bra (albeit as a result of his deception) and the victim’s naked breasts were not captured in the screenshots. Against the abovementioned considerations, I noted that the Accused had abused his authority as a police officer and had brought disrepute to the Singapore Police Force, the Accused’s offending act was premeditated, the Accused was persistent in his offending, and the Accused’s offending act had an adverse impact on the victim. In my view, the indicative starting sentence for the section 417 Penal Code offence in this case was about four months’ imprisonment.

27     Having considered the offender-specific mitigating factors, I was of the view that the sentence of three months’ imprisonment that the Prosecution had submitted for was appropriate, and I so ordered.

## Conclusion

28     The Accused was dissatisfied with my decision and filed a Notice of Appeal. I granted a stay of execution of his sentence. He is currently on bail of $15,000 pending the appeal.
