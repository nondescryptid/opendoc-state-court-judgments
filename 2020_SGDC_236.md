COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS – Sale of services – breach of contract

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 34/2020.\]

20 October 2020

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

1       This is a claim for payment for advertising services rendered by the Plaintiff allegedly for the benefit of the Defendant and allegedly pursuant to an oral agreement between them. I dismissed the claim on 17 September 2020. Pursuant to the Plaintiff’s appeal against my decision, these are my Grounds of Decision.

## Introduction

2       The Plaintiff, Khoo Yong Ker is a sole proprietorship, trading as Barak Transport Services and is in the business of providing chartered bus services and other transport services (“the Plaintiff”). The Defendant is a body corporate (incorporated on 3 July 2009) in the business of providing services in the training of foreign domestic workers (“the Defendant”). The Defendant was founded by the Plaintiff and had the following directors during the following period as relevant for the purpose of this dispute – the Plaintiff (from 3 July 2009 to 28 March 2016); Koh Kian Seng Dennis (“Dennis Koh”) (from 7 April 2010 to 22 January 2013); Tang Yang Ching (“Yang Ching”) (from 6 December 2010 to 22 January 2013); and Chng Swee Siong Allen Joey (“Allen Joey”) (from 7 April 2010 to 11 April 2011) (“the _then_ Directors”).

3       During the period 3 July 2009 to 22 January 2013, the Plaintiff was the Managing Director and substantial shareholder of the Defendant. On 22 January 2013, Jimmy Low Sing Khiang (“Jimmy Low”) and Yap Wee Shong Clement (“Clement Yap”) bought into the Defendant and became shareholders and directors of the Defendant. However, the Plaintiff remained as a director of the Defendant until 28 March 2016 when the relations between him and Jimmy Low and Clement Yap had irretrievably broken down. After 28 March 2016, the Plaintiff ceased to be a director of the Defendant.

## The Plaintiff’s Claim

4       The Plaintiff’s case is that sometime prior to 1 October 2010, an oral agreement was entered into between the Defendant’s _then_\-directors and the Plaintiff for advertisements of the Defendant’s services in the provision of training programs for foreign domestic workers to be affixed and carried on the Plaintiff’s two buses (“the advertisement services”) with the understanding that a reasonable sum would be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff when the Defendant had built up its business and had more substantial means to pay (“the alleged Agreement”).[^1] Thereafter, the Plaintiff’s two buses did in fact carry advertisements of the Defendant’s services during the period from 1 October 2010 till around August 2016.

5       The Plaintiff issued a Tax Invoice to the Defendant on 30 July 2016 for the advertising services. As the Defendant had refused to pay in accordance with the Tax Invoice, the Plaintiff claims the Defendant is in repudiatory breach of the alleged Agreement. And the Plaintiff therefore claims the following from the Defendant:

> (a)     $245,000 under the Tax Invoice for the advertisement services; and

> (b)     $4,000 as costs incurred by the Plaintiff for the removal of the Defendant’s advertisements from its two buses.[^2]

6       In the alternative, the Plaintiff also claims for the carrying of the Defendant’s advertisements on its two buses on a quantum meruit basis at reasonable or comparable market rates. In respect of this, the Plaintiff relies on the charges for advertisement posted on buses of Comfort Delgro, SMRT, Cosmo and/or Lifestyle.[^3] As a second alternative, the Plaintiff claims damages against the Defendant on the basis of unjust enrichment of the Defendant as a result of the advertisement services.[^4]

## The Defendant’s Defence

7       The Defendant denies that that was such an oral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant (through the _then_\-directors on the Defendant’s behalf).[^5] The Defendant also pleads that even if there was such an agreement, the Plaintiff has breached his fiduciary duties by causing or procuring the Defendant to enter into the alleged Agreement with himself and that the Defendant had not ratified or affirmed the alleged Agreement.[^6]

8       The Defendant also pleads that the Defendant’s current directors did not know of the alleged Agreement until the Defendant received the Tax Invoice. Therefore, the alleged Agreement did not form part of the terms and conditions and/or liabilities of the Defendant when the current shareholders and directors Jimmy Low and Clement Yap bought into the Defendant as shareholders.[^7] Further, the Defendant pleads that the Defendant has not received any benefit from the Plaintiff’s advertisement services because the address of the Defendant reflected in the advertisements was the wrong address and the advertisements reflected programmes that were either obsolete or had ceased to be offered by the Defendant for years already.[^8] Additionally, the Defendant says that the Plaintiff is estopped from seeking payment from the Defendant by virtue of the fact that sometime in January 2013, the Plaintiff had told Jimmy Low that the Defendant was not liable to pay for the advertisement services.[^9]

## Facts That Are Not in Dispute

9       It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff was a substantial shareholder and Managing Director of the Defendant prior to and at the time of the making of the alleged Agreement[^10] and he remained as a Director of the Defendant even after Jimmy Low and Clement Yap had bought into the Defendant and had become shareholders and directors of the Defendant in January 2013.[^11] The Plaintiff only ceased to be a director of the Defendant on 28 March 2016.[^12] The Plaintiff was also the sole proprietor of the Plaintiff at all relevant times.

10     In addition, the Plaintiff himself has confirmed that the two other directors of the Defendant at the time of the alleged Agreement, Dennis Koh Kian Sing (“Dennis Koh”) and Allen Joey Chng Swee Siong (“Allen Joey”) gave him “blanket authority” to make decisions for and on their behalf of the Defendant and that he was also the sole signatory for the Defendant’s bank account at all relevant times.[^13]

11     It is also not in dispute that, other than the Tax Invoice of 30 July 2016, there is no documentary or any other supporting evidence such as emails or text messages that show the existence of the alleged Agreement or any of the terms of the alleged Agreement, in particular, terms relating to the payment for the advertising services.

## Issues to Be Determined

12     Arising from the pleaded case of each party, the following are the issues for my determination:

> (a)     Whether there was an oral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant (through the _then_ directors) for the Plaintiff to carry out advertisements on the Plaintiff’s buses for the Defendant’s benefit and for the Plaintiff to be paid a reasonable sum for such advertisements when the Defendant has built up its business and has more substantial means to pay.

> (b)     If there was such an agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant (through the _then_ directors), whether the Plaintiff has breached his fiduciary duty to the Defendant and whether, by virtue of that, the Defendant is not bound by the agreement.

> (c)     Whether the Defendant is liable to the Plaintiff for the bus advertisement charges based on unjust enrichment.

> (d)     Whether the Plaintiff had made any oral representation to Jimmy Low sometime in 2013 such that the Plaintiff is estopped from claiming for the advertising services.

## My Decision

### Whether there was an oral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant for the Plaintiff to carry out advertisements on the Plaintiff’s buses and for the Plaintiff to be paid a reasonable sum for such advertisements when the Defendant has built up its business and has more substantial means to pay

13     In the Court of Appeal decision of _Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 1029</span>, VK Rajah JA stated at \[125\]-\[126\], “\[o\]bjective ascertainment of the parties’ intention (known as ‘the objective principle’) is the cornerstone of the theory of contract and permeates our entire approach to contractual interpretation.”[^14] In the High Court decision of _Chia Ee Lin Evelyn v Teh Guek Ngor Engelin nee Tan_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 330</span>, Lai Kew Chai J in making his findings as regards five oral contracts said (at \[43\]), “…_the primary test of the court when analyzing the totality of the evidence, which is entirely oral, is to find if there was in each alleged oral contract an intention to enter into a binding contract_. It is important to note that the test of a person’s intention is not a subjective one, but _an objective one_. _In other words, the intention which courts will attribute to a person is always that which that person’s conduct and words amount to when reasonably construed by a person in the position of the offeree, and not necessarily that which was present in the offeror’s mind_.”[^15] \[emphasis added\]

14     In his first affidavit of evidence in chief filed for this suit, the Plaintiff said that prior to 1st October 2010, the Defendant through their directors, Dennis Koh and Allen Joey and him had discussed about agreeing to have two of the Plaintiff’s 18-seater buses carry advertisements to publicize the Defendant’s business[^16]. Pursuant to that discussion, the Plaintiff got Dennis Koh who was trading as Trigger Solutions to carry out the decal works. For the decal works, Trigger Solutions invoiced the Defendant directly. There were no details about this discussion or where the discussion occurred in the said affidavit of the Plaintiff. However, at trial, the Plaintiff supplemented his evidence and said this discussion occurred at a physical meeting at the Defendant’s Kelantan Lane office where the Defendant’s _then_ directors, Allen Joey and Dennis Koh met with him and agreed with his proposal to advertise the Defendant’s services on the Plaintiff’s buses for a reasonable sum based on SBS and SMRT rates.[^17]

15     As Dennis Koh was the other director and shareholder of the Defendant at that point in time, if what the Plaintiff has stated is true, then his evidence would be corroborated by Dennis Koh’s evidence. At trial, however, Dennis Koh clarified that the Plaintiff “did not actually consult the minority shareholder directors about any commercial decision he wished to make for the Defendant” and that he would usually make the decision himself[^18] and would merely inform the minority shareholders thereafter for their information[^19].

16     According to Dennis Koh, the Plaintiff told him he “needed help to do some decal stickers for the buses” and that because Dennis Koh has experience doing it, Dennis Koh was told by the Plaintiff to help make the decals[^20]. According to Dennis Koh, the Plaintiff told him that the purpose of doing the bus advertisements was to advertise the Defendant’s services[^21] and the discussion occurred in church (both he and the Plaintiff used to go to the same church)[^22]. Therefore, contrary to the Plaintiff’s claims that there was a discussion about engaging the advertising services of the Plaintiff by the Defendant that occurred at a meeting in the premises of the Defendant, the testimony of Dennis Koh suggests that the discussion, if there was any, was at best, informal and occurred by way of the Plaintiff informing Dennis Koh to help with the decal works, rather than a formal business discussion in which an oral agreement to engage the Plaintiff’s advertising services for the benefit of the Defendant was reached between the Plaintiff on behalf of his sole proprietorship business and the Defendant’s directors on behalf of the Defendant.

17     As regards the terms in that alleged oral agreement, the Plaintiff had insisted that there was an agreement for the Plaintiff to be paid a reasonable amount when the Defendant has built up its business and could pay. In his first affidavit of evidence in chief, the Plaintiff did not fully flesh out the details concerning this term of agreement.

18     This averment of the Plaintiff is contradicted by the testimony of Dennis Koh under cross-examination. According to the testimony of Dennis Koh, it would appear that there were two discussions concerning bus advertisements about the Defendant’s services on the Plaintiff’s buses – the first time was when this was discussed in their church premises[^23]; and another time in the premises of Teleo Pte Ltd which is also where the office of the Plaintiff’s sole proprietorship business was at that time[^24].

19     From the testimony of Dennis Koh regarding the discussion at the church premises between the Plaintiff and him, it would appear that there was no discussion whatsoever about payment for the bus advertisements by the Defendant. In particular, there was no discussion on how and when the Plaintiff would be paid for the bus advertisements[^25]. The general information given by the Plaintiff to Dennis Koh on that occasion was that doing the advertisements was good for the Defendant and if the Defendant did well, “the shareholders would benefit as well”[^26]. Based on Dennis Koh’s testimony, it would appear that the Plaintiff’s intention at that time was to do the bus advertisements gratuitously since promoting the Defendant’s services or programmes would benefit the Plaintiff as Managing Director and majority shareholder of the Defendant as well.

20     According to Dennis Koh, there was another discussion at the premises of Teleo Pte Ltd. At this discussion, it would appear that both Dennis Koh and Yuan Ching were told by the Plaintiff that he expected that when the Defendant did well, the Defendant would pay back to shareholders and to the Plaintiff as well[^27]. However, Dennis Koh contradicted the Plaintiff’s testimony regarding the payment terms in the oral agreement as he was clear that no specifics such as how much the Plaintiff was going to charge the Defendant for the bus advertisements and the rate at which the Defendant was expected to pay the Plaintiff were ever discussed[^28].

21     From the testimony of Dennis Koh, the only inference that can be drawn from the lack of specifics in the discussion as regards payment terms or charging rates is that at the time of the discussion, the intention of all relevant parties was for the bus advertisements to be rendered gratuitously for the benefit of the Defendant. Since the buses belong to the Plaintiff and since, other than the decal works, no further expenses would be incurred in having the Plaintiff’s buses carry advertisements to promote the Defendant’s programmes and services, it was something that the Plaintiff could do with ease and it was something that the other directors of the Defendant had no reason to object to. The “benefit” that the Defendant would obtain from the bus advertisements that was operative in the minds of the _then_ directors of the Defendant was the benefit that would flow to the shareholders should the Defendant do better as a result of the bus advertisements of their services. None of the persons involved at that time had the clear intention for the bus advertisements to be a service to be rendered by the Plaintiff for the benefit of the Defendant per se.

22     In cross-examination, the Plaintiff himself admitted that the alleged Agreement to provide the advertisement services for a reasonable sum is not found in any of the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s books or records anywhere[^29] and that apart from the Tax Invoice issued by the Plaintiff on 30 July 2016[^30], there is no documentary evidence whatsoever of the alleged Agreement[^31]. If there was such an alleged Agreement for the Plaintiff to provide advertisement services for a reasonable sum, there would have been a record of it, if not in the Defendant’s books (since the Plaintiff’s excuse is the Plaintiff would only charge the Defendant upon the Defendant becoming profitable), then, at least a record of the accruing revenue in the Plaintiff’s books. But there is no record whatsoever; not even in the Plaintiff’s accounting records as a revenue item accruing to the Plaintiff from the Defendant.

23     If indeed, it was parties’ intention to enter into the alleged Agreement, it is inexplicable why the Plaintiff’s books have no record of the alleged Agreement when it would have been in the Plaintiff’s interests to have the alleged Agreement recorded in its books so as to obtain payment from the Defendant when due.[^32] The lack of any evidence whatsoever of the alleged Agreement in the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s accounting records shows that the alleged Agreement did not exist. Alternatively, if parties had agreed for the Plaintiff’s buses to carry advertisements of the Defendant’s services, the conduct of the relevant parties such as the Plaintiff and Desmond was such that, when reasonably construed by a person in the position of the Defendant, did not amount to an agreement that the Defendant would pay for those advertising services on the Plaintiff’s buses.

24     The Plaintiff has also exhibited in his supplementary affidavit of evidence in chief chat logs of the WhatsApp group “GMC” created on 30 November 2012, one day before the Defendant’s Shareholders Agreement was executed on 1 December 2012. This chat group consisted of only the Plaintiff, Clement Yap and Jimmy Low and in the Plaintiff’s own words, included chats about contractual matters such as MOM renewing the Defendant’s contract for the Settling-In Programme, the Defendant’s evaluation of the Defendant’s bidding for 26 Evans Road as well as chats on the major operational changes in the Defendant.[^33] When confronted with the question why there was no mention of the alleged Agreement in the chat group, the Plaintiff was evasive and gave excuses but could not clearly account for why the alleged Agreement did not even crop up in their discussions during the time when the relevant parties were discussing about the business activities of the Defendant prior to Jimmy Low and Clement Yap buying into the Defendant[^34]

25     In addition, the evidence also shows that, apart from the Defendant’s contact number, the contents of the advertisements had become irrelevant or obsolete within 1 to 2 years of their being affixed on the Plaintiff’s buses in October 2010. The Plaintiff who was aware of the changes to the contents of the advertisements as regards the courses run by the Defendant, was not at all bothered to correct the outdated information.[^35] When questioned as to why he did not update the information on the decals to reflect the actual courses conducted by the Defendant, the Plaintiff was evasive and could only give excuses such as him “being distracted by the Defendant’s financial problems”, him “having overlooked it” and so on.[^36] The Plaintiff’s lack of care about the accuracy of the contents in the advertisements show me that the advertisements were placed on the Plaintiff’s buses gratuitously as if it was a casual arrangement between two related entities both of which the Plaintiff has a vested interest in and not pursuant to an arms-length commercial transaction in which the Defendant was expected to make payments for.[^37] As counsel put it, the Plaintiff’s attitude shows that the advertisements were meant to be “FOC”.[^38]

26     As regards the Plaintiff’s explanation that the reason why the Tax Invoice was only raised on 30 July 2016, after he had exited as Director of the Defendant was because of the term of the alleged Agreement that the Defendant would pay the Plaintiff only when the Defendant had built up its business and had a more substantial means to pay, it was shown at trial that the Plaintiff had known that the Defendant had become profitable as early as August 2015.[^39] Yet, the Plaintiff did not bill the Defendant until after he had exited from the Defendant as Director. The only excuse he could come up with for not billing the Defendant was to say that he was distracted and had forgotten to invoice the Defendant.[^40]

27     Given all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that the only reason why the Plaintiff did not bill the Defendant in August 2015 when the Defendant first turned a profit is because there was no such alleged Agreement between parties for the Defendant to pay a reasonable sum for the advertisements on the Plaintiff’s two buses when the Defendant becomes profitable.

28     The other evidence that the Plaintiff relied on to say that there was such an alleged Agreement is the testimony of Du Shu Tong, the bus-driver who drove the buses with the advertisements[^41]. At best, his testimony only goes to show that the Defendant’s representatives would have seen the bus advertisements on the two buses. However, having seen the bus advertisements does not equate to knowledge of the existence of the alleged Agreement and the terms of the Agreement or the acceptance of the terms of the Agreement. In fact, it is not denied by the Defendant that the representative of the present Defendant, Jimmy Low that he was aware of the bus advertisements[^42].

29     Other than his own testimony about the alleged oral agreement and the payment term that was allegedly agreed upon between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, the Plaintiff has adduced no other evidence in support thereof. The Plaintiff’s testimony is not supported by his witness, Dennis Koh whether as regards the existence of such an oral agreement or as regards the terms of the agreement which include the term that the Plaintiff would be paid for the advertising services by the Defendant when the Defendant had built up its business and had the means to pay.

30     Having analysed the totality of the evidence on the whole, the only logical conclusion that I can arrive at from the lack of any documentary or other supporting evidence as to the existence and terms of the alleged Agreement is that no such agreement was in fact made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant for the Plaintiff to provide advertisement services on the Plaintiff’s buses for a reasonable sum.

31     As stated above, the primary test of the court when analyzing the totality of the evidence, which is entirely oral, is to find if there was an intention to enter into a binding contract. From the totality of the evidence as analyzed above, it is clear to me that the evidence, when assessed objectively, does not point to a clear intention between the parties that the Plaintiff’s advertisements on his two buses was to be a service for which the Defendant had to pay at the time of formation of the said oral agreement. It was more of a gratuitous act borne out of the goodwill of the Plaintiff since the Plaintiff owned the two buses and since promoting the Defendant would also be beneficial to the Plaintiff as he was the main shareholder and Managing Director of the Defendant then. The absence of any record in the books of the Plaintiff reflecting the prospect of such an accruing revenue further attests to that fact.

32     I therefore find that the Plaintiff has not shown on a balance of probabilities that there was an oral agreement for the Plaintiff to provide the advertising services to the Defendant by placing advertisements on the Plaintiff’s buses and for the Defendant to pay a reasonable sum for the said advertisements when the Defendant had built up its business and had the means to pay.

### Whether the Plaintiff has breached his fiduciary duty to the Defendant and whether, by virtue of that, the Defendant is not bound by the agreement

33     This issue becomes relevant only in the event of a finding in the Plaintiff’s favour that there was a binding oral agreement between the parties for the Defendant to pay for the advertisements of the Defendant’s services on the Plaintiff’s two buses. As I have reached a conclusion against the Plaintiff, technically, it is not necessary for me to go into this issue.

34     Nevertheless, as counsel for the Plaintiff has devoted a substantial part of his submissions to address this issue, for the sake of completeness, I will provide my findings on the same.

35     Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the only argument raised by the Defendant to support their case of breach of fiduciary duties by the Plaintiff is that of “self-dealing”. Counsel for the Plaintiff argued that this is hardly sufficient to make out a case of breach of fiduciary duty and cited the case of _Su Ah Tee & Ors v Allister Lim and Thrumurgan (sued as a firm) & anor (William Cheng & Ors, third parties)_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 159</span> where Justice Belinda Ang stated that before an argument of self-dealing can be made, it is essential to show the lifting of the corporate veil[^43]. Counsel for the Plaintiff argued that in this case, the Defendant has not pleaded facts which show that the corporate veil should be lifted.

36     Based on the testimony of Dennis Koh at trial, it would appear that the Plaintiff is the only one who is actively involved in the management and running of the Defendant’s business, and the other directors such as Dennis Koh prefer to be “sleeping partners”[^44]. Given the dynamics of the relations among them, the fact that the Plaintiff was the one who made decisions on behalf of the Defendant by itself is not enough to show that there was a breach of fiduciary duty during the relevant time of the alleged Agreement.

37     Therefore, even assuming that the Plaintiff had caused the Defendant to enter into the alleged Agreement with the Plaintiff, this fact by itself does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. Counsel for the Plaintiff also sought to rely on Article 99(c) of the Defendant’s Articles of Association to say that the Plaintiff is immune from any allegation of breaches of fiduciary duty. As there is a lack of evidence to show breach of fiduciary duty, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether Article 99(c) of the Defendant’s Articles of Association is applicable in the first place.

### Whether the Defendant is liable to the Plaintiff for the bus advertisement charges based on unjust enrichment

38     As I have already found that the evidence points to a case of the Plaintiff doing the bus advertisements for the Defendant gratuitously, and according to Jimmy Low[^45], this is also the Plaintiff’s representation to him that the advertisements were carry-overs from the previous relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant and that the Defendant was not liable to pay for the advertisements, there is no case for an action in restitution. Thus, the Plaintiff’s claim for unjust enrichment fails.

39     In any event, to succeed in a claim for unjust enrichment, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant has been unjustly enriched by the bus advertisements at the Plaintiff’s expense. In respect of this, the Defendant has shown at trial that apart from the contact number, the other information shown in the bus advertisements had become outdated or obsolete within one to two years after the bus advertisements were put up.[^46] The Plaintiff’s own witness, Dennis Koh also agreed with counsel for the Defendant that the bus advertisements were ineffective as the Defendant had stopped running the programmes advertised therein and had moved on to provide other programmes.[^47] In fact, the Defendant’s main programmes, SIP and CEI, which made up 85 to 90% of its total business were not even featured in the bus advertisements.[^48]

40     Further, the Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to show how the Defendant has been enriched by the Plaintiff’s bus advertisements, such as an increase in the Defendant’s business revenue for instance. Not only has the Plaintiff failed to show that there was enrichment enjoyed by the Defendant, the Plaintiff has also not surfaced any evidence to show that the enrichment enjoyed by the Defendant was unjust which is a requirement to be established in order to succeed in a claim for unjust enrichment (see _Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 801</span> at \[134\]).

41     All in all, the Plaintiff’s claim for unjust enrichment fails.

### Whether the Plaintiff had made any oral representation to Jimmy Low sometime in 2013 such that the Plaintiff is estopped from claiming for the advertising services

42     Counsel for the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff is estopped from claiming payment from the Defendant for the bus advertisements because, sometime in January 2013, the Plaintiff had represented to Jimmy Low that the advertisements on the Plaintiff’s buses were carry overs from the previous relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant when they were related parties and the Defendant was not liable to pay for them.[^49] According to Jimmy Low, it was by virtue of that oral representation that the present Defendant did not insist on the removal of the outdated advertisements on the buses. The Defendant therefore says that it would be unjust and inequitable for the Plaintiff to now go back on his representation to Jimmy Low, a representative of the current Defendant, and claim that the Defendant is liable to pay the Plaintiff for the bus advertisements.

43     On the facts, there is nothing to counter the said allegation of the Defendant. As such, I am satisfied that such an oral representation was made and that by virtue of that, the Plaintiff is also estopped from asking the Defendant to pay for the bus advertisements in any event.

## Conclusion

44     Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s claim fails in its entirety. The Plaintiff’s claim is therefore dismissed with costs to the Defendant, with such costs to be taxed, if not agreed.
