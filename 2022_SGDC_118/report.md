\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9071/2022/01.\]

3 June 2022

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       A government agency, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”), was allegedly the subject matter of an attempted fraud. Before me, the accused, Foo Jie Rong, was charged with engaging in conspiracies with two co-accused persons, Chan Rui Chang (“Chan”) and Foo Ming San (“Ming San”) to dishonestly deceive IRAS to disburse grants under the Wage Credit Scheme (“WCS”). These alleged conspiracies concerned false declarations and falsified documents submitted on behalf of two entities, Foo Jierong Tutors Consultancy Pte Ltd ("FJTC") and F&C Student Care LLP ("F&C'), which related to wage increments and salary payments purportedly made to the accused’s and Chan’s parents, who were purportedly employed by FJTC and F&C.

2       The 38 charges against the accused consisted of the following:

> (a)     Two charges of abetment by conspiracy to cheat IRAS which are offences under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) read with s 116 PC (the “cheating conspiracy charges”); and

> (b)     36 charges of abetment by conspiracy to falsify documents, namely payslips belonging to F&C, which are offences under s 477A PC read with s 109 PC (the “falsification conspiracy charges”).

3       At the start of the trial, the accused, through his then counsel, Mr. Phipps Jonathan, consented to a joint trial of his charges. The co-accused persons were his (then) friend, Chan, and his father, Ming San. Before the trial commenced for the accused, both Chan and Ming San had either pleaded guilty to similar cheating and falsification conspiracy charges involving IRAS, and/or had consented to such charges being considered for the purpose of sentencing.

4       At the trial of the accused before me , both Chan and Ming San, were called to testify for the Prosecution, as were Chan’s parents, and also the accused’s mother. Subsequently, as both Ming San and the accused’s mother gave evidence contrary to what they had earlier informed the authorities in their written statements, the Prosecution applied to impeach the credit of both of these witnesses. As for the Defence, the accused testified, and also called several witnesses to support his account.

5       At the end of the trial, after going through the extensive notes of evidence (“NE”), the exhibits, and the submissions of parties, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the accused on all the charges against him beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted him accordingly. Thereafter, following the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, and after reviewing some documents tendered by the accused as part of his mitigation, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 12 months’ and 24 weeks’ imprisonment on the accused. The accused being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail.

6       I now give the reasons for my decision.

## Undisputed Background Facts

7       At the start of the trial, the Defence and the Prosecution tendered a statement of agreed facts (SOAF), together with agreed documents annexed to the SOAF. The main agreed facts, extracted from the SOAF, and as was evident from positions taken by parties at the trial, are summarised below.

### Co-accused persons, witnesses and entities involved

8       The co-accused persons are:

> (a)     Chan, a 40-year-old male Singaporean, who was the sole director and shareholder of FJTC at the material time, and

> (b)     Ming San, a 62-year-old male Singaporean who is the accused’s father. At the material time, he was the sole partner and owner of F&C.

9       On 5 February 2021, Chan pleaded guilty to one charge under section 417 PC r/w section 116 PC, and 11 charges under section 477A PC, and consented to 26 remaining charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Chan was convicted and sentenced to a total sentence of 22 weeks' imprisonment.

10     On 22 February 2021 , Ming San pleaded guilty to one charge under section 417 PC r/w section 116 PC and 11 charges under section 477A PC, and consented to 38 remaining charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Ming San was convicted and sentenced to a total sentence of 18 weeks' imprisonment.

11     Aside from the co-accused persons, the other persons related to the accused and Chan, who testified at the trial, are:

> (a)     Chan Sing Far, a 69-year-old male Singaporean who was the director of Attentive Insurance Agencies Pte Ltd, working in general insurance. He is Chan's father;

> (b)     Eng Yek Ngoh, a 69-year-old female Singaporean who was, at the material time, working as a part-time cleaner with Crosby Cleaning Services Pte Ltd and Bace Resources Pte Ltd. She is Chan's mother; and

> (c)     Lim Kum Yoke, a 60-year-old female Singaporean. She is the accused's mother and Ming San's wife.

12     FJTC was registered on 24 February 2011 and was a tuition agency. The accused was a director of FJTC from 24 February 2011 to 31 October 2013, while Chan was a director of FTJC from 26 February 2011 onwards. The accused and Chan were joint directors and shareholders of FJTC, until the accused ceased his directorship on 31 October 2013 and gave up his shares on 4 November 2013, leaving Chan as the sole director and owner of FJTC.

13     F&C was registered on 3 August 2011 as a limited liability partnership with two partners, one of them being the accused. F&C was a student care centre, which shared its business premises with FJTC. The accused added Ming San as a partner sometime in September 2013, and the accused himself ceased to be a partner in December 2013. Thereafter, Ming San became the sole owner of F&C. F&C later entered into a Deed of Assignment with a representative from Brightstars Student Care (“Brightstars") in October 2013, and Brightstars took over the operations of F&C from January 2014 onwards.

14      **Although the accused relinquished his formal appointments in FJTC and F&C, he remained involved in their daily operations and management**.

15     At the material time of the offences, Chan was the director of FJTC, while Ming San was the sole partner and manager of F&C. Chan and the accused declared that their parents were employed by FJTC and F&C as follows:

### The Wage Credit Scheme (“WCS”).

16     The WCS was introduced in Budget 2013 as a three-year scheme under which the Government co-funds 40% of the wage increases that are given to Singaporean employees who earned a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. The WCS was intended to incentivise employers to give wage increments to their employees by subsidizing a portion of the increment. The relevant details of the WCS are as follows:

> (a)     Under the scheme, the Government subsidizes 40% of wage increases given by qualifying employers to qualifying Singapore employees during each qualifying period (each qualifying period is each calendar year from 2013 onwards).

> (b)     The subsidy is calculated by taking the employee's gross average monthly wage in a calendar year, including bonuses, and comparing it to the gross average monthly wage paid to the employee in the previous calendar year, to determine whether there has been any wage increase. 40% of the increase will be subsidized by the Government. The maximum gross average monthly wage eligible for subsidy under the scheme is $4,000 a month.

> (c)     The WCS is a fully automated scheme. Employers are not required to submit an application in order to receive the WCS subsidies. Instead, the Central Provident Fund ("CPF") Board calculates the amount of subsidies due to each employer based on CPF contributions an employer makes for its employees. This information is then passed on to IRAS, which will administer the scheme and disburse the wage credits to the employers accordingly in one pay out in the following year.

17     To qualify for WCS, employers had to give wage increases in QY2013 to QY2015 to Singapore Citizen employees who:

> (a)     Received CPF contributions from a single employer for at least 3 calendar months in the preceding year;

> (b)     Have been on the employer's payroll for at least 3 calendar months in the qualifying year (i.e. employer must have paid employee CPF contributions for at least 3 calendar months in the qualifying year);

> (c)     Have at least $50 gross monthly wage increase (up to the Gross Monthly Wage ceiling of $4,000); and

> (d)     Must not also be the business owner of the same entity.

### CPF contributions to purported employees of FJTC and F&C

18     In 2014, Chan made increased CPF contributions to the following purported employees of FJTC, namely, Ming San, Chan Sing Far (father of Chan) and Lim Kum Yoke (mother of the accused). Chan filled in the 'Employer Declaration Form' with the details of these three purported employees and their increased salary payments and submitted the form to IRAS. This entitled FJTC to be eligible for payments of $47,361.60 under the WCS.

19     In 2014, Ming San made CPF contributions to three purported employees of F&C, namely Eng Yek Ngoh (mother of Chan), Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke. Ming San also filled in the 'Employer Declaration Form' with the details of these three purported employees and their increased salary payments and submitted the form to IRAS. This entitled F&C to be eligible for payments of $54,850.51 under the WCS.

### Enquiries by IRAS on salaries paid to purported employees

20     Following enquiries from IRAS for supporting documents from FJTC to show that the salaries had indeed been paid to the three purported employees as claimed, Chan submitted 36 payslips and payment vouchers to IRAS, stating that a certain salary had been paid to that employee in the year 2014. The amount reflected in each payslip and payment voucher is set out below:

23     On 30 September 2015 at about 9.44 a.m., Yeo Xue Liang, an officer from IRAS lodged a police report at the Commercial Affairs Department ("CAD") alleging that FJTC, and F&C may have committed fraud in relation to the WCS.

## Overview of the Prosecution’s case

### Outline of the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence

24     The Prosecution called a total of 11 witnesses to testify. I have summarised their evidence below.

25     PW1 Yeo Xue Liang (“Mr Yeo”) was a compliance officer of IRAS administering the WCS at the material time.

> (a)     He carried out an audit review of FJTC and F&C for qualifying year 2014, because of the substantial wage increases observed, and also the hiring of related employees by these entities. Mr Yeo said that he discovered that both Lim Kum Yoke and Chan Sing Far were indicated to be concurrently employed at FJTC and F&C, and Eng Yek Ngoh, also had the same wage increment pattern as Lim Kum Yoke and Chan Sing Far. Further, he found out that Eng Yek Ngoh was concurrently hired by 3 companies, as well as by F&C, while Lim Kum Yoke, was also operating a drink stall in 2013, which she converted to a café in 2014. As for Ming San, he was also employed as an engineer by DenseLight Semiconductors Private Limited (”DenseLight”) at that time. Further, Mr Yeo observed that different modes of salary payments were used for Ming San, Lim Kum Yoke, and Chan Sing Far compared to other employees.

> (b)     Mr Yeo subsequently sought clarification from Chan about the employment of the qualifying employees of the company (Chan Sing Far, Ming San, and Lim Kum Yoke). He said that FJTC appeared to be operating at a loss of $36,377 for 2014, but that if FJTC received the WCS pay-out of $47,361.60, it would not be in the red.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (c)     Mr Yeo also sought information about the qualifying employees of F&C, following which Ming San submitted payslips for salaries purportedly paid to the employees of F&C in 2014, and also declared that Chan Sing Far, Eng Yek Ngoh, and Lim Kum Yoke were each paid an annual wage of $48,000, that is $4,000 per month in 2014. Mr Yeo said that he assessed that F&C could be incurring a high amount of expenses and was unable to actually maintain that kind of wages for the employees. The company was not financially doing well, and hence the wages were not sustainable. This was relevant since the intention of the WCS was to help businesses through this transition period to increase productivity, and should not be used as a vehicle to actually keep a business afloat.

> (d)     Mr Yeo also stated that on 13th May 2015, IRAS received an anonymous letter declaring that F&C no longer operated its business at the address stated. After reviewing FJTC and F&C, IRAS decided that the wage credit pay-out would be withheld, and a police report should be lodged against FJTC and F&C for the possible fraud of the WCS. On 30th September 2015, he lodged a police report against FJTC and F&C and the case was referred to the CAD.

26     PW2 Chen Shuying Jane (“SIO Jane”) was the former senior investigation officer of the CAD who recorded Ming San’s statement on 26 October 2015 (P109). The statement was recorded in a mixture of Mandarin and English. She testified that he did not request to speak fully in Mandarin, and that after the statement was recorded, it was read back to him and he acknowledged and signed it. He also made amendments to the statement and initiated against these amendments. She said that the statement was recorded accurately and that Ming San did not raise any difficulty or complaint to her during or after the statement recording, nor did he say that he could not understand any part of the statement. His demeanour was normal during the process, and he did not appear confused or “not bothered” about the contents. He also did not rush through the recording. Specifically for the answer to question 251 at page 41, SIO Jane denied Ming San’s claim in court that that this was not his answer, or that she had (simply) typed this in and asked him to sign at the bottom of the page.

27     PW3 Wang Juan (Madam Wang) was a Chinese language teacher who worked at F&C for two months from November to December 2013. She understood the accused to be the person in charge of F&C, and saw him at the premises every day, although she admitted that she does not know who the actual boss was. Neither does she know Ming San, or Lim Kum Yoke, nor had she seen them at the F&C premises. She also does not know Chan Sing Far, or Eng Yek Ngoh. Madam Wang stopped working for F&C in 31st December 2013 when F&C transferred its business to Brightstars. Thereafter, she worked for Brightstars instead from January 2014 until 31st May 2016. She said that F&C did not continue its operation from 31st December 2013 as Brightstars was operating the business using the same premises.

28     PW4 Wong Man Moi (Madam Wong) was a supervisor in charge of operations at F&C from 25th June 2012 to 31 December 2013, and was hired by the accused for her role in F&C. She continued to work for Brightstars thereafter up to the 1st week of February 2014. Madam Wong taught English and also handled the petty cash, collection of fees, as well as salary details of the staff i.e. for herself (salary of $1,600 per month), the Chinese teacher (salary slightly over $1,000 per month), and the auntie (Madam Cheng) who carried out the cleaning and cooking (salary about $850 to $900 per month). Madam Wong does not know of Lim Kum Yoke, Eng Yek Ngoh, and Chan Sing Far as employees of F&C, and she said that they were not on her salary list. She added that F&C was already not making money,[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)and there was no need for other staff for F&C, as they had very few students. As for the accused’s mother, Lim Kum Yoke, Madam Wong said that she would come by to help when there was a need, but she was not the cleaning supervisor as there was no need for one. Instead, the cleaning was done by Madam Chen who was not supervised in her cleaning duties. Madam Wong prepared the salary cheques for herself, the Chinese teacher and the aunty, and also Lim Kum Yoke when she does part time work, which happened when the aunty was on leave. Madam Wong also handled the bookkeeping, and she was never informed that someone else was helping with this.

29     PW5 Tan Tee Hean (“Mr Tan”) was a Chinese language teacher who worked at F&C from November 2012 to November 2013. He was interviewed for his role by Ming San. Mr Tan said that at F&C, his starting monthly pay was $850 and then $900 upon confirmation. Mr Tan’s immediately supervisor was Madam Wong, who was in charge of operations. There was also a Madam Cheng who was in charge of food and cleaning. Mr Tan said that he understood Madam Wong was in charge of F&C, although he has seen Ming San come to F&C’s premises usually in the late afternoon or at night to do repair works, such as repairing the doors and the toilets. Mr Tan said that he had also seen Min San’s wife (Lim Kum Yoke) come to F&C about once a week. There was also a period of time when Madam Cheng went on holiday for around 7 to 10 days when Lim Kum Yoke took over the cooking duties and was at the centre almost daily. Mr Tan had the impression that Chan was the one doing the accounts for F&C. As for the persons by the name of Chan Sing Far and Eng Yek Ngoh, Mr Tan does not have any impression of them, and confirmed that he has not dealt with them in the course of his work.

30     PW6 Chan Rui Chang (“Chan”): He is also known as Constant and was a co-accused. His father is Chan Sing Far and his mother is Eng Yek Ngoh. In essence, the material parts of his evidence were as follows:

> (a)     Chan got to know the accused during their National Service days, and they were also neighbours living in the same condominium. They was a good bond between them at that time. The accused was the founder of FJTC, and Chan became a director of FJTC in 2011, after he invested $200,000. The money was used to fund FJTC’s operations, and also the accused’s second singing album to promote the latter as a singing tutor. Prior to this second album, Chan had also provided support to the accused for his first singing album. Chan said that he did not keep track of the money from FJTC used for the accused’s album, although withdrawals were made throughout 2014 for this.

> (b)     Chan said in 2012, the accused was given access to the bank accounts and funds for the tuition centre, and that even when Chan became the sole director of FJTC, he would discuss the decision making and operation matters of FJTC with the accused before making commitments. [\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Chan stated that he was not the main decision maker for FJTC, but had to go through the accused because it was ultimately the accused’s company and the latter played a major part in the decision making process. Thus, Chan had to have the accused’s permission before he could employ his parents for FJTC, as well as for F&C.[^4] The latter was founded by the accused who subsequently roped his father, Ming San, into the business. F&C’s business was sold to Brightstars Student Care Centre towards the end of 2013, and F&C was no longer in operation thereafter, although the accused and his parents continued to care for at least one student after Brightstars’ operating hours.

> (c)     Throughout the course of their friendship, from 2004 onwards, Chan frequently lent the accused money from his personal savings, and also allowed the accused to use Chan’s credit cards to fund the accused’s personal singing career. The debts that the accused incurred on Chan’s credit card debts amounted to more than $300,000. Only the accused used those credit cards and Chan himself did not use them. Chan also did not know about the amount of credit card debts at the time, as he did not have control of the credit cards which were with the accused. However, by July 2013, the debts totalled about $113,000 in unsecured loans, and Chan was told by his employer to clear off his credit card debts. Chan then took his credit cards back from the accused except for an OCBC card that he allowed the accused to retain. Chan also told the accused to make repayments for the credit card debts, but the accused told Chan he was unable to pay the credit card debts in one lump sum. They then agreed for the accused to make consistent monthly repayments of a minimum of $5,000 to clear the outstanding credit card debts using the monies from FJTC’s account. From mid-2013 to 2014, Chan made monthly cash withdrawals of $5,000 from FJTC’s bank account to repay the outstanding credit card debts incurred by the accused. The accused could also make over the counter withdrawals from FJTC’s account.

> (d)     Chan said that in the middle or towards the end of 2013, the accused wanted to come up with a third album. Chan was hesitant to invest in it because the second album had not achieved the results hoped for, but he relented when the accused pleaded with him. So Chan allowed the accused to withdraw money from FJTC’s account for this purpose, and the third album was released sometime in 2014, with the accused withdrawing monies from the account from 2013 all the way to 2015, but Chan did not keep track of the withdrawals. Aside from FJTC’s account, Chan also used his own personal money for the accused’s third album, and also paid for the accused’s bills arising from a severe car accident, debts incurred by the accused to MOE for breaching a bond, and gambling debts that the accused incurred. While the accused proposed for Chan to become one of the directors of FJTC, Chan said that he did not receive any money as a director, nor did he draw any salary or director’s fees from FJTC. He invested another $200,000 instead. Chan also said that the money from FJTC was channelled to the accused’s singing career instead of loan repayments.

> (e)     Sometime in 2013, the accused, his father, Ming San, and Chan came to know about the WCS, which involved the government co-funding 40% of wage increases given to Singaporean employees, subject to a maximum wage of $4,000. Around July 2013, the three of them had a meeting at the FJTC premises, with the meeting called by the accused. At the meeting, the accused explained how the scheme works and also how they could maximise the grant. Chan said that the three of them then discussed if they could utilise the WCS to get pay-outs for both FJTC, as well as F&C. Following the discussion, Chan called IRAS and made general inquiries about how the WCS worked, but he did not tell IRAS whom he was hiring.

> (f)     The accused told Chan that he would be listing his parents as employees of FJTC and F&C. Chan likewise decided to list his parents, with his mother, Eng Yek Ngoh listed as an employee of F&C, and his father Chan Sing Far listed as an employee of both FJTC and F&C. Chan confirmed that the agreement to list their parents, was made by the accused, Ming San and Chan. [\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> (g)     In September 2013, the accused and Chan drafted employment contracts for their parents, Chan Sing Far, Eng Yek Ngoh, Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke to be listed as employees of FJTC and/or F&C as per their earlier discussion. Chan said that he got the help of the accused on the words used to describe their roles and to expand on their job scopes.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Their employment contracts stipulated that they were to be placed on a 3-month probation period from October to December 2013, that their monthly salary was $51 each during this period, and that it would be increased to $4,000 per month starting from January 2014. They then asked their respective parents to sign the employment contracts. The employment contracts listed the purported roles of Chan Sing Far as business manager of both FJTC and F&C; Ming San as the operations manager of FJTC; Lim Kum Yoke as a housekeeping supervisor of FJTC and a cleaner of F&C; and Eng Yek Ngoh as the bookkeeper of F&C. Chan further stated that the work done by Chan Sing Far, Ming San, Lim Kum Yoke and Eng Yek Ngoh, if any, was minimal.

> (h)     At the time the contract was drafted, Chan Sing Far had his own insurance business, and he did not do work the 35 hours of work for FJTC as indicated. He worked at most 5 to 10 hours, and only on some weeks.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) As for Eng Yek Ngoh, while she was supposed to work as a bookkeeper for F&C, Ming San or the accused would pass Chan the documents for F&C, and Chan ended up doing the work as Eng Yek Ngoh could not do the bookkeeping. From January 2014, as Brightstars had taken over F&C’s operations, the bookkeeping for F&C only referred to the fees collected from 2 students. [^8] Lim Kum Yoke, was indicated as the housing supervisor, but she had no subordinate or anyone to supervise for the entire 2014, and also did not work 35 hours per week. Chan said that the accused and he indicated the number of hours as 35 for each of their parents as per the employment contracts.[^9]

> (i)     Chan said that Chan Sing Far was not given his salary for the whole of 2014, nor was Eng Yek Ngoh paid her salary,[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)as their supposed salaries were reinvested in FJTC to pay off the credit card debts, and also for the accused who needed it for his album.[^11] Chan believes that the accused was aware that his parents did not receive their salaries.[^12]Chan Sing Far also did not perform his duty of finding a new location for F&C, nor did Eng Yek Ngoh perform her bookkeeping duty.[^13] Chan admitted that in his messages to the accused, he stated that he was hesitant to indicate that they were paying $4,000 a month to each of their parents, because he actually wanted to pay them $2,000 so that the company would have more cash flow, and he was also doubtful that a salary of $4,000 a month was justifiable or made commercial sense. However, he relented after the accused’s explanation. For Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke, Chan also did not pay any salary to them in 2014, but would prepare the FJTC payslips and payment vouchers for them which he passed to the accused. The accused said that he would make payments to his parents, although Chan did not personally verify if this was done, nor was he sure whether money was passed by the accused to his parents.

> (j)     As for F&C, Chan confirmed that both his parents, Chan Sing Far and Eng Yek Ngoh did not receive any salary from F&C, although Chan had asked them to sign on the F&C payment vouchers prepared by the accused for each month from January to December 2014 which they did. Chan said that the accused and Ming San did not give him any money to be paid to his parents as salary from F&C. Chan also confirmed that in relation to both FJTC as well as F&C, his parents had signed the payment vouchers even though no salary was paid to them for all of 2014. [\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> (k)     In relation to the CPF payments, as regards FJTC, Chan made CPF contributions for Chan Sing Far, Lim Kum Yoke and Ming San for their purported employments at FJTC, using money from FJTC’s OCBC bank account and occasionally, from his personal bank account. The accused also occasionally made CPF contributions for Chan Sing Far, Lim Kum Yoke and Ming San from his own bank account. As regards F&C, Chan would occasionally help Ming San make CPF contributions to Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke for their purported employment at F&C, via an AXS machine from FJTC’s bank account, and occasionally from his own personal bank account.

> (l)     Chan said that there were occasions when he was hesitant to go ahead with the plan so he tried to delay making the CPF payments. When he did this, he would receive messages from the accused. In one message sent on the 14th of March 2014, the accused had asked him whether he “…really want to wait till last minute then do CPF.” Chan said that the message from the accused was sent on the 14th of the month as the deadline for the CPF payment was on the 15th. Chan explained that he tried to delay making the CPF payments. because he was not very confident of the plan, and because he became aware of the case of an Indian man who was charged because he had abused the PIC grant scheme. Chan even wrote to the accused and expressed his concern that there was a risk in carrying out the plan. He suggested to the accused to give out $2,000 per month instead, and then increase it to $4,000 per month the following year. Chan said that he felt that $4,000 per month was too high to pay for the work done by their parents, and raising the pay for their parents from $51 to $4,000 was difficult to justify. Nevertheless, after the accused responded to him, Chan agreed to continue with the original plan to maximise the WCS claim.

> (m)     There were also messages exchanged between them on 22 November 2014. In one message from the accused sent at 3:03pm, the latter had indicated: “This government money, if fully exploit also, only settle 2/3 of the debt”. Chan said that the “government money” referred to here was the WCS amount. In another of the accused’s responses, the accused had said that “…the trend of students in Yew Tee can’t depend on student income anymore and I have to think of ways to get government money and put his body on the line, in order to have a chance of repayment and getting money.” Chan explained that the reference to getting government money was getting the WCS grant.

> (n)     Chan said that after Brightstars took over the business, for the entire year of 2014 up to March 2015, F&C existed to take care of two students after 5.30 pm who were at the premises. [\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> (o)     In 2015, when IRAS requested for bank statements reflecting the salary payments purportedly made by FJTC to Chan Sing Far, Lim Kum Yoke and Ming San, the accused’s had circled various ATM cash withdrawal transactions on FJTC’s bank statements, and told Chan to inform IRAS that these were the salary payments made to Chan Sing Far, Lim Kum Yoke and Ming San for their employment in FJTC. Chan said that in fact, the ATM cash withdrawals of at least 5,000 that Chan withdrew on a monthly basis from FJTC’s bank account went towards repaying the credit card debts and towards the accused’s personal singing career. Chan confirmed that his parents did not receive any of the cash salaries from FJTC or F&C.

> (p)     On 24th March 2015, IRAS sent a letter to FJTC requesting FJTC to complete an employer declaration form and to provide payslips or proof of payment for 2013 and 2014 for Chan Sing Far, Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke. Chan filled in the employer declaration form dated 24th March 2015 with the details of Chan Sing Far’s, Ming San’s and Lim Kum Yoke’s purported employments and their increased salary payments, affixed the company’s stamp, and then submitted this to IRAS. The list of employees was filled in by the accused.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (q)     On 26th March 2015, IRAS emailed him to request for bank statements as proof of the salary payments made by FJTC to the qualifying employees. On 27th March 2015, Chan emailed IRAS the statement of account of FJTC for 2014, falsely stating that the cash withdrawals, as circled on the statement of account, were salary payments made to the qualifying employees, Chan Sing Far, Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke. Chan said that the transactions were circled by the accused. [\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) Chan also agreed that the figures were circled at random.[^18] As the WCS pay-outs were still not disbursed, Chan sent follow up emails on 13th April 2015, 15th July 2015 and 20th July 2015 to IRAS. Chan also discussed the matter with the accused and sought his input before drafting the emails to IRAS.

> (r)     Chan said that on 26th October 2015, there was a raid on the FJTC premises by CAD, and he had to give a statement. He subsequently met with the accused and Ming San at a coffee shop, where the accused queried Chan about what the latter was asked during the interview. The accused then provided advice “to make things clearer.”[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

> (s)     Subsequently, in relation to the charges involving the WCS, Chan pleaded guilty to engaging in a conspiracy with the accused and Ming San to cheat IRAS into delivering $47,631.60 to FJTC, and to another 11 charges which related to falsifying payslips in relation to Ming San, Lim Kum Yoke and Chan Sing Far to show that they were paid certain salaries in 2014. Chan also admitted to the Statement of Facts relating to these charges. Chan also consented to 26 other charges being taken into consideration towards sentencing, which related to one count of engaging in a conspiracy together with Ming San and the accused to cheat IRAS into delivering monies amounting to $54,850.51 in relation to F&C, and 25 additional charges which related to other payslips that were falsified for Ming San, Lim Kum Yoke and Chan Sing Far in relation to FJTC. He was sentenced to a total sentence of 22 weeks' imprisonment (see \[9\] above).

31     PW7 Chan Sing Far is Chan’s father, and Eng Yek Ngoh’s husband.

> (a)     Sometime at the end of 2013 or beginning of 2014, Chan approached him and asked him to be one of the FJTC staff, saying that they would be entitled to the government grant. He was to be paid $50 for first 3 months after probation, and then $4,000 a month thereafter. Chan Sing Far was subsequently at a meeting with Chan, Ming San and the accused, where Chan Sing Far was told that his was to be a managerial job, to look after the office and to attend administrative matters. They would also tap on his connections as a grassroots leader for him to introduce students to FJTC, as well as to advise on insurance matters. Chan Sing Far said that he was told about his job scope by the accused, and that his job was for FJTC. He did not know that he was to be employed by F&C.

> (b)     Subsequently for the $4,000 a month he was to be paid after probation, Chan had told him that FJTC need the money so it was withheld for reinvestment first. Nonetheless, Chan Sing Far had signed payment vouchers (at pages 461-466 of the Agreed Bundle of Documents) acknowledging receipt of his salary from FJTC even though he did not actually receive $4,000 per month. Chan Sing Far said that he wondered why he was to be paid as much as $4,000 a month for doing so little work, as he did not need to attend at FJTC every day and would go only occasionally when they called him to go down to answer calls and to deal with administrative matters. Chan Sing Far also confirmed that no student joined FJTC on his recommendation, and that he did not find a new venue for the tuition centre. Neither were the insurance policies he recommended taken up by FJTC.

> (c)     While he did not receive his salary, Chan Sing Far said that CPF contributions were made for him. He also said that while he was aware of his employment by FJTC, he only found out that he was also employed by the student care (F&C) after the police investigations,[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) but was not aware of any payments from F&C made to him.

32     PW8 Eng Yek Ngoh is Chan’s mother, and also the wife of Chan Sing Far. She testified that she has been a cleaner for over 10 years. In 2013 and 2014, she worked as a cleaner every Monday to Friday from 6.30am to 10.30pm. Eng Yek Ngoh confirmed that despite payment documents in the agreed bundle which reflected salaries that she was purportedly paid by F&C from January to December 2014, she never worked for F&C, nor had she received any of the purported salary from F&C. She also did not receive $4,000 per month for her work with any of the 10 companies that employed her in 2014.

33     PW9 Foo Ming San (“Ming San”) was a co-accused person, and is the accused’s father. He is also the husband of Lim Kum Yoke.

> (a)     From September 2013 to end of 2014, he was the sole partner and director of F&C, and this business was sold to him by the accused who was its previous owner. He was the boss of F&C even thought he was also working at DenseLight at the material time.

> (b)     Ming San confirmed that he pleaded guilty to 12 proceeded charges on the 22nd of February 2021, including a cheating charge related to him engaging in a conspiracy together with the accused and Chan in relation to the WCS, by declaring to IRAS that Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke were bona fide employees of F&C and that they had been paid a total salary of a $144,000 in 2014, in order to dishonestly induce IRAS into delivering $54,850.51 to F&C. He also pleaded guilty to 11 other charges were under Section 477A of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy to falsify payslips to show that Lim Kum Yoke, Eng Yek Ngoh and Chan Sing Far were paid certain salaries in 2014. He admitted to the 12-page Statement of Facts in relation to these charges, which was read and interpreted to him in Mandarin, and also gave his consent for 38 other charges to be taken into consideration. Ming San was sentenced to a global sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment in relation to all these charges, and he completed serving his sentence on 25th May 2021. However, in court before me, Ming San claimed that he had pleaded guilty because he had no choice as he did not have money to contest the allegations at trial. [\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

> (c)     Ming San said that he had hired Eng Yek Ngoh to do the bookkeeping, and that her salary was $72 for the first 3 months (October, November and December 2013), following which she was given $4,000 monthly. [\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) He described her job as being to tally the receipts submitted. He said he also hired Chan Sing Far, who was a grassroots leader who knew a lot of people, and who was in the insurance business, and believed that Chan Sing Far could recommend him a lot of business. Like Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far’s pay was very little for the first 3 months (October to December 2013) and he was then paid $4,000 a month thereafter. Ming San said that Chan Sing Far’s role in F&C was to act as a business manager, to bring in business for F&C, and also to find a new location for F&C’s operations. Chan Sing Far did not have any fixed working hours and was not required to work at F&C’s premises. Ming San said that for both Eng Yek Ngoh and Chan Sing Far, their initial pay was given to Chan Rui Chan, and thereafter it was given to the accused because Chan Rui Chan would come to work very late. For both Eng Yek Ngoh and Chan Sing Far, their employments were eventually terminated because they did not produce results, and Ming San said that he was losing money. When asked about the WCS, Ming San claimed that he would definitely make a loss under the WCS because of CPF and income tax. However, he was willing to participate as he “…want them to bring in business for the company.” [^23] Ming San said that he had to make the CPF payment for them at the AXS machine, although he would usually ask the accused to do this.

> (d)     For the WCS, he said that Chan’ and his son (the accused) had asked him to go to the office to have a meeting, during which Chan had said that the WCS was “an encouragement” from the government. Chan had also said that he had checked with the CPF board, which told hm that it was not an offence and that the government did not control the salary. Ming San further said that both ‘Constance’ (i.e. Chan) and he were the bosses, while the accused was just an employee, who was present at the meeting because Chan wanted him there “as a witness.” Ming San said that he did not think that the accused had spoken to him about the scheme. Following this discussion, Eng Yek Ngoh and Chan Sing Far, as well as Ming San’s wife, Lim Kum Yoke, were hired as employees. The latter’s role at F&C was to be a supervisor to the teachers and the cook, to help out with the housekeeping, to buy groceries, and also to cover the role of anyone who did not report for work. Lim Kum Yoke’s salary was less for the first 3 months, in October to December 2013, and then increased to $4,000 month. Ming San confirmed that from end 2013 and for 2014, Lim Kum Yoke was also running a drink stall or a café. For the first 3 months of their employment, all three of them were on probation. After the probation period ended, their job scope did not change. [\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) Ming San claimed that salaries were paid to Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far, and Lim Kum Yoke, using his own personal salary, as well as from the sale of his Malaysian house. As for his work in FJTC, Ming San said that he was also paid all his monthly salaries, including for all the months in 2014.

> (e)     For F&C, Ming San said that when he sold it to Brightstars, the business was not making money but was suffering losses. Ming San said that even after it was sold to Brightstars, there were 2 children who needed to stay back until 7.00pm, and Ming San would stay behind to take care of them after Brightstars closes at 5 pm until their parents came for them. Apart from these 2 students that he would care for about 2 hours, F&C was not in operation, and there was no other income for F&C in 2014,[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) Ming San said that he was paid $10-$20 per student from their parents every time the student stayed back late. Ming San also said that as per the filing to IRAS that he signed off on, the revenue for F&C in 2014 was $3,600. This amount include the deposit that he had collected for 10 students earlier.[^26] Ming San claimed that even after he had sold the business to Brightstars and F&C was no longer in operation, he continued to hire the 3 employees i.e. Eng Yek Ngoh and Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke. However, Ming San said that after a few months, as they did not produce any result, he terminated their services.

> (f)     As for FJTC, Ming San said that he was hired as a facility manager, and he took care of the equipment and went there in the afternoon, after completing his own work in the morning. For his work at FJTC, Ming San said that he was paid in cash by Chan, and if the latter arrived late that night, the money would be passed to the accused, who would then give it to Ming San.

> (g)     The Prosecution subsequently applied to impeach Ming San’s credit, using a statement that he made to CAD on the 26th of October 2015. I will deal with the inconsistencies and the effect of the impeachment at a later stage. Suffice to say, Ming San agreed that after the statement was recorded, he was given an opportunity to read through it, although Ming San claimed that there were certain things he wasn’t sure about because his English was not so good. However, he agreed that he had no complaints to raise about the entire statement-recording process, and that this was a statement that he had given voluntarily to CAO Jane Chen. [\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

34     PW10 Lim Kum Yoke is the accused’s mother, and the wife of Ming San. The Prosecution applied to impeach her credit in view of the inconsistencies in her statement (P111) with what she testified to in court.

35     PW11 Cheng Kim Yeok (“Madam Cheng”) was a former employee of F&C from 2011 to 2013 as a cook cum cleaner. She joined Brightstars in 2014 when F&C had sold the business to Brightstars. She testified that she did not have a supervisor when she was working at F&C, and neither did she supervise anyone. During the entire period of time that she worked at F&C, she was the only person doing the cleaning and preparing food for the students. Her colleagues at F&C were Madam Wong (“Wendy”), Mr Tan and Wang Juan, and both Madam Wong and Wan Juan also joined Brightstars like her after F&C sold the business to it. At F&C, Madam Cheng’s monthly salary was $700, and she would be paid through cheques passed to her by Madam Wong. Madam Cheng recognised the accused as the principal of F&C, and also Chan who works there, but she does not know of Ming San, Lim Kum Yoke, Chan Sing Far, or Eng Yek Ngoh. She also has not met the accused’s or Chan’s parents when she worked at F&C, although she confirmed that her work was at the back of the premises, and she may not have seen them. Madam Cheng does not know who took over her duties when she went on leave.

36     PW12 Lim Xuan Ying Amy (“Amy”) was formerly a senior investigation officer of the CAD who recorded Lim Kum Yoke’s s 22 Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) statement on 26 October 2015, 0958 hrs (P111). Amy confirmed that an interpreter, Alvin Loh (now deceased), had read back the statement to Lim Kum Yoke in Mandarin. The latter had been given a chance to make amendments, and had requested for several amendments to be made, following which she signed off on the statement.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) Amy testified that if Lim Kum Yoke had required any clarification to the questions asked, Amy would have clarified them. Further, the interpreter had translated the entire statement back to her, and she had no issues with it. Amy also confirmed that the answers recorded on the statement were given by Lim Kum Yoke.

### Prosecution’s arguments in brief

37     To summarise, there were essentially two separate sets of charges against the accused, all broadly connected with alleged conspiracies that the accused engaged in with Chan and Ming San to cheat IRAS into disbursing grants under the WCS, and also in relation to the false declarations and documents submitted in connection with these conspiracies. In particular, the false declarations related to the purported wage increments and salary payments in respect of the purported employment of the accused’s and Chan’s parents. To reiterate, the 38 charges that the accused claimed trial to consisted of:

> (a)     Two cheating charges in which he was alleged to have conspired with Chan and Ming San to deceive IRAS by falsely declaring the salaries of the purported employees of FJTC and F&C, with dishonest intent to induce IRAS to disburse the following sums of money to FJTC and F&C, when no such salaries were paid to said purported employees. The details of the charges are set out below.

38     The Prosecution’s arguments are outlined in greater detail below.

#### The accused’s involvement in the cheating conspiracy charges

39     The Prosecution argued that the accused had played a leading role in the cheating conspiracies. In this regard, the Prosecution pointed to:

> (a)     The 2013 meeting between the accused, Chan and Ming San, where the accused had admittedly performed the manual workings on the whiteboard during their discussion of the WCS, and advised the co-accused persons on how to maximise the WCS.

> (b)     Further evidence of the accused’s role could be seen from the WhatsApp messages he exchanged with Chan (P107) about the WCS, and his testimony, where he had set out his role in getting the government funds (i.e. the WCS grant)[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). The accused had also stated that it was his idea to get the maximum pay-outs for FJTC and F&C under the WCS, and that the money so obtained would only settle 2/3 of the debts.

40     Next, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s and Chan’s parents were not _bona fide_ employees of FJTC and F&C for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, no actual salaries were paid to them for their purported employment by FJTC and/or F&C in 2014. As could be seen from the testimonies of Chan and those of his parents, as well as from Ming San’s police statement given on 26 October 2015 (P109), and in the Statement of Facts (P110) that Ming San admitted to at his plead guilty mention (P108), Ming San had implicated himself and the accused in the conspiracy to cheat IRAS and falsify payslips. The Prosecution had also applied to impeach both Ming San and the accused’s mother, Lim Kum Yoke, based on inconsistent accounts they gave in court, that contradicted their earlier statements, and argued that the evidence they gave in court purportedly in favour of the accused, could not be believed. Instead, the Prosecution argued that Ming San’s previous accounts in these statements - that he did not pay F&C salaries to Chan’s parents and to Lim Kum Yoke, and that he himself did not receive salaries from FJTC in 2014 - should be preferred to his contrary testimony in court. This was in accordance with the factors set out in s 147(6) of the Evidence Act, Cap 97 (EA).

> (b)     Second, the Prosecution argued the work done by the parents of the accused and Chan, if any, was minimal and contrived to justify being purportedly paid by FJTC and F&C. The Prosecution pointed out that:

>> (i)       Chan Sing Far was running his own insurance business throughout this time, as was Ming San who was employed by Denselight. As for Eng Yek Ngoh, she did not perform her supposed role as the bookkeeper of F&C, and for Lim Kum Yoke, who was supposedly holding dual full-time roles of cleaning supervisor of _both_ FJTC and F&C in 2014, there was actually already a full-time cook-cum-cleaner working at F&C, Madam Cheng since 2011, who was the only one performing such duties.

>> (ii)       The purported increase in salary for Ming San was also inflated and not justified, and the same could be said about the purportedly gross monthly wages of $8,000 ($4,000 from FJTC and F&C each) to Lim Kum Yoke for cleaning the same premises shared by both FJTC and F&C. As for Chan Sing Far, his purported monthly salary of $8,000 similarly could also not be justified, and in fact, he was effectively paid for doing nothing since he did not achieve the objective of securing new premises that he was supposedly paid for (or any other objective).

> (c)     Third, further evidence that the salaries purportedly paid to the accused’s and Chan’s parents were not genuine, was the fact that the manner in which they were paid (by cash as opposed to by cheque), was also different from how the legitimate F&C employees like Madam Wang, Madam Cheng, and Mr Tan were paid.

41     In addition, the Prosecution submitted the accused had exploited the WCS for personal enrichment rather than the legitimate benefit of the employees or for any business purpose, pointing to the fact that only the family members of the conspirators were involved in the WCS, and were given wage increments, and not the other employees. Further, that the WCS was to be used to benefit the accused in terms of paying for his singing career, or to paying for the debts Chan had incurred towards the accused’s singing career, was apparent from what the accused had admitted in his statement and in his message to Chan that “These govt money if fully exploit also only settle 2/3 of the debts”.

42     Moreover, despite F&C not even operating as a business in 2014, it was nonetheless used to extract more grants from the WCS scheme by ‘double counting’ Lim Kum Yoke and Chan Sing Far for their supposed dual employments at FJTC and F&C. Finally, in March 2015, the accused and Chan had discussed the need for F&C to continue to “be in existence” in order to obtain more grants under the WCS, despite F&C’s operations having effectively ceased as of end 2013 (apart from “2 remaining students” that they would take care of after 5.30p.m.). The accused also continued to tell Chan that they had to maximise the WCS grant,[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) and “milk it as much as we can”.[^31]

#### The accused’s involvement in the falsification conspiracy charges

43     The Prosecution argued that the 36 F&C payslips were falsified as none of the accused’s or Chan’s parents were _bona fide_ employees of F&C, given that F&C was not operating as a business in 2014, and any salary purportedly paid out as stated in the payslips were thus false entries made with intent to defraud IRAS. The Prosecution also submitted that the accused had a motive for engaging in a conspiracy to falsify the F&C payslips, being the one who had brainstormed ideas to obtain government funds because he needed money to repay debts and to further his personal singing career.

44     In addition, the Prosecution pointed out that the accused had stated that he “think(s)” that he had helped Ming San to prepare the payslips, based on templates obtained from Chan, and that these documents were prepared for purposes of submission to the IRAS.

## Overview of the Defence’s Case

45     The accused was originally represented by Mr. Phipps Jonathan until 17th June 2021, when the accused discharged Mr Phipps, and thereafter, represented himself in court. Aside from testifying in his own defence, the accused also called witnesses to testify for his defence.

### Outline of accused and other defence witnesses’ evidence

46     As regards the accused’s evidence, he essentially denied any conspiracy or intention to cheat IRAS, claiming only that his “intention is to maximise the grant and not to cheat the grant”, and that Chan and his parents were “doing everything legally”. He claimed that he was “just trying to give \[his\] best advice how to maximise the scheme in a legal way”.34 He likened their actions to eating as much as one wanted at a buffet that one had paid for, which was something that was permitted. The accused also claimed that his involvement was to do the “mathematical calculation” and provide advice “according to what was legal”.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) Further, the accused argued that the WCS pay-outs have nothing to do with \[him\], and that he would not get a single cent or benefit from it.[^33]

47     The accused said that Chan’s parents, namely Chan Sing Far and Eng Yek Ngoh were “legitimate employees to the best of \[his\] knowledge” because they “appear\[ed\] for the company events” and also “turned up for all the government medical check-up”.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) Further, Chan was ultimately “the boss” of FJTC and whether Chan wanted to employ his own parents was up to him. The accused also claimed that he did not know that Chan had “any private arrangement with his parents” and there was “no abetment at all”.[^35] As for the accused’s own parents, namely Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke, the accused also claimed that they were legitimate employees, whose pay could be revised at their employer’s discretion.[^36]

48     As for the payslips belonging to F&C, the accused claimed that it was “not \[an\] afterthought to do a fake payment voucher” as documents to prove to IRAS that his parents had received their salaries.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) He testified that “\[his\] parents also signed the payment voucher in order to get their salary”. 38

49     As for the witnesses that he called, these were essentially former employees, students or vendors of FJTC, who testified largely as to their dealings with the accused and their interactions with him. Their evidence can broadly be summarised as follows:

> (a)     DW2 Tan Keng Yong: He is a designer and printer, who stated that his company printed name cards and multiple batches of flyers for FJTC and F&C from 2013 to 2015. He dealt with Chan, the boss of FJTC, and Ming San, the boss of F&C. He said that he would travel there at least 3 to 4 times a year, usually in the afternoons or at about 7 or 8 pm on weekdays, and would see Ming San, Chan, Lim Kum Yoke, “an admin girl” and the students. Lim Kum Yoke would usually be doing some work such as cleaning up in the centre.

> (b)     DW3 Tan Yee Kun: He is chartered accountant who prepared the accounts, the financial statement and the ledger for FJTC for 2013-2014. He said that at that time, there was more than enough revenue to pay all the staff’s salaries. On questioning, he agreed that he took the documents generated by FJTC at face value,[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) and in relation to the payment vouchers, he would not go any further to ask if salary payments were (actually) made, and “as long as the payment voucher signed by the preparer and the receiver, \[he\] will consider it as paid out”.[^39] The witness also confirmed that compared to 2013, FJTC made a loss in 2014 (from a profit of $99,000 to a loss of more than $36,000), as the amount FJTC collected in tuition fee dropped by more than $60,000.[^40]

> (c)     DW4 Lim Si Seng (“Lim”), was formerly a tutor with FJTC between 2014 and 2015. He recognised the accused, Chan, and Ming San. Lim had seen Ming San fixing a light at the premises once, although Lim said that he did not see Ming San often, and does not know what he does at FJTC.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)

> (d)     DW5 Daniel Chan Wei Min (“Daniel”), was formerly the accused’s student, and he became a Chinese tutor with FJTC in 2014, teaching there for about 8 or 9 months. He said that the accused and Chan interviewed him for the job. Daniel said that the accused’s mother would come over to the premises usually at night at about 8 to 9 pm. She would cook for the accused, and he also thinks that she does cleaning. As for Ming San, Daniel does not know what he does although he has seen Ming San there.

> (e)     DW6 Benjamin Chang Yong Kuang (“Benjamin”), was formerly the accused’s student at FJTC in 2013 and 2014. He said that he had seen the accused’s mother clean the tables and vacuum the premises when he was there.

> (f)     DW7 Jeanette Tan Hong Lin (“Jeanette”), was formerly a part time admin assistant at FJTC in 2014, who would collect payments from students’ parents for their tuition fees. Half of them paid in cash and the other half by cheque. She would record the cash received in this way in a booklet. She also said that Chan’s mother (Eng Yek Ngoh) attended the company dinner on 15 February 2015.

### Defence’s arguments in brief

50     The accused tendered a set of written submissions. An outline of the Defence’s arguments is set out below.

51     The accused submitted that Lim Kum Yoke and Ming San were already employees of F&C and FJTC respectively before the WCS scheme was introduced, so clearly they were not employed for the sake of obtaining the WCS grant. The evidence of Madam Wong and Mr Tan, as well as that of several defence witnesses was that they had seen Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke working in the centre, including seeing Ming San fixing the light and the door, and Lim Kum Yoke buying groceries and holding a broom in her hand.

52     Further, the evidence of Mr Yeo from IRAS was that it was not illegal to increase the salary of an employee who is related to the employer, but doing minimal work in the company, since the scheme was meant to benefit the employee. In addition, contrary to the Prosecution’s initial arguments, FJTC did have enough cash to pay out the increased salaries Ming San, Lim Kum Yoke, Chan Sing Far and Eng Yek Ngoh.

53     Separately, while the Prosecution claimed that F&C was not operational in 2014, it was still a live company, even though it had limited activities and drastically reduced business, as it still had 2 students still under its charge. This was not unlike companies like Teo Heng KTV Studio that still paid their employees even when there was essentially nothing for them to do, other than doing minimal cleaning of the premises during the Covid-19 pandemic.

54     The accused criticised the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, arguing that:.

> (a)     Chan was a tardy person and who was prone to remember things wrongly or confuse one thing for another. An example was the error he made where he wrongly identified Anna as the accountant of the company.

> (b)     The statements of Ming San and Lim Kum Yoke (used to impeach them) were also not credible.

> (c)     On Chan Sing Far’s claim that he only knew that he worked for FJTC but was unaware of F&C, and also that his CPF statements only reflected contributions from one company (FJTC), the accused argued that Chan Sing Far’s testimony was contradicted by evidence tendered by the Prosecution, and also by photographs showing that the F&C signboard, which was prominent in size and colour, was placed right above the main entrance of the premises where Chan Sing Far has to pass through. As for Eng Yek Ngoh’s total denial of everything, ranging from her claim of never having worked for the company, never having seen any of them before, and never having been to the premises, her evidence was contradicted by the SATA check-up receipts and the photograph of her at the company dinner (buttressed by testimonies from defence witnesses present at the dinner). Further, the employment agreements of both Chan Sing Far and Eng Yek Ngoh were tendered in evidence. The accused alleged that these witnesses wanted to get him into trouble after their son, Chan, had gone to prison.

55     The accused insisted that while they (Chan, Ming San, and he) had tried to maximise the grant, they did not try to cheat IRAS, and there was no deception or dishonesty in their dealings with IRAS. He said that in his statements to the CAD and in his evidence in court, he had denied any intention to cheat IRAS, and has been honest and upfront that his role was to advise on how to maximise the grant. He insisted that there had been no lying, no deception involved and no dishonesty. In addition, the accused claimed that he had made monthly trips to the bank to withdraw his parents' salaries and passed these to them, and also believed that the same was done for Chan’s parents. Thus, everything was done according to the book and he did not break any law.

56     The accused argued that in the WhatsApp messages between Chan and him that were tendered by the Prosecution, he had repeatedly said to do everything legally and even raised his concern that Chan's parents would be accused of being phantom workers as they were working from home and no one else could see them doing work. This was unlike the situation with his parents who could be seen working in the premises. The accused said that to his knowledge, Chan Sing Far and Eng Yek Ngoh were employed by FJTC and F&C, and they were supposed to work from home. He claimed to have genuinely trusted Chan, and that he had no knowledge of the private arrangement between Chan and his parents whereby Chan did work that was supposed to be done by Eng Yek Ngoh, and where Chan had borrowed their salaries when he was financially strapped.

57     Chan had also verified with IRAS that it was ok to employ their parents and to increase their salaries to SGD$4,000 and that it was not illegal. The accused reiterated that IRAS was like a buffet provider and increasing the salaries to the maximum was allowed. He likened this to eating as much at a buffet as possible, so long as they fulfilled the criteria and honestly declared the employees to be their parents and spouses.

58     As regards the payslips, the accused reiterated that he had prepared these by filling in the templates and printing them out according to the respective bosses' instructions. He said that his position was buttressed by the answer he had given to question 284 to 286 of his statement (P114), which showed that he did the physical preparations (filling in and printing) according to what his employer, Chan, had requested.

59     As for his parents’ salaries, the accused insisted that he had passed the salaries to them and had no reason to think the payslips were falsified. Further, the employees who were witnesses for the Prosecution and the Defence, had testified that payslips and payment vouchers were the normal documents prepared and signed every month by all employees, which showed that the claim that the payment vouchers and payslips for Chan and his parents were falsified was groundless. Further, the employee declaration forms submitted to IRAS was filled in by Chan whom he had reminded to be honest in the declarations.

60     The accused also insisted that there was no personal enrichment for him from the WCS, as any reimbursement would be credited to the companies and would only be used to repay whatever the companies and respective directors have forked out in cash in terms of salaries and CPF payments. Further, the beneficiaries would only be the employees, both in salaries and CPF money credited into their CPF accounts, which the accused claimed was what the scheme was designed for. The accused also said that his family and he had suffered financially, and his father, Ming San, who was unable to pay his legal fees anymore when his case was going on, had been advised by his legal representatives to plead guilty, and they would act to get his sentence overturned when the accused had won his case.

## The Law

61     Before analysing the evidence to determine if the Prosecution has successfully proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, I will set out the main legal principles applicable to the current charges. In this regard, the law that applies to the 38 charges against the accused is quite clear and uncontroversial. I set this out in brief below.

### Cheating and inducing a delivery of property

62     As made clear in _Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 946</span> (“_Gunasegeran_”) at \[40\]–\[44\], the following three elements must be proven in order to establish the offence of cheating punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code:

> (a)     Deception must have been practiced on the victim;

> (b)     There was inducement such that the victim delivered any property to any person; and

> (c)     There must be a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property.

63     As regards the element of “deception”, this has been defined as the inducing of a person to believe to be true something which the person making the representation knows is in fact false (see _Gunasegeran_ at \[42\]). It may constitute an act, representation or omission, and need not be direct or a personal representation (see _Chua Kian Kok v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 826</span>). Further, a dishonest concealment of facts is deception (see _Seaward III Frederick Oliver v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 89</span>).

64     As for the second element of “inducement to deliver property”, it was held that in _Seaward III Frederick Oliver v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 89</span> (“_Seaward_”) at \[28\], that the false pretence need not be sole, operative reason for the delivery of property, so long as it “played some part” in the process. Further, the High Court held in _Gunasegeran_ at \[43\] that there is no requirement for the inducement to be communicated orally, although in most cases that would usually be the case. There is also no need for the inducement to be express, and that it can be reasonably inferred from the surrounding circumstances that this was clearly what the deceiving party was seeking to do.

65     As regards the third element, the _mens rea_ set out for cheating charge is that of “dishonesty”. “Dishonestly”, in turn, is defined in s 24 PC to mean an intention to cause wrongful gain to any person or wrongful loss to any person. “Wrongful loss” is further defined in s 23 PC as “loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled”.

### Falsification of documents (F&C payslips)

66     As regards the 36 charges of falsification, under s 477A PC, the elements that have to be established are as follows:

> (a)     A person makes or abets the making of any false entry in any book, electronic record, paper, writing, valuable security or account which belongs to or is in the possession of his employer;

> (b)     That the person is a clerk, officer or servant, or is employed or acting in the capacity of a clerk, officer or servant; and

> (c)     That person does so wilfully and with intent to defraud.

67     It is clear from the decision of the Court of Appeal in _PP v Li Weiming_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 393</span> that “intent to defraud” in s 477A PC need only be a general one. Thus, the court held at \[85\] that “(i)t is clearly possible that a person may carry out an act with an intent to defraud by practicing a deception with the aim of causing an injury, loss or detriment or obtaining an advantage, even if he is indifferent as to who the object of his fraudulent intent is.” Further, at \[85\], the court made it clear that “(s)ection 477A itself does not make the intent to defraud a specific person an essential ingredient of the offence and the explanation makes it clear that it is sufficient to satisfy the required _mens rea_ by alleging a general intent to defraud.”

### Abetment by conspiracy

68     All the 38 charges involve the additional element of abetment by conspiracy, although in the case of the first two charges of abetment to cheat, the offence was not actually successfully carried out, as reflected by the inclusion of s 116 PC in the charge, while the 36 charges of abetment by forgery were completed, as reflected by s 109 PC being part of each of these charges. Explanation 2 to s 108 PC further makes it clear that to constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. The distinction between the use of s 109 or 116 PC in the charges only affected the maximum prescribed punishment that a court can impose if the primary elements of the offence are established.

69     Further, Explanation 5 to s 108 PC provides that “(i)t is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed”.

70     In _Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 258</span> (“_Shi Ming Yi_”), the High Court summarised the essential elements of a charge of abetment by conspiracy at \[39\]-\[41\] as follows:

> \[39\]...    The requirements for the offence of abetment by conspiracy were spelt out in _Lee Yuen Hong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 604</span> at \[38\]:

>> On a charge of abetment by conspiracy, the Prosecution has to establish the following elements:

>> \[1\]    the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons, in a conspiracy;

>> \[2\]    the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and

>> \[3\]    an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.

> \[40\]  Proof of an agreement between the parties can be inferred from the words and actions of the parties, as elaborated upon in _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 302</span> at \[20\]. I quote:

>> One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been coordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.

> \[41\]  The inference of a conspiracy was clarified by Yong CJ in _Er Joo Nguang v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 756</span> at \[35\]:

>> So far as proof goes, conspiracy is generally a matter of inference, deduced from certain acts of the accused parties, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. Both the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties before and after the alleged commission of the crime will be useful in drawing an inference of conspiracy … An inference of conspiracy would be justified only if it is inexorable and irresistible, and accounts for all the facts of the case.

71     In determining whether the _mens rea_ of conspiracy is made out, liability does not require that the different participants in the conspiracy be equally informed as to the details of the conspiracy were to be carried out (see _Nomura Taiji v Public Prosecutor_ \[1998\] 1SLR(R) 259 (“_Nomura Taiji_”) at \[109\]-\[110\]. In _Quek Hock Lye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 1012</span> (“_Quek Hock Lye”)_, the Court of Appeal referred to _Nomura Taiji_ and held (at \[41\]) that the approach to be taken was to establish whether knowledge of a particular fact can be characterised as “a mere detail” or “an integral element of the underlying agreement as part of the main object of the criminal conspiracy”.

## Assessment of the Evidence

### General

72     I start off with two general comments.

73     First, there were many preliminary facts that were undisputed. This was not surprising since much of the evidence was based on the contents of documents, such as bank account statements, declaration forms and other documents presented to IRAS, as well as written messages between the accused and Chan. Many of these documents were included in the annexes to the SOAF as “Exhibits to be admitted by agreement”. Documents relating to the previous plead guilty proceedings involving the co-accused persons were also tendered as evidence.

74     Second, there was essentially no dispute as to the law. This was again unsurprising since the provisions in the Penal Code, and the cases that apply in relation to such offences, as summarised above, have set out clear definitions, requirements and principles that are easily understood and applied.

75     With these general comments made, I move on to consider the two types of offences that the accused was alleged to have committed i.e. the two cheating conspiracy charges involving the accused and both co-accused persons where the named victim was IRAS, and the 36 falsification conspiracy charges involving falsification of payslips belonging to F&C, which were offences the accused was alleged to have committed with his father, Ming San.

#### The cheating conspiracy offences

##### (1)    The accused and his co-accused persons, and the dire financial situation in 2013 and 2014

76     Chan, one of the main Prosecution witnesses and a co-accused person, was previously on good terms with the accused. Thus, Chan had invested in the accused’s singing career and in FJTC, and subsequently took over FJTC from the accused, apparently in connection with large debts that Chan had incurred due to his investment in the accused’s singing career. However, the accused remained the main decision maker in FJTC, and he continued to be given access to the funds and bank accounts of FJTC. As for the other co-accused person, Ming San, he was the father of the accused, and the person who officially took over F&C from the accused.

77     Nevertheless, as set out at \[10\] of the SOAF “(a)lthough the accused relinquished his formal appointments in FJTC and F&C, _he remained involved in their daily operations and management._”

78     In 2013, there was clearly financial pressures on both Chan and the accused, as Chan was told by his company to clear off his credit card debts, and Chan had to come up with an arrangement with the accused for Chan to make withdrawals from FJTC’s accounts. The accused also needed money to pay for his third album as he felt that this was the final chance he had in trying to make a success of his singing career, in light of his advancing age. In addition to financing the third album, based on Chan’s evidence, the accused also had hospital and medical bills to pay for in relation to a severe car accident he was involved in, as well as gambling debts, and debts arising from his breaching a bond with MOE.

79     Further, the prospects of continuing to earn tuition revenue from students where FJTC and F&C were located, were poor in light of the trend of (declining) student numbers in the Yew Tee location.

##### (2)    The accused’s involvement with the WCS

80     Under the difficult financial circumstances that they were facing in 2013, there was no dispute that a meeting was held in mid-2013 involving the accused, Chan and Ming San. According to Chan, this meeting was initiated by the accused, during which the accused discussed the WCS and informed the rest of his co-accused persons how to maximise the WCS returns by employing the accused and Chan’s parents as employees of F&C and/or FJTC. Similarly, Ming San, in his Statement of Facts (P110) at \[10\] agreed that the accused was the one who came up with the plan, and that both Chan and Ming San subsequently agreed to take part.

81     As pointed out by the Prosecution, further evidence of the accused’s crucial role in this plan to could be seen from the WhatsApp messages that he exchanged with Chan (P107) about the WCS , where the accused had stated that he had thought of ways to get “govt money” (i.e. the WCS grant) [\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42), and that the entire plan to obtain a maximum pay-out for FJTC and F&C under the WCS was “\[his\] idea”[^43], and also that “(t)hese govt money if fully exploit also only settle 2/3 of the debts”. The accused also admitted to acting in concert to start Chan’s parents with “580 in both companies.” The relevant WhatsApp messages, with parts highlighted in bold italics, are reproduced below.

82     Clearly, not only did the accused continue to play an integral role in the management and operation of FJTC and F&C in 2013 – 2015, it could be seen that he was in fact the main driver and operator of the conspiracy to exploit the WCS scheme, and to get government funds for them (Chan and himself) at a time when the accused was in debt, and Chan was also under pressure (from his company) to pay off the credit card debts incurred by the accused. Thus, Chan and Ming San were essentially following the accused’s lead in trying to take advantage of the WCS. In fact, based on Chan’s testimony, on occasions when Chan hesitated or wavered in the plan to exploit the WCS, it was the accused who persuaded him to continue with it.

83     I would add that the fact the accused stated that the money from the grants would only settle 2/3 of the debts (of Chan and the accused) showed that their intent was always that the WCS monies – rather than to be used to benefit the employees and to raise their productivity as was the objective of the WCS – was instead to be “fully exploit(ed)” by the accused and Chan to settle their own debts, which had arisen due to the dire financial situation largely brought about by the accused in the first place.

##### (3)    The deception that was to be practised on IRAS

84     As set out in the agreed facts, the WCS was introduced in Budget 2013 for the Government to co-fund 40% of the wage increases that are given to Singaporean employees who earned a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. The WCS was intended to incentivise employers to give wage increments to their employees by subsidizing a portion of the increment. The employees must have received CPF contributions from a single employer for at least 3 calendar months in the preceding year; and have at least $50 gross monthly wage increase (up to the Gross Monthly Wage ceiling of $4,000).

85     In 2014, Chan had made increased CPF contributions to purported employees of FJTC, namely, Ming San, Chan Sing Far (father of Chan) and Lim Kum Yoke (mother of the accused), and filled in the 'Employer Declaration Form' with the details of these 3 purported employees and their increased salary payments and submitted the form to IRAS. This entitled FJTC to be eligible for payments of $47,361.60 under the WCS.

86     In 2014, Ming San made CPF contributions to three purported employees in F&C, namely Eng Yek Ngoh (mother of Chan), Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke (his wife and the mother of the accused). Ming San also filled in the 'Employer Declaration Form' with the details of these three purported employees and their increased salary payments and submitted the form to IRAS. This entitled F&C to be eligible for payments of $54,850.51 under the WCS.

87     I agreed with the Prosecution that the evidence pointed irrefutably to the fact that the accused’s and Chan’s parents were, in fact, not _bona fide_ employees of FJTC and F&C, and that the purported salary increases were bogus.

88     First, as regards Chan’s parents and the accused’s parents:

> (a)     Both Chan and his parents made it clear they did not in fact receive any salary from FJTC and/or FCC for 2014.

> (b)     In addition, the co-accused, Ming San had made similar admissions in his police statement (P109), and also in his Statement of Facts (P110) that he agreed to during his own earlier plead guilty mention in court.

>> (i)       Specifically, as far as F&C was concerned, in P109, Ming San had stated in his answer to Q249 that, he (as the boss of F&C) did not pay salaries to Chan’s parents, although the accused did make CPF contributions to them. Further, on his own purported employment by FJTC, Ming San had admitted in his answer to Q253 that he stopped working for FJTC from July 2013, as Chan could not afford to hire him anymore since FJTC’s business was bad. Nevertheless, Chan continued to make CPF contributions for him, which Ming San believed was because of the accused’s idea that this would allow them to get hold of the 40% government grant from the WCS.

>> (ii)       Further, Ming San had made similar admissions to the court at his plead guilty mention, when at \[13\] of his Statement of Facts (P110), he had admitted to having made false declarations about increasing the wages of Chan’s parents and Eng Yek Ngoh to $4,000 a month for 2014, and had also admitted that the CPF contributions for these three purported employees were made for the sole purpose of deceiving IRAS into disbursing wage credits of $54,850.51 under the WCS. It should be noted that Ming San had admitted to the Statement of Facts P110 without qualification before a District Judge, and that this was done with the benefit of legal advice (see P108).

>> (iii)       I thus accepted the account given by Ming San in his police statement P109 to be the truth, in light of the clear precautions that had been adopted by the CAD in the recording process for that statement (as testified to by SIO Jane), and also as that statement was recorded in 2015 which was much closer in time to the current events. That it was a statement that was self-incriminating, and also one that contained clear and comprehensive details of the circumstances of the offences, made it even more believable. Further, that his account in the P109 statement was subsequently confirmed in the Statement of Facts dated 19 February 2021, in which Ming San had again admitted to these incriminating details, after the account was read to him in Mandarin in court, and Ming San had admitted to his role even while he implicated the accused (his son) and Chan, made Ming San’s account given in these statements made in 2015 and 2021 even more believable.

> (c)     As for the accused’s mother, Lim Kum Yoke, while she appeared to give testimony was favourable to the accused, she was not able to give any kind of consistent evidence about how and who paid/gave her the salaries purportedly earned by her at FJTC and F&C, or about when she purportedly started to work for the entities. She thus ended up contradicting herself in court, between the version in her court testimony, and the version in her earlier s 22 CPC statement recorded on 26 October 2015 (P111). As regards her attempt to explain away the inconsistent versions in her statement P111, the Prosecution refuted her claim that no interpreter was present to read back the statement to her when P111 was recorded, and pointed out that the statement recorder, Amy, had confirmed that an interpreter, Alvin Loh, had indeed read back the statement to Lim Kum Yoke. The latter was also not only given a chance to make amendments, but had in fact made amendments and signed off against them. I agreed with the Prosecution that Lim Kum Yoke’s account in court was inconsistent and her attempts at explaining the discrepancies were difficult to accept. In all, I found her to be a witness of little credit, and it was obvious that she was never paid $8,000 per month as alleged by the Defence.

89     Second, it was clear that the work purportedly done by the parents of the accused and Chan for FJTC and/or F&C for 2014, if at all, was minimal and certainly could not justify the payment of the purported exorbitant sums of salaries to them. This was an important consideration, since it struck at the issue of whether the salary increase for them, and the salaries purportedly paid to these “employees”, were genuine, or whether they were merely paper increases made solely for the purpose of abusing and subverting the WCS, a public scheme put in place to subsidise real increases in salary for the benefit of genuine employees. In this regard, I took into account the following matters:

> (a)     As rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, both the accused’s father, Ming San, and Chan’s father, Chan Sing Far, were running their own businesses and/or in other employment at the time when they were purported fully employed by F&C and/or FJTC. Thus, it was highly doubtful that they would have time to perform their “full time work” for FJTC and F&C, at the same time that they were performing their other full time work. In this regard, Chan Sing Far was running his own insurance business, while Ming San was employed by Denselight throughout 2012 to 2014.

> (b)     In the case of Chan Sing Far, his purported monthly salary of $8,000 was also clearly grossly inflated, and could not be logically explained, nor shown to be reasonable or justified. Even more ridiculous was the fact that he was purportedly paid $8000 per month for a period of 12 months, or close to $100,000 for the entire year of 2014, when in fact, he did nothing for FJTC and/or F&C, as he never achieved the objective of securing new premises that he was supposed paid to do, or apparently anything else he was engaged for. Noes it appear that the accused, Chan or Ming San ever even seriously pushed him to do so. Yet they allegedly continuing to pay him obscene amounts of salary, essentially for doing nothing, and without question. There was also no evidence tendered to show that securing suitable premises was even attempted by Chan Sing Far during this period.

> (c)     As for Eng Yek Ngoh, her purported role as a bookkeeper of F&C was never performed by her at all, but was actually undertaken by Chan. While the accused claimed not to know this, the fact that he appeared to be very much involved in the operations of both F&C and FJTC, would suggest that he would or should have known. At best, it could be said that the evidence showed that the accused did not seem to even care about bookkeeping for F&C, but he was quite happy to go along with the plan to first put her on the minimum salary of $51 per month for the last three months of 2013, and then have her salary increased manifold times in 2014, simply to take advantage of the WCS. Even then, since F&C had essentially no work in 2014, there would have presumably been precious little bookkeeping to do. In this regard, considering that in 2013, F&C was operating with a full complement of students, which was no longer the case in 2014 as F&C had sold of its business to Brightstars by end 2013, the claim that Eng Yek Ngoh should have be paid so much more in 2014 than in 2013, even if a bookkeeper for F&C was really required, for a business that was effectively no longer functioning in 2014, was even more ridiculous.

> (d)     For Lim Kum Yoke who was supposedly holding dual full-time roles of cleaning supervisor of _both_ FJTC and F&C in 2014, her purported work scope was also clearly fictional.

>> (i)       This was because there was already a full-time cook-cum-cleaner working at F&C, Madam Cheng, since 2011, and the latter testified that she was the only one performing such duties, and that there was in fact no supervisor for her work. Further, Madam Cheng said that she did not even know Lim Kum Yoke (who was supposedly her cleaning supervisor).

>> (ii)       Madam Cheng’s evidence was supported by the evidence of the other genuine employees of F&C, including Madam Wong and the Chinese tutors. In fact, it was notable that Madam Cheng, like the other genuine employees of F&C, joined Brightstars when it took over F&C’s business, and continued her work there. In contrast, her supposed “supervisor”, Lim Kum Yoke, “remained” with F&C, which had next to no business by then.

>> (iii)       Further, even if Lim Kum Yoke did indeed perform such work in 2014, for her to purportedly earn gross monthly wages of $8,000 ($4,000 from FJTC and F&C each) for cleaning the same premises shared by both FJTC and F&C, was clearly ludicrous and simply defied belief. This was especially so when the full time cleaning and cooking staff, Madam Cheng, was paid less than $1,000 monthly for performing a similar, but full time role.

>> (iv)       In addition, it should be noted that in 2014, Lim Kum Yoke also had other business/work of her own to take care of. In this regard, in 2014, she had converted her drinks stall that she operated, into a café, and hence she would have had an increased work load and added responsibility outside of her purported employment at FJTC and F&C. She could have had precious little time, if any, to devote to work for BOTH FJTC and F&C for which she was supposed to have been paid $8,000 monthly.

>> (v)       For all the above reasons, it was clear that the Defence’s story that Lim Kum Yoke was working as a cleaning supervisor of _both_ FJTC and F&C in 2014, and earning $8,000 (i.e. $4000x2 for both) in the process, even more incredible and unbelievable.

>> (vi)       Notably, the accused agreed that the amounts purportedly paid to his parents as salaries for working in FJTC and/or F&C, did not make sense as they were clearly above the market rate.

> (e)     Third, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that the purported employment of the accused’s and Chan’s parents with FJTC and/or F&C, and the “inflated” salaries purportedly paid to them, were clearly false, in light of the clear differences between how they were treated and dealt with, as compared to the treatment for the “genuine employees”.

>> (i)       In this regard, the salaries that there were purportedly paid for the work that they were purportedly performing (sums of $4,000 each for FJTC/F&C and $8,000 if they were “working” for both) were many times what the genuine employees such as Madam Wang, Madam Wong, Madam Cheng and Mr Tan were paid (ranging from $850 to $1,600 per month). Even Madam Wong who was the supervisor in charge of operations at F&C, and who oversaw the work of the other employees, was paid no more than $1,600 per month.

>> (ii)       Moreover, the manner in which Chan and the accused’s parents were paid (by cash as opposed to by cheque), was also different from how the legitimate F&C employees like Madam Wang, Madam Cheng, and Mr Tan were paid. I also noted that unlike the genuine employees who were paid through Madam Wong, Chan and the accused’s parents purportedly received monies, in cash, directly from their respective sons. In fact, the distinction in treatment was never satisfactorily explained.

>> (iii)       While the accused claimed that there were cash withdrawals made to pay the parents, there was nothing to show why payment by cash was necessary, or that the cash withdrawals made from the company accounts were actually used to pay the salaries of these purported employees. In this regard, I note Chan’s testimony that the monthly cash withdrawals made from the account were in fact used to pay off the credit card bills of Chan that the accused had incurred, which Chan was pressured by his company to settle with the banks, rather than to the purported employees. Thus, when IRAS sought evidence about the monthly payments made to the purported employees, the accused had randomly circled cash withdrawal records on the statement of account of FJTC, and had Chan email these to IRAS.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44)

>> (iv)       Another clear distinction in treatment between the parents of the accused and Chan, and the genuine employees, was the fact that only the former were given pay increases, and grossly inflated ones at that. The genuine employees, whose work amounted to essential day to day duties, and which work was directly relevant, visible and tangible, were certainly not so lucky, as they were not even considered for any benefits from the WCS. Instead, it was Chan’s and the accused’s parents, who contribute little, if anything, to the business and operations of F&C, who had their salaries grossly inflated.

>> (v)       This distinction in treatment between the obviously \`essential’ employees, and Chan’s and the accused’s parents, were clearly unjustifiable as even the accused admitted that besides his parents and Chan’s parents, two other employees were also eligible for the WCS, as they met the four criteria i.e. being Singaporean, worked for at least 3 months prior, at a minimum of $51 a month in salary, and the salary could be increased to a maximum of $4,000. However, the accused claimed that the WCS wasn’t applied for them because the “…company will have to fork out the salaries and the CPF in advance when the company has to bleed even further with no guarantee that WCS will be given out.” Nevertheless, the accused sought to “apply” for the WCS for his parents so as to “benefit \[them\]”.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)Yet, this begs the question of whether in fact, the company, which was already bleeding and suffering financially from having to repay the accused’s credit card debts and potentially having to pay for the accused’s third album, was really even in a financial position to pay the full salaries of Chan’s and the accused’s parents beyond making CPF contributions, as the accused claimed it could.

>> (vi)       All in all, the evidence pointed irresistibly to the conclusion that the accused had exploited the WCS for personal enrichment rather than for the legitimate benefit of employees or for any genuine business purpose. At most, the accused and Chan’s parents would only benefit from CPF contributions made to them, but this may well only be because such contributions were themselves necessary costs to be incurred in order to trigger the WCS payments by the Government to FJTC and F&C. The WCS grants, could then be withdrawn to satisfy the payment of debts already incurred by the accused and Chan. Indeed, this was evident from the admissions made by the accused in his statement, and also from the accused’s message to Chan that: “These govt money if fully exploit also only settle 2/3 of the debts”.

> (f)     Fourth, even though Chan’s and the accused’s parents were supposed to have started their work (i.e..” probation”) with FJTC and/or F&C in 2013, and then continued on full salaries in 2014 working for FJTC and/or F&C, what was surprising was that the full time/genuine employees of F&C, such as Madam Wong, Madam Wang, Madam Cheng and Mr Tan, apparently either never saw Chan’s and the accused’s parents working there, or only saw them doing minimal work at the premises. In fact, some of these full time/genuine employees did not even recognise Chan and/or the accused’s parents at all. This again suggested that the employment of Chan’s and the accused’s parents, purportedly from 2013 onwards, was clearly bogus.

> (g)     Finally, perhaps one of the strongest piece of evidence that the purported payment of salaries to the parents of Chan and the accused were fake was, in the case of F&C, demonstrated by the fact F&C was not even operating as a business in 2014. This fact was actually already known as early as October 2013, when negotiations were taking place to sell the business of F&C to Brightstars. This sale was completed by end 2013.

>> (i)       In this regard, it was an agreed fact in the SOAF at \[9\] that “F&C later entered into a Deed of Assignment with a representative from one Brightstars Student Care Centre ("Brightstars") in October 2013, and Brightstars took over the operations of F & C from January 2014 onwards.”. It is relevant to note that it was the accused, who had signed this deed of assignment (see his answer to Q201), and hence he would be well aware that F&C would effectively not have any viable business beyond end 2013. Yet, his parents and the parents of Chan were engaged from the last quarter of 2013 onwards on probation, with the intention that they be paid full salaries from 2014 onwards.

>> (ii)       Further, based on Chan’s evidence, after Brightstars took over F&C’s business at end 2013, for the entire 2014 up to March 2015, F&C continued to exist apparently just to take care of two students after 5.30 pm who were at the premises.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) Ming San admitted that apart from these 2 students that he would care for about 2 hours when needed, F&C was not in operation, and there was no other income for F&C in 2014.[^47] Ming San also said that he was paid $10-$20 per student every time the student stayed back late. Thus, as per the filing to IRAS that Ming San signed off on, the revenue for F&C for the whole of 2014 was only $3,600. Even then, this amount included the deposit that he had collected for 10 students earlier.[^48] In the accused’s statement recorded by CAD (P113), the accused also said that F&C only had one student in 2014, and that the annual revenue was “A few thousand dollars only” (see answers to questions 185 and 189).

>> (iii)       Yet, despite having sold its business to Brightstars, and with F&C effectively no longer in operation in 2014, and having only a paltry sum in terms of revenue for the entire year, it continued to hire all 3 employees i.e. Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke, and even purported to pay them exorbitant sums that it clearly could not afford, and which were sums many times what it had paid them in 2013 when it was still fully functioning. This made absolutely no sense.

>> (iv)       Further, the accused and his co-accused persons even compounded their cheating attempts by ‘double counting’ Lim Kum Yoke and Chan Sing Far, by paying them double in 2014 for purportedly holding dual employments at FJTC and F&C.

>> (v)       Thus, quite aside from the earlier point made that there was no concrete evidence that the accused and his co-accused persons even made any payment to Chan’s and the accused’s parents (except for CPF contributions), it was ludicrous for F&C to operate in that manner. It was also unbelievable that the accused and Ming San would condone this further “bleeding” of the business of F&C, when they were so careful earlier not to have included the genuine employees in the WCS, simply because they were allegedly concerned that including the latter would “bleed” F&C.

>> (vi)       Thus, the only logical explanation that could be derived from the behaviour of the accused, and that of his co-accused persons, was that they were solely out to extract grants from the WCS, even when F&C was not even operating. This was in fact precisely what the accused and his co-accused persons admitted to be doing, as seen from the WhatsApp messages exchanged between the accused and Chan. Specifically, in March 2015, the accused and Chan discussed the need for F&C to continue to “be in existence” in order to obtain more grants under the WCS, despite F&C’s operations having ceased as of end 2013 (apart from the “2 remaining students” occasionally being taken care of after 5.30p.m.).Indeed, it was the accused who continued to tell Chan that they had to maximise the WCS grant[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) and “milk it as much as we can”.[^50]

90     In short, the overwhelming evidence from the Prosecution witnesses (which included the co-accused persons) and Prosecution exhibits, as well as that of the accused himself, were that they made use of Chan’s and/or the accused’s parents to cheat IRAS into disbursing grants under the WCS, when these monies should never be paid because the conditions to do so never genuinely existed. Thus, contrary to the accused’s denial that there was any conspiracy to cheat, or his claim that he merely gave advice to Chan and Ming San to maximise the scheme legitimately, the accused was a major and active participant who worked with his co-accused persons to put in place a plan to deceive IRAS that the accused and Chan’s parents were employed by FJTC and/or F&C, and were paid their salaries in 2014, when this was not the case.

#### The falsification conspiracy charges

91     As regards the 36 falsification conspiracy charges, the accused had allegedly engaged in a conspiracy with Ming San to falsify documents belonging to F&C, and in pursuance of that conspiracy, Ming San had falsified payslips stating that various sums of money had been paid to Chan Sing Far, Eng Yek Ngoh and Lim Kum Yoke, as reflected in the 36 charges. Further, as stated at \[20\] of the SOAF, Ming San had submitted these payslips to IRAS to claim that the salaries had been paid to these three purported employees in 2014.

92     The crux of the Prosecution’s case was that the 36 F&C payslips were falsified as none of the accused’s, or Chan’s parents, were _bona fide_ employees of F&C, given that F&C was not operating as a business in 2014, and any salaries purportedly paid out as stated in the payslips were thus false entries made with intent to defraud IRAS. Further, the accused had a motive to engage in the conspiracies as he was in need of money.

93     I have already dealt with the main evidence and expressed my view that:

> (a)     Neither Chan’s nor the accused’s parents were _bona fide_ employees, nor were they paid by F&C their alleged salaries; and

> (b)     The accused was in needs of the funds, and any funds disbursed via the WCS scheme was intended for alleviating his financial woes.

94     I would add that additional evidence of the accused’s involvement in the falsification conspiracy charges could be seen from his own statement (P114) recorded on 2 December 2015 where:

> (a)     In his answer to Q278, he admitted to helping his father (Ming San) prepare the F&C payslips for Chan Sing Far for 2014. He admitted that these payslips were prepared for submission to IRAS (see answer to Q279);

> (b)     In his answers to Q284 and Q286, he admitted that these F&C payslips for Eng Yek Ngoh for 2014 were prepared at the same time as those that were prepared for Chan Sing Far; and

> (c)     In his answers to Q291 to Q294, he admitted that these F&C payslips for Lim Kum Yoke for 2014 were prepared by him.

95     Moreover, in Ming San’s statement (P109), Ming San had stated:

> (a)     In his answers to Q137 and Q138, that he had asked the accused to prepare the F&C payslips for Chan Sing Far from Oct 2013 and Dec 2014;

> (b)     In his answers to Q182 and Q183, he stated that the accused had prepared the F&C payslips for Eng Yek Ngoh from Oct 2013 and Dec 2014; and

> (c)     In his answers to Q223 and 224, he stated that the accused had prepared the F&C payslips for Lim Kum Yoke from 2012 to 2014.

96     Further, in Ming San’s Statement of Facts (P110) during his plea of guilt mention on 22 February 2021, Ming San had admitted that he engaged in a conspiracy with the accused to falsify papers belonging to F&C i.e. the payslips, stating that F&C had paid Chan Sing Far, Eng Yek Ngoh, and Lim Kum Yoke for every month in 2014 for work that was purportedly (but not actually) done.

97     The falsified payslips were subsequently submitted to IRAS to state that a certain salary that been paid to each of the 3 purported employees of F&C, namely Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke for each month in the year of 2014, when such payments had clearly not been made.

98     As the accused knew that the 36 payslips stating that F&C had paid Eng Yek Ngoh, Chan Sing Far and Lim Kum Yoke the purported salaries in 2014 were clearly fictitious, and as he knew that these payslips were intended for IRAS, I was satisfied that he had had therefore wilfully and with an intent to defraud IRAS, falsified each of the 36 payslips in pursuance of the conspiracy, which is an offence under section 477A read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). In short, the evidence pointed irresistibly to his guilt.

### Conclusion on the charges

99     The accused had, variously likened his attempts at getting the WCS grant, as being legitimate acts akin to eating food at a buffet where he was entitled to eat the maximum amount. In his analogy, the buffet operator was IRAS, and the WCS money was equivalent to the buffet items. In this regard, the accused claimed that his actions and that of his co-accused persons, in increasing the salaries of the purported employees (Chan’s parents and his parents) to the maximum limit, so as to get the maximum WCS grant, was equivalent to them (legitimately) eating as much as possible at the buffet.

100    However, with respect, his analogy is erroneous and inaccurate. To put it simply, if the WCS grant was the buffet items, then F&C and FJTC (and by extension the accused and his co-accused persons) were simply not entitled to even be at the buffet table because they didn’t satisfy the criteria to be present. This was because the parents of the accused and Chan, were not genuine employees of FJTC and/or F&C, and neither were they paid salaries as the accused and his co-accused persons had originally claimed, if in fact they were paid at all. In short, neither F&C nor FJTC was not entitled to the WCS grant. Thus, to attempt to eat at the buffet table, when you have not yet paid your dues, or satisfied the conditions to do so, but misrepresenting otherwise, was the deception that the accused and his co-accused persons attempted to practise on IRAS in order to get hold of the WCS grant, which are public funds.

101    It was these offences which the accused and his co-accused persons committed through the use of FJTC and F&C, which were entities that they controlled, as well as the subsequent related falsification offences that they also committed, that they had all been called to face the music. His co-accused persons have done so, when they pleaded guilty and/or agreed to have taken into consideration charges that reflected their criminal involvement. It was the accused who was now on trial for his role.

102    Arising from the clear and overwhelming evidence which implicated the accused, including evidence from the same co-accused persons, I find that the Prosecution had indeed proven the offences beyond a reasonable doubt, and I found the accused guilty on all the 38 charges that he was tried before me.

## Sentencing Phase

103    I now move on to deal with the sentencing.

### General Considerations

104    In respect of a charge under 420 PC read with s 116 PC, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment of up to 2 ½ years (i.e. one-fourth of the maximum term of 10 years’ imprisonment for a completed offence), and the offender is also liable to a fine. In respect of a charge under 477A PC read with s 109 PC, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment of up to 10years, and the offender is also liable to a fine.

105    The accused is a first offender.

106    To reiterate, the following sentences were imposed on the co-accused persons who had pleaded guilty, although the cheating conspiracy charges that they faced were framed as charges under s 417 PC read with s 116 PC, where the maximum prescribed imprisonment term was only 9 months.

> (a)     For Chan:

>> (i)       s 417 PC r/w s 116 PC: 10 weeks’ imprisonment (consecutive)

>> (ii)       s 477A PC r/w s 109 PC (11 charges): 4 weeks’ imprisonment each (3 sentences running consecutively); and

>> (iii)       Total sentence: 22 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)     For Ming San:

>> (i)       s 417 PC r/w s 116 PC: 8 weeks’ imprisonment (consecutive)

>> (ii)       s 477A PC r/w s 109 PC (11 charges): 4 weeks’ imprisonment (for one charge - consecutive), and 3 weeks’ imprisonment each for remaining charges (two of the sentences of 3 weeks’ imprisonment running consecutively); and

>> (iii)       Total sentence: 18 weeks’ imprisonment.

### Prosecution’s sentencing position

107    For the accused, following his conviction, the Prosecution submitted for

> (a)     At least 12 months imprisonment for each charge of Section 420 r/w s 116 Penal Code (1st and 2nd charges),

> (b)     At least 6 weeks’ imprisonment for each charge of conspiracy to falsify documents under Section 477A r/w s 109 Penal Code (3rd to 38th charges).

108    The Prosecution broadly argued that general deterrence must feature strongly in the sentencing equation in light of the fact that:

> (a)     The victim was a government agency;

> (b)     The accused played a significant role in the scheme and his culpability was high;

> (c)     There was a significant degree of planning and premeditation in carrying out the cheating offences;

> (d)     There was a difficulty in detection of such offences as the WCS is fully automated;

> (e)     This was a group offence involving the accused and two others; and

> (f)     The amount of money that IRAS would have been cheated of was significant at $102,221.11.

109    Further, the Prosecution cited some sentencing precedents in its submissions on sentence (Annex A – Sentencing Precedents). I have summarised the main features of these case below.

110    Following clarifications sought from the Prosecution, where the accused was also invited to comment:

> (a)     The Prosecution maintained its position that 12 months’ imprisonment per charge was appropriate. In fact, the Prosecution clarified that based on further precedents tendered of cases under section 420 r/w 116 PC offences, and in light of the amounts involved in the current charges i.e. “…the starting point for each of the s 420 read with s 116 Penal Code charges in the present case ought to be _upwards of_ 16 months’ imprisonment, as the charges involved amounts of $47,361.60 (in respect of FJTC), and $54,850.51 (in respect of F&C).”[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)

> (b)     The Prosecution also highlighted that in another case, _PP v Tew Yee Jeng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 28</span> (MA 9011/2016/01), where the offender had pleaded guilty, he received 20 months’ imprisonment for the charge under s 420 read with s 116 PC involving a similar amount ($54,707.79). The Prosecution stated that “ …there is a pressing need for general deterrence, given that the victim of the cheating offence (while inchoate) is a government body, to deter any likeminded individuals who might likewise exploit schemes administered by the government.”[^52]

> (c)     Notwithstanding the precedents such as _Tew Yee Jeng_, which suggested sentences of 20 months’ imprisonment for similar amounts as in the charges against the present accused, the Prosecution nonetheless took the position that “it was only with a view to maintaining proportionality with the sentences imposed on the co-accused persons, as well as the totality principle, that the proposed sentence for the s 420 read with s 116 PC charges have been adjusted downwards. In the circumstances, the proposed sentence of _at least_ 12 months’ imprisonment for each s 420 read with s 116 PC charge cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.”[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53)

111    Finally, the Prosecution argued for a global sentence of at least 20 months’ imprisonment. This consisted of running a sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment for a charge under section 420 r/w s 116 Penal Code, and five sentences of 6 weeks’ imprisonment for each charge of conspiracy to falsify documents under Section 477A r/w s 109 Penal Code Penal Code i.e. 12 months imprisonment plus 30 weeks imprisonment. [\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

112    As for the falsification conspiracy charges, the Prosecution highlighted the following considerations:

> (a)     There was deviousness and surreptitious planning on the accused’s part, and the accused was the one who had prepared the 36 falsified payslips belonging to F&C, which Ming San submitted to IRAS. The Prosecution argued that submission of these documents by Ming San “…meant that the accused himself was accorded a buffer to distance himself from the false declarations to IRAS.”

> (b)     The falsifications were done for personal gain, with the falsified payslips intended to defraud IRAS to disburse the pay-outs, which would eventually benefit the conspirators in one way or another

> (c)     The F&C payslips were falsified as there was no genuine business activity or revenues in 2014 to speak of – given that F&C was no longer operating as a business in 2014, and its business had been transferred to Brightstars.

113    As the accused had claimed trial to the charges, he was not entitled to any sentencing discount. For parity in sentence with his co-accused persons, where Ming San and Chan had received sentences of 3 weeks’ and/or 4 weeks’ imprisonment, an uplift was warranted and the proposed term of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge was entirely justified on the facts of the case

114    The Prosecution submitted that the sentences for not less than five charges under s 477A r/w s 109 PC should run consecutively with the sentence for at least one count under 420 r/w s 116 PC to reflect the accused’s culpability, and to accord with the principle of parity, given that Chan and Ming San had both pleaded guilty to 12 proceeded charges, and had the sentences for 3 charges under 477A r/w s 109 PC run consecutively with the sentence for one charge under s 417 r/w s 116 PC.

### Accused’s position

115    As for the accused, he did not put forward any proposed sentence. In fact, aside from some medical documents that he submitted, the accused did not make any attempt to mitigate. Instead, he reiterated his innocence, and said that he intended to appeal against his conviction, with new evidence and witnesses.

## Court’s assessment of sentence

116    Having considered both the precedents and sentencing principles highlighted by the Prosecution, I agreed with the aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution.

117    In so far as the cheating was directed at a public agency, and the targeted sums were public funds meant for improving productivity of workers and for benefitting employees and industries as a whole, it was clearly important to send out a strong message that those who try to abuse the system, must be made to pay a stiff price. This is important to deter them, and other would be offenders against such abhorrent behaviour. Indeed, in _Dong Guitian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 34</span> (“_Dong Guitian_”) at \[40\], the High Court had made it clear that the principle of deterrence is a dominant consideration where the deception had been perpetrated against a government agency, and that a harsher sentence is justified. It is also relevant to note that the High Court there made clear that it did not even matter that the government department did not suffer any financial loss.

118    I would add that I also agreed with the Prosecution that such a message of deterrence was especially important where offences of this kind may be difficult to detect, in light of the fully self-automated feature of such public schemes. As note by the High Court in _PP v Law Aik Meng_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 814 (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[25(d)\], difficulty of detection of commercial crimes was a relevant sentencing consideration “….precipitating a heavy sentence if and when such crimes are eventually uncovered through painstaking investigation”.

119    Further, as regards the role played by the accused, even though he protested the Prosecution’s characterisation of him as the “mastermind”, I was of the view that he was indeed the major driving force behind the plan to cheat IRAS of public funds, since he not only orchestrated and arranged the meeting where the plan was first discussed with his co-accused persons, he even taught them how to maximise their illicit gains of public monies.

120    In addition, as could also be seen from the messages that he subsequently exchanged with Chan, he was also the person who pushed Chan along when the latter showed signs of faltering in his resolve to carry on with the plan. Further, the accused also engaged in discussions with Chan in March 2015 to emphasise the need for F&C to continue to be in existence in order to obtain more grants from WCS, despite F&C operations having effectively ceased. Needless to say, it was also the financial crisis that he perpetuated to begin with, that very much created the circumstances leading up to the plan to cheat IRAS. As for the falsification conspiracy charges, the accused was the one who had made the false entries which his father, Ming San, then submitted to IRAS.

121    In short, the accused was the main character in the entire nefarious plot.

122    I also had to consider that had the plot succeeded, the sums that IRAS (and the government) would have been cheated of, at over $100,000 ($102,221.11 for both cheating conspiracy charges), was large. All of this money was also public funds.

123    Finally, I would add that unlike his co-accused persons who had confessed to their roles in the conspiracies, and who had shown remorse and pleaded guilty, the accused had never shown any remorse or acceptance of his role, but had claimed trial to the charges. While the accused was entitled to contest his charges in court, he should certainly not expect, nor would he be entitled to, any sentencing discount for pleading guilty that his co-accused persons had likely received, and which had likely factored in their eventual sentences. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused “…cannot reasonably be given any discount on sentence which would usually be accorded to accused persons who pleaded guilty as a sign of their remorse and who have saved the Court time and resources by so doing.” [\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

124    Looking next at the precedents cited by the Prosecution, it was clear to me that where amounts intended to be cheated amount to about $50,000, sentences of 20 months’ imprisonment have been considered appropriate, even where the intended victim is a private entity, and where the fraud does not lead to any actual losses (see _Tew Yee Jeng_). In fact, in _Su Chia Ern_, where the victim was a private entity and the intended loss was only $31,716.22 in respect of a s 420 r/w s 116 PC charge, a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was imposed.

125    Further, where the victims are government agencies even lesser amounts of losses would attract sentences higher than the 12 months’ imprisonment sought in the current case. For example in _Tan Wen Jie_, a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment was imposed when the loss was $40,712.

126    Thus, all things considered, it was clear that the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment sought for each of the s 420 r/w s 116 PC charges in the present case was, to put it mildly, quite lenient, when one considers the aggravating factors highlighted above. I would also add that in deciding on the sentences for the s 420 r/w s 116 PC charges, I could not make a direct comparison with the sentences imposed on Chan and Ming San, since they were convicted of lesser charges of 417 r/w s 116 PC, for which the maximum prescribed imprisonment was less than one-third (9 months versus 30 months) for the accused. In this regard, I can do no better than to cite the words of Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) in _Phua Song Hua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 33</span> (“_Phua Song Hua”_), where his Honour had stated at 38 that: “The principle of parity of sentence is irrelevant once there are different offences, as there is no longer any common basis for comparison…..”

127    Nonetheless, to the extent that the sentences of Chan and Ming San were relevant in deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose on the accused for his commission of the much more serious offences under s 420 r/w s 116 PC, it was only to provide a sense of proportionality and perspective. In this regard, the Prosecution’s proposed 12 months’ imprisonment term, out of a possible 30 months’ imprisonment term that could have been imposed per cheating conspiracy charge, was clearly fair and proportionate. This was the case, after considering the aggravating factors set out above, including the accused’s role compared with that of his co-accused persons, and the absence of any sentencing discount in the accused’s case as he did not plead guilty.

128    For completeness, I was of the view that there was nothing of any mitigating value put forward by the accused, or that could be seen from the facts adduced before me, to justify any further reduction in sentence. Even the accused’s medical documents provided no basis for lowering his sentence (see _Chew Soo Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span>).

129    Accordingly, in light of the sentencing principles, precedents and out of a sense of proportionality, I imposed a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for each of the cheating conspiracy charges.

130    As for the s 477A r/w s 109 PC charges, these were also the same type of charges that Chan and Ming San had pleaded guilty to, for which they had been sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment, and 3 to 4 weeks’ imprisonment respectively. In light of the role played by the accused in the offences, and due to a lack of any sentencing discount for pleading guilty, I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift was warranted in the case of the accused, and I imposed a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment per s 477A r/w s 109 PC charge.

131    As for the global sentence, I note that in the case of Chan and Ming San, four out of 12 charges were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 22 weeks' imprisonment for Chan, and 18 weeks' imprisonment for Ming San.

132    In the present case, while the accused was convicted of three times as many charges (38 charges for the accused versus 12 charges for the co-accused persons), I considered that the sentence for the s 420A r/w s 116 PC charge was already 12 months’ imprisonment. That being the case, and also bearing in mind the accused’s clean record, I was of the view that it would be sufficient to have the sentence for one of the s 420A r/w s 116 PC charges (12 months’ imprisonment) run consecutively with the sentences for four of the s 477A r/w s 109 PC charges (6 weeks’ imprisonment each).

133    The sentences that were made to run consecutively were for the following charges: DAC-904157-2019, DAC-904158-2019, DAC-904159-2019, DAC-904170-2019 and DAC904182-2019, with the other sentences to run concurrently, for a global sentence of 12 months’ and 24 weeks’ imprisonment.

134    All things considered, I am of the view that such a sentence is fair and proportionate, and would sufficiently serve the ends of justice, without being crushing. The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is out on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
