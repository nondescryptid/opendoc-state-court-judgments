Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Companies Act – Carrying on business for fraudulent purpose

4 March 2022

### Senior District Judge Bala Reddy:

## Introduction

1       The focus of attention in this case was a company called Genneva Pte Ltd (“Genneva”) incorporated on 21 January 2008 with its principal activity based on the trading of gold. Genneva offered gold-based investment to its customers. The business model was to sell gold to customers at a mark-up over the prevailing market gold spot prices and guarantee a buy back at a higher-than-market price after a pre-determined contract period. During the contract period, Genneva would pay the customers a discount equivalent to an agreed percentage of the selling price on a monthly basis until the end of the contract period.

2       However, this was not a sustainable business model and Genneva appears to have run at a loss. By 2011, Genneva was in an ominous financial position when it launched a devious scheme, “Gold Inspection”, whereby its customers would become its short-term creditors. With its mounting liabilities Genneva enticed a large number of its customers to renew their gold purchase contracts, and in the process, deposit their gold with the company for a limited period of 3 days for an alleged “data-dot” process to authenticate the gold sold by Genneva. This seemed to be a ploy to hold on to the gold deposits for a longer period. Nearer the redemption date, the customers who were promised the delivery of gold were enticed with more attractive terms for further roll-over periods.

3       During the course of the trial, it became very clear that this entire process of Gold Inspection was nothing but an elaborate ruse to deceive the customers. Genneva carried on with the Gold Inspection scheme as part of its business with intent to defraud its customers between 17 August to 30 September 2012.

4       During this period the Accused was clearly in a position where he was an integral part of the Gold Inspection Exercise. He was effectively in charge of the collection of the gold from the customers and the subsequent disposal of the gold. His intimate connection with Genneva together with all his actions and conduct amply demonstrated that he had knowledge that Genneva was in poor financial condition and would not be able to return the gold to the customers.

5       I had no hesitation in finding that the Accused was a knowing and active participant in in the Gold Inspection Exercise and had shared in Genneva’s intention to defraud its customers and accordingly found him guilty of the charge under section 340(5) read with section 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev. Ed.) (“Companies Act”).

## The Charge

6       The Accused claimed trial to the following charge:

> You, LIM HONG BOON are charged that you, in Singapore were knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of Genneva Pte Ltd (the “Company”), with intent to defraud creditors of the Company between 17 August and 30 September 2012, being the period which the Company implemented a gold inspection exercise for customers to deposit their gold with the Company in exchange for a promise to return a similar quantity of gold to the customers three days later, for the purported purpose of inspecting the authenticity and purity of their gold, when you knew that the Company did not have any reasonable expectation of returning the gold within the stipulated timeframe given its financial conditions, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 340(5) read with section 340(1) of the Companies Act, Chapter 50.

## Undisputed Facts

7       Genneva was a private limited liability company incorporated in Singapore on 21 January 2008 by Leow Wee Khong and Liew Chee Wah. Each had one ordinary share in the company. Genneva had an issued share capital of $2 as at 31 December 2008. The company operated out of Orchard Towers occupying units at #08–06 and #08–09.

8       The principal activity of Genneva was trading of gold. It sold gold to its customers at a mark-up over the prevailing market spot prices (the “Selling Price”) and guaranteed to buy back the gold from the customers at the same Selling Price after a fixed period of days, usually 7 days following the expiry date of the contract period which could be in a range of between one month to six months.

9       During the contract period, the customers were entitled to an upfront discount of 1% to 12% of the Selling Price and/or also a monthly discount of 2% to 4.3% of the Selling Price. This was described as a purchase discount and was effectively a deduction in the Selling Price to the customers. Such discounts may be an upfront discount.

10     For ease of reference in these Grounds of Decision (“Grounds”), it would be useful to explain some of the terminologies that were used in Genneva. There were Group Marketing Consultants (“GMCs”), who acted as supervisors and whose role was to discuss how to improve various aspects of Genneva’s operations and to deal with feedback from consultants.[^1] The GMCs formed a small committee from which Genneva would seek feedback on ideas for new promotions of Genneva’s products. A “consultant” would introduce Genneva’s products to customers and help them transact with Genneva.

11     The Gold Inspection Exercise (“GI Exercise”) is a term used interchangeably with Gold Inspection Process. The GI Exercise was described by Genneva as follows: “_\[The\] management… has decided to align Singapore’s gold authentication procedure with practices in Genneva offices in Malaysia and elsewhere. We call this Gold Inspection process (GI). The Singapore office is required to authenticate and verify each piece of gold sold to clients..._”[^2]

## Prosecution’s Case

12     The Prosecution led evidence from 18 witnesses who testified in court, and additionally adduced the statement of another witness who was unable to be physically present in court or testify via Zoom.

13     Briefly the evidence of the witnesses was as follows:

### PW1 – IO Normal Lee Khee Howe

14     PW1 Lee Khee Howe Norman (“PW1 IO Norman”), as the former Investigation Officer for this case, took over the investigations in July 2017 from another Investigation Officer. It was his evidence that the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) had received more than 100 police reports against Genneva in September 2012. These reports largely related to gold deposited with Genneva pursuant to the GI Exercise which were not returned to the complainants who had also failed to receive their monthly payouts from Genneva.[^3] PW1 IO Norman testified that when the CAD commenced investigations on 1 October 2012, Genneva was still operating.[^4] In the course of investigations, no gold bar was seized as none was found.

15     PW1 IO Norman was also responsible for recording the Accused’s statements: Exhibits P37 to P42. There was no challenge to the voluntariness,[^5] or the accuracy[^6] of the statements recorded by him.

### PW2 – Aaron Kwok Fong Loong

16     The prosecution’s next witness was, PW2 Kwok Fong Loong (also known as “Aaron”) (“PW2 Kwok”) who had been earlier convicted on his guilty plea to a charge of knowingly being a party to the carrying on of Genneva’s business with intent to defraud creditors under section 340(5) of the Companies Act,[^7] and was sentenced to 56 months’ imprisonment. When giving evidence he was a prisoner serving his sentence.

17     PW2 Kwok testified that he was employed between 2010 and 2011 by a Malaysian company called Samudra GV Sdn Bhd as a marketing development manager.[^8] The company was later renamed as Genneva Malaysia Sdn Bhd (“GM”). In 2012, PW2 Kwok was seconded to become the general manager of Genneva in Singapore.[^9] He testified that Genneva Singapore’s business in buying and selling gold was similar to that of Genneva Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s business.

18     He gave evidence that the Accused had worked as his colleague in Genneva Singapore from June to September 2012.[^10] It was his evidence that the Accused was in charge of Genneva’s Gold Department which controlled Genneva’s gold inventory and the GI Exercise. In such capacity, PW2 Kwok stated that the Accused knew how much gold Genneva had collected and how much gold was physically stored with Genneva.[^11] He further testified that the Accused was also responsible for the physical gold entering and leaving Genneva.[^12] Although PW2 Kwok was the general manager, he however, strangely claimed that he did not know the specific role the Accused played in the GI Exercise or in the movement of the gold.[^13] He did admit however, that during the period of the GI Exercise (the “GI Period”), there were complaints from the GMCs that their commission payments were delayed.[^14]

19     It was quite clear that PW2 Kwok was less than candid in many aspects of his evidence and was a rather reluctant witness against his former colleague, the Accused.

### PW3 – Goh Seow Mooi

20     PW3 Goh Seow Mooi (“PW3 Goh”) was a customer of Genneva who later became its consultant and GMC. As a consultant, she recommended Genneva to potential customers.[^15] PW3 Goh testified that as a GMC, she supervised a group of consultants, whose role was to discuss how to improve various aspects of Genneva’s operations and to deal with feedback from consultants.[^16]

21     She explained how a regular sale transaction in Genneva was conducted. She stated that under a buying scheme where physical gold was involved, the customer would pay a discounted price to buy gold. At the expiry of the contract period, a customer had the option of selling the gold back to Genneva at the undiscounted price.[^17] Under a buying scheme where no physical gold was involved, the client would pay a discounted price for gold, but the gold would be kept by Genneva. In the course of a contract period, Genneva would make periodic payments (known as “discounts”) to the customer. At the end of the contract period, the client had the option to sell the gold back to Genneva at the undiscounted price.[^18]

### PW4 – Andre Toh Sern

22     PW4 Andre Toh Sern (“PW4 Toh”) is the Prosecution’s expert witness who prepared the Expert Report.[^19] In his Expert Report and during his testimony in court, he opined that Genneva’s business was most likely to fail and it would be unable to repay creditors based on how its business was conducted.[^20] He observed that Genneva always had a net liabilities position since its incorporation and had a total net liability of $227,586,517 as at 16 August 2012, just before the GI Exercise was implemented.[^21] Against this backdrop, PW4 Toh concluded that Genneva was most likely to be unable to meet the additional liability of $46,854,230 that was incurred as a result of the GI Exercise.[^22] PW4 Toh derived the figure of $46,854,230 from the value of the gold collected by Genneva as part of the GI Exercise.[^23] In this regard, PW4 Toh explained that each time a customer deposited gold with Genneva as part of the GI Exercise, the customer became Genneva’s creditor with respect to the gold or the gold’s Selling Price under the new contract because Genneva was obliged to return to the customer gold of a similar weight on the gold-collection date.[^24]

23     PW4 Toh gave three main reasons for why Genneva was unable to generate enough cashflow to meet the additional liability of $46,854,230:

> (a)     First, as at 16 August 2012, Genneva’s cash balance was only $295,692,[^25] which indicated that Genneva was unlikely to have sufficient cash for its normal course of business and would thus be unable to repay its creditors when the liabilities fell due.

> (b)     Second, Genneva’s investing and financing activities played insignificant roles between 1 January and 16 August 2012, and there is no evidence that this situation would change after 16 August 2012.[^26]

> (c)     Finally, based on Genneva’s cash flow projection from 17 August 2012 to 31 December 2015, assuming that it was able to obtain funds to continue its operations, Genneva would reach a negative cash balance of $1.6 billion by 31 December 2015.[^27]

### PW5 – Lim Kieng Justin

24     PW5 Lim Kieng Justin (“PW5 Lim”) was a consultant of Genneva in 2008. As a consultant, he introduced Genneva’s products to customers and helped them transact with Genneva. By end-2010 he had become a GMC which role he played till 1 October 2012. He further clarified that the GMCs were part of a small committee from which Genneva would seek feedback on ideas for new promotions of Genneva’s products.

25     PW5 Lim testified that Genneva’s management had explained that the GI Exercise would improve Genneva’s cash and gold flow.[^28] Similar to PW4 Toh’s evidence, PW5 Lim explained that where a customer deposited gold with Genneva under the GI Exercise by ‘selling back’ the gold, Genneva would owe the customer a piece of gold or the value of the gold.[^29]

26     PW5 Lim gave evidence that the Accused was seconded to Genneva to head the Transaction Department, and this was evidenced by the fact that the Accused was located at the “_premier office_” where “_a lot of the gold transaction actually_” took place.[^30] It was also PW5 Lim’s testimony that he had approached the Accused for directions on how much gold could be distributed to customers and which customers should receive the gold.[^31] It was also PW5 Lim’s evidence, that it was the Accused who decided how much gold to disburse and to whom.

27     PW5 Lim further testified that Genneva was in dire financial straits before and during the GI Exercise. This was apparent to him when Genneva started delaying commission payments to consultants sometime in 2010 or 2011. In September 2012, PW5 Lim was owed three or four months’ worth of commissions. Whenever he received payment, it was only partial payment. When the premises were raided on 1 October 2012, Genneva owed him about $300,000.[^32] In relation to discount payments owing to customers, PW5 Lim stated that while customers before 2012 received payment immediately upon ‘selling back’ gold to Genneva, customers who ‘sold back’ gold in 2012 only received post-dated cheques which were due about three to seven days later.[^33] Compounded to this, between July and September 2012, Genneva implemented a limit on the amount of gold that could be ‘sold back’ to Genneva per day. The excuse given to PW5 Lim was that without such a limit, Genneva was unable to handle the large volume of ‘sell back’ transactions.

28     PW5 Lim further testified that at the initial stages of the GI Exercise, customers had gotten their gold back. Subsequently, there were delays in the returning of the gold and there was insufficient gold each day to return to the customers. These customers were told to come back to Genneva on a later date to collect their gold.[^34] At the time of the raid, there were still many customers who had not received their gold back.[^35] Towards the end of September 2012, there was “definitely not” enough gold to return to the customers.[^36]

### PW6 – Luc Tai Victor

29     PW6 Luc Tai Victor (“PW6 Luc”) started as consultant in Genneva and subsequently became an Assistant GMC. He too gave evidence similar to the earlier witnesses on how the transactions were carried out at Genneva. He testified that when a customer bought gold from Genneva, he would buy it at a discounted price. There would be a contract period of three months, and at the end of which, the customer could sell the gold back to Genneva at the undiscounted price that was set at the time of the purchase.[^37] However, in 2012, Genneva implemented a limit on how much gold could be sold back to Genneva.[^38] In addition, it was a requirement that customers who wished to enter into another contract with Genneva had to participate in the GI Exercise by submitting their gold bars to Genneva to be inspected.[^39] He further testified that he was unable to get back some of the gold that he had helped his customers deposit with Genneva for the GI Exercise.[^40]

30     It was also PW6 Luc’s evidence that the Accused would know what had happened to the gold collected from the GI Exercise.[^41] PW6 Luc recalled that he and PW7 Thia had asked the Accused what was happening to the collected gold. In response to that, the Accused uploaded an Excel spreadsheet onto PW6 Luc’s laptop. This was adduced in evidence as Exhibit P2. That information however was hardly sufficient to answer the query.

### PW7 – Colin Thia Chang Wei

31     PW7 Colin Thia Chang Wei (“PW7 Thia”) acted as consultant with Genneva from 2009 till the raid on 1 October 2012.[^42]

32     PW7 Thia testified that in 2012, the Accused and PW2 Kwok implemented a limit on the amount of gold that could be ‘sold back’ to Genneva each day, as Genneva “_was unable to raise the funds_” to pay customers who wanted to ‘sell back’ their gold.[^43] PW7 Thia also testified regarding the delays in the return of the gold to the customers as well as cases where customers were not able to collect any gold even after the waiting period.[^44] When customers were not getting their gold back on time, he and PW6 Luc approached the Accused to seek an explanation for the delay in the return of the gold and the Accused responded by just referring them to an Excel spreadsheet, which he was unable to understand.[^45]

33     PW7 Thia also testified that during the GI Period, a number of consultants volunteered to help out with the collection of gold for the GI Exercise. In the process, PW7 Thia took the initiative to institute a system whereby the volunteers would record down the amount of gold collected from Genneva’s customers in “summary sheets”: Exhibit P46.[^46]

34     PW7 Thia also testified that the Accused was in charge of the GI Exercise as all the gold ended up in an office room which the Accused was in charge of (“Office Room #08-06”).[^47]

### PW8 – Leow Wee Hin

35     PW8 Leow Wee Hin (also known as “Ah Heng” and “Mr Heng”) (“PW8 Leow”), who held the title of ‘Treasurer’ in Genneva from 2008 to 2012, testified that when PW2 Kwok came to Genneva in 2012, he transferred “_gold, cash, and everything_” to PW2 Kwok and the Accused, effectively handing over power and assets to them.[^48]

36     In relation to the GI Exercise, PW8 Leow testified that the Accused controlled how much gold was to be returned to the customers each day.[^49] Further, during the GI Period, he followed the Accused’s instructions to make arrangements to pawn gold deposited by customers for the GI Exercise.[^50] The Accused kept the pawn tickets.[^51]

37     Finally, PW8 Leow testified that there was insufficient gold to return to customers after the initial stages of the GI Exercise.[^52]

### PW9 – H’ng Yan Yi

38     PW9 H’ng Yan Yi (“PW9 H’ng”) was a clerk at Genneva who worked with the Accused in handling the gold collected from the GI Exercise. PW9 H’ng, testified that she reported to the Accused and he was her “_boss_” at Genneva.[^53]

39     As regards the GI Exercise, PW9 H’ng explained that the Accused was the person who had instructed her to collect gold and apply data-dots to them. She testified that it was the Accused who decided on the quantity of gold to be returned and to which customer. PW9 H’ng further testified that some customers were not returned any gold despite having deposited gold with Genneva under the GI Exercise.[^54] She also stated that she had kept the Accused informed that there was insufficient gold to return to customers.[^55]

### PW10 – Poh Wee Sen

40     The conditioned statement (Exhibit PS1) of PW10 Poh Wee Sen (“PW10 Poh”), was admitted as evidence. He became a customer and later acted as a Genneva consultant between 2010 and 2012. His evidence was based on his personal experience in taking part in the GI Exercise as a consultant. He testified that sometime on or before 4 September 2012, PW11 Low Koon Seah (“PW11 Low”), who was PW10 Poh’s client, informed him that he had sent in a 1000g bar of gold for the GI Exercise and asked PW10 Poh to help him collect the gold bar. To facilitate that PW11 Low passed PW10 Poh a carbon copy of a Customer Service Request (“CSR”) form dated 28 August 2012.[^56]

41     On 4 September 2012, PW10 Poh collected PW11 Low’s gold bar and invoice. In order to do so, he signed on the CSR form, and submitted it to the counter staff at Office Room #08-06. He signed on a payment voucher dated 31 August 2012,[^57] which stated that S$95,000 was paid by Genneva to PW11 Low, and that PW10 Poh had collected the cash. The counter staff then handed PW10 Poh a new 1000g bar of gold and an invoice dated 4 September 2012.[^58]

42     However, it transpired that Genneva did not in fact pass any cash on 4 September 2012 to PW10 Poh. This was because the sum of $95,000 was used to purchase the new 1000g bar of gold. PW10 Poh subsequently passed PW11 Low the new 1000g bar of gold and the invoice dated 4 September 2012.

43     After some time, PW10 Poh discouraged his clients from sending in their gold bars for the GI Exercise, as he believed that Genneva could be in financial trouble. This was because the return period for gold bars under the GI exercise was extended from three days to a week and even longer. He testified that he later found out that Genneva did not return the gold bars which were collected from their customers under the GI Exercise.

44     He also gave evidence that from November 2011 onwards, Genneva had stopped paying him his commissions on time. From July 2012 onwards, he did not receive any more commission payment from Genneva.

### PW11 – Low Koon Seah

45     PW11 Low, another consultant with Genneva, gave evidence through a conditioned statement.[^59] He testified that he had deposited a 1000g gold bar with Genneva under the GI Exercise, and had obtained a promise by Genneva that he could collect a 1000g gold bar in three days. He understood that this meant that Genneva owed him a 1000g gold bar which was due in three days.

46     On 28 August 2012, in order take part in the GI Exercise, PW11 Low proceeded to Genneva and submitted a 1000g bar of gold and an invoice dated 14 August 2012[^60] which was earlier given to PW11 Low by Genneva in relation to the previous contract for the aforementioned bar of gold. The contract period under this invoice was stated to be one month from 14 August 2012, and PW11 Low could sell back the gold to Genneva between 13 and 20 September 2012. However, due to the GI Exercise, this period was brought forward to 26 August to 2 September 2012. Additionally, he also submitted a CSR form dated 28August 2012. On the CSR form, PW11 Low filled in his particulars and indicated that he was selling back his gold to Genneva and that he was buying 1,000g of gold from Genneva in the same transaction. After submitting the abovementioned items, PW11 Low left Genneva with a carbon copy of the CSR form.[^61]

47     Later, he asked PW10 Poh to help him to collect the gold bar due to him. To facilitate this, PW11 Low passed PW10 Poh the said CSR form. On 4 September 2012, on behalf of PW11 Low, PW10 Poh collected a 1,000g bar of gold and an invoice dated 4 September 2012 for a new contract.[^62] The new contract gave a larger discount at 2.2% per month compared to PW11 Low’s previous contract which gave only a 2% discount per month.

48     When Genneva issued the new contract on 4 September 2012, the first discount was due and was supposed to have been paid to him. However, Genneva did not make the payment. Instead, when PW10 Poh passed PW11 Low the above gold bar and invoice, he informed PW11 Low that Genneva would pay the first discount on the new contract when he collected his second discount from Genneva.

49     Following this, PW11 Low sent in another batch of gold for the GI Exercise. However, Genneva has not returned any gold to him to date.

### PW12 – Fredrik Lim Peng Chuan

50     PW12 Fredrik Lim Peng Chuan (“PW12 Fredrik”), who was a GMC and senior consultant at Genneva, also gave evidence through a conditioned statement.[^63] PW12 Fredrik testified that during the latter half of 2012, the financial situation in Genneva was “not good”.[^64] First, Genneva owed PW12 Fredrik his commissions that had accrued from January 2012 onwards. Second, Genneva delayed its discount payments to such an extent that he even helped Genneva pay the discounts owing to his clients out of his own pocket. Due to the delay in discount payments, more clients panicked and wanted to sell back their gold to Genneva. This created a vicious cycle which worsened Genneva’s cash flow problems.

51     Later, Genneva’s Malaysian directors implemented the GI Exercise to purportedly resolve Genneva’s financial crisis.[^65] These directors explained to PW12 Fredrik that one of the aims of the GI Exercise was to let Genneva have physical gold when Genneva bought gold from its clients. Genneva could then use the physical gold to meet new sales or for other business activities. Another excuse given was that this would prevent fake gold flowing into Genneva’s business.

52     PW12 Fredrik also described the Accused’s role in Genneva. He stated that the Accused was one of the persons in charge of Genneva’s operational matters and he oversaw the handling of the gold in Genneva. He further testified that the Accused was also in charge of the GI Exercise, and he made the decisions on when and how much gold were to be returned to clients who had sent in their gold for the GI Exercise. He also affirmed that the Accused was the person whom the consultants approached with questions about the gold that were still owed to the clients.[^66]

53     He also recalled that during an ad hoc meeting or a casual conversation in late July 2012, either the Accused or PW2 Kwok mentioned that one of the aims of the GI Exercise was to pawn the gold collected to pay the discounts to its clients. The clients were not told about the pawning of gold.

### PW13 – Ng Chuz Chuan

54     A conditioned statement[^67] was admitted as the evidence-in-chief of PW13 Ng Chuz Chuan (“PW13 Ng”), who started as a Genneva consultant in 2008 and later became a GMC. He testified that before the Accused joined Genneva in June to July 2012, Sanny Tiu Sy was in charge of Genneva’s operations, gold and cash. After the Accused and PW2 Kwok came to Genneva in June to July 2012, the Accused became in charge of Genneva’s operations, gold and cash. At an informal meeting that took place on or after June to July 2012, PW2 Kwok informed PW12 Ng and other consultants that the Accused was in charge of the gold. PW13 Ng also testified that the Accused was in charge of the GI Exercise, as he was in charge of Genneva’s gold. Consequently, the Accused knew what was done with Genneva’s gold and how much gold was collected for the GI Exercise.

55     He stated that he learnt that some clients did not get back their gold in three days after they had deposited gold with Genneva under the GI Exercise. As a result, he advised his clients to exercise caution in deciding whether or not to participate in the GI Exercise.

56     PW13 Ng also testified that from the time he joined Genneva, commission payments were delayed for between one to three months. Around June or July 2012, the Accused informed the GMCs and consultants that commission for sales made in January 2012 would be paid in or about July 2012. Later in August 2012, the Accused told the GMCs and some consultants that the January commissions would be paid in two instalments. However, Genneva failed to pay the second instalment. Genneva also delayed its discount payments.

### PW14 – IO Kenneth Lim Guang Rong

57     PW14 IO Kenneth Lim Guang Rong (“PW14 IO Lim”) is the current Investigation Officer for this case, having taken over from PW1 IO Norman. He gave evidence on the efforts to locate and contact Sanny Tiu Sy and PW15 Lim Yi Sheng (also known as “Rainie”) (“PW15 Rainie”). He informed the court that Sanny Tiu Sy was resident in the Philippines and PW15 Rainie in Malaysia. In particular, PW15 Rainie was willing to testify at the trial but was unable to travel to Singapore due to travel restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. As for Sanny Tiu Sy, he informed PW14 IO Lim that he was unwilling to testify due to the recent demise of his father.

### PW15 – Lim Yeng Sheng

58     PW15 Rainie, an administrative staff of Genneva who worked with the Accused in Office Room #08-06, testified that the Accused was her “_boss_” and that he gave her work instructions.[^68] With regards to the GI Exercise, the Accused instructed her to (i) apply data-dots to the gold; (ii) stop applying data-dots, after one to two weeks of applying data-dots; and (iii) distribute to customers gold that were not data-dotted.[^69] Every day, she was also required to inform the Accused “_about the gold coming in and out_” of Office Room #08-06.[^70]

59     She testified that after one to two weeks of data-dotting gold, the Accused instructed her to stop doing so and to issue gold that was not data-dotted.[^71] PW15 Rainie testified that the Accused had brought her and PW9 H’ng to take over the gold and money from Sanny Tiu Sy at Office Room #08-06. She further stated that the Accused also had control over the safe in Office Room #08-06._[^72]_

### PW16 – Michelle Foo Li-Mei; PW17 – Tan Fong Chin; and PW18 – Lee Hui Ting Stephanie

60     PW16 Michelle Foo Li-Mei, PW17 Tan Fong Chin and PW18 Lee Hui Ting Stephanie are CAD officers who recorded the statements of Sanny Tiu Sy: Exhibits P47-1 to P47-10. They gave evidence through conditioned statements.[^73] Their undisputed evidence was that they had recorded the statements from Sanny Tiu Sy accurately and that the latter had given his statements voluntarily.

### Sanny Tiu Sy

61     The statements of Sanny Tiu Sy were adduced in court as Exhibits P47-1 to P47-10. The statements showed that he had come to Singapore from the Philippines sometime in June 2008 and joined Genneva, which was his only employer in Singapore. He was soon promoted to business operations manager and had charge of the safes in Genneva, together with PW8 Leow.[^74] On 5 June 2012, he was shown an email from the board of directors of Genneva to the effect that PW2 Kwok was being posted in from Malaysia as the General Manager and that the Accused was being brought in to replace him.

62     He also stated in his statement that while PW2 Kwok was the General Manager, it was the Accused who was in charge of the Transaction Department and that it was this department which handled the buying, selling, collecting and pawning of the gold.[^75] He reiterated in his statements that it was the Accused who was in charge of actual inspection of the gold bars.[^76] He also further stated that it was the Accused who gave instructions for the sale of gold bars and gold to be pawned.[^77]

## Defence’s Case

63     The Accused chose not to make any submissions at the close of the prosecution’s case and elected to give evidence in his defence.

64     He stated that he is aged 44 years and married. He left school before he completed his Form 4 education. He joined GM in 2008. While he was in Malaysia, he said he was an office assistant, with duties mainly to accompany one Datuk Ng to the bank to either deposit or withdraw money. He also stated that when GM bought gold from the supplier, he collected gold from the bank on behalf of GM.[^78]

65     He stated that the owners were Datuk Ng, Datuk Yee, Datuk Chin, Datuk Lim, Datuk Tan, and Ahmad Kairudin. He also stated that GM enjoyed political support from persons such as Dr Mahathir, Datin Rosmah, the Penang Governor as well the princess of Pahang. He identified photographs where these personalities were present at some of the GM events.[^79]

66     He further testified that in late 2010, GM sent a team to Genneva to find out the differences in workflow as there were constant complaints of insufficient gold and money at Genneva. He stated that they discovered that unlike in GM, at Genneva, gold need not be returned for 3 days for renewal nor full payment be made for a purchase.[^80] He also explained some differences in processes in GM and at Genneva.[^81] In early 2011, the Accused was sent to Singapore to take over Genneva’s SKR Program, which was in the control of Datuk Chin.

67     Throughout his evidence he was quick to mention that he was not involved in Genneva’s business and was not stationed in Singapore.[^82] He stated that he was stationed at the office unit at #05 -27 Orchard Towers and took instructions from Datuk Ng to carry on the business with SKR Program until mid-July 2012. The Accused stated that he was tasked to assist PW2 Kwok to keep track of the gold and data-dotting at Genneva. A team of Malaysians were sent to help out. He was told that PW2 Kwok was required to start a new venture called Genneva World (“GW”) which would subsume the business of Genneva. The GMCs of Genneva were to be given a share in the new company GW.

68     Prior to the arrival of PW2 Kwok, it was one Jones Choo who was in charge of Genneva. He claimed that Sanny Tiu Sy was the business operations manager and that he did not take over any duties from Sanny Tiu Sy. He was only instructed by Datuk Ng, to assist PW2 Kwok.[^83] He denied having ever seen Exhibit P1, which was an internal memorandum detailing his secondment as the head of the Transaction Department of Genneva, replacing Sanny Tiu Sy. He testified that he was stationed in Office Room #08-06 in Orchard Towers, and had staff reporting to him. He distanced himself from what he called the Transaction Room which he said was occupied by PW8 Leow.

69     It was his evidence that his staff kept track of the gold movement on an Excel spreadsheet. He further said that he did not know about the GI exercise (or Gold renewal and rebalancing program). Accordingly, he denied that he briefed the consultants about this when it was not his job to do so. He also testified that he did not deal with any of the agents or the consultants.

70     As far as he was aware, the counter staff ensured that the gold was bought from Genneva by verifying the serial number on the invoice with the physical gold. It was only after such confirmation that the gold would be handed over to his room.[^84] The gold so received would be recorded in an Excel spreadsheet, Exhibit P2, by the staff who received the gold. He also gave evidence that another extract of the Excel spreadsheet also appears in Exhibit P42, which records the movement of the gold in and out of the office room. It was his evidence that during the period 21 August 2012 to 24 September 2012, the office room received 3,676,905g of gold and issued out 3,662,295g of gold.[^85] He stated that the Excel spreadsheet did not reflect the actual amount of gold received by Genneva during the GI Exercise as the gold was received from other sources. He also insisted that he did not deal with any cash.

71     It was his defence that he was not in a position to decide how much gold was to be collected under the GI Exercise. He was also not in a position to decided how much gold was to be returned and to which customers. It was his evidence that when the GMCs spoke to him about the gold, he would refer the issues to Datuk Ng, who instructed him on what he should do.

## The Law

72     Section 340(1) of the Companies Act states:

> **Responsibility for fraudulent trading**

> If, in the course of the winding up of a company or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court directs.

73     Section 340(5) of the Companies Act provides:

> Where any business of a company is carried on with the intent or for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1), every person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business with that intent or purpose shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $15,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.

74     It is pertinent to observe that the pre-conditions for an action under section 340(1) of the Companies Act (that there be winding up or any other proceedings involving the company) are not required for an offence under section 340(5) of the Companies Act. Section 340(6) of the Companies Act is explicit in that “\[s\]ubsection (5) shall apply to a company whether or not it has been, or is in the course of being, wound up.”.

75     Further, the Court of Appeal in _Phang Wah v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 60</span> (“_Phang Wah_ (SGCA)”), at \[19\], had also clarified that “\[t\]he effect of s 340(5) of the \[Companies\] Act was to create separate criminal liability independent of the civil liability embodied in s 340(1) of the \[Companies\] Act.”, and affirmed that section 340(6) of the Companies Act reinforced this conclusion.

76     An offence in section 340(5) of the Companies Act attaches criminal liability to persons who are knowingly a party to the carrying on of a business with either of the intentions or purposes mentioned in section 340(1) of the Companies Act i.e. either (a) to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person; or (b) for any fraudulent purpose.

77     To make out the charge against the Accused, the Prosecution must prove that:

> (a)     Genneva carried on the business, namely the GI Exercise, between 17 August and 30 September 2012;

> (b)     The business of the GI Exercise was carried on with the intent of defrauding the creditors of Genneva; and

> (c)     The Accused was a knowing party to the carrying on of Genneva’s business i.e. the GI Exercise, with that intent.

78     It is also necessary for the court to be satisfied that the GI Exercise was indeed a business carried on by Genneva between 17 August and 30 September 2012 as one of its main business activities during the said period.

79     The next element that requires to be proven by evidence is that the GI Exercise was carried out with the intent of defrauding Genneva’s creditors, in this case as contended by the Prosecution, its own customers.

80     The legal test to establish defrauding of customers is clearly set out by the High Court in _Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 227</span> (“_Rahj Kamal_”). A business is carried on with intent to defraud creditors if it incurs debts which the company had no intention of repaying at the time when the debt occurred. In _Rahj Kamal_ at \[35\] – \[36\], the High Court agreed that there was intent to defraud under section 340(5) of the Companies Act where a company had no profit-generating business and there was a substantial risk of creditors not getting their money back:

> 35    For the fraudulent trading offences, the Prosecution needed only prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, two elements: first, that the business of the Company had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors or with a fraudulent purpose and, second, that the accused was knowingly a party to the carrying on of that business with such intent or purpose. With regard to the first element, the trial judge was persuaded by _R v Grantham_ <span class="citation">\[1984\] QB 675</span>, a case on s 332(3) read with s 332(1) of the 1948 English Companies Act, which was _in pari materia_ to s 340(5) and 340(1) of our Companies Act. In that case, the trial judge’s direction, which was approved by the Criminal Court of Appeal was set out at 169a–d:

>> **… A man intends to defraud a creditor either if he intends that the creditor shall never be paid or alternatively if he intends to obtain credit or carry on obtaining credit when the rights and interests of the creditor are being prejudiced in a way which the defendant himself has generally regarded as dishonest … a trader can intend to defraud if he obtains credit when there is a substantial risk of the creditor not getting his money or not getting the whole of his money** and the defendant knows that that is the position and knows he is stepping beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business would regard as honest.

> 36    As discussed above, **with no profit-generating business under the Company’s belt, there was, to the knowledge of the appellant, a substantial risk of the victims not getting their money or the whole of their money. The trial judge was therefore entitled to find that there was intent to defraud the creditors** and that the appellant was knowingly a party, having made a well-supported finding that the appellant was, at the very least, aware of the DP. Hence the elements of the fraudulent trading offences were also made out. Accordingly, I had no hesitation in dismissing the appellant’s appeal on these charges.

\[emphasis added\]

81     In order for fraudulent trading to be established, it is necessary to show that a creditor was deceived or misled and that the defendant intended to gain an advantage: _Liquidator of Leong Seng Hin Piling Pte Ltd v Chan Ah Leck and others_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 77</span> (“_Leong Seng Hin_”), at \[17\].

82     In that case the plaintiff was the liquidator of Leong Seng Hin Piling Pte Ltd (“LSH”), a company which was wound up pursuant to a winding-up petition presented by Group Industries Pte Ltd (“GIPL”) on the ground that LSH was insolvent as it was unable to pay a judgment debt. The plaintiff, as liquidator of LSH, sought a declaration under section 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) that the three defendants, who were former directors of LSH, were knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of LSH with intent to defraud creditors. The question that the court considered was whether “the defendants \[did\] continue to receive supplies knowing that it could not pay for them so much so that the defendants had been knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of the company with intent to defraud GIPL within the meaning of s 340(1)” (at \[18\]).

83     Another issue that arises under section 340(1) of the Companies Act is the question of whether dishonesty needs to be established. In this context, the court in _Leong Seng Hin_, at \[14\] – \[15\], held that the test for honest conduct is both objective and subjective:

> … So the subjective intention of the defendant that he has acted in good faith (and a court may draw inferences from the surrounding circumstances of the case as to the defendant’s state of mind and his honest intent: see _Tang Yoke Kheng_ at \[8\]) constitutes evidence which the court evaluates and tests against the weight of other objective facts available, including, if required, the objective standard of what an honest person would have done in the circumstances, in assessing the conduct of the defendant which is alleged to be dishonest.

84     In the case of _Marina Towage Pte Ltd v Chin Kwek Chong and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 81</span> (“_Marina Towage_”), in considering intent to defraud, the court stated (at \[96\]):

> As for the substance of an intent to defraud, Lord Lane CJ observed in the English criminal case of _R v Grantham_ <span class="citation">\[1984\] QB 675</span> at 681 that a debtor has an intent to defraud a creditor if the debtor obtains credit intending that the creditor will never be paid or obtains credit or carries on obtaining credit to the prejudice of the creditor in a manner which the debtor knows is generally regarded as dishonest:

>> … A man intends to defraud a creditor either if he intends that the creditor shall never be paid or alternatively if he intends to obtain credit or carry on obtaining credit when the rights and interests of the creditor are being prejudiced in a way which the defendant himself knows is generally regarded as dishonest … \[A\] trader can intend to defraud if he obtains credit when there is a substantial risk of the creditor not getting his money or not getting the whole of his money and the defendant knows that that is the position and knows he is stepping beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business would regard as honest.

> The Court of Appeal cited this passage with approval in _Tang Yoke Kheng_ (at \[7\]), while acknowledging the futility of “attempting to cast a legal definition of something as amorphous as ‘fraud’” and conceding that Lord Lane CJ’s words are “merely an account of an instance in which fraud might manifest itself”.

85     It is clear that there can be no intent to defraud unless there is dishonesty resulting in deception of an innocent party, which can be proven as a practical forensic necessity by circumstantial evidence: _Marina Towage_ per Coomaraswamy J at \[98\]:

> There can be no intent to defraud, therefore, unless there is dishonesty resulting in deception of an innocent party: _M+W Singapore_ (\[50\] _supra_) at \[103\]. Dishonesty is a subjective state of mind. What must be proven is that the defendant held subjectively a dishonest intent: _Leong Seng_ at \[13\]. Of course, it is impossible to see into a defendant’s mind and thereby to prove conclusively that it held a subjective dishonest intent. Therefore, as a practical forensic necessity, an intent to defraud can be proven only by circumstantial evidence, not by direct evidence.

86     It can be surmised from the above cases, that one of the factors which a court looks at, in determining whether there was an “intent to defraud”, is whether the defendant company had taken credit or goods while knowing that it could not pay. In the event such a practice was carried out rampantly or consistently, the more fortified the court would be in making a finding that there was such an intent to defraud.

87     Turning now to consider the relevant facts that need to be considered to decide whether an offence under section 340(5) of the Companies Act is made out, useful guidance is provided in the case of _Phang Wah and others v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 646</span> (“_Phang Wah_ (SGHC)”). Even though _Phang Wah_ (SGHC) concerned a charge under the _fraudulent trading_ limb of section 340(5) of the Companies Act, the analogous facts and considerations in that case are equally applicable to the present case, which concerns the defrauding of creditors.

88      _Phang Wah_ concerned a multi-level marketing business, Sunshine Empire, which offered various lifestyle packages to its clients. The clients purchased these packages with points which they obtained through payment of money to the business. In return, clients received monetary payouts from the business, styled “CRP payouts”. In finding that Sunshine Empire’s business was unsustainable, the court considered the following factors (at \[35\]) namely, (a) Sunshine Empire’s consistent business practice in giving out large CRP payouts, which constituted a very high proportion of the business’ revenue; (b) these high payouts were paid for by the sale of new packages; (c) there was a consistently high level of payout for 15 months; (d) as such, the inference is that the high payouts was the attraction of the packages, and if the payouts were reduced, sales of the packages would be severely affected and cut off the revenue stream for the scheme; and (e) there were no credible alternative sources of revenue “_despite the allusions to vague future business plans and some minor ad hoc investments_.” (at \[35\]). Further, whether there was fraudulent trading is also a question of fact alone – _Phang Wah_ (SGCA) at \[24\].

## Assessment of Evidence

### Whether the GI Exercise was a business carried on by Genneva from 17 August to 30 September 2012

89     It was clearly established by documentary evidence and by witnesses in the course of the trial that GI Exercise was indeed a business carried on by Genneva during the period 17 August to 30 September 2012.

90     PW2 Kwok had issued a letter on 15 August 2012 indicating to Genneva’s consultants that from 17 August 2012 onwards, customers may opt for “_early renewal_” for existing contracts which were due for “_rebalancing_”. The prescribed procedure required the customer to deposit the gold with Genneva for three working days for Genneva to apply data-dots to them.[^86]

91     This was followed closely by another update to “_All Genneva Clients_” from PW2 Kwok, on 24 August 2012 which made reference to “_Gold Inspection_” or the “_GI_” exercise.[^87] He stated that the purpose was to “_authenticate and verify each piece of gold sold to clients_” and to apply “_data-dots_” on them so that gold sold by Genneva could be identified by the data-dots.[^88]

92     PW10 Poh, PW11 Low, PW12 Fredrik and PW13 Ng had all confirmed the fact of the GI Exercise as well as the period when it commenced. I had no reason to disbelieve any of them. All of them confirmed that the GI Exercise had continued till the date of the raid by the CAD on 1 October 2012.

93     Witnesses also uniformly painted a picture of Genneva not being in a financially strong position with most of the gold trading activities concentrated on the GI Exercise. For example, PW12 Fredrik mentioned quite candidly that the GI Exercise was a lifeline to save the company which was in _dire straits_ and there were persistent reminders that it was probably the only way to salvage the company and the consultants went along although they had concerns of the company’s financial viability.[^89] Other witnesses also gave similar accounts of the state of Genneva at the material time.[^90]

94     I also found that the GI Exercise was used to incentivise the customers to send their gold in for inspection in the course of contract renewals. Genneva offered attractive terms for the renewed contracts which included an option for early renewal of the contracts with discounts owed being paid to the customers upon such renewal. It was clear that the GI Exercise was in fact the most important business of Genneva during this period.

### Whether the business was carried on with the intent to defraud the creditors of Genneva

95     PW4 Toh, the Prosecution’s expert witness who prepared the Expert Report in Exhibit P4, gave a very clear and succinct account of the business of Genneva upon his forensic examination of the company and its business model. PW4 Toh illustrated key business transactions between Genneva and its key stakeholders with the following diagram:[^91]

![]([2022] SGDC 0047_Image/[2022] SGDC 0047_image1.png)

96     He explained the above as follows:

> (1)     Genneva purchases gold from gold suppliers.

> (2)     Genneva sells gold to customers who will have an option to sell back the gold to Genneva at the same Selling Price during the Buy Back Period

> (3)     Genneva pays upfront discount and/ or monthly discount to customers.

> (4)     Genneva pays monthly commission to Agents/ Sales Consultants.

> (5)     Genneva buys back the gold at the same Selling Price when the customers exercise the option to sell back the gold to Genneva during the Buy Back Period.

97     PW4 Toh, whose evidence on the above description was not challenged, also testified that customers could purchase the gold under various schemes offered by the company, including either actual delivery of physical gold (the "Gold Scheme") or non-delivery of physical gold (the "Goldless Scheme"). The key difference between the Gold Scheme and the Goldless Scheme is that under the Gold Scheme, the company will deliver the gold to customers, whereas under the Goldless Scheme, there is no physical delivery of gold to customers.

98     He further testified that based on documents and information made available to him he found that there were 39 types of offers/ product codes under the Gold Scheme with various contract periods and terms of discounts.[^92] The monthly agent commission was also based on the volume of gold sold by the Agents or Sales Consultants.[^93]

99     There was really no challenge to PW4 Toh’s Expert Report except that it was alleged that he “_took the documents at face value and was unable to authenticate or verify the information contained in the documents… particularly the financial documents of Company_”, and that his “_findings and opinions were based on assumptions and accounting projections_.”[^94]

100    On this, PW4 Toh had stated that the report did “n_ot amount to an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is to express an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole_”.[^95] He had clarified that his Expert Report was based on the available documents and information including financial data seized by the Singapore Police Force from Genneva's premises that he had used and listed in Appendix 3.[^96]

101    In dealing with the Expert Report of PW4 Toh and assessing the weight to be given to PW4 Toh’s assertions, I was fully aware of the limitations but however found that as regards the relevant and material issues in this trial, his evidence clearly buttressed the evidence of the other witnesses and I accordingly accepted his very careful and detailed analysis of the business of Genneva as well as agreed with his opinion on the dire financial straits of the company, which will be dealt with later in these Grounds.

102    The evidence led disclosed that the customers of Genneva who participated in the GI Exercise were indeed defrauded when Genneva failed to return them their gold as promised. The customers thus became creditors of Genneva.

103    PW4 Toh had explained the GI Exercise succinctly as follows:[^97]

> 43    The following illustrative example presents how the GI exercise worked based on our reading and understanding of the documents and information made available to us.

> 44.    Illustrative example of gold inspection (See Appendix 8 and Appendix 9): A customer had previously bought 1 kilogram of gold from Genneva, Product Code "rebalancing 3rd" at a selling price of $95,000 and a monthly discount of 2% over the Selling Price. The contract is due in one month. The customer decides to bring the gold to Genneva for GI exercise and renew the contract. The customer fills the CSR form in which the customer requests to sell back the 1 kilogram of gold to Genneva at $95,000 and at the same time to purchase 1 kilogram of gold from Genneva at the same price of $95,000 under Product Code "2.2%/180 days". The CSR form also indicates that the customer can come back to Genneva to collect the new Sales Invoice, 1 kilogram of gold and upfront discount of 2.2%, computed to be $2,090 over the Selling Price of $95,000 three (3) days later ("Gold collection date"). Genneva also issues a Purchase Invoice and a Payment Voucher.

> On the Gold collection date, the customer collects the new Sales Invoice, 1 kilogram of gold and cash of $2,090 for upfront discount from Genneva. The renewal contract (Product Code "2.2%/180 days") now will be due in six (6) months, instead of one (1) month as per previous contract before renewal, with a monthly discount of 2.2% over the Selling Price of $95,000.

104    The following flow chart depicted how the GI transactions were carried out:[^98]

![]([2022] SGDC 0047_Image/[2022] SGDC 0047_image2.png)

> (1)    A customer submits a CSR form and an original Sales Invoice, Product Code "rebalancing 3rd" to Genneva for early renewal. The contract will be due in one (1) month) together with one (1) kilogram of gold. Under the original Sales Invoice, Product Code "rebalancing 3rd", the Selling Price was $95,000 and the monthly discount was 2% over the Selling Price. The CSR form indicates that the customer requests to sell back the one (1) kilogram of gold to Genneva at $95,000 and at the same time purchase one (1) kilogram of gold from Genneva at the same price of $95,000 under Product Code "2.2 0/0/180 days". The CSR form also indicates the "Gold collection date" (three (3) working days from Gold inspection date, which is the date that the customer handed over the gold to Genneva) when the customer can come back to collect the new Sales Invoice, one (1) kilogram of gold and cash for upfront discount of 2.2% of $2,090 over the Selling Price of $95,000.

> (2)    Genneva will issue a Purchase Invoice and a Payment Voucher to be signed by the customer for the buy-back of the one (1) kilogram of gold at $95,000. The customer does not receive actual cash for the gold that was sold back to the Company. Instead, the cash amount of $95,000 will be used to offset against the same Selling Price or the Gross Total Value of the new Sales Invoice for the new purchase of one (1) kilogram of gold.

> (3)    On the Gold collection date, the customer will submit a copy of signed CSR form to Genneva.

> (4)    Genneva will give the customer the new Sales Invoice, the one (1) kilogram of gold and cash of $2,090 for the upfront discount of 2.2% over the Selling Price of $95,000.

105    I examined the exhibits tendered in respect of the above and found that when a customer brought in his gold with the previous set of contractual documents and filled up the necessary CSR form to seek a new contract, the customer had to surrender his gold and documents in exchange for a document that advised him to return to Genneva three days later or in some cases even a longer period.[^99] Although the customer signed a document acknowledging that he had sold gold to Genneva, he in fact did not receive any cash but only an assurance that he can return on the future date indicated to collect his fresh contract and the equivalent in gold.[^100]

106    I found that although the transaction was reflected in the available documents seized from Genneva as a transaction for the purchase and sale of gold, in reality the customer saw it as a renewal of the contract for the gold. During this period, the customer would have had to leave the gold in the custody of Genneva and may get gold of equivalent quantity and not that which he handed to the company.

107    It was evident to me that during this period the customers were in fact extending credit to Genneva, even without realising what the company was up to. In this regard, I found that Genneva was carrying on the GI Exercise as its main gold trading business with no profit generating business and with substantial risk of creditors not getting their money back.

108    I find that those in charge of carrying out the GI Exercise must have known that a large number of customers will not be repaid. The forensic analysis of Genneva’s operations by PW4 Toh was telling.

109    After a thorough analysis of the assets and liabilities position of the company, not only during the material period of the GI Exercise, but generally overall from its very inception, PW4 Toh opined as follows:

> 94    In summary, the Company has consistently made losses since its incorporation and incurred accumulated losses of $228,086,515 as at 16 August 2012 as shown in Table 22. Based on our observation, there was no evidence to show the Company had any significant investing activities. Therefore, the Company's mainstream of income was from operating activities.

> ….

> Profitability of Genneva's products under the Goldless Scheme

> 100.  As explained and illustrated in paragraphs 33 to 39, for products under Goldless Scheme, the Company will have negative cash outflows and incur costs including monthly discount and monthly commission to be paid to customers and the Agents respectively. In addition, as there is no physical delivery gold, the financial results of products under the Goldless Schemes are not subject to the movements of market gold prices. Consequently, Genneva cannot make any profit from the products under Goldless Schemes.

> 101.  In summary, based on our analysis, the Company's products would most likely incur losses and would most likely not be profitable. If the Company's products cannot make profits, the Company may not generate sufficient cash flows in the long term to repay its creditors when liabilities fall due and consequently the business was most likely to fail.

> Opinion

> 102.  Based on our analysis as detailed in paragraphs 79 to 83, the Company always had a net liabilities position since its incorporation and had a net liability of $227,586,517 as at 16 August 2012. This indicates that the Company would most likely be unable to repay its creditors when liabilities fall due.

> 103.  Based on our analysis as detailed in paragraphs 84 to 86, the Company would most likely be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to repay its creditors when liabilities fall due.

> 104.  Based on our analysis as detailed in paragraphs 87 to 101, the Company and its products would most likely be unable to make profits.

> 105.  Consequently, Genneva's business was most likely to fail and would be unable to repay creditors based on how the business of the Company was conducted during the above period.

110    The above resounding indictment on the financial state of Genneva, is consistent with the testimony of witnesses who testified that the situation was really bleak during the material period. Commissions which were paid to the consultants on a monthly basis, were delayed for more than three months and in the case of PW5 Lim he was owed three to four months’ worth of commissions and at the date of the CAD raid he was owed about $300,000.[^101] This delay in payments was also recounted by PW12 Fredrik who was owed as much as $1 million.

111    It was PW7 Thia’s evidence that PW2 Kwok together with the Accused implemented a limit on the amount of gold that could be sold back to the company each day as Genneva was unable to raise funds to pay the customers who wished to sell back their gold.[^102]

112    I found that the evidence of PW10 Poh, PW13 Ng and PW8 Leow fully corroborated the conclusions reached by PW4 Toh on his forensic analysis of the company and the ominous financial position of the company.[^103]

113    It was a consistent account by the witnesses that during this period the company continued take in gold from the customers but with no prospect of the gold being returned to the customers.[^104]

114    That this was the state of affairs in the company was admitted by the Accused in court:[^105]

> Singapore kept complaining to Malaysia---Genneva Malaysia that they did not have enough money and gold. Okay. The---so, the company sent the group of us over here to look at the workflow.

And in his statement to the CAD:[^106]

Question 49:

 | 

What do you mean by Genneva Singapore’s office was short of cash and gold bars?

 |
| 

Answer:

 | 

At that time, Genneva Singapore was managed by a person called Joey Leow and there were lots of requests from the Singapore office to the Malaysia office asking for physical gold to be sent from Malaysia to Singapore. For the shortage of cash, Datuk Ng Poh Weng told me that the Malaysia female accountant, Ms Chew, who had followed us on the visit did a verification of Genneva Singapore’s accounts and reported to Datuk Yee that there was a shortage of cash in Genneva Singapore’s office.

Question 57:

 | 

Are you aware of any other financial difficulties faced by Genneva Singapore since you entered Singapore in 2011?

 |
| 

Answer:

 | 

Yes, I was aware that clients were not getting their discount payments and I also heard complaints from GMCs (Fredrik Lim, Justin Lim, Sammi Goh, Desmond Peh) of delayed payments of their commissions. The GMCs complained to me as they wanted to inform Datuk Ng Poh Weng to solve the issue as he was the Finance Director.

115    I found that the above clearly demonstrates that Genneva was manifestly unable to meet its liabilities and its customers were fast becoming creditors of the company when what was due to them was not paid on due dates or gold to be returned was not done so.

### Whether the Accused was a knowing party to the carrying on of the GI Exercise, with the intent to defraud the creditors of Genneva

116    Importantly, what needs to be considered next is whether the Accused who was a party to the carrying on of the GI Exercise knew that the company was carrying on the GI Exercise with the intent to defraud Genneva’s creditors.

117    The prosecution’s evidence showed that the Accused was in a position where he was effectively in charge of the crucial part of the GI Exercise, i.e. the collection of the gold from the customers and the subsequent disposal of the same. Whereas the Accused’s defence was that he was not in charge of the GI Exercise nor did he have knowledge about it. He wanted the court to believe that he was only an office assistant.

118    I have to start with Exhibit P1, the “Internal Memorandum” dated 5 June 2012 that was issued to Leon Leow Wee Khong by the board of directors of Genneva Pte Ltd.[^107] The Internal Memorandum signed by one Dato Marcus Yee Yuen Seng entitled “_Secondment of Mr Aaron Kwok Fong Loong and Mr Ivan Lim Hong Boon_”, stated:

> We refer to the above

> The Directors have decided with effect from 15th June 2012, Mr Aaron Lwok\[sic\] Fong Loong will be seconded to Genneva Pte Ltd as General Manager and **Mr Ivan Lim Hong will be seconded to head the Transaction Department of Genneva Pte Ltd replacing Mr Sanny Tiu Sy**.

> Your attention is much appreciated.

\[emphasis added\]

119    I did not consider Exhibit P1 alone as determinative of the Accused’s role in the GI Exercise, but rather as one of the shreds of evidence led before the court that established that the Accused played an integral part in the GI Exercise.

120    The evidence of the prosecution witnesses was that the staff and GMCs of Genneva looked to the Accused for answers and directions in respect all the issues that arose in connection with the GI Exercise. This included important details such as the distribution and disposition of gold.[^108] PW7 Thia also testified that when there was a delay in the customers getting back their gold he approached the Accused to resolve the matter. Remarkably, PW6 Luc and PW7 Thia testified that it was the Accused who had the answers to their queries because he was the person in charge of the gold collected during the GI Exercise.[^109] PW7 Thia’s responses indicate that the Accused was the person in control of the gold operations under the GI Exercise:[^110]

> Q:    Alright. Then after that, what happened?

> A:    After that it got delayed from, uh, 3 days later to 5 days later. Subsequently, 7 days and beyond.

> Q:    Why was there this delay?

> A:    Uh, I do not know.

> Q:    Did you ask anybody as to why there was this delay?

> A:    We tried asking around---I tried asking, uh, my GMC but nobody could give us an answer.

> Q:    Okay. Did you speak to any person inside the---inside the gold inspection room?

> A:    Um, I don’t remember.

> Q:    Okay. Okay. During the gold inspection process, did you speak to Ivan at all?

> A:    On and off, yes.

> Q:    What do you speak to him about?

> A:    Um, mainly, why---why is it taking so long and, uh---yah, mainly, what is it taking so long from 3 days to 5 days then subsequently so long, 7 days and beyond.

> Q:    Okay. And what was his answer?

> A:    His answer was, um, there wasn’t enough people to help to do data dotting.

121    PW7 Thia also further clarified in his examination-in-chief:[^111]

> Q:    Okay. So---okay, so, my question now is, why did you--- sorry, why did you suggest to Luc Tai to go and look for Ivan and not anyone else?

> A:    Because all the gold ends up in that room in Ivan’s office.

> Q:    Okay.

> …

> Q:    Whi---which one is Ivan’s office in 08-06? Can you just point out to us?

> Court:    At which point of time.

> Hon:  Sorry. Your Honour.

> Q:    During the GI scheme?

> A:    Office room.

> Q:    Okay. So when you mentioned about the gold inspection room, which room are you talking about?

> A:    Office room.

> Q:    Okay. So, when you mentioned about the gold inspection room with Ivan and the 2 girls, which room is it?

> A:    Office room.

> Q:    Okay. Okay. Then, was there anybody in the transaction room?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Who was in the transaction room?

> A:    Mr. ‘Heng’.

> Q:    And---so my question is, why did you approach Ivan in the gold inspection room also known as office room---

> A:    Mmm hmm.

> Q:    Instead of Mr. ‘Heng’ in the transaction room?

> A:    Because, uh, even if, uh---if you approached Mr. ‘Heng’, he approached it to Ivan. He will say he doesn’t know anything, please ask Ivan.

> Q:    Okay. Why?

> A:    That I do not know why.

> Q:    Okay. As in---so, I’m trying to understand why is it that when there was a query, you went to Ivan?

> A:    Mmm. Like I said, so even if you ask anybody else, they will all refer to Ivan. So subsequently, there is a common understanding that, okay, so even if I go to A or B or C, they will all ask me to refer to Ivan.

> Q:    Okay. Why is everyone referring questions to Ivan?

> A:    I do not know.

> Q:    Okay. In what sense---sorry, let me just rephrase that question. What was Ivan doing such that he was expected by people to know what was going on?

> A:    Okay. Because during the GI, the GI takes up mainly the whole bulk of the---the transactions then because it was a GI, right? So since he is in charge of the GI, so basically, everybody just refer---refer us or refer any queries, anything you want to ask, you want to know, go ask Ivan.

122    PW12 Fredrik in his conditioned statement[^112] admitted as part of his examination-in-chief recounted the role that the Accused played in the GI Exercise which unmistakeably showed that the Accused was playing an important and integral role in the GI Exercise:

> 8.    There were meetings held to discuss the implementation of the GI exercise, Ivan Lim, Aaron Kwok, GMCs and AGMCs attended the meetings which are held at 0809 of Genneva’s premises. There were discussions to finalise the workflow of the GI exercise. Ivan Lim had mentioned that the packaging of the gold will be removed in order to Data-Dot the gold.

> 9.    Ivan Lim was one of the persons in charge of operational matters in Genneva, he oversaw the handling of the gold in Genneva. I think only Ivan Lim had access to the safe where the gold bars are kept in #08-06 of Genneva’s premises at Orchard Towers. His office was in the room beside the balcony in #08-06.

> 10.    As Ivan was in charge of the GI exercise, he made the decisions on when and how much gold were to be returned to clients who have sent in their gold for the GI exercise. He was also the person the consultants including myself who approached to ask questions about the gold owing to us or our clients. To my knowledge, Ivan Lim reported to the 3 Malaysian directors and usually took instructions from Ng Poh Weng.

> 11.    The assistant GMCs, AGMCs helped in the collection of gold bars from and the return of gold bars to Genneva’s clients for the GI exercise. These AGMCs included Colin Thia and Victor Luc Tai. Counter staff at 0806 of Genneva’s premises at Orchard Towers also helped to return gold bars to clients.

> 12.    The AGMCs will pass the gold bars to Ivan and his team for the Data-Dotting. 3 days later, gold bars with the same weight will be returned to the clients through the AGMCs. This period of 3 days subsequently became extended.

123    He stood firm during cross-examination on his observation on the role played by the Accused and I found no reason to doubt the veracity of his evidence as regards the Accused’s part in the GI Exercise:[^113]

> Q:    So, basically everyone was just evading responsibility and pointing to Ivan to have to answer all these questions?

> A:    I’m---I wasn’t sure if they are evading responsibility, but, uh, I g---I do believe that they---they have no idea what he---you know. They can’t make a decision, uh---uh, because they were, uh, always, you know, if I---whene---whenever I ask Aaron or whoever they will said, “Go and talk to Ivan”, uh, because they have no idea when the gold will come in or---or not, yah.

> Q:    And you say that Ivan reported to the 3 Malaysian directors and usually took instructions from Ng Poh Weng?

> A:    Yes, yes.

124    Evidence from PW9 H’ng was also corroborative of the above description of the role of the Accused. PW15 Rainie, the administrative assistant at the Accused’s office, identified him as her “_boss_” and testified as to how he gave her work instructions relating to the GI Exercise pertaining to application of the data-dots as well as to keep the Accused informed “_about the gold coming in and out_” at Office Room #08-06[^114]:

> Q:    Would you agree that the persons in the office room is in charge of the gold that is coming in and going out of that office room?

> A:    We have to inform I---Ivan about the gold coming in and going out.

> Q:    What---what do you mean by you have to inform him?

> A:    Every day, we have to inform him how much gold came in and how much gold went---went out.

> Q:    Do you know if---did you inform anybody else about the amount of gold coming in and out on a daily basis?

> A:    Only if Aaron Kwok queried, then we would tell him or else, no.

> Q:    Now, do you know who is Ivan Lim’s boss?

> A:    Should be Aaron Kwok

125    It is therefore quite clear that the Accused’s role was not only central to the GI Exercise but was significant as he controlled the movement of the gold and gold redemptions. It is also noteworthy that the witnesses saw him as the one having direct access to the directors of Genneva in Malaysia, in particular one Datuk Ng.

126    His access to Datuk Ng and his familiarity with the operations of Genneva both here and in Malaysia showed that he can reasonably be expected to know and be aware that the company was not engaged in any business activity with the gold collected that would generate sufficient revenue to meet its liabilities to the customers. Critically, he was also aware of the gold surrendered during the GI Exercise being sold, pawned or sent overseas. This is strengthened by the fact that he admitted in his statement to the CAD that he did in fact come to Singapore on a weekly basis at the instructions of Datuk Ng Poh Weng.[^115] This flies in the face of his consistent denial in his defence in court of any knowledge of what was happening at the Genneva Singapore office.

127    The Accused’s denial in court was in direct contradiction to his claim that he was merely supervising data-dotting. His extensive incriminating involvement in the activities of Genneva Singapore was disclosed by himself in his unchallenged statement to the CAD when he was asked to elaborate on his responsibilities as instructed by Datuk Ng Poh Weng:[^116]

> When I first came out to Singapore in 2011… I was instructed by Datuk Ng Poh Weng to collect cash from a money changer in Arab Street, ranging from $200,000 to $500,000 to be paid as commission payouts to the agents or to buyback gold from the agents. There were also one or two instances where I had to collect cash from the same money changer, about $600,000 to purchase gold from Genneva Singapore (about 10kg of gold) and I would transport the gold pieces back to Malaysia myself. This was my responsibility up till the period where a Gold Inspection exercise (“GI exercise”) took place sometime in August 2012.

> **During the period of the GI exercise, I was passed pawn tickets from Jones Choo for me to redeem from the pawnshops. I understood that these gold were pawned by the agents as they wanted to use the proceeds from pawning the gold to purchase another gold from Genneva Singapore. I would inform Datuk Ng Poh Weng the weight of the gold to be redeemed from the pawnshops and he would give the approval and arranged for me to pick up cash from the same money change\[r\] in Arab Street, Singapore. The amount would range from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 as the amount of gold to be redeemed would then be transported back to Malaysia by car accompanied with Genneva Malaysia operations staff and 2 bodyguards.**

\[emphasis added\]

128    The Accused’s main defence to the charge was that he was not in charge of the GI Exercise nor did he have any knowledge about it. I find that on the evidence before me this clearly cannot be true. The Accused’s evidence in court and his instructions to counsel put to some of the prosecution witnesses were perforated with inconsistencies which he was unable to explain when cross-examined.

129    There were numerous occasions when he tried to minimise his role in Genneva’s finances and knowledge of Genneva’s financial health, and denied helping to record and prepare cash payments that would ultimately be paid to customers. However, when he was confronted with his Statement to the CAD where he had stated quite categorically:[^117]

> I would also record and prepare the cash payments that would be handed to the counter staff for the purpose of passing to the customers. My job is very easy, another operations colleague would inform me how much cash is needed to be returned to customers and I will prepare them and pass it to my operations colleague. My colleague will then divide the cash according to the individual customer contracts and hand over the cash to the counter staff who would pass to the customers.

he was at a loss to explain and proffered answers which confirmed that he was lying in court when he down played his role.[^118] His story became further unbelievable when he tried to distance himself from any knowledge of the GI Exercise by claiming that he was not aware of the term “Gold Inspection Exercise” before the trial.[^119] This obviously could not be the case as it was he who had used the term during the recording of the unchallenged CAD statement as highlighted earlier in these Grounds.[^120]

130    Whilst the evidence in the trial undoubtedly established that he was in the thick of affairs relating the GI Exercise in Genneva Singapore, the Accused had tried to distance himself from any knowledge of the financial health of Genneva by even denying that he was kept updated of Genneva’s cash inflows and outflows.[^121] This was again in direct contradiction to his statement where he admitted that he was kept informed of the cash flows by the staff concerned.[^122] He was unable to explain this discrepancy[^123] which proved that he had knowledge of the cash management and financial health of the company.

131    The Accused denied that he had knowledge of the fact that gold collected from the GI Exercise were pawned and later redeemed with Genneva Malaysia’s money and sent to Malaysia. He claimed that money from Genneva Malaysia was never used to redeem the gold.[^124] However, I find that again this clearly contradicts his statement to the CAD that most of the redemptions were made using Genneva Malaysia’s funds.[^125] He had to concede and admit in cross-examination that his statement to the CAD was accurate.[^126] His evidence in court in this respect was also distinctively a lie as has been the case with many aspects of his evidence in court.

132    As highlighted earlier, the Accused has been contradicted by several witnesses who spoke truthfully of the events that transpired during the material time. The Accused’s denials were simply aimed at giving a lower profile to his role. For example, he claimed that he did not replace Sanny Tiu Sy as the head of Genneva’s Transaction Department.[^127] This has been contradicted by multiple witnesses whose evidence I accept as being truthful. In fact Sanny Tiu Sy had stated in his statement to the CAD that the Accused took over from him in late June 2012 and that since then, he was kept in the dark regarding Genneva's financial status.[^128]

133    PW13 Ng, besides confirming the role of the Accused, also testified that he was in a position within the company that was higher in the hierarchy than Sanny Tiu Sy and further testified that PW2 Kwok, as the General Manager, had given directions to him and other consultants that the Accused was in charge of the Gold.[^129] The evidence given by PW15 Rainie was also to similar effect.[^130]

134    PW8 Leow testified that he transferred all the gold, cash, assets and control to PW2 Kwok and the Accused.[^131] In addition the Accused’s claims[^132] of not being in charge of the employees in Genneva rang hollow when considered against the incontrovertible evidence given by PW9 H’ng[^133] and PW15 Rainie.[^134] The evidence of PW9[^135] and PW5 Lim[^136] also show that it was the Accused who decided how much gold to disburse and to whom.

135    Although the Accused had painted a picture of himself as being subordinate to others in the company, the evidence before me showed otherwise. During his cross-examination, it was clear that during the GI Period, the Accused reported to and took instructions directly from Datuk Ng,[^137] and did not report to anyone else in Genneva Singapore.[^138] I am left with this distinct impression based on the evidence, that Accused was clearly an employee with sufficient authority derived directly from his masters in Malaysia, in particular one Datuk Ng.

136    I was therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty as charged and convicted him.

## Sentence

### Prosecution’s Submissions

137    The prosecution submitted that during the four months of Genneva’s troubled existence (from June to September 2012), the Accused was in charge of running the core of the GI scheme which involved the gold collection and movement which directly resulted in the massive losses. It was further submitted that as far as the paper trail went, the Accused was also appointed as the Head of Transactions of Genneva by the directors of the company. Notwithstanding his official designation, the Accused was the “go to” person when there were queries or issues concerning gold while the GI scheme was running.[^139]

138    In support of a sentence of 68 months’ imprisonment the Prosecution stressed the relative culpability of the Accused against that of PW2 Kwok, the General Manager of Genneva who had been sentenced to 56 months’ imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to a similar charge. Based on a parity of sentence analysis, the Prosecution submitted that the fact that the Accused in this case claimed trial as against PW2 Kwok who pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity must be given due weight.[^140]

139    Citing deterrence as a major consideration in assessing sentence for crimes that affects the delivery of financial services, the Prosecution highlighted numerous factors including the colossal amount of losses caused in this case and the large number of people who were deceived and made to suffer the consequences.

140    The Prosecution further submitted that the Accused would have realised that many clients were not getting their gold back, whether on time, or at all. In addition, it was he who had given instructions and permitted the collected gold to be brought to Malaysia and also pawned. These actions worsened Genneva’s ability to fulfil its obligations to its creditors. The clients were turned into unwitting creditors of the company.

141    Prosecution also made references to the following cases, _Rahj Kamal_ , _Phang Wah_ (SGHC)[^141] and the sentence imposed on PW2 Kwok, and urged the court to consider a sentence significantly higher than the 56 months’ imprisonment sentence of PW2 Kwok.

### Defence Submissions

142    The Accused downplayed his role in Genneva, where he said that he started as an “Office Boy” and gradually moving to perform other work as directed by his employers. He stated that since it was a term of his employment that he could be transferred to the various offices of Genneva, he was tasked to carry out duties in Genneva Singapore.

143    Counsel submitted that the Accused was requested by PW2 Kwok, who was the General Manager of the company to help out and supervise the data-dotting process as well as keep a look out for the entry and exit of gold in the gold room during the GI Exercise.

144    It was further submitted during mitigation that all the others turned to him for help since there was no one else to turn to. He acknowledged that during the GI Exercise period, a total of 639.5kg of gold with a market value of S$44.82 million was due and owing to clients of Genneva.

145    He also attempted to shift blame to the Directors in Malaysia since he had expected them not to let the company go under or not repay the debt to the clients.

146    In respect of his decision to claim trial despite the overwhelming evidence against him was summarised by his counsel as follows:[^142]

> Lim did not deny that, like everyone else involved in the Company, he assisted in the GI. He maintained that he did not do so as an officer or an employee in managerial position. He took issue with the Prosecution’s assertion in Kwok’s SOF that he was appointed as Head of Transactions of the Company.

147    He further mitigated that he was not the controlling mind and will of the company and had played no part in formulating the company’s business model or its operations. He further stated that he was merely an employee of Genneva Malaysia sent to Singapore and instructed to manage the gold room during the GI Exercise. He disclaimed any discretion or authority to make decisions and stated that he merely followed the instructions of his superior, Datuk Ng.

148    The thrust of his mitigation was to give a lower profile to his role in the scam and highlight that he had not benefited personally from the GI Exercise or through the company’s business.

149    Learned Counsel for the Accused also sought to distinguish the earlier cases by showing that in all the precedent cases, the Accused persons stood to gain financially from their crime. Counsel made reference to _Rahj Kamal_**_, Phang Wah_** **(SGHC)** as well as _Tan Hung Yeoh v Public Prosecutor_._[^143]_ On the Accused’s specific instructions, Counsel also asked that a fine be imposed on the Accused. In the event that the court was not minded to impose a fine, the court was asked to consider a sentence lower than that imposed on PW2 Kwok.

### Assessment and Decision on Sentence

150    In a case such as the present, deterrence must be the most important principle of sentencing an offender convicted for such deliberate conduct in causing huge losses to unsuspecting investors. I found that the Accused was fully aware of the enormous amount of losses that were going to be suffered by the clients of the company but nevertheless persisted in his irresponsible disregard of what he saw unfolding before him. He had had oversight of the gold collection under the GI Exercise and was fully cognisant of Genneva’s inability to meet its obligation to return the gold or make payments which were due to the customers. He was focussed on ensuring that he carried out the instructions of his employers who were in Malaysia. He simply turned a blind eye to the obvious and carried on with the scam until the raid by the CAD.

151    Rajah J in _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[24\], makes the pertinent observation regarding crimes such as the present that involves financial services and affecting the economic infrastructure of the nation:

> (e)     _Offences affecting the delivery of financial services and/or the integrity of the economic infrastructure_: The present case affords a classic and illuminating illustration of such an offence. The public interest vested in a secure and reliable financial system that facilitates convenient commercial transactions is extraordinary, especially in light of Singapore’s reputation as an internationally respected financial, commercial and investment hub. Yet another instance of such an offence surfaced in the recent case of _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“_Payagala_”), where the appellant made fraudulent purchases with a misappropriated credit card. In imposing a deterrent sentence, I made the following observations at \[88\]:

>> ... Such offences, if left unchecked, would be akin to a slow drip of a subtle but potent poison that will inexorably and irremediably damage Singapore’s standing both as a financial hub as well as a preferred centre of commerce. ...

152    The investment scam that Genneva perpetrated involved trading in gold, a most valuable commodity in the financial markets. The price of gold is moved by a combination of supply, demand, and investor behaviour. Though that seems simple enough, the way those factors work together is sometimes counterintuitive. For instance, in the present case, the discounts offered to the clients and the agreed gold purchase prices, as discussed earlier in these Grounds, and the evidence of PW4 Toh, reveal _ex post facto_ a massive attempt to defraud the unsuspecting investors who had trusted Genneva to honour its obligations.

153    Moreover, gold is seen as a good store of value so people may be encouraged to buy gold as an investment product. It cannot be disputed that Gold often retains its value not only in times of financial uncertainty, but in times of geopolitical uncertainty too. As such it is sometimes referred to as the "crisis commodity," because people flee to its relative safety when world tensions rise and often outperforms other investments. However, in this case, gold became the very crisis because unscrupulous activities by the Accused and those concerned with him had deceived the clients.

154    I found that multiple aggravating factors are engaged in this case. I agreed with the submission of the learned DPP that the offence in this case (i) involved multiple victims, and (ii) caused public disquiet due to the large number of victims cheated and substantial amount of losses. The Accused’s role in causing the loss was pivotal in all respects. Together with PW2 Kwok, the Accused oversaw the collection of gold under the GI Exercise which included the pawning of the said gold as well as siphoning off the gold by transporting the same to Malaysia instead of using the gold to meet the liabilities in Singapore to the clients.

155    It was clear to me that Genneva was riding on the relative stability of Singapore’s financial system which provides an easy access to source for investments from the public. There is therefore a strong need to deter entrepreneurs and their employees who use dishonest means to enrich themselves to the detriment of unguarded investors.

#### Parity of Sentence with PW2 Kwok

156    The learned DPP submitted that both PW2 Kwok and the Accused were of equal culpability despite their differing roles in Genneva. Accordingly, it was submitted that as compared to PW2 Kwok who had pleaded guilty, the sentence for the Accused who had claimed trial should see an uplift of 12 months’ imprisonment resulting in a sentence of 68 months’ imprisonment. The principle of parity in sentencing between co-accused requires that sentences meted out to such offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. In other words, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished.  At the same time an offender who has a more culpable role in a criminal enterprise should be dealt with more severely than an accomplice who played a lesser role (_Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[44\]).

157    With regards to parity of sentence, the following dicta of Yong CJ, in _Public Prosecutor v Ramlee and another_ \[1998\] 3 SLR 95, at \[7\] is instructive:

> 7    Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances: see _Archbold_ (1998), para 5-153. An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see _R v Walsh_ (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 224. In _R v Fawcett_ (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that the test was whether “right-thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of justice?” The same should apply by analogy when the court is exercising its revisionary powers. Right-thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, would consider that something had gone wrong since the offenders whose culpability are not significantly different, should receive the same sentence.

158    The above was endorsed and applied in _Balakrishnan S and another v Public Prosecutor_ \[2005\] 4 SLR (R) 249 at \[138\] and further explained by Menon CJ in _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span>, at \[47\]:

> 47    The crucial consideration in considering the application of the parity principle is not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the appellant had suffered injustice (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2009) (“_Sentencing Principles in Singapore_”), citing _R v Lowe, The Times_ (14 November 1989) at para 13.019). In my judgment, it is useful to understand that the parity principle ultimately rests on the need to preserve and protect public confidence in the administration of justice. Public confidence in this context demands that sentencing is carried out with due regard to the element of basic fairness. Where this is not the case, and where co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise are sentenced in an unduly disparate manner, the sentences would then seem to be arbitrarily imposed and this raises fundamental rule of law concerns.

159    The learned CJ, also emphasised at \[52\] that the parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair. But ultimately, what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case at hand.

160    Turning now to the facts at hand, it is important to analyse the respective roles and functions of PW2 Kwok and the Accused. It had been the prosecution’s case throughout that PW2 Kwok was the General Manager who had overall charge of Genneva’s operations in Singapore. That this was clearly so is evident from the Record of Proceedings[^144] during PW2 Kwok’s guilty plea hearing when a close scrutiny of the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) to which PW2 Kwok pleaded guilty without qualification is done

161    While I find that it is beyond doubt that both the Accused and PW2 Kwok were in the thick of activities at Genneva, it was nevertheless evident that PW2 Kwok exercised higher function and role in the company as the General Manager. I am also prepared to accept Defence counsel’s submission that their roles should not be equated. Although the evidence revealed that it was Datuk Ng Poh Weng who had given instructions to the Accused, it was nevertheless in evidence that it was PW2 Kwok who as General Manager requested the Accused to help out in the data-dotting process and to keep a look out for the entry and exit of the gold from the company’s gold room during the GI Period. The Accused acted on this until the premises were raided by the CAD.

162    I also noted that the Accused did not deal with or sign any of the documents related to the gold transactions save that he was fully in charge of all the activities in the gold room during the GI Exercise.

163    It is also significant that PW2 Kwok in his SOF, _inter alia_, admitted to a greater role than the Accused, at \[27\] which stated:

> …the accused was personally involved in the carrying on of the business of Genneva, and in the operations of the GI scheme. For example, **_he signed off on Circulars and documents issued to GMCs and clients explaining about the GI scheme. He also listened to the problems of consultants_**.

\[emphasis added\]

164    However, against the above backdrop, the Court has to consider the fact that PW2 Kwok had pleaded guilty at the earliest, which means that there is now a significant differentiating factor between the Accused and PW2 Kwok.

#### The precedent cases

##### (1)    _Rahj Kamal_

165    In _Rahj Kamal_, Rahj was convicted on three counts of cheating and three counts of fraudulent trading. He had practised deception on a large scale by projecting himself as the economic saviour of the Malay community, persuading his victims to hand over their hard-earned money and exploiting the ignorance and trust of his victims. He ruthlessly formed one business entity after another to confuse the authorities. Numerous victims were deceived, and such widespread deception mushroomed into a serious threat to society. In these circumstances, deterrence was the most important consideration in the court’s sentencing decision. At trial, the accused was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for each charge, with sentences in two charges ordered to run consecutively. In total he received 4 years’ imprisonment. However, on appeal, Yong CJ, taking a serious view of his deplorable and totally unacceptable conduct, enhanced the sentence to 96 months’ imprisonment by ordering four of the sentences to run consecutively.

#### (2)   Tan Hung Yeoh

166    The appellant was convicted under section 340(5) of the Companies Act for being knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of Hong Siong Motor Credit Trading Pte Ltd (“HS”) with the intent to defraud one of HS’s creditors viz, Chuan Petroleum Pte Ltd (“CP”). HS entered into four contracts to purchase marine oil from CP. HS never made full payment of the sums due to CP. It was not disputed that these transactions between HS and CP were fraudulent with the intent to defraud CP. The only issue at trial was whether the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions. He was fined $15,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs agreed at $17,000 and a compensation sum fixed at $150,000. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. On appeal, the appellant challenged the trial judge’s finding that he was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of HS with the intent to defraud CP.

167    Yong CJ, in dismissing the appeal held that the totality of the evidence showed that the trial judge’s finding of fact that the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions of HS was well supported by the direct and circumstantial evidence before him.

168    I did not find this case to be of much assistance to sentencing in the present case where the factual matrix is vastly different and involves a far larger scam, involving multiple investors and huge sums of losses.

##### (3)    _Phang Wah_ (Sunshine Empire)

169    Learned Defence Counsel placed much emphasis on this case on the basis that the accused and another, who were directors of Sunshine Empire were similarly charged under section 340(5) of the Companies Act and were sentenced to imprisonment terms of four and a half years and three and a half years.

170    However, it is important to examine the full facts of the case to understand the various sentences imposed in that case in the correct perspective.

171    Sunshine Empire was a multi-level marketing business which sold several types of lifestyle packages. Participants of the “Prime” lifestyle packages were incentivised by the offer of Consumer Rebate Privileges (“CRP”). CRP payouts were funded from the sale of lifestyle packages, even though this fact was never revealed explicitly to the participants. This constituted a very high proportion of Sunshine Empire’s revenue. There was no alternative source of revenue. The Accused Phang and Hoo were charged with and convicted of one charge under section 340(5) read with section 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) for knowingly carrying on the business of Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent purpose. Phang and Hoo were sentenced to four years six months’ and three years six months’ imprisonment, respectively, for the s 340 charge.

172    It is also noteworthy that besides the above offence, Phang and Hoo were also charged with and convicted of eight charges under section 409 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed.) They had agreed to pay, and did indeed cause to be paid, a total of S$947,904.88 to Neo, purportedly a group sales director. Phang and Hoo had lied about Neo. With regard to the section 409 charges, Phang was sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from 15 to 30 months while Hoo was sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from nine months to 24 months. In total, Phang was sentenced to four and a half years’ imprisonment.

173    Phang and his wife, Neo, were also charged with and convicted of six charges under section 477A read with section 109 of the Penal Code. This involved payment vouchers arising from the payments advanced to Neo as a group sales director. Neo asked the accounting staff to prepare vouchers in her name for one month and in Phang’s name the following month because her income tax liability was high and she wanted to reduce that liability. She also claimed that she wanted Phang to declare a higher income for tax purposes in order for him to be eligible to obtain credit. Six payment vouchers were falsified in all. Phang and Neo were each sentenced to a fine of $60,000 (_viz_, $10,000 for each of the six section 477A charges).

174    The learned trial judge found:[^145]

> 334    The reach of the scheme was large. Although the precise number of participants is not known as some of them bought multiple packages, the number of gold prime packages sold totalled 16,784. This brought in a massive sum of $175,563,326 after GST deduction. Deducting the CRP payout of $107,355,461, the balance was some $68,207,865. Out of this sum, Phang received US$5,150,318.13 in consultancy fees through EGA Inc in Hong Kong, a company controlled by him. The other loans and payments to companies of which either Phang or Jackie were directors are set out in the agreed statement of facts. At the time of the raid a sum of $8,415,701.07 and US$1,861,891.73 remained in the accounts of Sunshine Empire and about $10m over in the accounts of related companies.

175    The high court agreed entirely with the District Judge’s finding that Sunshine Empire’s business was clearly unsustainable and that it was clear that collapse of the Sunshine Empire scheme was inevitable.[^146] Further, Tay J found at \[70\]:

> 70    Looking at everything in perspective, I see no reason to vary the nature of the sentences or to lower or enhance the sentences ordered by the District Judge. It is clear that Sunshine Empire’s fraudulent business scheme was propagated on a large scale involving more than a hundred million dollars from the trusting public. Despite attempts to clothe the scheme with trappings of legitimacy, such as the e-Mall platform and EM-Call talk time, it was, shorn of its camouflage, a money circulation scheme without genuine sale of goods and services. It was marketed primarily as a compensation plan, with high CRP pay outs being the irresistible lure of the scheme. Participants were carefully steered away from realising that the profits they would be earning would not come from investments in various projects but were moneys injected by more purchases of packages, whether by new participants or existing ones. There was a palpable sense that the Sunshine Empire scheme had been designed specifically to avert and thwart law enforcement.

176    It should be noted that the total sentences meted out to Phang and Hoo were 9 years’ and 7 years’ imprisonment respectively. It would be incorrect to look at the individual sentences for each of the charges as the learned trial judge, affirmed on appeal, had based her decision on the _totality principle_ for both the section 340(5) Companies Act charge and the section 409 Penal Code offences:

> 341    Having regard to the totality of the offending, I determined a global sentence of nine years’ imprisonment for Phang and seven years’ imprisonment for Jackie to be appropriate.

177    Similar to Phang’s case, a large-scale deceit had been propagated in the present case resulting in even far greater loss to the investing public. The Expert Report illustrates the massive fraud that took place in the company over the years that put Genneva at an accumulated loss position of more than $228 million as at 16 August 2012:[^147]

![]([2022] SGDC 0047_Image/[2022] SGDC 0047_image3.png)

178    During the six-week GI Period, from 17 August 2012 to till end of September, the Accused was in charge of collecting 3,664.415kg of gold from the unsuspecting clients. Of this amount, 672.015 kg of gold with a market value of about $46,854,230 remained owed to the clients who had unwittingly become creditors of the company.

#### Starting point sentence and uplift

179    Having considered all the facts and the role played by the Accused in this case, I determined that a sentence of 48 months’ imprisonment will have been meted out if the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest. However, the Accused chose to claim trial, which was his right to do so. But a plea of guilt is an offender-specific mitigating factor that a court takes into account in assessing sentence. As to the quantum of the discount an offender receives on a plea of guilt would depend on the specific facts of the case.

180    As it has been reiterated earlier, the losses were massive and the various aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution, specific deterrence, general deterrence as well retribution apply in the final consideration of what uplift in sentence would be appropriate. Additionally, the significant mitigating factor of an early plea of guilt that was offered to PW2 Kwok in his sentence, will not be available for this Accused.

181    It is not in dispute that the Accused was not the operating mind behind this scam unlike the Accused persons in the cited precedent cases. But however, the Accused was not a mere cog in the wheel but more of an axle or a lynch pin of the wheel as he was vital to the whole process of the GI Exercise which consequently led to the colossal losses.

182    I had to consider as aggravating factors the considerable state resources expanded and the 17 witnesses from whom evidence was led in court in this case to establish the Accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It must also be noted that an expert from an established audit firm who had done a comprehensive forensic analysis of what transpired at Genneva Singapore also took the stand to give his expert opinion and establish the extent of the scam. It would be right to reflect that the sentencing court in PW2 Kwok’s case would have, as a utilitarian justification for a sentencing discount, given due weight to his guilty plea that saved time as well as valuable state resources.[^148]

183    In the circumstances, I found that an uplift of 12 months from the starting point sentence of 48 months would be fair and proportionate to the role of the Accused in this case. In accordance with the fundamental principle of sentencing which must fit both the crime and the offender, I determined that a sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment will be appropriate.
