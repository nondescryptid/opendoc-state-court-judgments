Criminal Law – Offences – Outrage of Modesty

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9077/2022/01.\]

25 May 2022

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       On 22 July 2019 at about 11pm the accused Helmi bin Norman aged 25+ years old texted the victim, his distant female cousin and primary school friend, to meet him near the fitness corner at Block 217 Yishun St 22 for a chat. The request to meet for a late night chat ended with the victim having her modesty outraged when the intoxicated accused squeezed her breast twice and also insulted her modesty.

2       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge of outrage of modesty, with two other charges of outrage of modesty and insulting modesty taken into consideration. Counsel sought to persuade the court that this was a suitable case for probation. I disagreed and sentenced the accused to five months and two weeks’ imprisonment. The accused appealed my sentence.

## The Charges

3       For completeness, I set out the proceeded outrage of modesty charge, and the two other charges taken into consideration:

> MAC-904527-2021 (1st charge)- Proceeded

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, are charged that you, (on the first occasion), at or about 11:20pm, on 22 July 2019, in the vicinity of the fitness corner of BLK 217 Yishun St. 22, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[redacted\] (a then 24-year-old female), to wit, you used your hand to squeeze her left breast (over clothes), intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> MAC-904528-2021 (2nd charge)- TIC

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, are charged that you, (on the second occasion), at or about 11:20pm, on 22 July 2019, in the vicinity of the fitness corner of BLK 217 Yishun St. 22, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[redacted\] (a then 24-year-old female), to wit, you used your hand to squeeze her left breast (over clothes), intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> MAC-904529-2021 (3rd charge)- TIC

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, are charged that you, at or about 11:20pm, on 22 July 2019, in the vicinity of the fitness corner of BLK 217 Yishun St. 22, Singapore, did utter insulting words to \[redacted\] (a then 24-year-old female) with the intention of insulting her modesty, to wit, you said “her boob big ah, but I think yours are bigger”, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

4       Outrage of modesty is punishable with an imprisonment term of up to 2 years or with fine, or with caning or any combination of such punishments.

## Material Facts

5       The accused a Singaporean was serving his fulltime National Service at the material time. The victim was then 24 years old.

6       At or about 11:00pm on 22 July 2019, the accused texted the victim to meet him for a chat. The accused had recently broken up with his girlfriend and he was upset. He purchased a 750ml bottle of whisky and drank it at the fitness corner at Block 217 Yishun St. 22, Singapore. As the accused was feeling upset, he messaged the victim, and she agreed to meet him for a chat.

7       When they met up at around 11:20pm, the accused started to cry when talking about his ex-girlfriend and he also drank heavily. He asked the victim for a hug but she declined, instead the victim gave him a friendly pat. They were seated side by side.

8       The accused then said that he was done with his ex-girlfriend. He downloaded the Tinder app, and told the victim, “get me someone to fuck”. He came across a profile of a woman exposing her buttocks. The accused then leaned back to take a look at the victim’s buttocks and said, “you got no butt ah”. This made the victim feel uncomfortable and she moved away from him. The accused continued swiping on Tinder, whilst the victim started using her phone. At this point, the accused came across a profile of another woman. He showed the victim the profile and said, “her boob big ah, but I think yours are bigger” (giving rise to the 3rd Charge taken into consideration).

9       The victim was angry and upset. Suddenly, the accused reached over with his hand and squeezed the victim’s left breast (over clothes) for one or two seconds. The accused had done so without the Victim’s consent, intending to outrage her modesty. The accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

10     The victim then pushed away the accused’s hand. She told him off and told him not to “cross the line” and “no”. The accused then said, “cannot ah”. The victim replied, “obviously not”. The victim tried to remain calm, although she was angry and upset and scared as the accused appeared intoxicated to her. The accused then said his ex-girlfriend’s breasts were B cup, but the victim’s breasts looked bigger. He reached out his hand again and squeezed the victim’s breast (over clothes) again for a second or two (giving rise to the 2nd Charge taken into consideration). The victim pushed him away and moved further away from him. She asked him what he was trying to do in a stern and angry tone. The accused apologised, but then said he was having a “boner”. The victim decided to leave. The victim felt traumatised by the incident and decided to report the matter.

## Parties’ submissions on sentence

11     Prosecution submitted that this was not an appropriate case for probation and a probation suitability report (“probation report”) should not be called for. This was a Band 2 case under the framework set out in _Kunasekaran s\\o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ \[2018\] 4SLR 580 (“_Kunasekaran_”) and seven months’ imprisonment should be imposed.

12     Defence urged the court to call for a probation report as probation was not precluded as a sentencing option. Should the accused not be found suitable for probation, even though this was a Band 2 case, the sentence should be adjusted downwards to three months’ jail.

## Issues to be determined

13     The issues for determination by the court were:

> (a)     Was probation a realistic sentencing option for the accused?

> (b)     If not, what is the appropriate sentence to be imposed?

## Issue 1: Was probation a realistic sentencing option for the accused?

### Probation for adult offenders

14     The legal principles for sentencing adult offenders to probation are well settled. As the court in _GCO v PP_ \[2019\] 3SLR 1402 (“_GCO_”) guided, probation can only be justified where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration.

15     In the case of young offenders rehabilitation presumptively takes precedence. Adult offenders can be sentenced to probation, although this would be the exception rather than the norm. An adult offender may be sentenced to probation if he demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation. Even where rehabilitation is found to apply, it can be displaced by the need for deterrence if the offence is serious or the harm is severe, among other considerations: _GCO_ at \[32\] to \[34\]. These principles were endorsed in _PP v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1412</span> (“_Terence Siow_”): at \[42\] and \[44\].

16     The court in _Terence Siow_ further re-iterated _GCO_ that in the specific context of outrage of modesty by adult offenders, deterrence will be the operative consideration: at \[43\].

### Submissions for the court to call for a probation report

17     Counsel urged the court to call for a probation report to assess the accused’s suitability for probation. He submitted that the accused was not precluded from such a sentencing option despite his age and nature of the offence, and preliminarily the accused displayed exceptional rehabilitative potential.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

18     I deal first with counsel’s submission that that a probation report should be called for _in any event_ to assist the court in applying the framework in _Terence Siow_, and to confirm the accused’s propensity for reform. I found this a curious argument, and I agreed with prosecution that this was getting things the wrong way round.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Counsel conceded that _Terence Siow_ did not stand for any such proposition that a probation report should be called for _in any event_ to assist the court in applying the framework in _Terence Siow_.[^3] Neither was such an approach supported by the case authorities.

19     As regards the calling of a probation report for young offenders, the court in _A Karthik v PP_ \[2018\] 5SLR 1289 (“_Karthik_”) had guided that when dealing with the sentencing of an offender aged 21 years and below, the court should generally call for the pre-sentencing report and should not embark on an assessment of the offender’s suitability for probation without the benefit of such a report, although this would not include situations where the pre-requisites for probation to be considered are not met or where probation is not a realistic option on the facts of the case: at \[20\] and \[21\].

20     Even in the case of a young offender, a probation suitability report is not called for when probation is not a realistic sentencing option_. Ho Mei Xi Hannah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 211</span> (“_Hannah Ho_”) concerned a young offender who was 20 years old when she committed the offences. The court decided that as probation was not a realistic sentencing option on the facts, it was not necessary to call for a probation suitability report: at \[84\]. It reached this conclusion after considering the offender’s age, the offences committed, the circumstances of the offence and her antecedents, and concluded that general and specific deterrence displaced rehabilitation as the predominant sentencing consideration: at \[85\] to \[92\].

21     As for youngish adult offenders, _GCO_ is instructive on probation and the calling of a probation report. The accused in _GCO_ was 23 years old and 25 years old respectively at the time he committed a section 509 insulting modesty offence and then a section 354 outrage of modesty offence. As regards the latter offence, the accused had touched the victim’s groin area from underneath her shorts while she was asleep. The accused argued that a probation report should be called in the light of the medical reports about his voyeurism and fetishism.

22     Neither the court at first instance nor the appellate court was persuaded to call for a probation suitability report. The district court was of the view that there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant the calling of a pre-sentence report. The appellate court agreed that it was unnecessary to consider probation as a sentencing option as there were no exceptional circumstances for probation to be considered. Even if the accused was found to have some potential for rehabilitation it would be eclipsed by the need for deterrence. This was because not only was outrage of modesty a serious offence, on the facts it was compounded by specific aggravating factors such as the exploitation of the vulnerability of the sleeping victim: at \[40\].

#### Counsel’s reliance on DT’s case

23     In support of his case for probation, counsel initially tendered a 1 July 2021 newspaper report of probation ordered for a 24 year old accused who molested his close female friend after going to her home where they drank alcohol.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) The redacted court papers for the case (“_DT_”) were subsequently tendered.

24      _DT_ did not assist counsel. First it was an unreported decision, and weight could not be placed on it as a sentencing precedent. Second, from the statement of facts, the accused in _DT_ committed the offence in Feb 2018 in the same month that he turned 21 years old. He was 24 years old at the time of sentencing in 2021. As _Karthik_ had guided, for such offenders the retrospective rationale continued to be relevant and seeks to justify giving a young offender a second chance by excusing his actions on the grounds of his youthful folly and experience, and rests on the offender’s age at the time of the offence: at \[37\]. However this would not be the case with the present accused who was an adult offender both at the time of commission of the offence as well at the time of sentencing.

### Rehabilitation not the dominant sentencing consideration on the facts

25     Applying the analytical framework at \[14\] to \[16\], it was clear that probation was not the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.

26     First, the accused was not a particularly young adult offender and he was well above the threshold age of 21 years old when he committed the offence. He had turned 25 years old a month before he committed the offence, and was 27+ years old when he was convicted on 21 April 2022. At the time of the offence he had already completed his polytechnic diploma and was serving full-time national service.

27     Second, outrage of modesty is a serious offence. As the court in _GCO_ observed, outrage of modesty is by its nature a serious offence. It is a specified offence in the Third Schedule of the Registration of Criminal Act (“RCA”) (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) and excluded from the mandatory treatment orders regime: at \[31\] and \[41\]. This view was endorsed in _Terence Siow_ where the court stated that deterrence was the operative sentencing consideration for such offences committed by adult offenders: at \[43\]. Both the young adult offenders in _GCO_ and _Terence Siow_ who committed outrage of modesty offences had failed in their arguments for probation.

28     There is no doubt that legislative intent is for outrage of modesty to be treated as a serious offence. Not only is the offence excluded from the community sentences regime by virtue of it being a specified offence under the Third Schedule of the RCA[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5), an offender is also disqualified from having the record of his molest conviction becoming spent as it is a Third Schedule offence[^6].

29     Third, in this case the serious nature of the offence was compounded by several aggravating factors when the factual matrix of the offence was considered. The offence not only involved the intrusion of the victim’s private parts, the accused had proceeded to repeat the same act on the victim’s private parts again, after she had pushed away his hand and told him in no uncertain terms “no” after the first intrusion.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

30     Neither could the nature of the accused’s intrusion be characterized as a minor or fleeting touch. On both occasions the accused had squeezed the victim’s breast for one or two seconds. The court in _GCO_ stated that there are two senses to “fleeting” – whether it was fleeting in terms of time, and whether the touch was lightly made and therefore not intrusive: at \[54\]. Even if the squeeze was for one to two seconds and over clothes, the act of squeezing cannot be said to be lightly made or characterized as minor.

31     Further, the accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence and this was an aggravating factor. As the court in _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ \[2008\] 1SLR(R) 115 (“_Wong Hoi Len_”) noted a sentencing judge should _ordinarily_ take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration, because those who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must in the usual course of events take full responsibility for their subsequent offending: at \[44\].

32     Counsel however sought to argue that the accused’s intoxication should not be considered as an aggravating factor in this case. In support of his submission counsel cited _Wong Hoi Len’s_ reference at \[40\] to a passage[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) in the _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (2nd Ed,2003) (“_Sentencing Practice_”)[^9] and said that in exceptional circumstances the court may regard intoxication as an explanation and even a mitigating factor if the accused’s conduct was out of character. The passage cited stated that:

> Intoxication as a mitigating factor is likely to be regarded with scepticism by the courts. (See Mani Nedumaran & Anor v PP \[1998\] SLR 411.) For crimes of violence and other serious offences, if an offender commits the offence after drinking, the court may well consider it as an aggravating factor or neutral at best (see Lindley (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 3; Bradley (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 12). In an exceptional case, if it were to be shown affirmatively that the offence committed under the influence of alcohol was out of character, the court may regard it as an explanation and a mitigation factor.

33     With respect, counsel had cited the court’s reference to that passage in the Sentencing Practice out of context. The court in _Wong Hoi Len_ had in fact referred to that particular passage in the _Sentencing Practice_ and stated that it was rather puzzling why a leading local sentencing guide like the _Sentencing Practice_ had approached the issue of intoxication that way. The court stated that the passage was not helpful because it left open all three possibilities, whether intoxication was aggravating, mitigating or neutral: at \[40\] and \[41\]. The court then went on to unequivocally state at \[44\] that a sentencing judge should _ordinarily_ take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration, as those who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must take full responsibility for their subsequent offending.

34     As for the submission that the offence was out-of-character and the accused was drinking as he had recently broken up with his girlfriend, this did not make his voluntary intoxication any less an aggravating factor. The same issue had arisen in _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jorden_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1294</span> (“_Jorden Lim_”), which involved a young adult offender who was 23 plus years old and intoxicated when he stole and crashed a lorry. The accused had sought probation on account of his mental condition and other factors.

35     The High Court observed at \[56\] that the district court appeared to have thought that the offender’s intoxicated and inebriated state was not aggravating and the offender had uncharacteristically tried to drive a vehicle he could not drive. In setting aside the probation order, the High Court stated it was by no means clear why the offender’s “uncharacteristic” actions would render his voluntary intoxication _any less aggravating._ The fact that an offender had acted “uncharacteristically” was just a manifestation of what intoxication could lead to – possibly uncharacteristic and disinhibited conduct in an alcohol-induced high.

36      _Wong Hoi Len_ had further cautioned that the “out of character plea” would already be captured by an offender’s lack of relevant antecedents and the court must not double-count the mitigating factors: at \[45\].

37     In the present case, the accused’s voluntary intoxication was a further aggravating factor. The accused had bought the 750ml of whiskey himself, and then drank heavily whilst at the incident location.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) According to his personal letter, he was already high on alcohol before the victim arrived and he continued to drinking after she arrived.[^11] The “out of character” argument did not in any way neutralize or lessen the accused’s voluntary intoxication as an aggravating factor.

38     In fact, according to the agreed facts, the accused’s intoxication had frightened the victim. Not only did the victim feel angry and upset by the accused’s actions, she was also scared as the accused appeared intoxicated to her and she felt traumatized by the incident.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

39     The court in _Wong Hoi Len_ at \[46\] and \[49\] stated that intoxication may well cause a victim to experience greater unpredictability and fear during the encounter, as the victim’s perceived harm from such intoxicated individuals was often greater. _A fortiori_ if the accused’s intoxicated state had caused the victim to experience an increased state of terror or alarm then it would be a further aggravating factor, aside from the accused’s intoxication as an aggravating factor.

40     In this case even if the intoxication causing fear to the victim was not treated as a separate aggravating factor, due and appropriate weight should be given to his intoxication as an aggravating factor when the intoxication did indeed cause fear to the victim.

41     The accused had wholly failed to show that there were any exceptional circumstances to warrant probation. Considering the accused’s age and the serious nature of the offence compounded by the aggravating features, deterrence would be the operative sentencing consideration.

### Submissions on the accused’s propensity for reform

42     I deal next with counsel’s submissions that the accused demonstrated a high propensity for rehabilitation, and his post-offence conduct provided insight and verification of his propensity for reform.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

43     He referred to the accused’s educational achievements: the accused obtained a National ITE certificate for mechatronics in 2012, then obtained his polytechnic diploma in 2015. After he completed his national service as an ambulance transport operator with a report of overall good performance, he began his current employment as an engineering assistant in October 2020.

44     As regards familial support, counsel submitted this was strong as his family understood the gravity of his offences and were committed to his continued rehabilitation.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

45     The accused was also a first offender of general good character and was unlikely to re-offend. At the time of the offence, he was in a state of intoxication induced by a traumatic break-up with his girlfriend of three years. He had been a teetotaler since the offences.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) The accused was also remorseful for committing the offences. He had apologised to the victim at the scene and also in his personal testimonial.[^16] He had pleaded guilty and spared the victim the ordeal of a trial.[^17]

46     His educational and national service records, together with his personal testimonial and three testimonials from his sister, a colleague who had known him for one year, and a female friend who had known him for five years,[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) were tendered in support.

#### Case fell far short of showing an extremely strong propensity to reform

47     As regards the accused’s educational and vocational achievements, the court in _Terence Siow_ reiterated that the rehabilitative goals of the criminal justice system are indifferent to the economic, educational or other status of the accused and the quest for academic qualifications is merely one indicator of rehabilitative capacity: at \[4\] and \[5\]. At the highest and to the accused’s credit, his academic and national service records showed that he had applied himself with some diligence towards his academic and work-related goals, and he had been in gainful employment post-offence. Taken together with his previous clean record and his plea of guilt, these were some indicators that there was some potential for rehabilitation.

48     However the matters raised did not meet the threshold of showing that he had a demonstrably strong potential for rehabilitation and reform. As regards his post-offence efforts to rehabilitate, it was claimed that the accused had since become a teetotaler and had enlisted the help of family and friends to help him stay straight, and that he had strong family support who understood the gravity of his offence and were committed to ensuring his rehabilitation.

49     These were bare unsupported assertions that rang hollow on the facts. According to the accused’s personal testimonial he lived with his two aged parents and maternal grandmother. None of his family members or friends supposedly supporting him in these post-offence rehabilitative efforts tendered anything in support these claims, or how they could provide him the necessary support in his rehabilitative efforts. The only family member who tendered a testimonial was his sister, but her testimonial did not touch on this issue. She did not in fact say she could support him in his rehabilitation efforts but instead said that it was the accused who supported her with looking after her two autistic children.

50     As for the testimonials from his colleague and his personal friend, they carried very limited weight as character testimonials. The colleague had only known the accused for “close to a year” post-offence (actually 10 months as the accused started work in October 2020 and the testimonial was dated August 2021). Likewise the female friend’s brief two-paragraph testimonial offered nothing supporting her opinion of the accused, and appeared more to be premised on what the accused said and how he portrayed himself to her. As for the SAF service transcript which stated that his overall conduct was good, the commander’s appraisal touched only on his work performance. Neither did it appear that the accused had sought any sort of external help or support as regards his alleged rehabilitative efforts post-offence.

51     As for the accused’s apologies and supposed remorse, the court in _Chen Weixiong Jerrick v PP_ \[2003\] 2 SLR (R) 334 had observed that whilst there is common practice in pleas for leniency to glibly state that an accused is remorseful when the strong arm of the law has caught up with an accused, apologetic gestures must be carefully scrutinized to see whether they constitute evidence of genuine heartfelt remorse: \[22\] and \[23\].

52     In this case apart from the accused guilty plea which I took as some evidence of remorse, I was dis-inclined to view his apologies as evidence of his remorse.

53     The agreed facts stated that he had apologised to the victim on the night of the offence, after he had squeezed her breast a second time and she asked him in a stern and angry voice what he was trying to do.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) However this apology was devoid of any genuine remorse as it was immediately followed by the accused telling the victim that he was “having a boner”. He was very much persisting in the same kind of unwanted and overtly sexualized conduct towards the victim.

54     In his personal testimonial,[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) the accused said he had apologized to the victim after he was approached the next day by the victim’s partner about his inappropriate conduct. However the accused persisted in his denials. In the same testimonial, the accused continued to maintain that what happened that night was “a blur to me and it is not conscious decision”. In fact it was not disputed that when he was called up for police investigations the accused did not admit to the offences, and this eventually led to the striking out of the claims in the mitigation plea that the accused had co-operated with the authorities.

55     Finally as regards the accused staying out of trouble since the offences were committed in July 2019, this was not a particularly substantial period that counted as a weighty factor, considering the overhang of the investigations and pending court proceedings during this period.

56     I was not persuaded by counsel’s claims that the accused had demonstrated a high propensity for rehabilitation. Even if the accused did possess some potential for rehabilitation, this would be outweighed by deterrence. In this case the retributive principle would also be relevant, considering what the victim had suffered. All things considered including the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the dominant sentencing consideration was deterrence and rehabilitation receded in significance.

## Issue 2: What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed?

### Parties’ submissions on sentence

57     Parties were agreed that this was a Band 2 _Kunasekaran_ offence, but disagreed about where it should be placed within Band 2 and the appropriate sentence.

58     Prosecution submitted that in the first step of the _Kunasekaran_ framework, the offence should be placed in the middle of Band 2. Not only was there intrusion of private parts, the touch was not fleeting and the squeeze on her breast was intrusive, and the accused was also intoxicated. In the second step of the _Kunasekaran_ framework, taking into account that the accused was a first offender and he had pleaded guilty but there were two other charges taken into consideration which showed that his conduct was odious towards the victim, a sentence of seven months’ jail was warranted.

59     Defence submitted that as a starting point the present offence should be placed on the lower end of Band 2 with a starting point of five months’ jail[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) because it involved intrusion of private parts. The touch should be considered fleeting as it occurred over one to two seconds, and there was no skin-to-skin contact or other offence-specific factors. The accused’s intoxication should not be considered an aggravating factor and his TIC charges should not be overplayed as they occurred in the same transaction.

60     Counsel said the starting point should be five months’ jail but there should be a downward adjustment to three months’ jail because the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty and he had shown genuine remorse. The offences were out of character and he was unlikely to re-offend and he had remined crime-free since the offences. There was also undue delay in prosecution as the charges were tendered in May 2021 almost two years after the offences were committed.

### Applying the Kunasekaran framework

61     The _Kunasekaran_ framework comprises three sentencing bands for outrage of modesty offences: at \[49\]:

> (a)     Band 1: less than five months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Band 2: five to 15 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     Band 3: 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.

62     In the first step the court is to determine the appropriate sentencing band by considering the offence-specific factors, namely: (a) the degree of sexual exploitation, (b) the circumstances of the offence, and (c) the harm caused to the victim whether physical or psychological. The court then ascertains the gravity of the offence, and determines which of the three bands is appropriate. In the second step, the court considers the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors, making upward or downward adjustments to the sentence as appropriate: _Kunasekaran_ at \[45\], \[48\] and \[49\].

63     Band 1 includes cases which do not present or any, or at most one of the offence-specific factors. Typically this would involve cases of a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion of private parts. Band 2 includes cases where two or more offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end would involve cases where private parts are intruded but without skin-to-skin contact. Band 3 includes cases where numerous offence-specific factors are present: _Kunasekaran_ at \[45(b)\].

64     In this case as regards the offence-specific factors, I disagreed with counsel’s submission that the only single offence-specific aggravating factor was the intrusion of the victim’s private parts.

65     Aside from the intrusion of the victim’s private parts, the nature of a squeeze could not be considered a brief or light touch, and downplayed as a fleeting touch as counsel had sought to do. Overall the act of squeezing someone’s breast was an intrusive act. Finally, the accused was also intoxicated at that time, which had also caused fear to the victim even if I did not count it as a separate aggravating factor. She was also traumatised by the incident, although the extent of the trauma was unknown as there was no further elaboration nor a victim impact statement.

66     In the first step, I would place this offence at the lower end of Band 2 with an indicative sentence of about six months’ jail. As for the non-offence specific aggravating factors, I considered the two other TIC charges, one of which involved the squeezing of the victim’s breast a second time that night. When the exchange between the parties as described in the statement of agreed facts was considered in totality, I found the culpability of the accused moderately high. He had persisted in being verbally and physically aggressive towards the victim despite attempts by the victim to tell him in no uncertain terms to cease and desist and she had even pushed his hand away after the first intrusion.

67     Even though the acts in the TIC charges were proximate in time and place, I found no merit in counsel’s argument that the offences should be viewed as a single incident lasting seconds. They were distinct acts that invaded distinct legal interests and increased the overall criminality of the accused, and derogated from his claims that the acts were out of character.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) The TIC charges were an aggravating factor that carried the offence even further up the Band 2 scale, although I would not place it as high as the middle of Band 2 as prosecution had urged, which carried an indicative sentence of about ten months’ imprisonment.

68     As for the mitigating factors cited by counsel, the only matters that carried mitigating weight were his plea of guilt which spared the victim the trauma of a trial and saved the court’s time and resources, and which I took as some evidence of remorse. I also considered that the accused had no prior offending.

69     As for counsel’s claims of inordinate delay, where there has been an inordinate delay in prosecution which is not contributed in any way by an accused, there could be sentence mitigation if it results in real injustice or prejudice to the accused. This rested on considerations of fairness and the repercussions of delay on the offender’ rehabilitation and reintegration: _Chan Kum Hong Randy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 1019</span> (“_Randy Chan_”) at \[20\] to \[22\] and \[70\].

70     In _Randy Chan_, six to 10 years had elapsed between the detection of the offences and the prosecution of the charges, and the prosecution’s only assertion was that there was a lack of proper co-ordination between the various police divisions and\\or a redeployment of the personnel involved. The court considered this an extraordinary and disturbing length of delay. In reducing the accused’s sentence, the court accepted that the accused had by his own efforts rehabilitated himself in the lengthy intervening period and started a new life with considerable success in his family life and career and he had been unfairly and unnecessarily prejudiced by the delayed prosecution: at \[42\], \[43\], \[58\] to \[61\] and \[68\].

71     However the 22-month gap here was not anywhere close to the magnitude of the delay in _Randy Chan_. I did not agree with counsel that there was inordinate delay or undue delay in prosecution. As the court in _Randy Chan_ guided, the length of the delay has to be assessed against the nature of the investigations.

72     As regards the nature of the offence, only the accused and the victim were present at the time of the offence. Prosecution said that the investigations did not rest on her word alone against his.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) The victim only reported the matter to the police in August 2019. It was also not disputed that the accused did not admit to the offences and did not co-operate with the police. He had denied outraging her modesty and said there were consensual hugs, and the police had to retrieve and verify the various text messages.[^24] Neither could it be said that in the intervening 22 months accused had successfully rehabilitated himself in the same manner and extent as the accused in _Randy Chan_ had done, such that he could claim to be unfairly and unnecessarily prejudiced.

73     The collective weight of the valid mitigating factors did not take the offence out of the Band 2 sentencing range, far less reduce it into the mid-point of Band 1 of three months’ imprisonment as counsel urged.

### Case authorities cited by Defence

74     Counsel cited three reported State Court cases- _PP v Kochadai Baskaran_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 74</span> (“_Kochadai_”), _PP v Ramakrishnan Anbu_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 75</span> (“_Ramakrishnan_”) and _PP v Ng Yuan Piow Victor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 90</span> (“_Victor Ng_”).

75      _Kochadai_ and _Ramakrishnan_ were plead-guilty cases, while the accused in _Victor Ng_ had claimed trial. All three cases involved untraced accused persons who molested victims on their breast whilst they were on public transport.

76     In _Kochadai_ the accused touched the victim’s right breast over her clothing while seated next to her in a bus and she was asleep. He was sentenced to four months’ jail. _Ramakrishnan_ also involved a molest on a bus. The accused had switched seats to sit behind the victim and he had touched her left breast in a pulsating motion that lasted at least two second. He was also sentenced to four months’ jail. In _Victor Ng_, the accused faced two charges of molest committed on a bus on two separate occasions. The first charge did not involve any intrusion of the victim’s private parts, while the second charge involved the touching of the victim’s left breast over her clothing when she was asleep on a public bus. The accused was aged 29 years old at the time of sentencing, and had completed his degree at NTU and secured employment as a service engineer. He was sentenced to five months jail for the second charge.

77     In all three cases the court had in the first step classified the offence at the lower end of Band 2 with a starting point of five to six months imprisonment: _Kochadai_ at \[29\], _Ramakrishnan_ at \[32\] and _Victor Ng_ at \[104\]. The sentences were then calibrated downwards to four months’ jail in _Kochadai_ and _Ramakrishnan_ on account of the guilty plea. There was no calibration downwards for the accused in _Victor Ng_ as he had claimed trial.

78     These cases did not assist Defence in their submission that the accused should be sentenced to three months’ jail. The accused persons in the three cases cited had received sentences of four months and five months’ jail for the single charge they faced. For _Kochadai_ and _Ramakrishnan_ they each only received a one or at the most two-month discount for their guilty plea. None of the accused persons in these three cases had any other charges taken into consideration for sentencing, and their intrusions did not involve squeezing the victim’s breast.

79     I also considered the eight-month sentence imposed on the accused in _GCO_ who had pleaded guilty to molest involving the intrusion of the victim’s private parts. He had placed his hands through the opening of the victim’s shorts while she was asleep and touched her vagina area from underneath her shorts. On appeal the court agreed that this was a highly intrusive touch on a vulnerable victim and affirmed the indicative starting sentence of eight months jail, and was of the view that the escalation in his offending cancelled out the mitigation of his guilty plea and apology.

80     In my view, the accused’s offending was more egregious than that of the trio of offenders in _Kochadai_, _Ramakrishnan_ and _Victor Ng_, but did not reach the level of the severity of offending of the accused in _GCO_.

## Conclusion

81     All things considered I was of the view that a sentence of five months and two weeks jail was appropriate and sufficiently reflected the gravity of the offence and the accused’s criminality, and was not out of line with the sentences passed in the cited cases. I sentenced the accused accordingly.
