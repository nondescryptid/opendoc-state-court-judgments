Employee’s duties – duty of fidelity – breach

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 21/2019.\]

9 May 2019

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## THE PARTIES

1       The Plaintiff is a private limited company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and is in the business of general contractors (building construction including major upgrading works) and general wholesale trade (including general importers and exporters).

2       The 1st and 2nd Defendants were former employees of the Plaintiff.[^1] The 1st Defendant does not dispute that she supervised the Plaintiff’s projects as a site supervisor. At the material time, the 2nd Defendant was the Plaintiff’s construction foreman.

3       The 3rd Defendant is a private limited company incorporated by the 1st Defendant on 9 July 2012 and the 1st Defendant is the sole shareholder and director thereof[^2].

4       It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant had incorporated the 3rd Defendant whilst she was still the Plaintiff’s site supervisor; and that the 3rd Defendant carried out a competing business with the Plaintiff.[^3]

## BACKGROUND

5       Prior to being the site supervisor of the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant was the sole proprietor of Fong Teck Design Renovation Contractor (“Fong Teck”) that was registered on 13 June 2000. In 2005, Mr. Lim Tse Leong Chris (“Mr Chris Lim”), Director of the Plaintiff approached the 1st Defendant and asked her to supervise the Plaintiff’s projects for the Plaintiff. According to the Plaintiff, this arrangement eventually led to the 1st Defendant being formally employed by the Plaintiff as the Plaintiff’s site supervisor not long thereafter and she was paid a remuneration as well as commissions for each project she was assigned to manage.

6       The 1st Defendant does not dispute that she was employed by the Plaintiff from or around November 2007[^4] and was remunerated by the Plaintiff as an employee and was assigned to manage projects in 2012 and 2013; it is also not disputed that the 1st Defendant was given commissions based on the value of the projects supervised by her as part of her remuneration[^5].

7       The 3rd Defendant was incorporated on 9 July 2012 and the 1st Defendant was its sole director and shareholder. The 1st Defendant’s services with the Plaintiff were effectively terminated on 17 October 2013 after she tendered her resignation in September 2013.

## THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM

8       In summary, the Plaintiff’s claims against the 1st Defendant are for:-

> a.     Breaches of her contractual duties and obligations as an employee[^6];

> b.     Breaches of her implied duty of duty of fidelity, mutual trust and confidence[^7];

> c.     Breaches of her fiduciary duties including a duty not to place herself in a position of conflict of interest and not to profit from her position[^8];

> d.     Deceit and/or fraudulent misrepresentation[^9];

> e.     Wrongful and/or unlawful interference with the Plaintiff’s legitimate business interests and/or contractual relations – inducing breach of contract[^10]; and

> f.     Exposing the Plaintiff to liabilities[^11]

9       For breaches under (a), (b), (c) and (e) above, the Plaintiff’s claim is for damages to be assessed. The Plaintiff also avers that the 1st and 3rd Defendants are liable to pay the Plaintiff the sum of $45,968 that the 1st Defendant has received from Hong Dat Engineering Pte Ltd (“Hong Dat”). For breach under (d) above, the Plaintiff’s claim is for the sum of $50,010 paid by the Plaintiff on the basis of the alleged deception practiced by the 1st Defendant and/or on account of the 1st Defendant’s alleged misrepresentation. For breach under (f), the Plaintiff avers that the 1st and 3rd Defendants are liable to pay the Plaintiff the sum of $320,000 or such sums that the 1st and 3rd Defendants have received from Sung Yee General Contractor Pte Ltd (“Sung Yee”).

10     The Plaintiff’s claim against the 3rd Defendant is for joint and/or several liability with the 1st Defendant in relation to the 1st Defendant’s breaches of her duties on the basis that the 1st Defendant was the alter ego of the 3rd Defendant and that the 3rd Defendant had received such income and profits derived from the 1st Defendant’s wrong-doings.[^12]

11     More specifically, the Plaintiff says that the 1st Defendant is in breach of her obligations and duties as an employee and as a fiduciary, by virtue of the fact that she had incorporated the 3rd Defendant on 9 July 2012 without the Plaintiff’s knowledge and consent and that the incorporation of the 3rd Defendant was for the purposes of competing with the Plaintiff and/or to use the 3rd Defendant as a vehicle through whom contracts could be diverted from the Plaintiff to the 3rd Defendant[^13].

12     Other than the 1st Defendant’s breach of duties by the incorporation of the 3rd Defendant, the Plaintiff also claims damages against the 1st Defendant for her breaches of her duties as an employee and as a fiduciary in respect of various projects. The brief description of facts surrounding these projects, the agreed facts relating thereto and the specific sums claimed by the Plaintiff are set out in the table below.

13     The Plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd Defendant is for breaches of his implied duties of fidelity and mutual trust and confidence.[^27] The Plaintiff alleges that the 2nd Defendant had a close relationship with the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff also claimed against the 2nd Defendant damages for inducing breach of contract in relation to the Plaintiff’s employees and/or unlawfully interfering with the Plaintiff’s business by allegedly inducing the Plaintiff’s workers to leave the Plaintiff’s employment and specifically in relation to the Hong Dat project, by diverting the Plaintiff’s workers away from the Plaintiff’s part of the project to work for Hong Dat instead[^28]. There were also other general allegations made against the 2nd Defendant in relation to the Wee Hur project. The Plaintiff also sought a restraining order as against the 2nd Defendant.

## THE 1st and 3rd DEFENDANTS’ DEFENCE

14     In Defence, the 1st and 3rd Defendants say that the 1st Defendant’s employment was not terminated by the Plaintiff but that she had, on her own accord, tendered her resignation on 25 September 2013 indicating her last day of service as 25 October 2013 as she had wanted to grow and expand her own business as a tiling contractor[^29]. The 1st and 3rd Defendants say that the 3rd Defendant was incorporated to take over the business of Fong Teck and Fong Teck’s lorry, YM4427L[^30]. Their defence is that with the 3rd Defendant’s operations, the 1st and 3rd Defendants were better able to assist and support the Plaintiff’s business and contracts, including assigning the 3rd Defendant’s employees to work for the Plaintiff by applying for additional foreign workers required by the Plaintiff and deploying them to the Plaintiff’s projects as well as in the renting of the 3rd Defendant’s lorry to the Plaintiff[^31]. The 1st and 3rd Defendants say that the Plaintiff was aware of the incorporation and existence of the 3rd Defendant and had in fact subcontracted the works in the Sengkang WT project to the 3rd Defendant as the Plaintiff’s subcontractor from or around 19 December 2012[^32].

15     The 1st Defendant also says that she did not misrepresent the 3rd Defendant’s position, ambit of services, capacity or existence to the Plaintiff but had truthfully informed the Plaintiff through Mr Chris Lim thereof. In relation to the various projects which are the subject of the Plaintiff’s claims against the her and the 3rd Defendant, the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ case is as summarised in the Table below.

The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then asked Mr Chris Lim if she could keep those two cash cheques as her reward for helping the Plaintiff to improve the Plaintiff’s CONQUAS scoring for the Teban Garden 40 project (“CONQUAS Scoring Agreement”) and Mr Chris Lim replied that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant may keep the two cash cheques as payment towards the CONQUAS Scoring Agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Sung Yee</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants say that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was approached by Sung Yee to take up the tiling work abandoned by their tiling sub-contractor.

## THE 2ND DEFENDANT’S DEFENCE

16     The 2nd Defendant’s defence is that he did not divert any of the Plaintiff’s workers away from the Plaintiff’s part of the project to Hong Dat as he was not even assigned to the Plaintiff’s project at the project site (Woodlands N8C20). He also categorically denies having induced the Plaintiff’s workers to leave the employment of the Plaintiff[^40].

## THE 1ST DEFENDANT’S COUNTERCLAIM

17     The 1st Defendant claims the Plaintiff is owing her commissions for the works she had completed in July 2013 in the sum of $9,357.50. She relies on her commission payslip of October 2013 for this claim[^41]. The 1st Defendant also says that the Plaintiff owes her commissions for the period between August and October 2013 at the projects at Sengkang 21/22, Rangoon 88, Yishun LC&T and Sengkang WT.

18     The 1st Defendant further claims that payment is due to her pursuant to an alleged oral “CONQUAS Scoring Agreement” between the parties for the Teban 40 project and she justified her retention of $45,968.00 received from Hong Dat on that basis. The 1st Defendant claims that a further sum of $19,582.00 is still owing by the Plaintiff to her pursuant to this alleged CONQUAS Scoring Agreement and she counterclaims for this amount against the Plaintiff**_[^42]_**.

19     In addition, the 1st Defendant avers that she had, between October 2013 and November 2013, paid the sum of $22,161.44 on behalf of the Plaintiff to the Plaintiff’s foreign workers their salaries, air tickets to return to China, foreign workers’ levy and deposits that were withheld by the Plaintiff and she counterclaims against the Plaintiff for this amount.

## LIST OF AGREED ISSUES

20     As the 1st Defendant’s position is that the Plaintiff was aware of the existence of the 3rd Defendant, the crux of her Defence depends on the issue whether there was an agreement between the parties that she is allowed to operate as an independent sub-contractor whilst being employed by the Plaintiff. Counsel for both parties agreed that this is the overarching issue – i.e., whether or not there was an agreement between the parties that the 1st Defendant is allowed from the outset or at least from the formation of the 3rd Defendant to operate as an independent sub-contractor. If not, the next issue is whether the 1st Defendant owes any duty to the Plaintiff as an employee or as a fiduciary and if so, what duty does the 1st Defendant owe and whether the 1st Defendant has breached such duty.

21     In relation to the various projects for which the Plaintiff claims there has been a breach of duties by the 1st Defendant, the following issues in relation to each project have been agreed to by parties as agreed issues:

> (a)     In relation to Hong Dat:

>> \-       Whether the Plaintiff had agreed to loan the Plaintiff’s workers to Hong Dat for $130 per worker per day to assist Hong Dat in their works;

>> \-       Whether the Plaintiff had agreed that the 1st Defendant was to keep the sum of $45,968.00 being payment from Hong Dat;

>> \-       As regards the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ counterclaim, whether the sum of $45,968.00 that was received by the 1st Defendant was given to her as payment in meeting certain CONQUAS scores pursuant to an alleged oral “CONQUAS Scoring Agreement” between the parties.

> (b)     In relation to Wee Hur and Sung Yee:

>> \-       Whether the 1st Defendant had disclosed her beneficial interest in the 3rd Defendant to the Plaintiff;

>> \-       Whether the 1st Defendant had disclosed her intention to carry out tiling works for Wee Hur and Sung Yee to the Plaintiff.

> (c)     In relation to the waterproofing works:

>> \-       Whether the 1st Defendant misrepresented to the Plaintiff as regards the shortage of workers for water-proofing works resulting in the Plaintiff suffering losses in paying Pang and Liew therefor;

>> \-       Whether the 1st Defendant had used the Plaintiff’s workers for works carried out not for the benefit of the Plaintiff but for the benefit of the 3rd Defendant;

>> \-       Whether the 1st Defendant had received any benefit from introducing Pang and Liew to the Plaintiff.

> (d)     In relation to the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ counterclaim:

>> \-       Whether there was an oral agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant regarding CONQUAS scoring and whether pursuant to such agreement, the 1st Defendant is entitled to keep the sum of $45,968.00 received from Hong Dat as part payment due to her for meeting certain CONQUAS scores and whether the Plaintiff is still owing the balance of $19,582 pursuant thereto;

>> \-       Whether the Plaintiff is obliged to pay the foreign worker’s levies, salaries and air tickets and deposits of the workers who had resigned from the employment of the Plaintiff as pleaded in the Defendants’ counterclaim.

## MY DECISION

### The Plaintiff’s Claim against the 1st and 3rd Defendants

#### The 1st Defendant’s role in the Plaintiff

22     As the key issue centres around the role played by the 1st Defendant while working as the site supervisor of the Plaintiff, I will first look at the 1st Defendant’s role in the Plaintiff.

23     By her own testimony[^43], the 1st Defendant detailed her responsibilities as the Plaintiff’s site supervisor as follows:

> (a)     drive and ferry the Plaintiff’s workers from their dormitory to the Plaintiff’s respective projects assigned to her, to BCA for identity verifications, to clinics or hospitals when they were unwell;

> (b)     attend project site meetings, monitor the progress of works at each project site; take photographs and report to the Plaintiff’s management on the progress of works;

> (c)     ensure that the instructions received from the main contractor at each project site assigned to her are properly conveyed to the Plaintiff’s foremen at each site;

> (d)     purchase materials and tools for project sites.

24     In her affidavit, she has also identified 13 projects which she handled during her tenure with the Plaintiff[^44].

25     In cross-examination, she admitted that for projects assigned to her, she “managed” and “oversee” them[^45]. And this “management” and “oversight” of projects include being assisted by other site supervisors such as the 2nd Defendant at the project sites[^46]. In addition, she was also in charge of handing to the workers their salaries and she was responsible for reporting to the Plaintiff’s management resource issues such as insufficient manpower[^47].

#### Whether there was an agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant whereby she was allowed to operate as an independent contractor at the same time as being an employee of the Plaintiff

26     Now that I have looked at the 1st Defendant’s role in the Plaintiff, as the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ Defence is mainly on the basis that there was an agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant that she was allowed to operate as an independent subcontractor whilst being the Plaintiff’s site supervisor, the question of whether there was any such agreement between the parties is the key question to ask before we consider the issue as to whether the 1st Defendant has breached her duties of fidelity as an employee and/or breach of her fiduciary duties owed to the Plaintiff because, if there was such an agreement, then the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ case succeeds and it will not be necessary to consider if there was any breach of duties of fidelity as an employee by the 1st Defendant.

27     In closing submissions, the 1st and 3rd Defendants maintained that the Plaintiff, through its representatives, was, at all material times, aware of the 3rd Defendant’s incorporation and existence. The 1st and 3rd Defendants further maintained that even if the Plaintiff did not know about the said incorporation of the 3rd Defendant initially, they had performed a QuestNet search on the 3rd Defendant and had or ought to have known by 11 December 2012 of the incorporation and existence of 3rd Defendant.

28     The position of the 1st and 3rd Defendants is that the Plaintiff through Mr Chris Lim was aware that the 1st Defendant was running her small business as Fong Teck when the Plaintiff’s Chris Lim approached her to work for the Plaintiff. The 1st and 3rd Defendants also say that the Plaintiff had knowledge or was aware of the incorporation and existence of the 3rd Defendant. Their position is that this by itself is sufficient proof that there was an agreement between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff’s Mr Chris Lim that the 1st Defendant could continue to operate her own tiling business while supervising the Plaintiffs’ tiling works as the Plaintiff’s employee at the same time.

29     Counsel for the 1st and 3rd Defendants relied on the following response of the 1st Defendant in cross-examination to bolster their argument that there was indeed an agreement for the 1st Defendant to continue to engage in her own business even when she was the Plaintiff’s employee (I am reproducing all the relevant responses as cited by counsel in order to give a more comprehensive overview of the position taken by the 1st and 3rd Defendants):

_I was the employee and the boss. Agreed that I worked---I---because before I joined the company as the company’s worker, I was a subcontractor of the company. I’ve clearly informed him about this.

_Q_

_As an employee, you are not to work for a competitor of NK Ceramics \[sic\], agreed?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_I don’t feel that it is a competitor. Even though in the same line, but it’s not competitor. Because I incorporated Meztec. I transferred the lorry from Fong Teck to Meztec. I also let Chris, the Plaintiff use---the admin of Meztec---_

_Q_

**_And from the time you became an employee onwards, there was no more payment to Fong Teck?_**

30     I note that the response of the 1st Defendant at cross-examination is generally defensive in nature. Her response consisted of bare assertions that she could continue to operate as an independent subcontractor and run a competing business whilst being a supervisor of the Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant has provided no details or any particulars upon which she relies to say that there was such an agreement.

31     From the 1st Defendant’s testimony in cross-examination (as seen from the extract quoted above), it is clear that the 1st Defendant is not saying that an agreement exists but that her position is that the Plaintiff had agreed and/or consented for her to operate as an independent sub-contractor by virtue of the following: -

> (a)     Mr Chris Lim was aware that the she was running her own business under Fong Teck when he engaged her to assist as a site supervisor of the Plaintiff and to manage the Plaintiff’s workers in 2005;

> (b)     Mr Chris Lim was allegedly aware that she had already started Fong Teck in year 2000;

> (c)     If she was not allowed to carry on with her own business, she would not have agreed to work for the Plaintiff;

> (d)     Mr Chris Lim was aware of the existence of the 3rd Defendant.

32     From the 1st Defendant’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief and from her testimony in court, she also appears to rely on the following for the inference that there was such an agreement between the Plaintiff and her that she is allowed to engage in competing businesses while under the employment of the Plaintiff:

> (a)     She continued to do business as Fong Teck whilst assisting the Plaintiff in managing its workers;

> (b)     The Plaintiff had known about her Fong Teck business because she had used Fong Teck’s lorry to assist in the Plaintiff’s business;

> (c)     She had been receiving commissions from the Plaintiff based on the projects handled by her;

> (d)     The Plaintiff should have known that the 3rd Defendant was incorporated to take over Fong Teck because the sticker on Fong Teck’s lorry was allegedly changed to the name of the 3rd Defendant;

> (e)     The Plaintiff had conducted a Questnet search on the 3rd Defendant in December 2012 which stated that the 1st Defendant was a director; and

> (f)     The Plaintiff had issued a sub-contract to the 3rd Defendant for the Sengkang N3C18 project.

33     I will now address each of these points of contention.

##### In relation to the existence of Fong Teck, the predecessor of the 3rd Defendant

34     The 1st and 3rd Defendants’ case is that the 3rd Defendant is incorporated to take over Fong Teck’s business and as the Plaintiff is aware of and has consented to the existence of Fong Teck, by extension, the Plaintiff is also aware of and has consented to the existence of the 3rd Defendant.

35     It is not disputed that Mr Chris Lim was aware that the 1st Defendant was the director of Fong Teck when he first got to know her in 2005[^54]. It is also not disputed that Mr Chris Lim was aware that the 1st Defendant was doing business as Fong Teck when he initially engaged her to manage the Plaintiff’s ten (10) workers on an ad-hoc basis[^55]. The Plaintiff however submits that the above understanding was only in relation to the _initial_ period of the parties’ relationship, when the 1st Defendant was engaged to manage the Plaintiff’s workers and projects on an ad-hoc basis. In cross-examination, Chris described their initial relationship as “_we first started off with the understanding that we try one another out because to see whether she can manage..._”[^56] and “_she was coming, in my mindset, as a freelancer… trying to see whether we both match, uh, each another's expectation before we move into the next phase…_”[^57];

36     The evidence from the Plaintiff shows that the Plaintiff did not formally employ the 1st Defendant as its site manager until in or around October 2006[^58]. The 1st and 3rd Defendants however say that the 1st Defendant only started “being remunerated by the Plaintiff as an employee” from November 2007 onwards[^59]. Thus, it is not in dispute that the 1st Defendant was an employee of the Plaintiff, at least from November 2007 onwards.

37     Given that the undisputed fact is that the 1st Defendant was an employee of the Plaintiff, at least from November 2007 onwards (assuming we go along with the Defendants’ case), when it comes to examining the evidence for the understanding or agreement reached between the parties as regards whether the 1st Defendant was allowed to run her own independent business, whether through Fong Teck or through the 3rd Defendant, on top of being an employee, it is the evidence of such understanding or evidence of the parties’ relationship after this point, that is, after November 2007, that is relevant.

38     The 1st and 3rd Defendant has not tendered any evidence to show that, after this crucial point (November 2007), the agreement for 1st Defendant to continue to run Fong Teck’s business whilst under the employment of the Plaintiff continued to operate as the understanding between the parties. The Defendant has not tendered any evidence to show that Fong Teck carried out tiling works for third parties or conducted competing businesses with other parties after this point and that the Plaintiff was well aware of that. From the absence of evidence, it would appear that the 1st Defendant stopped doing tiling subcontractor business under Fong Teck after her employment with the Plaintiff or at least from November 2007 onwards.

39     The 1st Defendant’s contention that she was an independent subcontractor as Fong Teck for the Plaintiff while being employed by the Plaintiff also does not hold water as there is no evidence of any payment made to Fong Teck by the Plaintiff for subcontractor work done by Fong Teck for the Plaintiff after the 1st Defendant was formally engaged as an employee of the Plaintiff and this was admitted to by her in cross-examination as well[^60].

40     Thus, the assertion by the 1st Defendant that Mr Chris Lim was well aware that she continued to do her business under Fong Teck in her affidavit[^61] and in cross-examination[^62] and that, “_because he agree with me to work, so I work. If he disagreed, then I will not accept this job_.” is at best a bare assertion on her part.

41     The 1st Defendant had not categorically stated that there was an agreement between her and the Plaintiff that she was allowed to continue to operate her Fong Teck business, much less operate a business under the 3rd Defendant, which according to her, replaced Fong Teck. To my mind, it is important to differentiate between the state of affairs in the initial period from that after the 1st Defendant was formally employed by the Plaintiff. On this aspect, it is clear to me that the 1st Defendant has deliberately glossed over the transition from the initial period to after her employment by the Plaintiff. It is to be noted that after the initial period, the Plaintiff had contributed towards the CPF payments for the 1st Defendant, just like any employer would for its employees.

42     There is also no evidence to show that after the 1st Defendant was formally employed by the Plaintiff, she sought approval from the Plaintiff to run her own business or that there was any agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant for the latter to operate as an independent sub-contractor.

43     In any event, there is a need to distinguish between her sole-proprietorship business as Fong Teck and the 3rd Defendant which was incorporated as a separate entity. Thus, even if the 1st Defendant was able to show that the Plaintiff had consented for her to continue to operate as Fong Teck (which is not the case), it cannot be assumed that there is also consent from the Plaintiff for her to incorporate the 3rd Defendant to operate in a competing business unless there is evidence to show that consent from the Plaintiff was explicitly given.

##### In relation to payment of commission by the Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant

44     The 1st and 3rd Defendants’ case is that the 1st Defendant is entitled to operate her own business and that the fact that she is paid commission supports such a case. It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant had received commissions based on the value of work done for the projects handled by her.[^63] This reference at paragraph 2 of the 1st Defendant’s letter of employment dated 20 November 2007[^64] that she is entitled to receive commission as part of her remuneration package as the site manager of the Plaintiff is clear. Therefore, based on the employment agreement between the Plaintiff and her, payment of commissions to the 1st Defendant is a term of her employment with the Plaintiff. Such a term pertains to her remuneration. Such a term of agreement is totally different from an express or implied term that she is additionally allowed to operate her own independent subcontractor business whilst being in the employment of the Plaintiff.

45     Therefore, that the 1st Defendant gets paid a commission is of no relevance to the question whether there was an agreement between the parties that the 1st Defendant is allowed to operate her own independent subcontractor business while being in the employment of the Plaintiff and does not lend any weight to show that that the Plaintiff had agreed that the 1st Defendant could continue to operate as an independent sub-contractor.

##### In relation to the Plaintiff’s payment for the use of the 1st Defendant’s lorry

46     The 1st and 3rd Defendants also pointed to the fact that the Plaintiff has been paying the 1st Defendant for the use of the 1st Defendant’s lorry belonging to Fong Teck and that was subsequently transferred to the 3rd Defendant and they argued that this shows the Plaintiff had consented to the existence of Fong Teck and by extension, the incorporated 3rd Defendant to take over Fong Teck’s business. On this, the Plaintiff does not dispute that the Plaintiff had made payments to the 1st Defendant in relation to the use of Fong Teck’s lorry (registration number YM4427L).

47     I note that the 1st Defendant had in fact agreed that these payments were “_reimbursed to (her) because (she was) an employee using (her) own personal vehicle for the purposes of the company_”.[^65] It is therefore clear to me that the fact that the 1st Defendant was paid for the use of the lorry does not in any way show that the Plaintiff had agreed to allowing the 1st Defendant to carry out competing business through Fong Teck and by extension, through the 3rd Defendant. The payment for the use of the 1st Defendant’s lorry was merely to compensate the 1st Defendant for allowing her own vehicle to be used by the Plaintiff for the purpose of the Plaintiff’s business.

##### In relation to the Questnet search and the discovery of the 3rd Defendant by the Plaintiff thereafter

48     The Plaintiff had denied that it was at any material time aware of or was informed by the 1st Defendant that the 1st Defendant had incorporated the 3rd Defendant that was doing the same competing business as the Plaintiff. In their Defence, it is not the case of the 1st and 3rd Defendants that the Plaintiff was informed of and had consented to the incorporation of the 3rd Defendant prior to its incorporation.

49     The 1st Defendant’s testimony did not rebut the clear testimony from the Plaintiff’s Mr Chris Lim[^66] which was corroborated by the Plaintiff’s employees, namely Jennifer Nyu Poh Lay[^67] and Tay Hui San[^68] - all of which show that representations were made by the 1st Defendant in end 2012 that (i) the 3rd Defendant was a company belonging to the 1st Defendant’s nephew and that the 1st Defendant had helped to set up the company only as a nominee director because her nephew was a Malaysian; and (ii) the 3rd Defendant was in the business of cornice work or household minor renovation works and was not a competitor of the Plaintiff[^69].

50     The contemporaneous evidence as shown from Mr Chris Lim’s telephone conversation with one of the Plaintiff’s employees at that time, Anna Tay on 13 September 2013 where he told Anna “_Why I initially park all these people at Meztec, I was given declaratory undertaking by her that Meztec's business is cornice work; they will not do tiling work._”[^70] also supports my finding that indeed, the Plaintiff was given a different story and that the Plaintiff did not raise any objection upon the discovery that the 1st Defendant had incorporated the 3rd Defendant because the Plaintiff was labouring under a different impression about the nature of the 3rd Defendant’s business and the role of the 1st Defendant in the 3rd Defendant.

51     Even the 1st Defendant’s witness, Anna Tay confirmed in her telephone conversation with the Plaintiff’s Mr Chris Lim that, “_Cos that day she mentioned to me that the, they will not do tiling. They do only plaster work_” and “_Then she say her nephew started with cornice_”.[^71];

52     From the above, the evidence clearly shows that the 1st Defendant did try to hide the true nature of her involvement in the 3rd Defendant and the true nature of the 3rd Defendant’s business. Thus, if the Plaintiff had not initially objected to the existence of the 3rd Defendant after the Questnet search on the 3rd Defendant was done in December 2012 and had also agreed for the 3rd Defendant to supply its workers to the Plaintiff, it was because of what the 1st Defendant had told the Plaintiff - that she had merely helped to set up the 3rd Defendant company for her nephew. If anything, the evidence relating to the Questnet search only shows that the Plaintiff had trusted the 1st Defendant[^72] and not that the Plaintiff had consented to the 1st Defendant operating her own independent, competing business through the 3rd Defendant.

53     There is no evidence whatsoever to show that the Plaintiff was aware of the incorporation of the 3rd Defendant before its incorporation or that the Plaintiff had agreed, at any relevant point of time, that the 1st Defendant could operate as an independent sub-contractor whether as Fong Teck or as the 3rd Defendant.

##### In relation to the alleged sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant

54     The 1st and 3rd Defendant’s case is that the existence of a sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant whereby the 3rd Defendant was engaged by the Plaintiff as a sub-contractor for the Sengkang N3C18 project shows that the Plaintiff had agreed to allowing the 1st Defendant to conduct business through the 3rd Defendant.

55     It is not disputed that for the Sengkang N3C18 project, the Plaintiff had relied on the 3rd Defendant’s assistance to obtain the quota for additional foreign workers to carry out the Plaintiff’s works at that project site. It is also not disputed that the Plaintiff had issued a letter to confirm that the 3rd Defendant was its sub-contractor for the Sengkang N3C18 project.[^73]

56     The Plaintiff however says that the sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant was pursuant to the 1st Defendant’s request made in or around April 2013 whereby the Plaintiff was informed by the 1st Defendant had that the sub-contract had to be issued to show to Welltech, the main contractor of the Sengkang N3C18 project, as evidence that the 3rd Defendant was involved in the project because Welltech had found the 3rd Defendant’s workers staying in the site dormitory.[^74] It is not disputed that the Plaintiff had hired foreign workers using the 3rd Defendant’s quota for foreign workers and these foreign workers hired under the 3rd Defendant were carrying out the works of the Plaintiff at the Sengkang N3C18 project. The Plaintiff says that it had issued the sub-contract with the 3rd Defendant to rectify the situation and backdated it to December 2012, i.e. before the Plaintiff commenced works at the Sengkang N3C18 project.

57     The 1st Defendant has not contradicted the Plaintiff’s account and explanation for the existence of this “sub-contract”. It is a fact that despite the existence of a “sub-contract’ between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant that is supposedly worth S$1,094,787.00, the 1st Defendant has admitted and confirmed that no claims had been made by the 3rd Defendant against the Plaintiff pursuant to the “sub-contract”.[^75] This fact alone supports the Plaintiff’s version of how the sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant came about.

58     In any event, the existence of this “sub-contract” between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant does not in any way show that the Plaintiff was aware of the business of the 3rd Defendant and had expressly or impliedly consented to the 1st Defendant conducting a competing business through the 3rd Defendant.

59     On the whole, the evidence supports the Plaintiff’s case that there is no agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant that she is allowed to operate her own sub-contractor business whether by herself or through the incorporation of the 3rd Defendant while she remained under the employment of the Plaintiff.

#### Whether the 1st Defendant owes any duty to the Plaintiff as an employee or as a fiduciary and if so, what duty does the 1st Defendant owe

60     Having found that there is no agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant for the 1st Defendant to continue to operate her own sub-contractor business at the same time as she was employed by the Plaintiff, I will now move on to the issue of whether the 1st Defendant owes any duty as an employee and if so, what these duties are. In addition, it is also necessary to examine the issue of whether the 1st Defendant is also a fiduciary and owes fiduciary duties towards the Plaintiff.

61     The Plaintiff submits that as an employee of the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant owes various duties including an implied duty of fidelity and good faith, to the Plaintiff during the term of her employment. The Plaintiff cited the Court of Appeal case of _Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D & F Main International (S) Pte Ltd) v. Wong Bark Chuan David_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 53</span>[^76] which held at \[193\] that:-

> “It is _trite law_ that there is an _implied term in the employer’s favour that the employee will serve the employer with good faith and fidelity_, and that he or she (the employee) will also use reasonable care and skill in the performance of his or her duties pursuant to the employment contract…”

(Emphasis added)

62     This duty of fidelity of an employee is further described in _Asiawerks Global Investment Group Pte Ltd v. Ismail bin Syed Ahmad and another_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 269</span>[^77] (“Asiawerks”) at \[61\] as:

> “There can be no denying that _all employees are expected to serve their employers diligently, honestly and loyally_. What this duty translates into factually depends on the circumstances such as the nature of the work. _Employees should not be engaged in other business or employment during their working hours without the approval of their employers. They should certainly not be diverting business opportunities that they got wind of only because of their employment status and during the subsistence of the employment_, whether or not such information amounted to confidential information within the meaning of the law.”

(Emphasis added)

63     In _Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v. Lui Andrew Stewart_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 39</span>[^78], the Court of Appeal held at \[67\] that an employee would be in breach of his implied duty of good faith and fidelity if he engaged in actual competitive activity with his employer during the term of his employment:-

> “The case law also clearly demonstrates that whether or not steps taken by an employee can be considered as preparatory to future competition (which is permissible), or instead constitute actual competitive activity (which is not permissible), turns on the facts of each particular case. … What is of _signal importance_ is _whether or not_, on the _facts of this particular appeal_, the Respondent had merely taken _preparatory steps_. If mere preparatory steps had been taken, there would have been _no_ breach of the Respondent’s implied duty of good faith and fidelity; on the contrary, if more than mere preparatory steps had been taken, then there _would_ have been a breach of this duty.”

64     The Plaintiff also argues that in addition to being an employee, the 1st Defendant was also a fiduciary given the scope of her duties and authority as the Plaintiff’s site manager. The Plaintiff cited the case of _Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v. Ting Chong Chai and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 221</span>[^79] in support of this argument. The High Court at \[275\] held that:-

> “A rough and ready guide to whether or not the imposition of a fiduciary obligation would be appropriate are the three characteristics identified by Wilson J (dissenting) in _Richard Hugh Frame v Eleanor Margaret Smith_ \[1987\] 2 SCR 99 at \[60\] which were cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in _Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 737</span> at \[41\]:

>> (1)    The fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power.

>> (2)    The fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests.

>> (3)    The beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the fiduciary holding the discretion or power.

> _At the end, the foundation for fiduciary obligation is the parties’ relationship. Factors such as ascendancy, vulnerability, and dependence which characterise the relationship will be important in deciding if one party does owe specific obligations to solely act in another’s interest at all times.”_

(Emphasis added)

65     In the present case, the 1st Defendant’s responsibilities as site supervisor included supervising workers, managing, overseeing and reporting on the work progress of the projects assigned to her. Such responsibilities would invariably involve the allocation and deployment of the Plaintiff’s manpower at the projects sites, keeping a record of the projects including the time spent by each worker for each project in order for the Plaintiff to make payment of the workers’ salaries, handing over the payment of the workers’ salaries on a monthly basis to the workers, supervising the work of the workers, planning the work at job sites, driving the workers to and from the job sites, attending weekly site meetings and ensuring that the works progressed smoothly.[^80]

66     During cross-examination, Mr Chris Lim described the 1st Defendant’s role as having the “sole right to manage the whole foreign workforce including promotion, demotion, dismissal, you know, of her workforces”[^81] and that “it’s Janny who prepared it, you know, every single workers, how much to pay them for their work done and whatsoever”[^82].

67     He also said, “she basically decides everything, because the boss himself, that’s referring to myself, were just too reluctant to take over that site job”[^83] and that “she was actually the biggest manager in my whole company because she gets the highest pay second to myself”[^84].

68     In cross-examination, the 1st Defendant also agreed that:

> a.     she was managing 11 projects for the Plaintiff in 2012[^85];

> b.     she was given cash to pay the workers’ salary[^86];

> c.     if the supervisors who were assisting her had a problem with the worksites, they would report to her[^87];

> d.     if there was a work related problem, she would “d_efinitely have to be responsible because this is---this was managed by me_”[^88];

> e.     she would usually attend the weekly progress meetings for the projects she was managing on behalf of the Plaintiff[^89];

> f.     if she was informed of a problem in relation to the progress of the works, it was part of her responsibility to think of a solution together with the relevant supervisor[^90];

> g.     she was responsible for financing the purchase of materials on behalf of the Plaintiff in order to keep the job sites going[^91]; and

> h.     she was responsible for ensuring that the works in respect of the projects that she was managing progressed smoothly[^92].

69     From all of the above, it is clear that the 1st Defendant had played a significant role in managing the affairs of the Plaintiff, especially in the area of the work to be carried out and work progress at the work sites and the foreign workers resource management and deployment at the project sites. She was given a fair amount of discretion and power in relation to the management and supervision of the Plaintiff’s workers and projects. As a site supervisor, the 1st Defendant had been entrusted with the management of the Plaintiff’s workers and projects and the Plaintiff relied heavily on her as regards supervising the work progress and the deployment of workers at the work sites and the supervision of the Plaintiff’s workers at the project sites.

70     Nevertheless, I will stop short of concluding that the 1st Defendant is also a fiduciary and that she therefore owes fiduciary duties to the Plaintiff. This is because, the threshold for finding a fiduciary relationship in the Plaintiff is definitely much higher. As the 1st Defendant was not an office holder of the Plaintiff, she was not in a position to “_unilaterally exercise her power or discretion so as to affect the (Plaintiff)’s legal or practical interests_” and her powers is not such as to make the Plaintiff “_peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of (her) holding the discretion or power_”.

71     From the evidence before me, it is clear to me that the 1st Defendant did not participate in the management of the Plaintiff or the running of the company affairs of the Plaintiff, did not manage the finances of the Plaintiff, was not in charge of paying the Plaintiff’s workers (she merely hands over to them the monies given to her) and was not in a position where she could affect the Plaintiff’s financial position and interests directly. Under these facts and circumstances, her duties to the Plaintiff remain those of an employee and not those of a fiduciary.

72     Be that as it may, as an employee, her duty of fidelity and good faith would undoubtedly include the duty not to place herself in a position of conflict of interest or to benefit from her position at the expense of the Plaintiff or to divert business opportunities away from the Plaintiff. If she were found to have done any of these, that would suffice to find her in breach of her duties as an employee.

#### Whether the 1st Defendant has breached her duty of fidelity as an employee

73     I will now examine whether the evidence shows that the 1st Defendant has breached her duties as an employee. For the purpose of determining how and in what way she has breached her duties, if at all, it is important to examine the evidence as regards the various projects and I will proceed to do so based on each project in turn.

##### In relation to Hong Dat

74     The project is the Woodlands 888 project during the period from first quarter of 2012 to the beginning of 2013. For this project, the main contractor was China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd and Hong Dat and the Plaintiff were both subcontractors taking care of different blocks at the project site. The 1st Defendant was deployed by the Plaintiff to supervise the Plaintiff’s works at this site.

##### Whether the Plaintiff had agreed to loan the Plaintiff’s workers to Hong Dat for $130 per worker per day to assist Hong Dat in their works and whether the Plaintiff had agreed that the 1st Defendant was to keep the sum of $45,968.00 being payment from Hong Dat

75     It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant had procured the services of the Plaintiff’s workers to perform works for Hong Dat. It is also not in dispute that for the work performed by the Plaintiff’s workers, the 1st Defendant received two OCBC cash cheques in the sum of $17,875 and $28,093 which she has pocketed.[^93] As these salient facts are not in dispute, the focus turns on whether the Plaintiff had agreed to the arrangement of allowing the Plaintiff’s workers to perform works for Hong Dat who were the competitor subcontractors at the work site together with the Plaintiff at the daily rate of $130. I will also examine the 1st Defendant’s justifications for deploying the Plaintiff’s workers to do work for Hong Dat and for pocketing the two cash cheques.

76     And this is her story: Mr Chris Lim of the Plaintiff had given his instructions to let the Plaintiff’s workers assist Hong Dat as Hong Dat had fallen behind schedule. This story is told through the affidavit of the 1st Defendant[^94] as well as the affidavit of Xing Guo Hua[^95], who was an employee of the Plaintiff deployed to work at the Woodlands 888 project. Xing Guo Hua is now the site supervisor in the employment of the 3rd Defendant. According to the 1st Defendant and Xing Guo Hua, Mr Chris Lim told Xing Guo Hua that he “may go ahead and assist Hong Dat” by deploying the Plaintiff’s workers at the pre-fixed daily rate of $130[^96]. It is an accepted fact that Hong Dat did make payment for the work done. The payments were made by way of 2 OCBC cash cheques in the sum of $17,875 and $28,093, which were handed over to Xing Guo Hua by Hong Dat’s foreman and Xing Guo Hua subsequently handed the cheques to the 1st Defendant.[^97]

77     The Plaintiff’s version is that all of this was done without the Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent[^98]. Mr Chris Lim of the Plaintiff gave an account of how he found out that the 1st Defendant had used the Plaintiff’s workers to assist Hong Dat when talking to one of the project directors of China Construction (the main contractor of the Woodlands 888 project) sometime in July 2013[^99]. Subsequently, he had learned from the director of Hong Dat that Hong Dat had made a total payment to the 1st Defendant of approximately $46,000 for the works done and that initially, the cheques were drawn in favour of the Plaintiff but was subsequently re-issued as cash cheques due to the 1st Defendant’s request[^100]. Through Mr Chris Lim, a copy of the two payment vouchers issued by Hong Dat that were acknowledged by the 1st Defendant was adduced as evidence[^101].

78     In cross-examination, counsel for the 1st Defendant tried to discredit Mr Chris Lim’s testimony by pointing out that from his telephone conversation with Ms Anna Tay Hui San, the General Manager, Administration and Operations of the Plaintiff sometime in September 2013, it was shown that he had known about the 1st Defendant assisting Hong Dat sometime around end 2012. I do not agree with counsel’s postulations. The telephone conversation cannot be clearly understood. The telephone conversation could be interpreted as Mr Chris Lim referring to his discovery – that even as early as 2012, the 1st Defendant had already been acting against the interest of the Plaintiff by using the Plaintiff’s workers to assist Hong Dat.

79     Counsel for the 1st Defendant also submits that Mr Chris Lim’s testimony should not be believed as the Plaintiff had not called the project director of China Construction or any representative from Hong Dat to give evidence on their behalf. I do not agree. As it is the 1st Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff had agreed to let its workers be used by the 1st Defendant to assist Hong Dat and that the Plaintiff had willingly consented to the 1st Defendant keeping the payments from Hong Dat, the evidential burden falls on the 1st Defendant to prove what she asserts and not the other way round.

80     The Plaintiff argues that I should not believe the 1st Defendant’s version for the following reasons (among other reasons):

> (a)     If the Plaintiff had agreed to let its workers assist Hong Dat for a fee, there would be claims or tax invoices issued by the Plaintiff against Hong Dat for the work done[^102]. That there were no such claims or tax invoices shows that the Plaintiff was not aware of this.

> (b)     The payment vouchers in respect of the cheques issued by Hong Dat were in the name of the 1st Defendant instead of the Plaintiff.[^103] The Plaintiff argues that if the arrangement was between Hong Dat and the Plaintiff, the payment vouchers would have been in the name of the Plaintiff to reflect the party receiving payment.

81     The Plaintiff also submits that it is highly suspicious that the cheques issued by Hong Dat as payment for the Plaintiff’s workers were cash cheques which is unusual in the ordinary course of business since whoever receives it can cash it for themselves.

82     I find the 1st Defendant’s story highly illogical. First, it is highly illogical that the Plaintiff would offer its own workers to assist in the work of a competitor when it itself was supposedly facing a manpower crunch. Second, the 1st Defendant’s story is not supported by any contemporaneous documentary evidence. There is no evidence whatsoever of any contractual arrangement between the Plaintiff and Hong Dat for the supply of the Plaintiff’s workers to assist Hong Dat. If there was indeed such a formalized arrangement between the Plaintiff and Hong Dat, there would be some correspondence or claim forms issued by the Plaintiff or tax invoice to show for it. The lack of any claim or tax invoice issued by the Plaintiff to Hong Dat for the workers is very telling. The Defendant has also not called any witness from Hong Dat to testify as to the circumstances leading to the arrangement of the Plaintiff’s workers working for Hong Dat and the payment by Hong Dat by way of two cash cheques. Third, I note that the testimony in support of the 1st Defendant’s story come from a witness who is currently in the employment of the 1st Defendant and both were the key personnel deployed to work at the Woodlands 888 project.

83     I will now come to the 1st Defendant’s story as regards why she pocketed the money received from Hong Dat. She said that Xing Guo Hua called her to accept the two OCBC cash cheques and that after collecting the cash cheques she drove to the Plaintiff’s office to pass the two OCBC cheques to the Plaintiff’s account representatives[^104]. As Mr Chris Lim was present at the Plaintiff’s office, she enquired about the payments allegedly due to her pursuant to the alleged verbal agreement between them regarding the CONQUAS scoring and that Mr Chris Lim told her to keep the cash cheques as the payment due to her[^105].

84     I will briefly deal with the issue of whether there was such an agreement for the Plaintiff to pay the 1st Defendant for the CONQUAS scoring here. This issue will be examined in greater detail when I deal with the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff. For our purposes at this juncture, it suffices to say that this story of the 1st Defendant is unbelievable as it is incredulous that there are no records whatsoever (such as a payment note or correspondence or record from the Plaintiff’s accounts or HR departments) of the Plaintiff’s agreement to allow the 1st Defendant to keep the two cash cheques for herself.

85     In conclusion, I find the 1st Defendant’s version to be illogical, incredulous and totally unsupported. As it is not disputed that the Plaintiff’s workers were deployed to assist Hong Dat and as I have found the Plaintiff’s version to be more believable – which is that this was done without the Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, it is clear that the 1st Defendant, in deploying the Plaintiff’s workers to do work for a competitor company without the Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, has breached her duty of fidelity as an employee of the Plaintiff as she has not served her employer, the Plaintiff diligently, honestly and loyally.

86     In the circumstances, as claimed by the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant is therefore liable to return to the Plaintiff the sum of $45,968 which she has pocketed.

##### In relation to Sung Yee

87     I will now turn to examine the evidence in relation to the Sung Yee project to determine whether the 1st Defendant has breached her duty of fidelity as an employee in relation thereto. This is in relation to the Yishun N4C3 project in which the main contractor was LC&T and the 1st Defendant was deployed by the Plaintiff to supervise that project. Both the Plaintiff and Sung Yee General Contractor Pte Ltd (“Sung Yee”) were engaged by LC&T to perform works at this project. The Plaintiff was awarded with the works at two blocks of flats and Sung Yee was awarded with the works at three blocks of flats.

88     The 1st Defendant was approached by Sung Yee’s project director, one Mr Kent Wee for help as they were experiencing shortage of manpower at the site. The 1st Defendant said she approached the matter of assisting Sung Yee with the Plaintiff’s Mr Chris Lim and Jennifer Nyu. It is not in dispute that she was specifically instructed not to assist Sung Yee by both Mr Chris Lim and Jennifer Nyu. Despite this, she, through the 3rd Defendant proceeded to accept works from Sung Yee and assisted them with their part of their contract with LC&T at the Yishun N4C3 project during the period from May 2013 to either December 2013 or early January 2014. It is a fact that this was during the 1st Defendant’s period of employment with the Plaintiff. For the works done by the 3rd Defendant for Sung Yee, the 1st and 3rd Defendants received a total sum of $320,820 from Sung Yee. This is not disputed. It is also not disputed that the profit made by the 3rd Defendant for the Sung Yee project was $77,805.11 based on the 3rd Defendant’s own calculation[^106].

89     The 1st Defendant’s justification for assisting Sung Yee is that because she had already informed Mr Chris Lim about the work opportunity in assisting Sung Yee and because the Plaintiff had turned it down, she is free to assist Sung Yee as she had “asked NK whether they want to do. There’s no---it’s not NK’s issue anymore”[^107]. The 1st Defendant’s position is that in that scenario, whether she helped Sung Yee or she asked someone else to help Sung Yee, it had nothing to do with the Plaintiff[^108]. Thus, it is the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ position that as the 1st Defendant had first approached the Plaintiff with the business opportunity to assist Sung Yee and the Plaintiff had turned it down themselves, by assisting Sung Yee, they have not in any way diverted business from the Plaintiff or deprived the Plaintiff of the business opportunity.

90     The 1st Defendant also says that she did not deploy any of the Plaintiff’s workers to do the work for Sung Yee and that she had used only 3rd Defendant’s workers[^109] to carry out the works.

91     The Plaintiff says that the 1st Defendant was aware that Mr Chris Lim had viewed Sung Yee as a competitor. When asked during cross-examination whether she understood that Mr Chris Lim had thought of Sung Yee as a competitor, her response was “_To me, from his point of view, yes_”.[^110] This was also a view shared by Mr Wee Liang Jun Kent (“Mr Kent Wee”), a Director in Sung Yee. He is also a witness for the 1st and 3rd Defendants. During his cross-examination, when asked why he approached the 3rd Defendant through the 1st Defendant for help and not the Plaintiff directly to ask them for help, he said, “_Uh, I just did not thought of it, uh, you know. And first of all, LC&T is the main contractor for the tiling. I mean, he subcontract to us. In my eyes, NK is a competitor, you know_”[^111].

92     From the 1st Defendant’s own testimony, she also said, “_He_ (referring to Mr Chris Lim) _say it’s best that he (referring to Sung Yee) cannot make it in time, and then let the main contractors chase him out of this project and then we could---we could assume what they are doing_”[^112]. During cross-examination, the 1st Defendant had also admitted that she did not seek permission from the Plaintiff to assist Sung Yee before she agreed to assist Sung Yee. When asked “_After Chris and Jennifer told you not to help Sung Yee and before you helped Sung Yee, you didn't ask Chris or Jennifer for permission_”, she said “_Correct_”[^113].

93     All of the above showed that the 1st Defendant had agreed to assist Sung Yee through the 3rd Defendant against the Plaintiff’s wish and specific instructions while she was still an employee of the Plaintiff. This is by itself sufficient to conclude that the 1st Defendant’s actions as set out above constitute a breach of her implied duty of fidelity and good faith, a duty which she owes to the Plaintiff as an employee of the Plaintiff. The 1st and 3rd Defendants’ position that they are free to undertake works without the need for the Plaintiff’s consent or approval is untenable as I have already found and concluded that there was no agreement for the 1st Defendant to run her own business whilst working for the Plaintiff full-time.

94     By assisting Sung Yee, which is a business competitor to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant has also engaged in competitive activity at the expense of the Plaintiff; usurped the Plaintiff’s business opportunity as the works undertaken by the 3rd Defendant were works that could have been undertaken by the Plaintiff (either at Sung Yee’s request or at LC&T’s request if Sung Yee had failed to complete their works in time); and profited from her position as the Plaintiff’s site supervisor by soliciting Sung Yee, a sub-contractor at the same project the Plaintiff was working on and for which the 1st Defendant was managing for the Plaintiff, to sub-contract its works to the 3rd Defendant.

95     In addition to the above, of the workers listed in the 1st Defendant’s affidavit as workers who have done work for Sung Yee, the evidence also shows that at least four of the Plaintiff’s workers are likely to have been involved in assisting Sung Yee without the Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. They are Liu Xiangjian, Sheikh Alomgir, Zhao Lihui and Jin Zhongchun. During the trial, both Sheikh Alomgir and Liu Xiangjian gave evidence of having worked at blocks D and B of the Yishun N4C3 project, which were blocks not within the Plaintiff’s scope of work.[^114] However, the Plaintiff had paid for Liu Xiangjian’s salary and levy from May 2013 to October 2013[^115] and Sheikh Alomgir’s salary and levy from July 2013 to October 2013[^116].

96     As for Zhao Lihui and Jin Zhongchun, they were under the Plaintiff’s employment and payroll until 22 September 2013 and 17 September 2013 respectively[^117]. Qu Han Jun, the site supervisor of the 3rd Defendant who was also previously the Plaintiff’s employee, admitted that both Zhao Lihui and Jin Zhongchun had carried out works for the Sung Yee project but stated that they were workers of Seong Construction.[^118] It is to be noted that by the 1st Defendant’s own evidence, both Zhao Li Hui and Jin Zhong Chun only came under the 3rd Defendant’s payroll on 1 July 2014 and 17 June 2014 respectively and this is after Sung Yee’s project at Yishun N4C3 project had already completed. The Plaintiff’s evidence shows that it had paid for Zhao Lihui’s salary and levy from June 2013 to September 2013[^119] and Jin Zhongchun’s salary and levy from May 2013 to September 2013[^120]. In cross-examination, Qu Han Jun, the site supervisor of the 3rd Defendant tried to explain the discrepancies by saying that both Zhao Lihui and Jin Zhongchun were only deployed as the 3rd Defendant’s workers from October 2013 (that is, after they went off the Plaintiff’s payroll). However, the Plaintiff submits, and I agree that it is unlikely that the 3rd Defendant would have specifically engaged two workers from Seong Construction for only two months of work, i.e. November and December 2013 to do the works for Sung Yee.

97     On the whole, even if the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ position is correct – that the 1st Defendant is free to do the work for Sung Yee because she had already asked the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff had turned it down, the 1st Defendant is still in breach of the duty of fidelity as she had deployed the Plaintiff’s workers to assist in the work at Sung Yee for her own benefit.

98     From all of the above, in addition to the 1st Defendant’s breach by engaging in a competitor’s work through the 3rd Defendant, the 1st Defendant has also breached her duty of fidelity and good faith by using at least four of the Plaintiff’s workers to carry out works for Sung Yee for her own gain without the Plaintiff’s knowledge and consent.

99     For this breach, the Plaintiff is seeking damages or an account of profits in the sum of S$77,805.11, being the profit made by the 3rd Defendant in relation to the Sung Yee project.[^121] The Plaintiff submits that this is the appropriate quantum of damages as it represents the losses suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the 1st Defendant’s breaches. The Plaintiff says that had the 1st Defendant not breached her duties by, _inter alia_, soliciting the work through the 3rd Defendant, Sung Yee could have approached the Plaintiff for assistance instead given that both parties were already working on the same project. The Plaintiff argues that, although Mr Kent Wee had stated during cross-examination that he did not think of asking the Plaintiff for assistance as the Plaintiff was a competitor[^122], he had agreed with the 1st Defendant to engage the 3rd Defendant for assistance which is as much a competitor of Sung Yee as the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also says that alternatively, the Plaintiff could have been engaged by LC&T, the main contractor for the project, to undertake the works that Sung Yee was not able to do as it had evidently fallen behind schedule.

100    It is not disputed that the 3rd Defendant made a profit of $77,805.11. On the facts, I find that the 3rd Defendant was only able to make this profit by virtue of the 1st Defendant being in a position whereby she had contact with the representatives from Sung Yee, the other subcontractor at the same work site as the Plaintiff, a position she obtained by virtue of being the Plaintiff’s employee. Therefore, the profit made by the 3rd Defendant is directly attributable to the 1st Defendant’s breach of her duty of fidelity as an employee. Further, the 1st Defendant had also tapped on the Plaintiff’s workers to assist the 3rd Defendant’s work, thereby allowing the 3rd Defendant to make this profit.

101    In the circumstances, the 1st and 3rd Defendants should give an account of the profit made by the 3rd Defendant’s work for Sung Yee. I therefore find the **1st and 3rd Defendants jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff in the sum of $77,805.11.**

##### In relation to Wee Hur

102    This is the Sengkang N4C20 project which the 3rd Defendant was engaged by Wee Hur Construction Pte Ltd to do. The 1st Defendant found out about the opportunity in relation to the Sengkang N4C20 project sometime before October 2012 and had tendered and carried out work for the Sengkang N4C20 project through the 3rd Defendant without the Plaintiff’s knowledge and/or consent[^123]. The 3rd Defendant was awarded the Sengkang N4C20 project on 19 February 2013 and the contract sum was S$1,472,563.49[^124]. The 3rd Defendant commenced works for the Sengkang N4C20 project in June 2013[^125] and completed its works around end of September 2015[^126].

103    It is clear that when the 1st Defendant made a bid for the project through the 3rd Defendant, she was still an employee of the Plaintiff. It is also not disputed that when the project was awarded to the 3rd Defendant and when the project commenced, the 1st Defendant was still an employee of the Plaintiff.

104    The Plaintiff’s case is that the 1st Defendant had breached her duty of fidelity and good faith and fiduciary duties for the Sengkang N4C20 project as she was engaged in competing business with the Plaintiff, or had in fact diverted business opportunities away from the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also says that she had in fact profited from her position as the Plaintiff’s site supervisor.

105    From Mr Chris Lim’s testimony[^127], it would appear that the Plaintiff found out about the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ engagement by Wee Hur by chance (see also telephone conversation on 19 September 2013 between Mr Chris Lim and Anna Tay[^128]). It is therefore clear that the Plaintiff was unaware about this project until Mr Chris Lim discovered it by chance.

106    The Plaintiff argues that the 1st Defendant has breached her duties for the following reasons:

> a.     The scope of the Wee Hur project works was tiling works which is the same business as the Plaintiff’s[^129];

> b.     The 1st Defendant had agreed that she had “_reflected the track record of (the Plaintiff)” \[sic\]_ in her negotiations with Wee Hur[^130];

> c.     The 1st Defendant agreed that she had also reflected copies of the Plaintiff’s CoreTrade skilled workers’ cards in her negotiations with Wee Hur (she attempted to explain this away by saying that it was a mistake)[^131];

> d.     The 1st Defendant was an employee of the Plaintiff at the time she quoted for the Sengkang N4C20 project[^132];

> e.     The 1st Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff about the opportunity in relation to the Sengkang N4C20 project and/or seek the Plaintiff’s consent to quote for the Sengkang N4C20 project through the 3rd Defendant. When asked, the 1st Defendant agreed that she “_did not disclose to Chris or anyone in NK that (she was) negotiating the contract with Wee Hur_”[^133];

> f.     When the 3rd Defendant was awarded the Sengkang N4C20 project, the 1st Defendant was still an employee of the Plaintiff;

> g.     The 1st Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff that the 3rd Defendant was awarded the Sengkang N4C20 project and/or seek the Plaintiff’s consent to carry out the works when the 3rd Defendant accepted and signed a contract for tiling works with Wee Hur for $1.4 million on 19 September 2013[^134];

> h.     The 1st Defendant was aware that pursuant to clause 3 of the Sengkang N4C20 contract, the 3rd Defendant was to commence work on the project from 1 March 2013[^135];

> i.     It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant was an employee of the Plaintiff up to 25 October 2013[^136] and accordingly, that the works for the Sengkang N4C20 project had already started whilst the 1st Defendant was an employee of the Plaintiff (by the 1st Defendant’s own testimony, the work for Wee Hur started in June 2013).

107    The Plaintiff submits that the 1st Defendant’s actions constitute a breach of her implied duty of fidelity and good faith and a breach of her fiduciary duties as she had (i) engaged in competitive activity with the Plaintiff; (ii) usurped the Plaintiff’s business opportunity as the works undertaken by the 3rd Defendant were works that could have been undertaken by the Plaintiff; and (iii) profited from her position as the Plaintiff’s site manager by quoting for the Sengkang N4C20 project using the Plaintiff’s track record and CoreTrade skilled workers’ cards.

108    On the facts, I find that the 1st Defendant has clearly breached her duties of fidelity and good faith as an employee of the Plaintiff. First, she had used the track record of the Plaintiff to raise her own credibility in the eyes of Wee Hur and thereby gain the trust of Wee Hur. In cross-examination, Jennifer Nyu, a witness of the Plaintiff, opined, it “_would be reasonable to assume that Wee Hur has con---awarded the N4C20 Project to Ms.---the 1_st_Defendant, because they did not know that she (was only) the Plaintiff’s employee_” and “_if they knew that they were the Plaintiff’s employee, they would not have awarded the contract to her_”.[^137]

109    Second, the 1st Defendant had knowingly used the Plaintiff’s CoreTrade skilled workers’ cards to give the impression that the 3rd Defendant had a group of reliable and experienced workers and this undoubtedly had raised the profile of the 3rd Defendant and increased its chance of getting the job from Wee Hur. That “her admin had ‘mistakenly’[^138] included the Plaintiff’s CoreTrade skilled workers’ cards” in the quotation for Wee Hur’s project is hardly a believable excuse.

110    Third, that the Plaintiff had no knowledge of what the 1st Defendant had done and has not given its consent for the 1st Defendant to bid for the Wee Hur project through the 3rd Defendant is not in dispute and therefore, it is clear that the 1st Defendant made a bid for the Wee Hur project without the knowledge or consent of the Plaintiff.

111    I will now move on to the issue of what quantum of damages to award the Plaintiff with for this breach.

112    The Plaintiff has asked for damages or an account of profits in the sum of S$346,178.34, being the profit made by the 1st and/or 3rd Defendants in relation to the Wee Hur project based on the Plaintiff’s calculations[^139].

113    The Plaintiff submits that this is the appropriate quantum of damages as it represents the losses suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the 1st Defendant’s breaches. The argument goes like this : had the 1st Defendant not breached her duties by, _inter alia_, quoting for the Sengkang N4C20 project without the Plaintiff’s informed consent, the said works were likely to have been awarded to the Plaintiff as (i) Wee Hur would not have awarded the works to the 1st Defendant had they known she was merely the Plaintiff’s employee; (ii) the 1st Defendant had relied on the Plaintiff’s track record and CoreTrade skilled workers’ cards in its quote; and (iii) the 1st Defendant had stated during cross-examination that “_there’s no shortage of workers in December_”[^140] (which was approximately when the 1st Defendant had quoted for the works), which means to say, the Plaintiff had the necessary resources to quote for the project at Wee Hur. Further, the Plaintiff also says that the 1st Defendant should be held liable to account for the profits made from the Wee Hur project in breach of her fiduciary duties.

114    I note that aside from the Plaintiff’s own estimate of the profit made by the 1st and/or 3rd Defendants in relation to the Wee Hur project, the Defendants have not put forth any alternative calculation or presented any evidence of the profit made by them through the Wee Hur project. In cross-examination, the 1st Defendant as well as the 3rd Defendant, through Chin Mei Fong, admitted that they were in a position to calculate the profit but had not done so[^141].

115    The Plaintiff argues that alternatively, it is entitled to damages based on the total sum it had paid to the 1st Defendant in salary and commission between October 2012 to October 2013 which is the period during which the 1st Defendant was involved in the Wee Hur project. This is because, the Plaintiff’s payment of salary and commission to the 1st Defendant was premised on the understanding that the 1st Defendant was a full time employee who would stay focused in carrying out her job.[^142] The Plaintiff says that if it had known that the 1st Defendant was not loyal to the Plaintiff and was in fact running a business in competition whilst she was an employee, it would not have retained the 1st Defendant as an employee. As such, the Plaintiff had suffered losses of at least S$101,940.78, being the total commission paid from October 2012 to October 2013 and salary paid from January 2013 to October 2013[^143].

116    I note that the Wee Hur project spanned another two years after the 1st Defendant had left the Plaintiff’s employment. Furthermore, according to the contract with Wee Hur, work was only supposed to have commenced from 19 February 2013. As the 1st Defendant left the Plaintiff’s employment in October 2013, the overlap with the 1st Defendant’s employment with the Plaintiff is less than the period after she left to the completion of the project at Wee Hur. For this reason, it would not be fair to attribute all of the profits made by the 3rd Defendant to the Plaintiff. Further, I have already found that the 1st Defendant does not owe duties as a fiduciary to the Plaintiff. Thus, as an employee, it would have been permissible for her to take “_preparatory steps_ to set up her own business after she leaves the Plaintiff’s employment and if mere preparatory steps had been taken, there would have been _no_ breach of the Respondent’s implied duty of good faith and fidelity”[^144]. However, in this case, it is clear that the 1st Defendant had gone beyond taking preparatory steps and had in fact successfully secured a project whilst still in the employment of the Plaintiff.

117    Thus, while I am clear that 1st Defendant has breached her duties as an employee, it is nonetheless important to acknowledge that she should not be penalized beyond the breach of duties as an employee. Unlike the case of Hong Dat and Sung Yee where the Plaintiff was also working at the same project sites, in this case, the Plaintiff is not involved at all in the Wee Hur project. There is also no evidence to show that Wee Hur was likely to engage the Plaintiff instead of the 3rd Defendant. As stated by the 1st Defendant, the 3rd Defendant was approached by Wee Hur’s Quantity Surveyor directly through her[^145].

118    As such, I find that it is more reasonable to calculate the losses based on the 1st Defendant’s remuneration in terms of her commission for the period from the incorporation of the 3rd Defendant in October 2012 to October 2013 when she left the Plaintiff’s employment. The project at Wee Hur was awarded to the 3rd Defendant on 22 January 2013. Thus, from January 2013, the 1st Defendant should also not be entitled to her monthly salary in light of the breach of her duties as an employee. The losses quantified in this way is on the basis that had the Plaintiff been aware of her breach of duties, the Plaintiff would have terminated her employment as from the time the 3rd Defendant was incorporated or at the latest, from January 2013 when the 3rd Defendant was awarded the competing project at Wee Hur. The Plaintiff had quantified their losses on this basis as S$101,940.78 (the amount is derived from a combination of the total commission paid from October 2012 to October 2013 and salary paid from January 2013 to October 2013). I see no good reason not to accept this figure as the losses suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the 1st Defendant’s breaches and will therefore award this amount to the Plaintiff. **_The 1_****st** **_Defendant is therefore liable to the Plaintiff in the sum of S$101,940.78._**

##### In relation to the waterproofing project

119    The Plaintiff’s claim on this project is on the basis that the 1st Defendant had misrepresented to the Plaintiff that there was a shortage of manpower to carry out waterproofing works at the Sengkang N3C18, Yishun N4C3 and Sengkang N3C21&22 projects and had thereby induced the Plaintiff to engage one Pang and one Liew to carry out the waterproofing works thereat. The Plaintiff paid a total of $50,100 for the waterproofing works.

120    According to the Plaintiff’s witness, Ms Jennifer Nyu, the payment for the waterproofing works was made after the Plaintiff’s QS had verified that the work was done and after checking with both the 1st and 2nd Defendants[^146].

121    The Plaintiff claims that the waterproofing works were in fact not done by Pang and Liew but by the Plaintiff’s own workers. According to the Plaintiff, this was discovered by the Plaintiff through conversations with their workers, Luo Xingming, Li Jianfeng and Miah Khokon who mentioned that the hacking and waterproofing works for the Sengkang N3C18, Yishun N4C3 and Sengkang N3C21&22 projects were done by the Plaintiff’s workers including Kamrul Hasan Md Atiyer (“Kamrul”), Martoja, Miah Khokon and Rahman Mohammad Saidur (“Rahman”)[^147].

122    The Plaintiff points to the testimony of Miah Khokon and Li Jianfeng who gave evidence that they had seen Kamrul doing waterproofing works at the Sengkang N3C21&22 project. Li Jianfeng also said that he did not see any other waterproofing sub-contractor doing waterproofing works at the Sengkang N3C21&22 project. However, in court, Kamrul testified that he did not do waterproofing works at the Sengkang N3C21&22 project [^148]. The Plaintiff has no other evidence to show that the Plaintiff’s workers were used to carry out the waterproofing works and that the 1st Defendant had misrepresented to the Plaintiff that there was a shortage of workers. In any event, the fact that the Plaintiff’s workers Kamrul, Martoja and Miah Khokon might have done some waterproofing works at the said project sites does not go towards showing that there was no waterproofing works carried out by Pang and Liew and that all the waterproofing works were carried out by the Plaintiff’s workers.

123    In closing submissions, the Plaintiff argues that their workers “_could have_” performed the waterproofing works. This was merely a speculation and the Plaintiff has failed to adduce any concrete evidence to show for this.

124    On the other hand, however, the Defendant’s evidence shows that there were complaints about the delay in the work schedule and the quality of the waterproofing work at the said project sites by the main contractors, Kay Lim and Welltech respectively when the waterproofing work was undertaken by Pro-werkz as the waterproofing work at the sites was outsourced by the Plaintiff to Pro-werkz[^149]. Further, the decision to engage another subcontractor to “re-do” the poor quality water-proofing work at the said sites did not originate from the 1st Defendant. It is also not disputed that the waterproofing work had to be outsourced due to shortage of manpower to perform the waterproofing works and it was initially outsourced to Pro-werkz.

125    As the Plaintiff has not come forth with their own workers who could say affirmatively that they had carried out waterproofing works at the said sites. The Plaintiff’s only witness, Kamrul’s testimony is unclear. The testimony of the other witness, Li Jianfeng who said he did not see any other contractor doing waterproofing work at the sites is of little value as it does not go towards showing that the Plaintiff’s workers were used to carry out the work and that therefore, the 1st Defendant had misrepresented to the Plaintiff that they were in shortage of manpower to do the waterproofing work.

126    As the Plaintiff has not proven its case on a balance of probabilities in relation to the waterproofing projects at Sengkang N3C18, Yishun N4C3 and Sengkang N3C21&22, the Plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant as regards this aspect of its claim is dismissed.

### The Plaintiff’s Claim against the 2nd Defendant

127    Other than a broad claim against the 2nd Defendant based on mere allegations, the Plaintiff has not provided any particulars in relation to the Plaintiff’s claim that the 2nd Defendant had induced the Plaintiff’s workers to leave the employment of the Plaintiff. There are also no particulars in relation to the Plaintiff’s claims that the 2nd Defendant had diverted the Plaintiff’s workers away from the Plaintiff’s part of the project at Woodlands project to work for Hong Dat. In fact, the 2nd Defendant’s testimony is that he was not even deployed to work at the said project and thus, was totally uninvolved[^150]. In relation to the Wee Hur project, the evidence does not show that the 2nd Defendant had played any role at all in procuring the Wee Hur project for the 3rd Defendant.

128    Other than a bare allegation that the 2nd Defendant had a close relationship with the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiff has adduced no evidence of breach of an employee’s duties by the 2nd Defendant. The evidence shows that the 2nd Defendant had acted on instructions of the 1st Defendant in carrying out his duties as he reports to the 1st Defendant in the course of carrying out his work duties during his employment with the Plaintiff. Therefore, he had not acted on his own accord but rather, the acts were carried out in compliance with instructions either directly from the Plaintiff or from his superior, the 1st Defendant.

129    The Plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd Defendant is therefore dismissed with costs to the 2nd Defendant.

### The 1st Defendant’s Counterclaim

130    The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff is based on the following:

> \-    The outstanding commissions of $9,357.50 for September 2013 and $26,555.19 which the 1st Defendant claims are due to her. The total amount is quantified at $35,912.69.

> \-    The outstanding amount of $19,582 which the 1st Defendant claims is payable to her by the Plaintiff in respect of the CONQUAS Agreement.

> \-    The sum of $22,161.44 which the 1st Defendant says she had paid on the Plaintiff’s behalf, these being expenses in relation to the workers who had allegedly worked exclusively and solely for the Plaintiff’s benefit[^151].

#### Whether the Plaintiff is liable to pay the 1st Defendant the outstanding commissions

131    The 1st Defendant’s claim for outstanding commissions can only be sustained if she had not been found to be in breach of her employee’s duties. As it is not disputed that the alleged outstanding commissions were all earned in 2013 and as I have already found in the above, that she has breached her duties as an employee, a fortiori she is not entitled to claim for the outstanding commissions, even assuming such amounts remain due and owing to her under the commissions agreement reached between her and the Plaintiff.

#### Whether there is a CONQUAS Scoring Agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant

132    The 1st Defendant alleged that in the second half of 2011, the Plaintiff’s Mr Chris Lim had made an announcement at the Teban Garden 40 project site’s canteen that the main contractor, Kay Lim had requested that the Plaintiff achieve a minimum CONQUAS score of 80 points for the Teban Garden 40 project. The 1st Defendant acknowledged that none of the workers present had responded to this announcement. She said that when the results were released, she had learnt from Kay Lim that the Plaintiff had scored 81.835 points. In her affidavit, she testified that she had approached Mr Chris Lim about her reward and Mr Chris Lim had instructed a Mr Isaac Chew to perform the computation. She further alleged that Mr Isaac Chew had showed her the scoring of 81.835[^152].

133    The 1st Defendant’s claim for $19,582 is based on this alleged CONQUAS Scoring Agreement and the alleged terms thereto. According to the Defendants, Mr. Isaac Chew had computed the CONQUAS scoring to be 81.835 but, pursuant to the agreement with Mr. Chris Lim, that was reduced to 81.5 points. The 1st Defendant also relies on Ms. Anna Tay’s computation[^153] to say that, pursuant to this CONQUAS Scoring Agreement and the terms therein, she is entitled to the sum of $65,550.00. The 1st Defendant says that, after offsetting the payments from Hong Dat by way of the two cash cheques, there is still an outstanding amount of $19,582 owing of to her.

134    It is a fact that although the 1st Defendant says that the scoring of 81.835 was given to her by Issac Chew, she did not call Isaac Chew as her witness. Thus, Anna Tay’s calculation which is based on a CONQUAS score of 81.835 was therefore based on hearsay evidence. The 1st Defendant has not provided any evidence to prove the basis for her saying that the project achieved a CONQUAS score of 81.835. There is therefore absolutely no basis for the 1st Defendant’s calculation for the amount she claims she is entitled to, even assuming there was such an agreement.

135    More importantly, the evidence does not show that there was such an enforceable CONQUAS Scoring Agreement in existence.

136    The Plaintiff’s position is that Mr Chris Lim had not, at any material time, offered to make payment to the 1st Defendant if she improved the CONQUAS score for the Teban Garden 40 project nor had he ever entered into an agreement with the 1st Defendant to that effect.[^154] The Plaintiff also says that the evidence shows that the Plaintiff had not have received any additional money from Kay Lim for obtaining a higher CONQUAS score and would have no reason whatsoever to make such an offer to the 1st Defendant[^155]. In addition, the evidence also shows that Kay Lim had confirmed in a letter to the Plaintiff that it did not make any payment to the Plaintiff regarding the CONQUAS score for the project.[^156]

137    The Plaintiff further submits that CONQUAS scoring is calculated by assessing various types of works i.e. architectural, structural and mechanical & electrical, and its numerous sub-components and it would not be possible to have a scoring strictly for tiling works done by the Plaintiff as tiling works are only one component of architectural works.[^157] The 1st Defendant herself has acknowledged at trial that she could not have guaranteed a CONQUAS score of 85 as she was only doing tiling works for two (2) blocks.[^158]

138    Further, even if the Plaintiff had made an announcement offering to make payment for improving the CONQUAS score for the Teban Garden 40 project, the 1st Defendant’s pleadings as well as evidence in her AEIC do not show that there was acceptance of the offer by the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant herself acknowledged that “_As none of the Plaintiffs' workers, including me, has then heard about CONQUAS assessment, or went through the same_, **_no one reacted to Mr. Chris Lim's announcement_**_._”[^159]

139    Therefore, even by the 1st Defendant’s own account, there is no binding agreement to be enforced by her as there is no acceptance of the Plaintiff’s offer by her, even assuming that such an offer was made.

140    In the circumstances, the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim based on the CONQUAS Scoring Agreement completely fails and is therefore dismissed.

#### Whether the Plaintiff is liable to pay the 1st Defendant for her claim for foreign workers’ expenses paid by her

141    The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim for the sum of S$22,161.44 is for the reimbursement for the following payments allegedly made by her on behalf of the Plaintiff:-[^160]

142    Based on exhibit E18 tendered by the Defendants, all of the above workers were employed by the 3rd Defendant but allegedly working for the Plaintiff arising from an agreement between the parties for the 3rd Defendant to supply workers to the Plaintiff. Based on this agreement reached in December 2012, the 3rd Defendant would supply workers to the Plaintiff. According to the Plaintiff, this agreement came about because of the 1st Defendant’s representation to the Plaintiff in the second half of 2012 that the Plaintiff was short of manpower. The Plaintiff had believed what the 1st Defendant said was true. As such, when the 1st Defendant suggested that the Plaintiff obtain additional manpower through the 3rd Defendant, which she said, was a company that belonged to her Malaysian nephew and in which she was only a nominee director, the Plaintiff had agreed[^161].

143    Under the terms of the agreement, the 3rd Defendant was to supply workers to the Plaintiff to work exclusively for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff would make payment of the workers’ salaries directly to the workers and reimburse the 3rd Defendant for the workers’ levy after receiving the relevant invoice(s) from the 3rd Defendant.[^162] It is not disputed that the Plaintiff is liable to pay for the workers’ levy for the workers who had worked for the Plaintiff under the terms of the agreement.

144    Of the workers referred to in the table above, the Plaintiff says it is not liable to pay for the salaries of the six (6) workers (s/no.1-6 of the table above) from 8 October 2013 onwards as these workers had submitted letters of resignation to the Plaintiff on or around 8 October 2013.[^163] The Plaintiff’s position is that the Plaintiff is not liable to pay for these workers for the period 9 October 2013 to 8 November 2013 as they would have stopped working for the Plaintiff after they submitted their letters of resignation.[^164] The Plaintiff also says that there is no evidence that the six workers had continued to do work for the Plaintiff from the time of their resignation to November 2013.

145    In closing submissions, the Plaintiff tabulated below table to show what it is prepared to accept liability for in relation to the salaries of these six workers from 21 September 2013 to 8 October 2013. The amount came up to a total of S$4,946.54 based on a pro-rated calculation of the salary due (i.e. each worker’s salary multiplied by 18/52 days).

146    The Plaintiff further submits that it is not liable to pay for the foreign workers levy of the same six workers from 8 October 2013 onwards for the same reasons as well. The Plaintiff further says that the 1st Defendant was or should have been aware that the workers no longer wished to work for the Plaintiff and had submitted letters of resignation to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff says that although these workers had been working for the Plaintiff, their work permits were under the 3rd Defendant and therefore, regardless of whether they were working for the Plaintiff or the 3rd Defendant, they would have reported to the 1st Defendant. As such, it would have been the 3rd Defendant’s obligation to pay for the levy of the workers after 8 October 2013 as the workers were carrying work passes under the 3rd Defendant.

147    As with the case for their salaries, the Plaintiff says it is prepared to accept that it should pay for the foreign workers levy of (i) the six workers from 1 October 2013 to 8 October 2013; and (ii) another four workers who had been working for the Plaintiff during the relevant period. The Plaintiff tabulated the amounts it says it is liable for as follows: (for the 6 workers, it is pro-rated as 8/39 days).

148    As for the air tickets, the Plaintiff says that it is not liable to reimburse the 1st Defendant for the air tickets allegedly purchased for the six (6) workers as there was no agreement between the parties that the Plaintiff was obliged to do so and the 1st Defendant has not pleaded that such a term was implied into the agreement. The Plaintiff further submits that it was not necessary for the 1st Defendant to have purchased the air tickets because the six workers could have continued to work for the 3rd Defendant as their work passes were under the 3rd Defendant in any event and the 1st Defendant had confirmed during cross-examination that the 3rd Defendant had ongoing projects at that material time.[^165]

149    The Plaintiff submits that it is not liable to reimburse the 1st Defendant for the refund of the deposits allegedly paid to the three (3) workers as the 1st Defendant had no obligation to make such payment to the workers. The Plaintiff’s position is that it is for the workers to make their claim against the Plaintiff and in any event, as the three workers are not parties to the proceedings, any determination made in relation to the deposits would not bind them.

150    I am satisfied that the agreement under which the 1st and 3rd Defendants are enforcing as against the Plaintiff for the reimbursement of the expenses in relation to the foreign workers pertain to workers that were recruited to do the Plaintiff’s work. Therefore, the Plaintiff is only liable for their salaries and foreign workers’ levies for the duration in which they performed work for the Plaintiff.

151    Accordingly, the Plaintiff is only liable to reimburse the 3rd Defendant the sum of 4,946.54 + 2,895.76 = $7,842.30.

152    In conclusion, on the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ counterclaim, it is ordered that the Plaintiff shall pay to the 3rd Defendant the sum of $7,842.30 as per the terms of agreement between the parties.

153    As the Defendants have failed substantially on their counterclaim against the Plaintiff, costs for the Defendant’s counterclaim is awarded to the Plaintiff.

## CONCLUSION

154    In conclusion,

> (a)     The Plaintiff’s claim is allowed with costs to the Plaintiff as follows:

>> (i)       1st Defendant is to return to the Plaintiff the sum of $45,968. In addition, the 1st Defendant is also liable to the Plaintiff in the sum of S$101,940.78. The Defendant is therefore ordered to pay to the Plaintiff the sum of $147,908.78.

>> (ii)       1st and 3rd Defendants are jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff in the sum of $77,805.11.

> (b)     The Plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd Defendant is dismissed with costs to the 2nd Defendant.

> (c)     As regards the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff shall pay to the 3rd Defendant the sum of $7,842.30. Costs of the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ counterclaim is awarded to the Plaintiff.

155    On 9 May 2019 when parties appeared before me for my decision, Counsel for the Plaintiff represented to the court that as against the 1st Defendant, there was an Offer To Settle served on her offering to settle the case on terms better than I had ordered. Counsel for the Plaintiff therefore asked that costs against the 1st Defendant be taxed on an indemnity basis from the date the Offer To Settle was served on her, that is, 23 November 2018. Accordingly, costs to the Plaintiff as against the 1st Defendant shall be on an indemnity basis from 23 November 2018. As costs shall be taxed, if not agreed, the issue of the 1st and 3rd Defendants’ individual liability as regards costs shall be dealt with at taxation.

156    As for the prayer for interest on judgment sum, I note that there has been a long delay since the institution of the proceedings. The present set of lawyers for the Plaintiff took over the case only from 2017. In light of the long delay, I have decided to exercise the court’s discretion not to award interest on the judgment sum as prayed for.
