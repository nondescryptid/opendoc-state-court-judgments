## Statement of Facts

4       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:-

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

> **INTRODUCTION**

> 1.    The accused is Arun Raj s/o Chandran, a 30-year-old male Singapore citizen bearing NRIC number xxx (Dob: 20 June 1990). The accused was employed in a bank at the material time.

> 2.    The involved parties are:

>> a.    Ashvin s/o Ragupathy, a 29-year-old male Singapore citizen bearing NRIC number xxx (DOB: 2 December 1990) (“Ashvin”). Ashvin was employed as a safety coordinator with a shipping firm at the material time. Ashvin has been friends with the accused since 2014.

>> b.    Kannan s/o R Kumaran, a 29-year-old Singapore citizen bearing NRIC number xxx (DOB: 8 October 1990) (“Kannan”). Kannan was employed as a safety coordinator with a shipping firm (different from Ashvin’s) at the material time. Kannan is a childhood friend of the accused and they knew each other since they were in primary school. Kannan is a cousin of the accused.

> **THE ARREST**

> 3.    On 2 June 2016, at about 11.30pm, a party of CNB officers left CNB HQ for Blk 327 Yishun Ring Road.

> 4.    On 3 June 2016, at about 1am, the accused was walking with another male Indian (one Naveen Davarajan (“Naveen”) near the car park entrance of Blk 330 Yishun Ring Road. They were both walking towards the direction of Blk 245 Yishun Avenue 9. At about 1.40am, the accused and Naveen were arrested by CNB officers at the void deck of Blk 245 Yishun Avenue 9. A search was conducted on the accused but nothing incriminating was recovered. The accused was subsequently escorted to his registered address at Blk 410 Yishun Ring Road, #XXX where a search was conducted. Nothing incriminating was recovered. He was escorted to CNB HQ thereafter.

> 5.    On 3 June 2016, at about 2.10 am, a party of CNB officers raided Ashvin’s residence located at Blk 327 Yishun Ring Road, #XXX (“Unit”) and found Ashvin in his bedroom. Ashvin was placed under arrest on suspicion of having committed drug related offences. The following items, among others, were seized:

>> a.    One block of vegetable matter wrapped with clear plastic (subsequently marked as “B1A”);

>> b.    One block of open vegetable matter on a clear plastic (subsequently marked as “B2A”);

>> c.    One brown bag paper bag (subsequently marked as “C1”);

>> d.    One brown cloth bag (subsequently marked as “C2”);

>> e.    One red plastic bag (subsequently marked as “C3”);

>> f.    One electronic kitchen scale (subsequently marked as “C4A”);

>> g.    One pair of metal scissors (subsequently marked as “C5”);

>> h.    One rubbish bag (subsequently marked as “D1”);

>> i.    One piece of plastic which had been cut open (subsequently marked as “D1B”);

>> j.    One piece of plastic which had been cut open (subsequently marked as “D1C”);

>> k.    One packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked as “A1”);

>> l.    One improvised bong (subsequently marked as “A2”).

> 6.    The seized exhibits were then sealed in tamper proof bags and brought to the CNB Headquarters for investigations.

> **BACKGROUND FACTS**

> 7.    For the past two weeks prior to the accused’s arrest, Kannan had been asking him to collect weed (a street name for cannabis) on Kannan’s behalf. Besides calling the accused, Kannan also repeated his request whenever he encountered the accused. The accused eventually agreed to Kannan’s request to collect weed. On 2 June 2016, Kannan exchanged a number of Whatsapp messages with the accused, which included _inter alia_ the following:

> 8.    On 2 June 2016, sometime between 9 to 10pm, Ashvin, Kannan and the accused met up at the Unit. Thereat, in the presence of the accused, Kannan informed Ashvin that the shipment of weed would be coming that night. Kannan then instructed the accused to collect a shipment of weed from Punggol. On Kannan’s instructions, a taxi was booked using the ‘Grab’ application. Thereafter, the accused took the taxi to Blk 256 Punggol Way.

> 9.    On the way to the destination, Kannan sent a Whatsapp message to the accused at 10.11pm, stating “Big field”. During this time, Kannan also called the accused and told the accused to find a small bag at an electricity box. The accused was to collect the bag and to go back to the Unit.

> 10.    After alighting at Punggol, the accused subsequently retrieved a brown coloured bag from a nearby electricity box. At the time, the accused knew that the brown bag contained weed. He subsequently made his way back to the Unit.

> 11.    At about 11.37pm, the accused called Ashvin and told him that the window grill to the Unit was locked. Ashvin returned to the corridor outside the Unit. Upon meeting up, the accused delivered the brown bag to Ashvin and the brown bag was slotted through the window grille into Ashvin’s bedroom. The two blocks of weed were subsequently marked as exhibits “B1A” and “B2A”.

> 12.    Ashvin and the accused then went downstairs. Ashvin joined his friends at the void deck below, while the accused went home to celebrate his mother’s birthday.

> 13.    On 3 June 2016 at about 12.30am, the accused met up with Ashvin in the vicinity of Ashvin’s HDB block. Sometime later, Naveen, who was a mutual friend of theirs, joined them. Naveen then asked Ashvin for weed to smoke. Thereafter, the three of them went up to Ashvin’s flat, and the accused and Naveen waited outside Ashvin’s flat along the corridor. Ashvin took some weed from the opened block of weed, wrapped it in some paper, and passed it to the accused through the bedroom window. This opened block of weed wrapped in clear plastic was subsequently marked as exhibit “B2A”.

> 14.    The accused and Naveen left the Unit thereafter and went to a playground near Blk 314 Yishun Ring Road where Naveen rolled up a cigarette using the weed they obtained from Ashvin. Naveen then kept the rest of the weed in his pocket. They went up to a sky park at a multi-storey carpark at Blk 315 Yishun Ring Road and took turns to smoke the cigarette. After smoking the weed, they went downstairs and were arrested shortly later by CNB officers on 3 June 2016 at about 1.40am (as stated above). The weed found in their joint possession was seized and marked as exhibit F1A.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1st CHARGE (DAC-915451-2020)**

> 15.    On 6 June 2016, the exhibits marked “B1A” and “B2A” were sealed in separate tamper-proof bags and were submitted to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

> 16.    Tan Ying Ying, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, who had conduct of the analysis in relation to the two said exhibits, subsequently issued two amended certificates dated 12 May 2020 under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) bearing:

>> a.    Lab No. ID-1632-01163-002, stating that the exhibit marked “B1A” was found to be one block containing (a) not less than 444.4g of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to contain cannabis, and (b) not less than 510.5g of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol.

>> b.    Lab No. ID-1632-00163-003, stating that the exhibit marked “B2A” was found to be one block and some loose vegetable matter containing (a) not less than 384.6g of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabis, and (b) not less than 424.1g of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol.

> 17.    Cannabis is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> 18.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did traffic in cannabis by delivering exhibits B1A and B2A to Ashvin.

> 19.    The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to traffic in not less than 499.99g of cannabis. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2ND CHARGE (DAC-900594-2017)**

> 20.    On 6 June 2016, the exhibit marked “F1A” was sent to HSA in a sealed tamper-proof bag for analysis.

> 21.    On 12 May 2020, Tan Ying Ying, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued an amended certificate under s 16 of the MDA bearing Lab No. ID-1632-01168-001, stating that the exhibit was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.83g of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol.

> 22.    Cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol (a cannabinol derivative) are Class A Controlled Drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

> 23.    The accused did have in his possession exhibit F1A, having knowledge of and having consented to Naveen being in possession the said exhibit. The accused is not authorised to possess cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(_a_) read with s 18(4) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC-900595-2017)**

> 24.    Following the accused’s arrest, he provided two bottles of his urine which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “CSA-16-00777-2 ARUN RAJ S/O CHANDRAN xxx” and “C-SA-16-00777-1 ARUN RAJ S/O CHANDRAN xxx” respectively in his presence.

> 25\. On 3 June 2016, the said urine samples were sent to HSA for analysis.

> 26.    Subsequently on 8 and 9 June 2016, HSA issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA bearing Lab Nos. AT-1633-04990-001-02 and AT-1633-04990-002-02 respectively.

> 27.    Chan Si Jia, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-16-00777-1 ARUN RAJ S/O CHANDRAN xxx” issued the certificate bearing the Lab No. AT-1633-04990-001-02, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.

> 28.    Tan Joo Chin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-16- 00777-2 ARUN RAJ S/O CHANDRAN xxx” issued the certificate bearing the Lab No. AT-1633-04990-002-02, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.

> 29.    11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, a cannabinol derivative, is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

> 30.    Investigations revealed that the accused had been smoking weed since sometime in 2014. He used to purchase weed from a male Chinese in Geylang at $50 per packet. At the time of his arrest, he smoked weed about two to three times a week. He would usually smoke weed with Ashvin, although he would also smoke on his own under his block.

> 31.    The accused’s urine was tested positive for 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid due to his consumption of the said drug on or about 3 June 2016. The accused is not authorised to consume 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9- carboxylic acid under the MDA or in the Regulations made thereunder. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

## Consideration of sentence

5       Where the quantity of cannabis trafficked is not less than 330 grams and not more than 500 grams, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), is a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment and to a mandatory 15 strokes of the cane.

6       For the drug consumption and drug possession offences, the applicable prescribed punishment for each charge under s 33(1) of the MDA is a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or a fine of up to $20,000 or to both.

7       The prosecution submitted for a sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for the drug trafficking charge and 9 months’ imprisonment each for the drug consumption and drug possession charges. It further submitted that the sentences for the trafficking and consumption charges should run consecutively, so that the total sentence would be 26 years and 9 months’ imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane.

8       The defence submitted that the appropriate sentence for the drug trafficking charge should be 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. It agreed with the prosecution’s sentencing position of 9 months’ imprisonment for the drug consumption and drug possession charges. Overall, the defence submitted for a sentence of 23 years and 9 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

9       For the drug trafficking charge, the weight of the drugs involved was considered to determine the indicative starting point. In _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 25</span> (“_Suventher_”), the Court of Appeal stated (at \[29\]-\[30\]) that the indicative starting point for the unauthorised import or trafficking in 431 to 500 grams of cannabis is between 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. This could be adjusted upwards or downwards to take into account the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.

10     Following the approach in _Public Prosecutor v Ravan s/o Samubil_ and others <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 103</span> (“_Ravan_”), I assessed the indicative starting point to be 29 years’ imprisonment. In _Ravan_, where 499.99 grams of cannabis was trafficked, Hoo Sheau Peng, J (at \[55\]) took the indicative starting point to be 29 years’ imprisonment, being the highest end of the range of 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment for the weight of between 431 to 500 grams of cannabis trafficked. Similarly, in the present case, as the amount of cannabis trafficked was 499.99 grams, the indicative starting point would also be 29 years’ imprisonment.

11     Sentence would then be calibrated upwards or downwards to take into account the accused’s culpability and the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.

12     There were no aggravating factors to indicate that sentence should be adjusted upwards. The prosecution submitted that as a courier, the accused’s culpability fell in the middle of the spectrum and that in view of his plea of guilt which showed his genuine remorse, sentence should be adjusted downwards to 26 years’ imprisonment.

13     In the plea-in-mitigation, defence counsel stated that the accused was working as an accountant at an established bank. He came from a tight knit family and gave his entire salary to his mother, who would give him an allowance. His family are heartbroken and devastated by his offending.

14     In considering sentence, I took into account the factors raised in the plea-in-mitigation by defence counsel and the accused. The accused had no antecedents. He had co-operated with the police by revealing the names of the co-accused persons and had outlined his involvement in the trafficking charge. He was remorseful and had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. There was little pre-meditation and his role was limited to being a courier.

15     I also accepted that the accused had been reluctant to deliver the drugs. The court was informed that Kannan (who was the mastermind), had repeatedly asked the accused to help collect “weed” (cannabis) for him. The accused had repeatedly turned Kannan down as he was afraid and did not want to dabble in transporting drugs. However, on 2 June 2016, Kannan arranged to meet him and brought him to Ashvin’s flat. Kannan repeatedly assured and persuaded the accused to help him collect the weed. The accused then relented.

16     The accused also claimed that he was constantly fearful when he interacted with Kannan, his distant cousin. He had been constantly bullied and ordered around by Kannan since he was young. Whenever they met, Kannan would punch him in his ribcage as a form of greeting. It was partly out of fear and misplaced trust in Kannan that the accused agreed to assist Kannan to transport the weed.

17     In assessing the accused’s culpability, it was significant that he did not deliver the cannabis for personal gain, but out of foolishness. He did not receive nor was he promised any monetary benefit. While he may have later obtained a small quantity of cannabis for consumption with Naveen, this was not a consideration in calibrating sentence for the drug trafficking offence, since he would be separately punished for possessing and consuming cannabis.

18     The prosecution relied on sentencing precedents where sentences of 25 to 26 years’ imprisonment were imposed when the drugs transported were of a similar or analogous weight to the present case. This was consistent with the sentencing precedents submitted by the defence. In these sentencing precedents, the offenders had committed the offences for personal gain or had played a greater role than just transporting the drugs, such as helping to repack the drugs. As none of these factors were present, I was of the view that a sentence below the range of 25 to 26 years’ imprisonment could be imposed.

19     In submitting for a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment, the defence relied on _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nor Haiqal bin Shaman_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 292</span> where the offender was sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment. The offender was involved in the repacking and delivery of drugs for four months before his arrest. He was promised drugs for his own consumption at a cheaper price. However, this case was not helpful as it involved the sentencing of a young offender who was only 20 years old at the time of his arrest.

20     Taking into account the sentencing considerations, I made a substantial downward adjustment from the initial starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment for the drug trafficking offence. In my assessment, a sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment was appropriate to reflect the accused’s culpability and role.

21     As for the drug consumption and possession charges, the defence had at \[29\] of the plea-in-mitigation conceded that the prosecution’s sentencing position for these charges was fair. I imposed a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment per charge, to reflect parity of sentence with the drug consumption charge faced by the co-accused Ashvin.

22     I ordered the sentences for the drug trafficking and consumption charges to run consecutively, so that the aggregate sentence was 24 years and 8 months’ imprisonment with the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane. The overall sentence is proportional to the offences committed and cannot be considered to be manifestly excessive.
