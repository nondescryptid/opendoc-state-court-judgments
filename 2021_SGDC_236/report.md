### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       The defendant is a 38-year-old woman. She lived with her husband (the “**Husband**”), their two daughters and their son in an apartment in Yishun.

2       In 2019, and again in 2021, she committed various acts of physical abuse against her elder daughter (born in February 2011, “**V1**”) and younger daughter (born in January 2015, “**V2**”) at their home. The elder daughter bore the brunt of the abuse. The defendant’s acts were captured on a CCTV camera that had been installed by her Husband in the living room of the home.

3       With the consent of the Public Prosecutor under s 20 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Chapter 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“**CYPA**”), the defendant was charged with eleven offences. Following a plea offer, she pleaded guilty to seven charges on 16 September 2021, with the remaining four charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

4       On 29 September 2021, she was sentenced to a total of 36 months’ imprisonment, a sentence that was suggested by her counsel. She commenced serving the sentence. On 11 October 2021, she filed the present appeal against the sentence through the Prison.

5       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

6       The defendant pleaded guilty to seven charges of ill-treating her daughters, under s 5(1) of the CYPA. The charges were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the _date_ and _time_ of each offence, the _Child_, and the _physical abuse_:

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, on the _\[date\]_, at or about _\[time\]_, at \[the home of the defendant and the victims\], Singapore, being the person who has custody, charge or care of the child, _\[Child, age\]_, did ill-treat the said child and subject her to physical abuse, _to wit_, by _\[physical abuse\]_, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1) punishable under Section 5(5)(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38 (2001 Rev. Ed.).

8       Section 5(1) CYPA provides:

>     A person shall be guilty of an offence if, being a person who has the custody, charge or care of a child or young person, he ill-treats the child or young person or causes, procures or knowingly permits the child or young person to be ill-treated by any other person.

9       The punishment for the offence (where death is not caused to the child or young person) is prescribed in s 5(5)(b) CYPA.

> (a)     For offences committed before 1 January 2020, an offender was liable to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years or to both.

> (b)     With effect from 1 January 2020, the prescribed punishment was doubled, and an offender is now liable to a fine not exceeding $8,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 8 years or to both.

### Facts

10     The salient facts were as follows.

#### Physical abuse of V1 and V2

11     At the material times the defendant was a housewife. She took care of the children while her Husband was at work.

12     On 18 June 2019, her Husband returned home after work and discovered that the front teeth of their elder daughter (V1) were broken. Upon asking V1 what had happened, she revealed that the defendant had slapped and kicked her, causing her mouth to bleed and her front teeth to break. The Husband immediately brought V1 to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“**KKH**”) to seek medical attention. On 21 June 2019, a police report was lodged from KKH regarding the assault.

13     In the course of investigations, V1 revealed that the defendant started beating her when she was in kindergarten (K1 or K2). The beatings worsened in 2018, when she was in Primary 1. The defendant would beat her very hard. This included slapping her many times on her face, using a cane to hit her, kicking her and pulling her hair. These assaults would usually take place in the living room where the CCTV camera was installed. Sometimes, the defendant would pull her by her hair and drag her to the bedroom to continue the assaults away from the CCTV camera. V1 did not tell her father about the assaults as she was afraid that the defendant would find out and beat her more. She also did not inform her schoolteachers about the assaults as she did not know that she could do so.

14     The incidents of physical abuse were captured on a CCTV camera in the living room of the home. The proceeded charges related to the following incidents (in chronological sequence).

15     On 8 June 2019, the defendant was alone at home with the children. At about 1.30 am, the defendant kicked V1’s head, repeatedly slapped V1’s face and repeatedly kicked V1 on her body. V1 was then 8 years old. _(5th charge)_

16     On 12 June 2019, the defendant was alone at home with the children. At about 10.09 pm, the defendant pulled both of V1’s ears, repeatedly slapped V1’s face, kicked V1 on her body and dragged V1 by her hair. _(3rd charge)_

17     On 14 June 2019, the defendant was alone at home with the children. At about 11.55 am, the defendant repeatedly slapped V1’s face and threw her (as she was standing) on the floor. _(4th charge)_

18     On 18 June 2019, the defendant was alone at home with the three children. At about 3.50 pm, the defendant pulled V1’s hair, repeatedly slapped V1’s face and kicked V1. As a result of the assaults, V1 sustained a missing upper front tooth and mild erythema over the acromioclavicular joint on the right shoulder. V1 was given two days of medical leave from 18 to 19 June 2019. [^1] (_1st charge_)

19     On 5 July 2019, the defendant was alone at home with the children. At about 6.20 pm, the defendant pinched her younger daughter (V2) several times and slapped her face repeatedly. V2 was 4 years old. _(2nd charge)_

20     After this incident, both V1 and V2 were temporarily taken from the home on 22 August 2019 by a Child Protection Officer (“**CPO**”).

21     On 1 December 2019, the defendant and her Husband were at home with the children. The Husband’s parents were also in the home. At about 9.00 pm, the Husband accompanied his parents to the ground floor for his parents to take a taxi home, and he went to a nearby shop to buy some things. The defendant was therefore left alone at home with the children. At about 9.02 pm, the defendant threw a capped marker pen at V1’s forehead. _(8th charge)_

22     When the Husband returned home at about 10.00 pm, the defendant approached him and informed him that she was angry with V1 earlier and threw a marker pen at her forehead. The defendant also informed her Husband that there was a bump on V1’s forehead, but the wound was minor and there was no need to bring V1 to the clinic. The Husband then asked V1 what happened. V1 informed him that the defendant told her not to tell anyone about the incident. Upon further probing, V1 revealed that the defendant was angry with her earlier and threw a marker pen at her forehead. The Husband alerted the CPO about the incident. The CPO informed that she would come by the home the next day. The next morning, upon finding out that the CPO would be coming, the defendant told V1 to lie to the CPO and tell the CPO that they were merely playing when a toy hit V1. The CPO brought V1 to KKH to seek medical treatment that same morning. It was found that V1 had a 2 x 2.2 cm oval shaped purplish-red cephalohematoma with central 2 mm scab, and the clinical diagnosis was left frontal forehead cephalohematoma.[^2]

23     (More than 1½ years later, sometime in or around August 2021, the Husband noticed that the defendant was losing her temper and shouting at the children for no reason. He thus viewed the CCTV recordings at his home and was shocked to discover that between March and May 2021, the defendant had physically abused V1 and V2. He then alerted the Child Protection Service.)

24     On 8 March 2021, the defendant was at home with the children. Her Husband was not around. At or about 7.34 pm, in the kitchen, the defendant pulled V1’s ear, slapped V1’s face, used her finger to hit V1’s head repeatedly and hit V1’s arm. V1 was crying as the defendant assaulted her. V1 was then 10 years old. (9th charge)

#### Psychiatric report of defendant

25     A psychiatric report prepared by a consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”) stated the following:[^3]

> (a)     The defendant did not suffer from any diagnosable mental illness at the time of the offences.

> (b)     She did not demonstrate a convincing level of insight into how such harsh physical disciplinary actions would negatively affect the children’s emotional, social and cognitive development in the future. There was also a degree of resistance noted in the defendant to adopt acceptable alternate methods to discipline her children.

> (c)     The potential future risk of harsh physical punishment on children remained high. Her future interactions with children should be strictly supervised in the presence of safe and responsible adults to ensure the wellbeing of the children.

## Sentencing

### Charges taken into consideration

26     The defendant admitted to four other offences, which were taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The particulars of the TIC charges were as follows:

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

27     The prosecution sought a total sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)     For the five offences that occurred in June and July of 2019 (the 1st to 5th charges), the prosecution sought a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment per charge.

> (b)     For the offence committed in December 2019 (the 8th charge), the prosecution sought a higher sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment. The offence was committed while the defendant was under investigation and after prior intervention by the CPO, and the defendant had tried to cover up the offence by asking V1 to lie to the CPO.

> (c)     For the offence committed in March 2021 (the 9th charge), the prosecution similarly sought a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment as the offence was committed while the defendant was on bail.

It was submitted that the sentences for the 1st, 2nd, 8th and 9th charges be ordered to run consecutively, and that a global sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment be imposed.[^4] Reference was made to sentencing precedents in support of the sentences sought (considered below, at \[36\]-\[37\]).

28     The prosecution submitted that child abuse was a societal evil that had to be severely dealt with. Deterrence and retribution were the primary sentencing considerations for child abuse cases.

29     Child abuse was notoriously difficult to detect. Young children were wholly dependent on their caregivers for their daily needs and looked up to their caregivers as figures of authority and role models. Children abused by their caregivers had no one else to turn to. Child abuse generally took place in the privacy of the child or abuser’s home and was kept hidden from the public. They were only detected if a third party, such as a teacher, social worker or a relative fortuitously uncovered the abuse. In the present case, given the tender age of V1 and V2, they were incapable of seeking help on their own. The abuses against them only came to light because of the visible and obvious injuries sustained by V1. According to statistics from the Ministry of Family and Social Development (MSF), the number of cases of physical child abuse which had been investigated ranged from 188 to 263 annually from 2010 to 2015. This figure spiked to 584 and 660 in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

30     Apart from general deterrence, there was also a need for specific deterrence in the present case. Although the defendant was untraced, she had a history of using violence on the two vulnerable victims. She committed the offences despite knowing that a CCTV camera was installed, and even after the authorities had been alerted to her actions.

31     It was submitted that there were a number of aggravating factors in this case. Both V1 and V2 were vulnerable victims. The defendant abused her position of trust as their mother. She took steps to try to cover up her offending. For example, in relation to the 8th charge, she told V1 not to tell anyone about the incident and also to _lie_ to the CPO about how the injury was sustained. She lacked remorse and sought to downplay her culpability while the matter was being investigated by the police: for the incident in the 3rd charge, she told the investigation officer (IO) that she only slapped V1 once or twice but not multiple times, and she denied kicking V1; for the incident in the 4th charge, she informed the IO that she only slapped V1 once or twice but not multiple times, and she denied throwing V1 on the floor; for the incident in the 5th charge, she informed the IO that she only slapped V1 once or twice but not multiple times, and she denied kicking V1.[^5] She sought to justify her conduct during her visits to the IMH, and denied being violent to her children except for “minor disciplinary actions”.[^6] The abuse did not stop despite the intervention of the Child Protection Service on 22 August 2019 and the police investigations that began on 3 September 2019. She re-offended in 2021 while on bail and awaiting trial.

### Mitigation Plea

32     Counsel for the defendant suggested a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)     For the 1st charge, a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment was suggested. Reference was made to sentencing precedents in support of this submission (considered below, at \[38\]-\[39\]).

> (b)     For the other charges, the defence’s submission on the sentences was aligned with the sentences sought by the prosecution.

> (c)     The defence also concurred with the prosecution that the sentences for four charges (the 1st, 2nd, 8th and 9th charges) run consecutively.[^7]

33     In mitigation, it was highlighted that the defendant was untraced. She was remorseful and accepted responsibility for her actions. She demonstrated her deep contrition by pleading guilty. She realised the seriousness of her offences and deeply regretted her actions. She pleaded for leniency.

34     The background leading up to the offences was set out.[^8] The defendant’s highest qualification was Higher NITEC. Her last full-time employment was in 2015, and she had been a full-time homemaker since then. She was enduring a turbulent and distressing phase of her life in the period leading up to the offences. She was estranged from her parents and had a difficult upbringing as her parents exerted heavy-handed corporal punishment. Her marriage to her Husband had also been marred by turmoil and disagreements. In early December 2018, she commenced divorce proceedings against him. He brought their children to live with her parents, and her parents did not allow her to see the children. From 25 December 2018 to 9 January 2019, she was admitted in IMH for an assessment. She was assessed to be not suffering from a major mental illness[^9] but her experience in IMH had a deeply damaging impact on her. The defendant and her Husband decided to reconcile subsequently, and she withdrew the divorce proceedings. Sometime in June 2019, she began to suffer from migraines and exhaustion frequently. She became very easily irritable and increasingly temperamental, unable to control her emotions. A medical check revealed that she was pregnant. She and her Husband decided that the pregnancy should be aborted. She underwent the abortion surgery on 11 July 2019, and another surgery on 26 July 2019 to remedy a complication.

35     The cumulative effects of a strained marriage, her parents’ disruptive interference into her domestic affairs, the terrifying experience in IMH and the heartache caused by having to terminate her pregnancy pushed the defendant into a state of loneliness and utter despair at the material time. She accepted that her actions were wrong and inexcusable, and that she ought to have exercised self-restraint.

### Sentencing precedents

37     The prosecution submitted that the offenders in these precedents committed similar acts of child abuse. In _Franklie Tan Guang Wei_, the offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment per charge for slapping the child on the face, causing finger marks on the child’s cheek and bruising on the ear; and punching the child twice on the buttocks, causing a bruise. In _Ramlee bin Pupon_, the offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge for: grabbing his 13-year-old daughter’s head and slamming it on the floor, causing her front tooth to be chipped off; and heating a metal fork with a lighter and pressing it on the victims’ arms. It was submitted that the sentences sought by the prosecution in the present case were in line with the precedents.

38     The following sentencing precedents were cited by the defence.

39     The defence submitted that the facts in _AQF_ and _BCL 2_ were more egregious than in the present case (in respect of the first charge). In _AQF_ the offender _caned_ the victims multiple times; in the present case the defendant did not use any instrument to hit V1, and her acts were not as heinous. The multiple injuries suffered by the victims in _AQF_ were more serious, including bruising and scars; in the present case, the injuries were relatively less serious in the form of one broken upper front tooth, which was a loose milk tooth, and mild erythema on V1’s right shoulder. In _BCL 2_, the offender had relevant antecedents and claimed trial; in the present case the defendant was untraced and pleaded guilty. The defence submitted that for the 1st charge, the starting point of the sentence ought to be lower than the 6 months’ imprisonment imposed in _AQF_ and _BCL 2_ in light of the less egregious facts. A starting point of 5 months’ imprisonment was suggested, with an upward calibration to 7 months considering that the defendant was the natural mother of V1 and was convicted of a number of charges of a similar nature.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Deterrence and retribution

40     In determining the appropriate sentence, the dominant sentencing considerations were _deterrence_ and _retribution_. Children are vulnerable victims and must be given the full protection of the law. In the present case, both victims were particularly vulnerable in view of their very young age; they could do nothing to protect themselves. The defendant, as a parent, was under a moral obligation to care for the children. Her acts of physical abuse against them were a betrayal of the trust that they had placed on her. Parents must not use violence against their children under any circumstances, and such acts of violence must be deterred. The sentence must also carry a retributive element in proportion to the physical and likely psychological harm caused to the child.

41     The gravity of offences against vulnerable victims such as children and young persons was underscored in _PP v Firdaus bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 225</span>, where the High Court stated at \[19\]:

>     \[T\]he gravity of the offence would be increased in cases involving vulnerable victims. Children and young persons are particularly vulnerable because they are unable to fend for themselves and require their parents or guardians to take care of them. Any person entrusted with the care of young children would be harshly dealt with if that trust is betrayed: see _Purwanti Parji v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 SLR(R) 220</span> at \[30\] and _PP v Teo Chee Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 250</span> at \[9\].

42     Violence perpetrated by parents and caregivers against children cannot be tolerated and would be met with the full force of the law. In _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>, the Court of Appeal stated at \[35\]:

>     In the specific context of violence against children, in _PP v AFR_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 833</span> (“_AFR_”), we made it clear to all parents and caregivers that such violence would not be tolerated and would be met with the full force of the law (at \[12\]). We also observed in the earlier decision of _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> (“_UI_”), in the context of the _sexual_ abuse of young victims, that (at \[33\]):

>> The ultimate relationship of trust and authority is that between a parent and his or her child. There exists between them a human relationship in which the parent has a moral obligation to look after and care for the child. In our view, the level of confidence and trust that a child naturally reposes in his or her parent entails that a parent who betrays that trust and harms the child stands at the furthest end of the spectrum of guilt…

>     In our judgment, these observations apply with equal force to the distinct but closely analogous situation of _physical_ abuse of children.

#### Appropriate sentence

43     I noted at the outset that the sentencing positions of the prosecution and the defence were not far apart. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 9 months’ or 10 months’ imprisonment for each charge. The defence did not disagree, save for the 1st charge. The global sentence sought by the prosecution was 38 months’ imprisonment, while the global sentence suggested by the defence was 36 months’ imprisonment. (Above, at \[27\] and \[32\])

44     These sentences were reasonable and in line with the precedents cited. The precedents show that cases of child abuse have been consistently met with substantial terms of imprisonment, ranging from 6 to 12 months’ imprisonment for each offence in the precedents cited.

45     I considered it appropriate, however, to calibrate the sentences slightly differently. For the first charge, I considered a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment to be appropriate. In _Ramlee_ (above, at \[36\]), the offender _slammed_ the head of his 13-year-old daughter on the floor, causing her front tooth to be chipped off, and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. That offender’s conduct was more cruel and more egregious than the defendant’s acts (in the first charge) which led to the loss of a _milk_ tooth. Taking _Ramlee_ as a reference point, a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment for the first charge in the present case would, in my judgement, be a fair sentence for the defendant; and it was within the range suggested by the prosecution (9 months) and the defence (7 months).

46     For the 2nd to 5th charges, I also considered it appropriate to impose the same sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment. These offences occurred in June and July 2019, which was around the time of the offence in the first charge. The culpability of the defendant in these offences appeared similar in that they all involved repeated slapping of the face of the victim as well as other forms of abuse. There were no medical reports of the injuries suffered by the victims for these charges, and it could not be said whether the injuries were more or less severe than the incident in the first charge. In my judgment, it would be fair that the same sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment be imposed for these charges.

47     For the 8th charge, I accepted the submission of the prosecution and the defence that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. The defendant threw a capped marker pen at V1’s forehead, causing a 2 x 2.2 cm haematoma. The CCTV footage of the incident, which was screened in court, showed the defendant throwing the capped marker pen at V1 _with force_. It was fortuitous that the projectile did not hit a more vulnerable part, such as the eye. The offence occurred on 1 December 2019, after prior intervention by the CPO in August 2019 and after police investigations had begun in September 2019. The defendant’s repeat offending showed a lack of remorse and insight into her earlier offending and warranted an uplift in the sentence.

48     For the 9th charge, I also accepted the submission of the prosecution and the defence that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment be imposed. This offence occurred in March 2021. The prescribed punishment for offences under s 5(1) CYPA had been doubled following amendments to the CYPA which came into effect on 1 January 2020 (above, at \[9(b)\]). This offence was committed after the defendant had been charged in court and was pending trial for the earlier offences. Further, two other offences were committed in April and May 2021 (the 10th and 11th charges, which were TIC). All these factors could have justified a higher uplift in the sentence. I was prepared, however, to accept the sentence submitted by the parties, given that this sentence would be ordered to run consecutively with other sentences.

49     As for the global sentence, I accepted the submission of parties that the sentences for the 1st, 2nd, 8th and 9th charges be ordered to run consecutively. The global sentence was thus 36 months’ imprisonment. This was the global sentence suggested by the defence. In my judgment, the length of the sentence would adequately convey society’s disapprobation of acts of violence against vulnerable children, reflect the defendant’s overall culpability and the harm caused to the victims, and meet the sentencing considerations of deterrence and retribution.
