2       In the same proceedings, four charges under the MDA were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. The charges were:

> (a)     Joint possession of not less than 23.29 grams of methamphetamine, with enhanced penalty;

> (b)     Trafficking in not less than 3.22 grams of diamorphine;

> (c)     Two counts of failing to report for urine test.

## Facts relating to the charges

3       The Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution revealed these key facts.

4       On 19 September 2019, at about 6.35am, a team of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers arrested one Thinagaran at the deck of a multi-storey carpark located at Block 694 Admiralty Grove, Singapore. On the same day at about 6.45am, CNB officers intercepted a white Fiat van (the “van”) at the cross junction along Gambas Avenue and Sembawang Avenue, Singapore. The Accused and one Zubir bin Ya’acob, who were seated in the van, were arrested. A search was conducted in the van and one black taped bundle (marked “A1A”), kept inside the Accused’s “Under Armour” sling bag, was found in the van’s front passenger seat floorboard.

### Facts relating to the joint trafficking charge (DAC 904968/2020)

5       Prior to the Accused’s arrest, the said Thinagaran, acting on instructions from an individual known only as “Raymond”, retrieved “A1A” which he knew contained “panas” (a street name for heroin), from an unknown Indian male. The said Thinagaran was instructed to proceed to the multi-storey carpark located at Block 693 Admiralty Grove, Singapore, and hand “A1A” to the said Zubir, and receive S$3,000 cash in return. The Accused and Zubir had similarly received instructions to collect drugs from Thinagaran at the carpark, before placing the drugs at a collection point for further dissemination.

6       As such, on 19 September 2019, at or about 6.30am, the Accused and Zubir drove the van to the said carpark. Zubir then exited the van, walked over to Thinagaran and handed over S$3,000 in cash, in return for “A1A”. Zubir brought **“**A1A” back to the van. The Accused then placed “A1A” into his “Under Armour” sling bag, before placing the sling bag under the floorboard of the passenger seat. The Accused and Zubir then drove out of the carpark, and were arrested shortly thereafter.

7        **“**A1A” was found to contain one packet of brown granular substance (marked “A1A1”). Upon analysis by officers from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), the exhibit marked “A1A1” was found to be one (1) packet containing not less than 451.4 grams of granular/powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 2.85 grams of diamorphine.

8       Diamorphine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The Accused was aware that “A1A1” contained diamorphine and had it in this possession for purposes of trafficking, in furtherance of the common intention between himself and the said Zubir.

### Facts relating to the possession charge (DAC 919536/2020)

9       After his arrest, the Accused was escorted to his workplace in Orchid Park Condominium. A search was conducted in the cleaners’ pantry in Orchid Park Condominium in the Accused’s presence. Several drug exhibits , including two packets containing a crystalline substance (marked “B1A” and **“**B1B”), one packet containing two packets of a brown granular substance and one packet of a crystalline / granular substance (collectively marked “B2A1”), one packet containing a crystalline substance (marked “B2D1”) and drug paraphernalia were seized. The Accused admitted that the seized drugs and items belonged to him.

10     On 20 September 2019, the exhibits marked “B1A”, “B1B”, “B2A1” and “B2D1” were submitted to the HSA for analysis. Upon analysis, the abovementioned drug exhibits were collectively found to contain not less than 21.21 grams of methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The Accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have methamphetamine in his possession.

11     The Accused was aware that “B1A”, “B1B”, “B2A1” and “B2D1” contained methamphetamine or ‘ice’. He admitted that they belonged to him and were intended for his personal consumption. Further, before the commission of the said offence, the Accused was on 22 March 2001 in Subordinate Court 24, _vide_ DAC-11149-2001, convicted of an offence for the possession of a controlled drug under section 8(a) MDA and sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment. The Accused was thus liable to enhanced punishment under section 33(1) of the MDA.

### Facts relating to the consumption charge (DAC 919537/2020)

12     After his arrest, the Accused provided two bottles of urine sample. The said urine samples were then sent to HSA on 20 September 2019 for analysis. The HSA subsequently issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

13     The Accused admitted to abusing methamphetamine or ‘ice’ alone at his house on the day. Further, before the commission of the said offence, the Accused was on 29 October 2012, in District Court 3, _vide_ DAC-32770-2012, convicted of an offence for the consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punished under section 33(A)(2) of the MDA with 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The Accused was thus liable to be punished under Section 33A(2) of the MDA.

### Facts relating to the charge of failing to report for urine test (DAC 919540/2020)

14     On 15 February 2018, the Accused was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months under a Supervision Order issued under regulation 15(2) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Reg 3) (“MDR”).

15     Pursuant to regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDR, the Accused was required to present himself for a urine test at Ang Mo Kio Police Division every Monday of each month, throughout the period of his supervision from 15 February 2018 to 14 February 2020. However, the Accused failed to present himself for his urine test at Ang Mo Kio Police Division on 16 September 2019 without any valid reason or medical certificate. The Accused had not been reporting for his urine tests since 28 May 2019 till his arrest, as he had started consuming drugs again.

17     For various periods from 1988 to 2018, the Accused was sent to drug rehabilitation centres or placed under drug supervision.

## Mitigation

18     In mitigation, the Accused admitted to his offences and begged for leniency.

## Prosecution’s Position on Sentence

19     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 12 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

20     On the offence of trafficking, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) sought a sentence of 5 to 6 years’ imprisonment. Based on the sentencing matrix in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span>, the indicative starting point for first time drug traffickers in diamorphine up to 3 grams was 5 to 6 years’ imprisonment. Because the quantity involved in the Accused’s case was 2.85 grams of diamorphine, the DPP submitted that a sentence in the higher end of the range would be appropriate. The DPP also highlighted that the Accused had another trafficking charge taken into consideration. She also informed the court that she was not seeking imprisonment in lieu of caning on this charge.

21     For the offence of possession of drug with enhanced penalty, Prosecution sought a sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, stating that this was the Accused’s second conviction for a possession of drug charge which carried an enhanced penalty. The DPP stressed the need for specific deterrence and also drew the Court’s attention to the fact that the Accused had another enhanced possession of drug charge taken into consideration.

22     For the consumption offence, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, a sentence identical to what had been imposed on the Accused in his last conviction in 2012, despite the fact that this was the Accused’s third conviction for long-term 2 (“LT-2”) consumption. The DPP informed the Court that even though an uplift was warranted, they had made a downward adjustment to the sentence they were seeking as they were mindful that the global sentence should not be crushing. As with the trafficking charge, the Prosecution was not seeking imprisonment in lieu of caning.

23     For the Accused’s fourth conviction for failing to present himself for a urine test, the Prosecution asked for a 12 months’ imprisonment term, a slight uplift from the last sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment.

## Decision on Sentence

24     Having considered the charges the Accused was convicted on and his numerous drug-related antecedents, I was of the view that the Prosecution’s sentencing position in respect of each of the charges was more than fair. The sentences sought for by the Prosecution were not excessive or heavy-handed, bearing in mind there was already in place mandatory minimum sentences prescribed under the law for the trafficking, enhanced possession of drug and LT-2 consumption charges. The Accused also had several drug charges taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing.

25     In considering the sentence to be imposed on the trafficking charge, I was of the view that the Accused rightly deserved a sentence closer to 6 years’ imprisonment. He was trafficking in 2.85 grams of diamorphine, an amount close to 3 grams which was the upper limit in the first band of the _Vasentha_ sentencing matrix. Even though the weight of the drugs is not the only consideration when determining the appropriate sentence, the Court in the case of _Vasentha_ made it clear that the quantity of drugs involved in a trafficking charge would have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed since the quantity of drugs would usually be proportionate to the harm and thus be a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence. Further, the Accused admitted to separately trafficking in 3.22 grams of diamorphine contained in 61 packets found in the cleaners’ pantry at Orchid Park Condominium where he worked. 6 years’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence in the circumstances.

26     On the possession charge, I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment from the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years was necessary. This was the Accused’s second conviction of enhanced possession and he also had another charge of enhanced possession taken into consideration for sentencing.

27     As for the charge of consumption (LT-2), this was the Accused’s third LT-2 offence. In his last conviction in 2012, he received a sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. Even though the Prosecution was not seeking a higher sentence, I was of the view that given his recalcitrance, the Accused was deserving of a sentence of at least 8 years imprisonment on this charge.

28     Turning to the offence of failing to report for urine test, the maximum punishment prescribed for this offence was 4 years’ imprisonment. This was the Accused’s fourth conviction for failing to report for urine test. He was last sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment in 2012. I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances, bearing in mind that the Accused also had two other charges of failing to report for urine test taken into consideration.

## Aggregate Sentence

29     I was minded to order the sentences in the trafficking charge and the LT-2 consumption charge to run consecutively. The aggregate sentence would have been 14 years’ imprisonment.

30     However, to ensure that the aggregate sentence was not crushing or excessive, I decided to calibrate the sentence on the trafficking charge downwards and to impose only the mandatory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment. Similarly, on the LT-2 consumption offence, I adopted the Prosecution’s sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. Thus, in summary, the sentences which I eventually imposed were as follows:-

31     The serious drug offences of trafficking and LT-2 consumption each carried mandatory minimum sentences of 5 years and 7 years imprisonment. The sentence the Accused should expect to serve on the charges he pleaded guilty to would at least be 12 years’ imprisonment.

32     Despite the numerous drug charges he faced in these proceedings and his long list of drug antecedents, the eventual aggregate sentence imposed was only 6 months above the minimum sentence the Accused could have received. In addition, the Accused had been spared caning, which would ordinarily have been imposed along with the sentences on the trafficking and consumption charges (each of which carried a minimum number of strokes), had he been below 50 years old. The Accused just turned 50 years old in August 2020. This fact would not have eluded the Accused since he had suffered caning for his last LT-2 consumption of drug offence.

33     In light of the above, the sentence imposed on the Accused, though long, cannot be said in any way to be manifestly excessive or crushing.
