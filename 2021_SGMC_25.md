Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Goods and Services Tax Act Cap 117A, 2005 Rev Ed – Proposed Sentencing Framework

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9019/2021/01-02\].

26 April 2021

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was the sole proprietor of two businesses, Wah Ye Advertising (Wah Yee) and Little Box Event and Exhibition Printing (Little Box). Both entities were in the manufacture of builders’ carpentry, joinery and advertising printing. The Accused wilfully with intent to evade tax had excluded certain sales transactions of the businesses and, thereby, omitted the GST input tax of the transaction from her GST returns.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to three charges for offences s 62(1)(b) punishable under s 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA). I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment, and I imposed the statutorily mandated penalty of $323,733.33. The primary issue in this case was whether the Court should adopt a new sentencing framework set out by the Prosecution for tax evasion offences under the GSTA.

3       The Accused and the Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence have appealed. The Accused is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Charges

4       The details of the three charges are as follows:

>      **MSC 902209 of 2020**

>     You, Pua Om Tee, are charged that you on or about 25th day of October 2014, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of Wah Ye Advertising (ROB XXX), and Little Box Event & Exhibition Printing (ROB XXX), did, wilfully with intent to evade tax, make false entries in your Goods and Services Tax F5 Return for the accounting period, 1 July 2014 to 30 September 2014 (both dates inclusive) by not accounting for standard-rated supplies of $306,769, which resulted in the undercharging of tax amounting to $29,928.95 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A), punishable under Section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the said Act.

>      **MSC 902211 of 2020**

>     You, Pua Om Tee, are charged that you on or about 31st day of October 2015, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of Wah Ye Advertising (ROB XXX), and Little Box Event & Exhibition Printing (ROB XXX), did, wilfully with intent to evade tax, make false entries in your Goods and Services Tax F5 Return for the accounting period, 1 July 2015 to 30 September 2015 (both dates inclusive) by not accounting for standard-rated supplies of $380,069 which resulted in the undercharging of tax amounting to $28,751.90 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A), punishable under Section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the said Act.

>      **MSC 902212 of 2020**

>     You, Pua Om Tee, are charged that you on or about 30th day of January 2016, in Singapore, being the sole proprietor of Wah Ye Advertising (ROB XXX), and Little Box Event & Exhibition Printing (ROB XXX), did, wilfully with intent to evade tax, make false entries in your Goods and Services Tax F5 Return for the accounting period, 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2015 (both dates inclusive) by not accounting for standard-rated supplies of $574,515, which resulted in the undercharging of tax amounting to $49,230.26 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 62(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A), punishable under Section 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the said Act.

## Facts

5       The Accused is Pua Om Tee, a 59-year-old female Singaporean Citizen. The Accused had engaged one Ong Kok Beng (Ong) as a part-time bookkeeper to handle the business accounts and tax matters for Wah Ye and Little Box.

6       Between 2013 and 2016, The Accused instructed Ong to exclude certain transactions of Wah Ye and Little Box from the quarterly GST F5 returns. Ong made the adjustments and excluded selected supplies, and the consequent output tax, from the Accused’s GST F5 returns for three quarterly periods from 1 April 2013 to September 2016. After Ong made the adjustments the Accused had approved the figures and Ong filed the GST F5 returns on behalf of the Accused.

7       As a result of the adjustments and exclusions the Accused’s GST returns for three quarterly period, 1 July to 30 September 2014, 1 July to 30 September 2015 and 1 October to 31 December 2015 contained false entries as they reflected the adjusted GST figures rather than the actual GST figures. Over these three periods the total value of supplies omitted was $1,261,353 and, as a result, the GST undercharged was $107,911.11[^1].

## Charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing

8       The Accused admitted to and consented for another eight charges for offences under s 62(1)(b) punishable under s 62(1)(i) and (ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA) being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (TIC charges).

## Issues to be determined

9       The issues to be determined in this case are as follows:

> (a)     Did the case of _Chng Gim Huat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR (R) 360</span> establish a sentencing benchmark for GSTA offences?

> (b)     Whether I should adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in determining the appropriate sentences for the ITA offences.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

10     The s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offence is punishable, under s 62(1)(ii), with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to both. In addition, the Court is obliged , under s 62(1)(i) of the GSTA, to impose a mandatory penalty of three times the amount of tax which has or would have been undercharged.

### Antecedents

11     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

12     The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment should be imposed for charges MSC 902209 (tax undercharged of $29,298.95) and 902211 of 2020 (tax undercharged of $28,751.90) and a sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment for charge MSC 902212 of 2020 (tax undercharged of $49,230.26). The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment.

13     The Prosecution stated that it had previously submitted for the adoption of a proposed sentencing framework (PSF) for offences of income tax evasion under s 96(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, Rev Ed 2014) (ITA). In _PP v Lam Allan_ (SC-910273-2018) and _PP v Ng Wee Kheng_ (SC-906871-2019), the District Judge had adopted the Prosecution’s PSF. The Prosecution also submitted that in _PP v Yeo Soh Khim_ (SC-911176-2019) for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA the Court had also adopted the Prosecution’s PSF for GSTA offences.

14     The Prosecution highlighted that the State Courts’ had been taking reference from the case of _Chng Gim Huat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 360</span> to calibrate the appropriate sentences for tax evasion offences and that the sentences imposed post-_Chng Gim Huat_ did not utilise the full sentencing range under section 96(1) of the ITA as there had been a clustering of sentences at the very low end of the range. In _Ng Wee Kheng_ and _Lam Allan_, the court had accepted this and taken guidance from the Prosecution’s PSF when sentencing offences under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA.

15     The Prosecution, submitted that sentences for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences had, similarly, not utilised the full sentencing range (which was up to a maximum of seven years’ imprisonment). It was pointed out that sentences for s 62(1)(b) offences had ranged from between one weeks’ and 12 months’ imprisonment and that this meant that only 14.3% of the sentencing range of seven years imprisonment had been utilised.

16     Having analysed the various sentencing approaches highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ \[2007\] 2 SLR 449, the Prosecution submitted that it would be appropriate to adopt a PSF based on the _R v Taueki_ \[2005\] 3 NZLR 372 methodology of using a two-staged approach that gave heed to both offence and offender-specific factors.

17     The Prosecution’s PSF was anchored in a harm-culpability analysis and it was proposed that a five-step framework based on the approach in _Logachev Vladislay v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> as follows:

> (a)     Step 1: Identifying the level of harm and culpability of the offender. The Prosecution submitted that the primary determinant of harm in such cases was the **quantum of GST evaded**. The Prosecution proposed the following table listing out the factors affecting harm and culpability:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.58%"> <col width="49.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence-specific factor (non-exhaustive)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Factors going towards harm</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.

The offender’s role vis-à-vis other co-offenders</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">E.g. whether the offender was the mastermind or a mere employee / accomplice following the mastermind.

Abuse of position and breach of trust</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">E.g. did the offender breach any position of trust (e.g. directorship, client confidentiality) to commit the offending act?</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Step 2: Identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range. The Prosecution proposed a harm-culpability matrix should be utilised to determine the indicative starting sentence, as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.7150569886023%"> <col width="25.0949810037992%"> <col width="25.0949810037992%"> <col width="25.0949810037992%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 1 Harm (below $75,000 evaded)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 2 Harm (between $75,000 to $150,000 evaded)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 3 Harm (above $150,000 evaded)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 14 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14 to 28 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 to 42 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14 to 28 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 to 42 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">42 to 56 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 to 42 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">42 to 56 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">56 to 84 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)     Step 3: Identifying the starting point within the indicative sentencing range.

> (d)     Step 4: Adjusting the starting point to consider offender-specific mitigating and aggravating factors. The Prosecution proposed that the Court consider the following non-exhaustive factors:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.02%"> <col width="49.98%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific mitigating factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific aggravating factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pleaded guilty</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Relevant antecedents</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cooperation with the authorities</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TIC charges</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender’s remorse</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lack of remorse</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Personal circumstances of the offender</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Taking active steps to avoid detection / thwart investigations</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (e)     Step 5: Adjustment to the sentence to consider the one transaction rule and the totality principle.

18     Applying the PSF to the current case, the Prosecution submitted that based on the level of GST evaded (ranging between $28,751.90 and $49,230.86) and in view of absence of other factors going towards harm, the harm in the present case would be “Level 1 harm”. In relation to the Accused’s culpability, the Prosecution submitted that her culpability was low as there was little planning or premeditation on the Accused’s part, that the _modus operandi_ of the offences was not particularly sophisticated and did not involve obfuscation or falsification of source documents. The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentencing range would be a sentence of imprisonment up to 14 months’ imprisonment.

19     The Prosecution submitted that the appropriate starting point for the sentences for the proceeded charges were as follows:

> (a)     MSC-902209-2019 (GST evaded: $29,928.95): 18 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)     MSC-902211-2019 (GST evaded: $28,751.90): 17 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (c)     MSC-902212-2019 (GST evaded: $49,230.86): 30 weeks’ imprisonment.

20     At step four, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused had consented to eight similar charges being TIC’ed and that this should be taken as an aggravating factor. The Prosecution accepted as mitigating that the Accused had pleaded guilty, was remorseful, had cooperated with the authorities and that she had not antecedents. As such, the Prosecution proposed that the court impose a 50% discount to starting point sentences and submitted for the sentences at paragraph \[12\] above.

21     The Prosecution submitted that two of the sentences should run consecutively and that a global sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment (approximately six months’ imprisonment) would not fall foul of either the one transaction rule or the totality principle.

### Mitigation

22     The Defence submitted that sentences of three weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $3,000 should be imposed on the Accused for each of the proceeded charges and for a global sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $9,000.

23     The Defence referred to _Chng Gim Huat_ and submitted that both the Prosecution and the courts had been guided by the sentence meted out in that case and, as a result, had imposed sentences ranging between three weeks’ and one month for GST evasion offences. The Defence referred to the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents for section 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences[^2] and that the statistics demonstrated that sentences had tended to cluster at the very low end of the sentencing range.

24     The Defence submitted that the District Court was bound by the sentences imposed in precedent cases, especially precedents from a higher court, to give effect to the principles of respect and sentencing consistency. The Defence submitted that the proper course for the court to take if it disagreed with the current sentencing precedents established by _Chng Gim Huat_ would be to express disagreement with the decision and suggest that the sentencing framework should be reconsidered by the High Court.

25     In _Loon Wai Yang v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 34</span>, the offender had appealed against his conviction and sentence on five charges for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA. The Prosecution had filed a cross-appeal against sentence. On appeal, the offender was acquitted on four of the five charges. For the fifth charge, for which the conviction was upheld, Chua Lee Meng J upheld the District Court judge’s sentence of three weeks imprisonment for an offence where the offender evaded GST in the amount of $41,252.65. Based on this precedent, the Defence submitted that the individual sentences for the three charges proceeded against the Accused should not exceed three weeks’ per charge.

26     The Defence submitted that the Prosecutions PSF was arbitrary as the level of harm appeared to be determined solely by reference to the amount of tax evaded and that other factors that would have an effect on the harm, such as the involvement of a syndicate or a transnational element, had not been factored into the framework. The Defence submitted that whilst the sentence bands may have been appropriate the assignment of $75,000 tax evaded as the upper limit for level 1 harm appeared arbitrary.

27     Finally, the Defence submitted that the imposition of sentences far above the norm that had been imposed by the Courts since _Chng Gim Huat_ would be contrary to the Accused’s legitimate expectations. Based on the Prosecution’s submissions the sentences to be imposed on the Accused would represent a fivefold increase, i.e. from three weeks’ to four months’ imprisonment, and this would be a very significant change from the sentencing benchmarks. Therefore, the Defence submitted that even if the PSF was proper, it should not be applied to the Accused as it would breach her legitimate expectations that her offences would warrant a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment for each of the charge.

28     The Defence confirmed that the Accused had made full restitution of the tax undercharged prior to her pleading guilty.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

29     The relevant provision of the GSTA is as follows:

> **62.** – (1)    Any person who wilfully with intent to evade or to assist any other person to evade tax –

>> …

>> (_b_)    makes any false statement or entry in any return, claim or application made under this Act;

>> …

>     shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction –

>> (i)    pay a penalty assessed under section 48 of three times the amount of tax which was or would have been undercharged in consequence of the offence or which would have been undercharged if the offence had not been detected; and

>> (ii)   be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.

#### Does Chng Gim Huat establish a sentencing benchmark for s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences?

30     I found that neither _Chng Gim Huat_ nor _Loon Wai Yang_ established sentencing benchmarks for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA. Turning first to _Chng Gim Huat_, the offence being considered was income tax evasion under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA. The Appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had not been charged with offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA. I noted that the maximum sentence of imprisonment for offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA, up to three years imprisonment, and for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA, up to seven years imprisonment, were vastly different. In view of the disparity between the maximum sentences of imprisonment, I found that if _Chng Gim Huat_ had established a benchmark sentence that that would have to be confined to offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA and could not establish a benchmark for offences under section 62(1)(b) of the GSTA.

31     In any case, I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not establish a benchmark, even for section 96(1)(b) offences. I had made this finding in a number of cases, in particular, _Public Prosecutor v Tan Song Cheng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 50</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Lin Shaohua_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 53</span> (both cases are pending the High Court’s decision). In _Abu Syed Chowdhury_ Yong CJ, at \[15\] stated:

>     “A “benchmark” is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides **the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined.** A good “benchmark” decision therefore lays down **carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the “norm”, and what exceptional situations justify a departure from it**”.

\[ **Emphasis added**\]

32     I found that for a decision to create a benchmark sentence it should meet the following two criteria, namely, that (1) the benchmark should provide a focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases **with differing degrees of culpability** can be determined. I found that the bolded phrase is the key requirement in that sentences should differ depending on the relative culpability of the offender vis-à-vis the benchmark sentence.

33     That (2) the benchmark should **lay down the parameters of its reasoning** so that future judges would be able to determine what falls within the norm of a benchmark and when to depart from it. I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not encapsulate these criteria.

34     The appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed for offences of tax evasion under section 96(1) ITA. Yong CJ disagreed with the appellant’s submission that he should be sentenced to a fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment. Yong CJ stated that the public interest was significant in tax evasion cases as the offences “were grave and were tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State” and that the offences affect society as a whole resulting in the State’s revenue having to be made up by other taxpayers. In addition, he found tax evasion offences were often difficult to detect and as such he held that “a custodial sentence should normally be imposed in order to meet the needs of general deterrence”: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\].

35     The appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had with wilful intent to evade tax omitted to include a sum of $290,000 from his income tax return for YA1995 and a sum of $1,024.000 from his income tax return for YA1996, resulting in a global tax undercharged of $354,645.65 for the two YAs. Yong CJ allowed the Appellant’s appeal against sentence and reduced the sentences imposed by the Magistrate to one months’ imprisonment for the first charge and two months’ imprisonment for the second charge.

36     As I stated in _Tan Song Cheng_ and _Lin Shaohua_, I found that Yong CJ had clearly stated that custodial sentences should be the norm for offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA, nonetheless I found that Yong CJ had not established a sentencing benchmark. He had not explicitly stated in _Chng Gim Huat_ that the decision should be utilised as a sentencing benchmark.

37     Yong CJ had highlighted that sentencing considerations for offences under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA would include the level of premeditation, the quantum of tax evaded and the offender’s role in the offence: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[110\] and \[111\]. However, he did not lay down parameters to determine how the harm caused by such offences should be calibrated nor did he list out factors that would affect an offender’s degree of culpability or the interplay between the harm caused and the culpability of the offender in determining the appropriate sentence. As such, I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not provide a focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases could take reference from.

38     Whilst _Chng Gim Huat_ did not establish a benchmark for offences under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA, let alone under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA, I found that a court could take guidance from the case in determining the appropriate sentence based on the fact that a custodial sentence should be the norm for income tax evasion and, by extension, for GST evasion offences.

39     Yong CJ had also referred to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision in _AG v Ma Lai Wu_ \[1987\] HKLR 744 as providing useful guidance on the factors to be considered in deciding on the appropriate sentence for tax evasion offences: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[108\]. Silke JA held in _Ma Lai Wu_ at \[747D – 747G\]:

>     “… We think that, in Hong Kong, … sentences of immediate custodial imprisonment should in future be imposed in the appropriate cases.

>      _It is necessary for a court to take into consideration when assessing the quantum of such sentence – and this list is not intended to be exhaustive –_ **_the time span of the offences, the systems and methods used to evade tax, where or not there was re-payment of the tax evaded, the amount of tax, the individual culpability of one or more defendants and the circumstances of each defendant_**”

\[ **Emphasis added**\]

40     I found that these factors would equally be applicable when determining the appropriate sentence for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA.

41     In _Loon Wai Yang_, Chua J had affirmed the District Court’s sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment for an offence under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA involving GST evaded amounting to approximately $41,000. It would appear from the decision that the Prosecution had discontinued their appeal against sentence[^3] and, in relation to the Appellant’s appeal against sentence, Chua J held, at \[49 to 50\]:

> “49    As for the fifth charge, the DJ had sentenced the Appellant to three weeks’ imprisonment. … the amount of GST refund had been overstated by $41,252.65 …

> 50    Before me, the Appellant accepted (in my view, correctly) that the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the fifth charge was not manifestly excessive. … I therefore dismissed the appeal against sentence in respect of the fifth charge.”

42     As it would appear that the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence had been discontinued, Chua J would not have considered whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Chua J did not address the principles or factors to be applied when sentencing offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA, nor did he set out a sentencing framework. As such, I found that _Loon Wai Yang_ did not establish a sentencing benchmark that would bind lower the lower courts. As _Loon Wai Yang_ did not establish a benchmark sentence I did not think that I would be offending against the principle of respect, referred to by the Defence (see paragraph \[24\] above), by declining to follow _Loon Wai Yang_ in imposing sentences of three weeks’ imprisonment for each of the three charges against the Accused.

#### Should the court adopt the Prosecution’s PSF?

##### (1)   Is there consistency in the sentences imposed for s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA offences in past cases?

43     As with my findings in _Tan Song Cheng_ and _Lin Shaohua_ with regard to offences under s 96(1)(b of the ITA, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that there was a need to re-consider how sentences for section 62(1)(b) of the GST were calibrated and it would be timely for the High Court to provide guidance on sentences for these offences.

44     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents comprising 50 prosecutions under section 62(1)(b) from 2004 to 2019[^4]. Sentences imposed for the s 62(1)(b) offences ranged from a low of two weeks’ to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge. However, there did not appear to be a correlation between the length of the custodial sentence and the quantum of GST evaded or, to a lesser extent, the offender’s level of culpability.

45     In _PP v Chua Swee Kian Magdalene_ (IRA-Sum Nos 56-96 of 2004)[^5] the offender was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $8,370. The offender had created false purchases and sales to foreign companies to support her claims. By comparison, offenders who had evaded larger GST amounts and had comparable or greater culpability were sentenced to relatively lighter terms of imprisonment. For example:

> (a)     In _PP v Tang Wai Kay_ (IRA-Sum Nos 1-49 of 2006)[^6], the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $64,933.43. The offender had forged invoices to mislead IRAS and had also not cooperated with IRAS over two years of the investigation. Based on the quantum of tax evaded and the offender’s culpability it would appear that the offender’s sentence was light in comparison to _Chau Swee Kian Magdalene._

> (b)     In _PP v Muhamad Sazali Bin Mohd Salleh_ (IRA-Sum Nos. 000169 – 000172 of 2009)[^7], the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $57,231.57. The offender had set up a sham business with the sole intention of using the business to perpetuate GST fraud. The offender was also uncooperative with the IRAS during the investigation. Similarly, in view of the quantum of tax evaded and the offender’s culpability it would appear that the offender’s sentence was light in comparison to _Chau Swee Kian Magdalene._

> (c)     In _PP v Seow Ming Liang_ (IRA-Sum Nos 000107 – 000110-MSC-2012)[^8], the offender was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $35,670.39. The offender had created fictitious purchase invoices to support the offence. The amount of tax evaded was over four times greater than the amount in _Chau Swee Kian Magdalene_ and yet the offender in this case was sentenced to a far more lenient sentence. I found that there was clear inconsistency in the sentences.

> (d)     In _PP v Chia Puay Yeoh_ (IRA-Sum Nos. 342-344, 346, 349-350, 352-355-MSC-2013)[^9], the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $40,905.57. The offender was the mastermind behind a “complex GST scam” that used multiple shell companies. Similarly, I found that in terms of the GST evaded and the culpability of the offender this case was far more egregious but that the sentence was relatively light when compared _Chau Swee Kian Magdalene_.

46     The conclusion that I drew from the cases tendered in the Prosecution’s table of precedents was that, in terms of the relative culpability and harm, there is a lack of consistency in the sentences, that have been imposed since 2004. The Prosecution tendered a graph of the sentences against the quantum of GST evaded[^10]. The table starkly shows how there has been a lack of correlation between the length of custodial sentences and the amount of GST evaded.

47     For instance, a similar sentence of five months’ imprisonment was imposed in both _PP v Li Xiangqing_ (SC-908320-2017 & Others)[^11] for evading GST amounting $1,044 and in _PP v Shyam Lekhraj Bhojwani_ (IRA-Sum Nos. 50-55 of 2006) for evading GST amounting to $235,692.55. Whilst there were clearly differences in the level of culpability between the offenders in these two cases, the huge amount of GST evaded in _Shyam Lekhraj Bhojwani_ would have warranted a far lengthier sentence when compared with the other precedents.

48     Thus, I agreed that there should be the development of a sentencing framework that would lay down the principles to be used in determining the appropriate sentence and which would utilise the full sentencing range available for offences under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA.

##### (2)   Utilising the full sentencing spectrum

49     In _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span>, Menon CJ held at \[59\] as follows:

>     “… It is trite that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence and that the sentencing judge ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> (“Angliss”) at \[86\]. Put another way, **the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence**: see _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> at \[24\].”

\[ **Emphasis mine**\]

50     The maximum sentence of imprisonment for an offence under s 62(1)(b) of the GSTA is seven years’ imprisonment. It was immediately clear from the Prosecution’s graph of sentences that the full sentencing spectrum has not been utilised[^12]. The longest sentences that have been imposed have been sentences of 12 months’ and 18 months’ imprisonment.

#### Prosecution’s PSF

51     The appropriate forum for the adoption of the Prosecution’s PSF is the High Court. However, I was also of the view that as reliance on past-precedents to calibrate sentences for offences under s 62(1)(b) was inadequate that I could take guidance from the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in terms of the principle to be applied to determining an offender’s culpability and the level of harm of the offence. This was similar to the approach that I took in _Tan Song Cheng_ and _Lin Shaohua_ with the exception that, in the present case, I did not accept the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing matrix (see Step 2 at paragraph \[17(b)\] above) as I found that a sentence up to 14 months’ imprisonment where there is a low culpability and low harm appeared to be overly severe.

52     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the calibration of the appropriate sentences should be based on a harm-culpability analysis. I agreed with the factors that the Prosecution proposed should be considered with regard to harm and culpability. With regard to harm, I found that the primary harm caused by GST evasion was the deprivation of revenue due to the public coffers and the consequent loss that would arise as the tax could not be used for the benefit of society as a whole. The lost revenue would have to be made up by other taxpayers: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\].

53     However, I did find that whilst the quantum of tax evaded was the primary consideration in the level of harm caused by the offence, there should also be a consideration of the other harm factors, namely, whether the offence was syndicated, whether it was transnational or whether it undermined the Government. If these factors were absent, then the level of harm caused by the offence should similarly be adjusted downwards. I accepted the Prosecution’s list of factors affecting culpability.

54     Based on the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents, it would appear that, based on a consideration of the GST evaded alone, the vast majority of charges for GST evasion under s 62(1)(b) would fall under level 1 harm on the proposed sentencing matrix. If, using the PSF, an offender was assessed to have low culpability and the offence involved level 1 harm, the possible sentence would nonetheless be up to 14 months’ imprisonment. As such, even for offences involving a relatively low level of GST evaded lengthy sentences of imprisonment would be the norm using the proposed matrix.

55     As such, I agreed with the Defence submission that pegging level 1 harm at GST evaded of $75,000 and below appeared to be arbitrary and would result in very stiff imprisonment sentences. In my opinion, it would have been preferrable to increase the quantum of GST evaded for a finding of level 1 harm.

56     I noted that the Prosecution’s application of the PSF would appear to acknowledge that the sentences to be imposed on the Accused calibrated after using the PSF would be harsh. For MSC-902212-2020, involving GST evaded amounting to $49,230.26, the Prosecution submitted that, based on level 1 harm and low culpability, the starting sentence should be 30 weeks’ imprisonment. A starting sentence of 30 weeks’ imprisonment would be approximately at the midway point of the range of up to 14 months’ imprisonment. A sentence of 30 weeks imprisonment would be far in excess of sentences imposed for the vast majority of precedents involving similar sums of tax evaded.

57     As stated above, the Prosecution appeared to have acknowledge this because they proposed a 50% reduction in the starting sentence after considering offender-specific factors, i.e. for MSC-902212-2020 the Prosecution proposed a sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment. I failed to see the justification in imposing a 50% discount after balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors. The mitigating factors, except for the fact that the Accused had made full restitution of the tax evaded, were not so remarkable as to warrant a 50% discount to the starting sentence, especially in light of the fact that there were 8 TIC charges. I inferred that the Prosecution proposed such a high discount because an application of the sentencing matrix would give rise to overly harsh sentences against the Accused.

58     For these reasons, in particular that I found that the sentencing matrix at Step 2 would result in very stiff sentences, I declined to apply the Prosecution's PSF.

#### The Appropriate sentence

59     I found that the Accused’s culpability was low. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was little planning or premeditation on the Accused’s part, that her method of evading GST was not particularly sophisticated and that her offences did not involve falsification of source documents. Based on the quantum of tax evaded and the Accused’s culpability I found that the following precedents were instructive:

> (a)      _Tang Wai Kay_ (see paragraph \[45(a)\] above): the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for evading GST amounting to $64,933.43. I found that this case was more egregious than the present case in terms of the quantum of GST evaded as well as the offender’s culpability. As such, I found that the sentences for the charges faced by the Accused should not exceed three months’ imprisonment.

> (b)      _Muhamad Sazali Bin Mohd Salleh_ (see paragraph \[45(b)\] above): similarly I found that in terms of both the quantum of GST evaded and the culpability of the offender this precedent was more egregious than the present case.

> (c)     In _PP v Tang Ee Boon_ (IRA Sum Nos. 000039-000041 & Others of 2010), for one of the charges the offender had evaded GST amounting to $34,472.94 and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for that charge. The offender’s culpability, based on the details in the table of precedents, was, like the Accused in the present case, low. As such, I found that the sentence imposed in this precedent was instructive in determining the sentence to imposed against the Accused.

> (d)      _Chia Puay Yeoh_ (see paragraph \[45(d)\] above), the offender had a far higher level of culpability as compared to the Accused. The offender had been involved in a complex GST scam, had carried out his scheme using multiple companies and had enlisted the help of accomplices to carry out the scam. As such, I found that the individual sentences to be imposed for the charges faced by the Accused should not exceed the three months’ imposed in _Chia Puay Yeoh_.

> (e)      _Loon Wai Yang_: I found that although the quantum of GST evaded of $41,252.65 was comparable with the quantum of GST evaded by the Accused, I found that the sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Loon Wai Yang_ to be low and not in keeping with the sentences in the precedent cases.

##### (1)   The sentence

60     In assessing the appropriate sentence I considered that there were eight TIC charges. The TIC charges disclosed that the Accused had started evading GST from July 2013 and that her offending continued until October 2016. This was a considerable period of time. The total GST evaded (including the TIC charges) was $226,902.56 and this was not an insignificant amount. I found that the TIC charges would warrant an uplift in the sentence.

61     With regards to mitigation, I gave credit to the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the first possible opportunity and that this was indicative of her remorse. I also gave credit to the fact that the Accused was a first-time offender, that she had cooperated with IRAS in its investigations and, significantly, that she had repaid fully the evaded GST.

62     Taking into account the quantum of tax evaded, the Accused’s culpability and the aggravating and mitigation factors I found that the appropriate sentences would be eight weeks’ imprisonment for MSC-902212-2020 (GST evaded of $49,230.26) and six weeks’ imprisonment for MSC-902209-2020 (GST evaded of $29,928.85) and for MSC-902211-2020 (GST evaded of 428,751.90). I ordered that MSC-902212-2020 and MSC 902209-2020 should run consecutively. The global sentence I imposed was 14 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

63     I found that a global sentence of 14 weeks’ imprisonment for the GSTA offences was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.

64     Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
