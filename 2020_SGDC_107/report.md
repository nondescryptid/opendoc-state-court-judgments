Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9072/2020/01.\]

4 May 2020

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was convicted after a trial on a single charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon under Section 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“Penal Code”). The Accused was sentenced to 3 years and 3 months of imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The sentence of imprisonment was backdated to the first day of his remand – 2 October 2018. He is currently serving his sentence. The Accused has filed an appeal through prison against sentence only. He was represented at trial by a counsel engaged under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.

## Charge

2       The Accused was found guilty of the charge in DAC 932623/2018 which reads:

> “You, THANGAMUTHU MAHARAJAN, male/36 years old, are charged that you, on 13 May 2018, at or about 11.39 p.m., at Apt Blk 190 Woodlands Industrial Park E7, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Kalaivanan Sathish Kumar, by means of a glass beer bottle, an instrument which, when used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, to wit, by smashing the glass beer bottle against the abovementioned Kalaivanan Sathish Kumar’s head, causing him to sustain a permanent facial scar, parotid gland and duct injury, and long-term partial facial nerve palsy, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

3       The Accused did not have any criminal record in Singapore.

## Facts

4       The Accused is Thangamuthu Maharajan, a 36-year-old male Indian National. He was a construction worker in Singapore before being charged and remanded for the offence in this case. The victim was an acquaintance of the Accused and was also a construction worker from India.

5       In the evening of Sunday, 13 May 2018, both of them were with other acquaintances having alcoholic drinks at the Woodlands Recreation Centre. A dispute arose over the Accused borrowing money from a friend of the victim to buy more drinks. The victim had expressed unhappiness at the manner by which the Accused had demanded more money from the friend. The Accused was upset at the victim’s interference.

6       Later the same night, the Accused, in a drunken state, took a beer bottle and hit the victim on his head from behind. The beer bottle broke and caused a deep cut on the left side of the face and the left ear of the victim. It resulted in a heavy loss of blood. The Accused ran away after hitting the victim.

7       The victim sought help at a nearby security guardhouse and was conveyed by ambulance to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. The Accused also surrendered at the security guardhouse and was arrested by the police.

8       Dr Deborah Lim of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, who had examined the victim, stated in her medical reports that the victim had suffered the following injuries as a result of the incident:

> (a)     A left facial laceration complicated by left 7th cranial nerve injury and parotid gland and duct injury (Medical Report dated 30 June 2018 at \[a\]).

> (b)     Deep left facial laceration with facial nerve involvement requiring facial nerve repair using nerve graft on 14 May 2018.

> (c)     The left facial laceration was at the preauricular location, around 7 cm curvilinear laceration that was deep. Laceration was going through the parotid gland and posterior part of masseter muscle, and the mandible was exposed (Medical Report dated 15 August 2018 at \[a\]).

> (d)     There will be long term partial facial nerve palsy. There is a risk of recurrent parotid gland infection in the future (Medical Report dated 15 August 2018 at \[e\]).

9       Dr Deborah Lim was of the opinion that “there is a potential for permanent facial nerve damage resulting in asymmetry of the face and impairment of function of muscles of the left face. Also, there is potential for left parotid salivary gland dysfunction.” (Medical Report dated 24 May 2018 at \[b\]).

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

10     The Prosecution submitted that the dominant sentencing principles in this case are deterrence and retribution. The DPP put forth the following in support of this point:

> (a)     There is no place for violence in any civilised society.

> (b)     It is necessary to ensure that the Accused learns never to take matters into his own hands, whatever disagreements he might have with others.

> (c)     The harm inflicted on the victim was severe.

11     The Prosecution sought for a sentence of at least three and a half years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The DPP highlighted the seriousness of the injuries suffered, emphasizing the long-term impact caused to the victim. The DPP cited the relevant sentencing case precedents to support his proposed sentence for the court’s consideration.

### Mitigation plea

12     The defence counsel sought an imprisonment term of not more than 2 years. In the written plea in mitigation, the Accused maintained that he had nothing to do with the injuries suffered by the victim. The defence counsel submitted that the Accused was a first offender and accepted that he must be punished. The Accused pleaded for leniency in sentencing.

13     The defence counsel cited two case precedents – _PP v Victor Samuel_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 470</span> and _PP v Ravindran Annamalai_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 77</span>. The case of _PP v Ravindran Annamalai_ was an inappropriate case for comparison since the offences and facts (involving rape, attempted murder and voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon under Section 324 of the Penal Code) were highly distinguishable. As for _PP v Victor Samuel_, although it is also a case under Section 326 Penal Code, the victim there suffered less serious injuries than the vicitm of our case. The victim there suffered a fracture on his arm while the victim in the present case suffered a life-threatening injury to a vulnerable part of his person that also left him with a permanent scar on his face.

## Sentence

### The governing sentencing principles

14     I agreed with the DPP that the consideration of the sentence to be passed in this case called into play the sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution. Section 326 Penal Code provides that:

> “Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, voluntarily causes grievous hurt by means of any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting, or any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or any heated substance, or by means of any poison or any corrosive substance, or by means of any explosive substance, or by means of any substance which it is deleterious to the human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by means of any animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.”

15     The offence is punishable with imprisonment for life or up to 15 years and caning. The seriousness of the offence is clearly reflected in the length and type of punishment provided for it. The elements of the offence are the grievous nature of the injuries caused and the use of a weapon or harmful means to cause the grievous hurt.

16     The severity of the grievous hurt caused, the nature of the weapon used and the manner of inflicting the injuries are the principal sentencing factors for this offence committed by the Accused and the key determinants of the punishment to be meted out in this case.

### The calibration of the sentence

17     The critical factor for the severity of the sentence passed in this case was clearly the very serious injuries caused. Beyond the pain and suffering at the time of the inflicting of the injuries and soon thereafter during the medical procedures and healing process, there is permanent scarring of the face and other disabilities affecting the parotid glands and long term partial facial nerve palsy.

18     Taking guidance from the Court of Appeal case of _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“the _BDB_ case”) in sentencing cases of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, the indicative starting points are based on the seriousness of the injury caused to the victim. The Court of Appeal indicated that the starting point for death should be 8 years and for a case of multiple fractures (of the ribs and limbs) on the body of a young victim of 4 years old, the starting point should be 3 years and 6 months. Where death is caused, the sentence of caning should be at least 12 strokes and for non-fatal serious injuries, a sentence of between 6 and 12 strokes of the cane may be considered.

19     The indicative starting point is to be adjusted for the offender’s culpability that is based on the assessment of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. In the present case, the following aggravating and mitigating factors were considered:

> (a)     The use of the glass bottle that broke and caused the serious injuries, this being an offence under Section 326 of the Penal Code for causing grievous hurt with a weapon.

> (b)     The lack of remorse in the face of the overwhelming evidence and the casting of aspersions on the witnesses.

> (c)     On the other hand, the initial surrender of the Accused to the police at the security guardhouse and his subsequent confessions to the police and a friend, revealed some sense of guilt and regret.

> (d)     The absence of any criminal record.

20     Based on the sentencing precedents cited by the DPP, I accepted his submissions of 3 years’ imprisonment as the starting point for the serious injuries caused, as can be seen from the medical reports of Dr Deborah Lim. The injuries were on a vulnerable part of the body of the victim and had also resulted in permanent scars and disabilities.

21     As for the nature of the weapon used, I disagreed with the DPP on the amount of uplift. The DPP had submitted for a 6-month uplift on the basis that the weapon used was a broken bottle and therefore was a sharp object and capable of significant harm. My view was that the Accused had used a glass beer bottle (as specified in the Charge) that was not broken. However, the bottle shattered on impact that resulted in the lacerations on the side of the face of the victim causing serious harm. Therefore, I had uplifted it by 3 months instead of the 6 months suggested by the DPP.

22     There is no doubt that the Accused deserved to be punished with caning for the pain and suffering he had brought upon the victim. This is in line with the sentencing principle of retribution. As for the number of strokes of caning to be imposed, there is no reason to depart from the guidelines provided by the Court of Appeal in the _BDB_ case. The sentence of 6 strokes of caning is at the lower end of the indicative sentencing range of 6 to 12 strokes of caning for cases of grievous hurt where non-fatal serious injuries had been caused.

## Conclusion

23     The sentence of 3 years and 3 months of imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane would adequately address the sentencing objectives as presented by the facts and circumstances of this case.
