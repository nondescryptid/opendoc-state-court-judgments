He testified that when the Accused surrendered the drug exhibits as stated in exhibit P2 to Sergeant Mohamed Hafiz (PW2), the Accused spoke to PW2 in English and had no difficulty in speaking to PW2.

11     PW2 also testified that when he spoke to the Accused in English, the latter had no difficulty in understanding him.

12     PW3 Silvanus Kolandasamy, a narcotic officer holding the rank of Staff Sergeant also said that he communicated with the Accused in English and that the latter had no difficulty in communicating with him in English.

## Evidence of PW4 Joey Tan Yang Yi

13     At the material time, Joey Tan Yang Yi (PW4) was a narcotic officer holding the rank of Assistant Superintendent attached to the Central Narcotic Bureau. He was the key witness for the Prosecution.

14     PW4 recorded a statement from the Accused. This was admitted in evidence and marked as exhibit P8. The Defence had no objection to its admissibility but took issue as to its accuracy.

15     PW4 testified that the taking of statement exhibit P8 was done in Mandarin as the Accused chose to speak in Mandarin. But it was typed and recorded in English. He also said that the Accused had no difficulty in communicating with him during the recording of the exhibit P8. PW4 confirmed that P8 was recorded accurately. P8 was recorded on 14 Nov 2017 at about 1430 hours and concluded at 1610 hours.

16     Exhibit D1(1-11) containing 4 cautioned statements were recorded on 14 Nov 2017 but after exhibit P8 had been done at 1610 hours on 14 Nov 2017.

17     Exhibit D1 (13-15) was similar to the charge which the Accused claimed trial to, namely, DAC941355/2017 involving the trafficking of one packet of crystalline substance marked “KRANJI”. This cautioned statement (exhibit D1 (13-15) was recorded in Jan 2018. PW4 explained that there was no cautioned statement in respect of the packet labelled as “KRANJI” on 14 Nov 2017 because it was only after further investigation and review of the Accused’s statement at \[28\] of P8 that he realised an offence under s5(1)(a) read with s5(2) of the MDA had been committed.

18     The material portion of \[28\] of exhibit P8 reads: “I was asked why “A1B” has a packet that had a label written “Kranji” on it. I wish to state that as I was cutting down on consuming ‘ice’, I have divided some of the ‘ice’ in my possession with the intention to give it to my other friends. I labelled one of the packets “Kranji” to indicate that I am giving it to a friend. I do not wish to divulge the identity of this friend.” This would constitute drug trafficking as defined by the Misuse of Drugs Act.

19     PW4 was subjected to extensive cross-examination regarding the recording of the material portion of \[28\] in exhibit P8.

20     I found PW4 to be forthright in answering. He was also challenged by counsel on his Chinese proficiency in open court as to what he said in Mandarin on this aspect of the statement to the Accused. There was no indication that PW4 was not proficient in Mandarin.

21     PW4 candidly testified that he cannot recall exactly in Mandarin the Accused’s answer to the question posed by PW4 relating to \[28\] of P8. But PW4 was certain that the Accused had stated that “he labelled one of the packets this “KRANJI” because he wanted to give it to a friend.” On clarification as to whether “KRANJI” was a person, the Accused said “he does not want to tell me who ‘Kranji’ was.” See Day 1 NE at pages 44 - 45.

22     After reviewing the whole case, I have no reason to doubt the reliability of PW4. I found him to be truthful and a credit worthy witness. I was of the view that he did not record \[28\] of P8 wrongly. He had not misunderstood the Accused during the recording of exhibit P8. The statement P8 was also read back to the Accused who confirmed it to be true and correct.

## Evidence of Mohamad Haziq Bin Mohamad Ikhsan (PW5)

23     PW5 was the Investigation Officer who held the rank of Inspector. He was attached to the Central Narcotic Bureau.

24     Exhibit P1 was a report of the forensic examination of one Xiaomi mobile phone and its SIM card. Exhibit P1 does reveal that there was a contact by the name of “Kranji” with a telephone number stated to be XXX. Upon the screening done for this contact’s telephone number, the subscriber appeared to be a person with a Myanmar name but not the name reflected on exhibit D1 – “Thu Yein Lynn Tun”. Investigation revealed that there was no address given. Hence, there was no further follow-up investigation on the contact by the name of “Kranji”.

## The Defence

25     There was no submission of no case to answer at the close of the Prosecution’s case. The Defence was called and the Accused elected to give evidence. No other witness was called by the Defence.

26     Essentially the Defence was one of denial. The Accused claimed that the drug marked “KRANJI” was meant for his own consumption and not to be passed to “Kranji”. He alleged that he bought the said drug from a Thai by the name of “Kranji”. The Accused requested “Kranji” to label the packet of drug as “KRANJI”. This was done in his presence. He also claimed to have bought drug from one Ah Don but written as Ong by the Police.

27     To support his defence of drug consumption, the Accused referred to his statement (exhibit D2) given to SSgt Silvanus (PW3) on 13 Nov 2017 at 1405hours. See \[9\] – \[10\] of D2.

28     During his examination in chief, the Accused initially claimed that PW3 did ask him why a packet of drug was labelled “KRANJI” and his reply was that the label was already there when he bought it but he then retracted it subsequently. See Day 1 NE at pages 79 - 80.

29     When asked to comment about \[28\] of P8, the Accused emphasized that he clearly told PW4 that he never passed drug to anyone. He used the words “clearly remember” 3 times in response to the question asked by his counsel. See Day 1 NE at page 80, line 13 to line 31. In relation to the question “what did you tell him about the packet labelled “KRANJI”, the Accused said he “told him that when I bought it, it came along with my purchase.” See Day 1 NE at pages 80-81.

30     The Accused also testified that he could understand part of his statement (P8). He admitted it was read to him in Mandarin. He alleged that he simply signed on P8 as he thought P8 was the same as his 1st statement taken at Clementi. That he signed on the statement as he was tired due to sleep deprivation. He also did not pay attention to P8. He also claimed that a further statement was taken from him on 12 December when he told PW4 that the packet was already labelled “KRANJI” on it when he purchased it for his own consumption. He added that what was recorded on 12 December was not read back to him.

31     It was on 3 Jan 2018 that PW4 came to prison to charge the Accused regarding the packet of drug labelled “KRANJI”.

32     At the close of the Defence, counsel submitted a written submission. This was responded to by the Prosecution in its written submission.

## Credibility of the Accused

33     I found the Accused to be an unreliable witness not worthy of credit. His evidence was riddled with contradictions. His account was internally and externally inconsistent. In fact, counsel conceded during his oral submission that there were indeed inconsistencies in parts of the Accused’s testimony. See Day 2 NE at page 7.

34     At \[10\] of D2, the Accused claimed to have only consumed 0.5g of “ice” on 12 November 2017. In court, he said he had consumed more than 1g of “ice”. He also admitted that he lied to PW3, the recorder of D2. See Day 1 NE at page 97.

35     It was clear that the Accused was embellishing his evidence when he mentioned 3 times that he clearly remembered what he said to PW4 when P8 was recorded. What he had told PW4 took place in 2017. How could it be possible to remember clearly what he had said to PW4 when his allegation that he did not pass drug to anyone has not been recorded in writing at all when P8 was recorded. He mentioned that he did not want to sell or give it to his friend after he had been served with the charge on 3 Jan 2018. See exhibit D1(13-15). In my view, his statement given on 3 Jan 2018 was an afterthought.

36     The Accused agreed that besides \[27\] and \[28\] of P8, all the rest of P8 were accurate. However, when his counsel referred him to \[34\] of P8, he then said it was not correct. He was clearly not forthright in giving evidence. This was also illustrated at \[28\] above and Day 1 NE at page 88, lines 2-11.

37     The Accused contended that he had asked “Kranji” to label his packet because the quality of drugs was of lower quality. However, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the purity of the “KRANJI” packet was of the highest level of the four packets seized from the accused. See \[20\] of the Prosecution’s submissions.

38     In \[1\] of exhibit D2, the Accused admitted that he can read, write and speak in English. During his cross examination, he also admitted that there were no communication issues between PW3 and him. But he later qualified himself when he claimed that he only told PW3 that he can speak English but denied that he could write English. This was again inconsistent with his own messages found in his cell phone which contained many English words written by him. See exhibit P1. Clearly there were many instances of inconsistencies in his testimonies in court and the documentary evidence.

## Findings

39     I found that words in \[28\] of P8 were common basic English words. Given the Accused’s educational background and having reviewed exhibit P1, I have no reason to doubt that the Accused can read and understand at least common simple English words. I was of the view that he could easily notice and read the following words – “I labelled”, “Kranji”, “give”, “friend” and “giving”. \[28\] of P8 were also read back to him in Mandarin accurately. Mandarin was the language which the Accused admitted that he can converse and understand. In fact, the Accused made a correction at \[28\] of P8. This fortified my finding that he understood what was read to him as per \[28\] of P8. This paragraph 28 was also consistent with \[34\] of P8 which stated the Accused’s intention to share his drugs with friends.

40     There was also no evidence of any valid reason for PW4 to give false testimony in court. I rejected the Accused’s bare allegation that PW4 was targeting at him. In any event, I found PW4 to be a witness worthy of credit. See also \[22\] above. Accordingly, I rejected the allegations by the Accused that he did not understand P8, particularly \[28\] or that it was recorded inaccurately.

41     In fact, the Accused agreed that D2 and P8 were accurately recorded in its totality. See Day 1 NE at page 96, lines 8-9. But he subsequently retracted it during his re-examination. In any event, the Accused had conceded that the entire statement of P8, save for the incriminating parts were accurately recorded. This showed that there was in fact no communication problems between PW4 and the Accused.

42     I found that the Accused was fully alert when he gave his statement as recorded in P8 otherwise he would not have raised issues regarding the address stated at \[7\] of D2, the issue relating to the replacement car in \[22\] and \[23\] of D2. See \[27\] of P8.

43     I rejected the Accused’s allegation that he was able to gauge the weight of the amount of ‘Ice’ that he consumed without the use of the weighing scale found in his possession. Similarly, I also rejected his evidence that he used the weighing scale to measure the drugs that he received from the supplier. In my view, it was not logical to say that one can gauge the weight of the drug for own consumption but needed the weighing scale to measure the weight when bought it from the supplier.

44     The fact that the Accused had many empty zip-lock bags in his possession (marked as “A2A”) and a weighing scale were consistent with his statement that the weighing scale was for dividing the “ice” into packets with the intention of giving it to his friends.

45     I found that it was during the recording of P8 that the Accused was specifically asked for the first time why there was a packet that had a label “KRANJI” written on it. I accepted the evidence of PW4 that he only realized much later that a further offence of trafficking was disclosed. This explained why he only served on the Accused, the charge which was the subject matter of this trial on the 3 January 2018.

46     I disbelieved the Accused’s allegation that he bought the drug labelled as “KRANJI” from one Kranji. If it were the case, he would have it recorded in D2, especially when he was referred to the exhibits stated in \[9\] of D2 which included the packet of drug labelled with the word “KRANJI” which was found inside the white medication packet. See \[2\] of the ASOF. Similarly, in his cautioned statement dated 3 Jan 2018 (D1(14-15)), he failed to identify Kranji as the supplier who had passed him the packet with the label “KRANJI”. This was despite the fact that the charge of having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking one packet of drug marked “KRANJI” having been read and the warning administered to him. See D1-14.

47     For the reasons stated by the Prosecution, I rejected the Defence contention that exhibit P8 \[28\] and \[34\] were not reliable and were at odd with the circumstantial evidence leading to the arrest of the Accused and his other statements. In particular, I agreed with the Prosecution “that the accused was never specifically questioned about the “Kranji” packet until Exhibit P8 was recorded on the 14 November 2017 at 2.30 pm. When the accused was specifically asked about it, he told the truth- that the “Kranji” packet was meant for “Kranji”. Before this SSgt Silvanus Kolandasamy (“SSgt Kolandasamy”) had admitted that he overlooked to ask about the “Kranji” packet in the statement recorded on 13 November 2017 because he intended to take a brief statement. The accused was also not confronted with his intention to traffic “Kranji” in the 4 cautioned statements served on him on the 14 November 2017. This was because the Investigation Officer ASP Tan himself had not yet come to a realization that the accused had committed a trafficking when Exhibit P8 was recorded. It was only much later that ASP Tan had realized that this offence was disclosed and had recorded the cautioned statement for this offence on the 3 January 2018. When the accused realized that he would be charged for this offence, the accused back-tracked on his earlier confession and contrived an alternative claim that the “Kranji” packet was passed to him by his supplier.” See \[11\] of the Prosecution’s written submission dated 25 March 2019. Accordingly, I found no basis to doubt the veracity of the contents of the statement P8 and I gave full weight to the statement P8.

48     With due respect, I did not think that the purity of the drugs showed that the “KRANJI” packet of drug was from “Kranji”. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the difference in purity between the “KRANJI” packet and the other packet in “A1B” was extremely marginal at 0.6342%. Moreover, there was no credible evidence that the purity of the drug from the same supplier will be of the same purity.

49     I agreed with the Prosecution that the cell phone records in P1 was a neutral factor. It did not preclude the Accused from intending to pass a further packet of drugs to “Kranji” at a date after 11 November 2017. Moreover, as pointed out by the Prosecution that “there is also no objective evidence to show what had actually transpired during this meet up. Further, the point in time which the _mens rea_ of the offence had crystallised was the point in which the accused had labelled the “Kranji” packet. It was at this point, when the accused had set aside the amount of ‘ice’ for the purposes of passing it to “Kranji”.”

## Guilty and Convicted

50     I accepted that the Accused was a drug abuser. Hence, he admitted the drugs found in him were for his consumption. However, it did not necessary mean that he was also not a drug trafficker. As stated above at \[47\], I see no reason not to give the full weight to exhibit P8. I was of the view that the evidence adduced by the Prosecution showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was indeed a drug trafficker as per the charge. Accordingly, the Accused was found guilty and convicted of the drug trafficking charge (DAC941335/2017).

## Antecedents

51     The Accused was traced for unrelated offences. He was last sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment on 18 Sept 2007.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

52     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of not less than 6 years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution did not ask for additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning but highlighted that no sentencing discount should be given in respect of the drug trafficking charge.

53     The learned DPP submitted that the imprisonment term for the trafficking charge should be above the minimum prescribed sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. Out of the 5 convicted charges, 2 of the sentences were to run consecutively.

## Mitigation and submission on Sentence by Defence

54     The Defence submitted for the following sentences to be imposed:

(a)     5 years’ imprisonment for DAC 941355/2017

(b)     8 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907164/2018

(c)     6 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907165/2018

(d)     7 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907166/2018

(e)     2 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907167/2018

55     In support of the submission, the defence referred to various sentencing precedents, in particular the case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ .

56     Counsel submitted for the sentences in DAC 941355/2017 and DAC 907167/2018 to run consecutively and the rest to run concurrently. The total sentence would be an imprisonment term of 5 years and 2 months. Counsel also submitted for the sentence to be backdated to 18 Nov 2017.

57     It was highlighted that the Accused had no drug related antecedents. The last imprisonment term was for an unrelated offence which took place more than 10 years ago.

58     It was also submitted that the Accused had made a decision to kick his drug habit before his arrest. He took drugs because of his irregular working hours. He had also been trying to cut down on his drug consumption.

## The Sentences

59     It is well known that the social object of the Misuse of Drugs Act is to eradicate the trafficking, possession and consumption of illicit drugs. The dangers that illicit drugs pose to society were acknowledged by the High Court in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia v PP_ . Clearly the main sentencing consideration must be one of general and specific deterrence.

60     Having taken into account the submissions of both the parties, the circumstances and the nature of the offences committed and the punishments prescribed for the offences, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

(a)     5 years 3 months’ imprisonment for DAC 941355/2017

(b)     8 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907164/2018

(c)     6 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907165/2018

(d)     8 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907166/2018

(e)     2 months’ imprisonment for DAC 907167/2018

61     The sentences in DAC 941355/2017 and DAC 907166/2018 were ordered to run consecutively. The other sentences were to run concurrently with these 2 sentences. Hence the total sentence was 5 years 11 months’ imprisonment. The sentence was back dated to 18 Nov 2017.

62     Having determined the individual sentences for each charge, I will next elaborate only on the sentences which differed from the submissions by counsel. These were the sentences in respect of DAC 941355/2017 and DAC 907166/2018.

63     I noted that the Accused had no related antecedents. I was aware that his last sentence was many years ago. Hence, I did not take this into consideration in sentencing the Accused. On the other hand, I was mindful that the Accused had committed multiple offences. Hence, he could not be treated as a first-time offender.

64     I was of the view that the sentences imposed were within the range of sentences indicated in the case precedents cited by the Defence. As for the drug trafficking charge, the indicative starting point was 5-6 years’ imprisonment and 5-6 strokes of the cane. See _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP, supra._ I did not think the sentence of 5 years 3 months’ imprisonment was excessive or not proportionate to the Accused’s culpability. It also took into account the lack of remorse shown in respect of this charge.

65     As for the sentence in DAC 907166/2018 relating to the consumption of a specified drug, namely, methamphetamine, the sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment was also within the sentencing range indicated in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia v PP, supra_ at \[38\]. In this respect, I also took into account the fact that he had pleaded guilty to the charge and that there was no significant aggravating factor.

66     The main contentions by the Defence were in respect of the total sentence to be imposed and which of the sentences were to run consecutively. I was of the view that the global sentence of 5 years 11 months’ imprisonment adequately reflected the total criminality of the Accused and did not infringe the totality principle. I did not think the aggregate sentence was crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospect. He was just above the age of 50 at the time the sentence was imposed. The total sentence was also not substantially above the normal level of sentence for the most serious offence committed. The Accused was not only a drug abuser but he was also a drug trafficker. I noted that he had abused drug 2-3 times a week since 2015. His offending behaviour was clearly for a substantial period of time. The 2 consecutive sentences also took into account the different legally protected interests of the various charges, in particular, drug trafficking and drug consumption. Section 307 CPC also mandated the court to order 2 of the sentences to run consecutively as the Accused had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 offences. I was of the view that the submission by counsel for the sentence in DAC 941355/2017 to run consecutively with the sentence in DAC 907167/2018 would mean that it would be better off for the Prosecution not to proceed with DAC 907167/2018 at all. That cannot be right. It was also not proportionate to the Accused’s overall criminality. Accordingly, I respectfully disagreed with the Defence on sentencing.

67     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
