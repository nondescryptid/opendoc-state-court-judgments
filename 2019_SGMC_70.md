\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9199/2019/01.\]

12 November 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Ms Alicia Chua faced 15 charges of allegedly acting as a bookmaker from 4 to 18 May 2014. The charges were brought under s 5(3)(a) of the Betting Act (Cap 21, Rev Ed 2011) (“**Betting Act**”). She denied the charges. The matter proceeded to trial in October 2017. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the defence made a submission of “no case to answer”. I accepted the submission of the defence and, on 1 December 2017, acquitted the defendant on all 15 charges. The prosecution filed an appeal against the acquittal.

2       The grounds of my decision (issued on 26 February 2018) are set out in _PP v Chua Buan Ling Alicia_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 9</span>. These were my main grounds for acquitting the defendant: (a) the original charges (marked C1 to C15) were defective in that they charged the defendant with using a betting account to “process” bets, which was a word that was vague and not part of the definition of “bookmaker” in the Betting Act; (b) although the 7th to 15th charges referred to a betting account from a betting website known as “Greysnow”, there was no evidence linking the defendant to that account; (c) there was conflicting evidence whether the bet amounts ought to be in Singapore dollars (“**S$**”) as stated in the charges, or in Hong Kong dollars (“**HK$**”); (d) the evidence of the key witness for the prosecution, who implicated the defendant, fell short of the threshold of being “not inherently incredible”.

3       The appeal was heard at the High Court on 14 May 2018. The High Court allowed the prosecution’s appeal in part and remitted the case to this court for the defence to be called: _PP v Chua Buan Ling Alicia_ (MA No. 9364 of 2017). The High Court gave directions to the prosecution (at \[27\] of the grounds of decision) that: (a) all the 15 charges be amended by substituting the words “process bets” with “receive bets”; and (b) the 7th to 15th charges be amended by removing the particulars relating to the Greysnow account and reducing the bet amounts accordingly.

4       Consequently, the 15 charges were amended and remitted to this court for the defence to be called. When the defence was called, the defendant elected to remain silent and called no witnesses. On 21 August 2019, having heard further submissions, I found that the charges against the defendant had _not_ been proven _beyond a reasonable doubt_, and acquitted the defendant on all the charges. The prosecution filed the present appeal against the acquittal.

5       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## Charges

6       The 15 charges were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the _date_ of the offence and the _amount of bets_ (as well as the list of football leagues on which the bets were placed). Set out below are the wording of the charges and the particulars (following the amendments directed by the High Court):

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on the \[Date\], in Singapore, did act as a bookmaker, _to wit_, by using a senior master agent account in relation to www.sbobet.com to receive bets amounting to a total of \[Amount\] for the following leagues:-

>> \[lists of football leagues\]

> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 5(3)(a) of the Betting Act, Chapter 21.

## Prosecution’s case

7       Evidence in the prosecution’s case was tendered by way of an Agreed Statement of Facts (Exh P1) supplemented by the evidence of the following witnesses:

> (a)     PW1 – Assistant Superintendent of Police (then Inspector) Yeo Kok Leong, who led a raid on the defendant’s residence;

> (b)     PW2 – Inspector Tan Keng Seng, who was involved in the same raid;

> (c)     PW3 – Superintendent Connie Seek, from the Technology Crime Forensic Branch (TCFB) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), who conducted a forensic examination of two mobile phones seized from the defendant’s residence;

> (d)     PW4 – Senior Station Inspector 2 Ng Shao Jiuan, from the TCFB, who conducted a forensic examination of a Sony laptop seized from the defendant’s residence;

> (e)     PW5 – Station Inspector Lee Seow How (“**SI Lee**”), a gambling expert from the Specialised Crime Branch of the CID, who analysed and provided expert testimony on the betting records printed out from relevant gaming websites;

> (f)     PW6 – Ng Beng Hock (“**Ng**”), a convicted bookmaker who implicated the defendant;

> (g)     PW7 – Inspector Ronny Lim Kian Yong, the investigation officer (“**IO Ronny**”).

#### Incriminating evidence found at residence of Ng, a bookmaker

8       It was not in dispute that on 19 May 2014 at about 3.00 am, a team of police officers from the CID, led by IO Ronny, conducted a search on the residence of Ng at Block 17 Jalan Tenteram. In Ng’s presence, IO Ronny accessed an online soccer betting website using Ng’s computer and Ng’s agent account, using the login details provided by Ng. IO Ronny printed out some betting records from the website. Ng’s computer was seized. A sum of S$795,104 in cash (the “**Cash**”) was also seized from a safe in Ng’s bedroom wardrobe and from his drawer. Photographs of these exhibits were tendered in evidence (Exh P8).

9       Ng was then taken back to the Police Cantonment Complex (PCC) for further investigations. There, IO Ronny printed out the remaining pages of the betting records in Ng’s presence. The entire set of betting records printed (both at Ng’s residence and at the PCC) which was tendered in evidence totalled 367 pages (Exh P6, the “**Betting Records**”). The Betting Records related to the period 4 to 18 May 2014 (the “**Relevant Period**”).

#### Raid on defendant’s residence

10     It was also not in dispute that later that morning on 19 May 2014, at about 8.10 am, acting on information received from Ng, another team of police officers proceeded to the defendant’s residence at 19 Cairnhill Circle. The officers placed the defendant under arrest and searched the unit in her presence. Various items in her possession were seized, including an Apple iPhone 5S (Exh P13), an Apple iPhone 5 (Exh P14) and a Sony laptop (Exh P15). A search was also done on her cars at a carpark. Nothing incriminating was found. She was then taken back to the PCC for further investigations. A number of the exhibits seized from the defendant’s residence were subsequently handed by IO Ronny to the TCFB for forensic examination.

#### Ng implicated the defendant

11     Ng was the key witness for the prosecution. The crux of his evidence was that the defendant employed him to assist in her online soccer betting business. He worked for her from 2008 until his arrest on 19 May 2014. The Cash that was seized from his residence was from illegal online soccer betting, and the money belonged to her.

12     Ng testified that the defendant owned a betting account at the illegal online soccer betting website <www.sbobet.com> (“**SBOBET**”). The betting account was a _senior master agent_ (“**SMA**”) account. The defendant gave him access to the account. His user ID for the account was “hkx77” (a _master agent_ account), and the password was “XXX”; the figure “XXX” was the date of birth of the defendant, 23 October 1973.[^1] Acting on her instructions, he managed the bookmaking business for her from 2008 until the date of his arrest. His duties included opening other agent accounts, collecting and distributing monies to other agents, making weekly reports to the defendant pertaining to the wins and losses, and settling payments with the SBOBET gambling website. In return, he received a monthly salary from her.[^2]

13     As for the Cash found at his residence, Ng testified that they were proceeds from the bookmaking business and belonged to the defendant. He would pass the proceeds to the defendant whenever she wanted him to do so.[^3]

#### Evidence of bets in Betting Records (Exh P6)

14     A report prepared by the prosecution’s gambling expert (PW5, SI Lee) was tendered in evidence (Exh P17). In the report SI Lee expressed the opinion that the printout in Exh P6 contained records of bets in connection with illegal soccer betting activities. The bet amounts for each day during the Relevant Period were added up. (These were the bet amounts stated in the 15 charges.)

15     In his oral testimony SI Lee explained that there was a hierarchy of betting accounts.[^4]

16     SI Lee explained that punters placed bets on their punter accounts, and the details of the bets were captured in the records of the agent accounts. Each bet was recorded down automatically on the website, including the date and time when the bet was placed and the amount of the bet. The amounts of bets and the payouts for each account were reflected in the website’s records:

> (a)     Each bet made by a punter (and received by the online betting website) was reflected under the column “Stake” of the punter’s account. For example, with reference to Exh P6 at p 11 s/n 1, the punter “hkx1010016” had placed a bet of $66 on a match played in the “Australia Hyundai A League” between the teams “Brisbane Roar” and “Western Sydney”. This bet was received on 4 May 2014. [^5]

> (b)     After the online betting website calculated the outcome of all received bets, the numerical values of the payouts were then reflected in a summary. The tabulated wins and losses were reflected in the “Payout” column of the agent’s account. For example, with reference to Exh P6 at p 8, the payout for the account “hkx10” was $36,020.78.[^6]

17     SI Lee testified that when Singaporean bookmakers and punters engaged in betting activities in Singapore, they would transact and settle payments in S$. However, at the top of the hierarchy, they would settle the accounts with the overseas betting website in HK$. Even if a gambling website recorded figures in another currency, the actual transactions in Singapore would be carried out in S$, and according to the exact recorded figures _without conversion_.[^7]

#### Phone messages between Ng and the defendant

18     From a forensic examination of the defendant’s Sony laptop by the TCFB, records of phone messages between Ng and the defendant were retrieved. (These messages were from a backup file that was synced from the defendant’s Apple iPhone 5 to the Sony laptop, both of which were seized during the raid on her residence.) The report prepared by the forensic examiner (Exh P12) and a summary of the relevant SMS messages extracted (Exh P16) were admitted in evidence by consent. These messages were sent between 26 August 2012 and 28 December 2013 (the “**SMS Messages**”).

19     According to the prosecution, the SMS Messages showed that Ng had sent more than 81 messages to the defendant concerning bookmaking activities. Ng testified that he continued to send such messages to update the defendant until the date of his arrest.[^8]

## Defence

20     After the defence was called, the defendant elected not to testify. The thrust of the defence was that Ng was lying when he implicated the defendant. His evidence was uncorroborated and not credible. There was no objective evidence showing that the defendant was a bookmaker during the Relevant Period, or linking the defendant to the bets shown in the Betting Records.

## Issue

21     The issue before the court was whether the prosecution had proven _beyond a reasonable doubt_ that the defendant had acted as a bookmaker and received bets as shown in the Betting Records, using the SMA account in SBOBET, during the Relevant Period.

22     There was no _objective_ evidence linking the defendant to the bets. The only link was the testimony of Ng. The key issue, therefore, was whether the testimony of Ng was credible.

## Decision

#### No phone messages between Ng and defendant during Relevant Period

23     The prosecution submitted that the SMS Messages (referred to at \[18\]-\[19\], above) showed that Ng made weekly reports to the defendant regarding illegal soccer betting activity on various soccer betting accounts.

24     The defence disputed the nature of the SMS Messages, and highlighted that these were messages that took place in 2012 and 2013. There was no objective evidence of any communication between Ng and the defendant during the Relevant Period. The defence highlighted that the only SMS messages that the investigators retrieved were those from the defendant’s Sony laptop, which was a backup of the messages on her iPhone 5 (Exh P14). The last backup date of that phone was on 17 May 2014, two days before Ng’s arrest;[^9] no SMS messages between her and Ng during the Relevant Period were found. The last message sent by Ng was on 28 December 2013 (Exh P16). Apart from the defendant’s phones, _Ng_’s two mobile phones (a Samsung and a Nokia) were also seized, which he said he had used to send SMS messages to the defendant during the Relevant Period.[^10] Likewise, no SMS messages were found in either of Ng’s mobile phones. The defence submitted that, if there were records of messages exchanged between Ng and the defendant in 2012 and 2013, and no records were found for the Relevant Period, it must logically lead to the inference that no such messages were sent. There was thus no objective evidence that Ng was acting on the defendant’s instructions during the Relevant Period.

25     I found the defence’s submission to be entirely logical and highly persuasive. If no phone messages between Ng and the defendant were found during the Relevant Period, the most reasonable inference was that there were no such messages. The forensic examiner from the TCFB (PW3) was of the opinion that while deleted data in a phone could be extracted if it was not overwritten, _older messages were more likely to be deleted or overwritten first before messages that were more recent_; logically, there was _a “higher possibility” of finding more recent messages in a phone as opposed to older messages_.[^11] The prosecution suggested that SMS messages in the phones _could_ have been deleted and subsequently overwritten, and that the absence of such messages did not mean that the messages were never sent. I found this suggestion to be entirely conjectural and of no help in the discharge of the prosecution’s burden of proof. Indeed, going by the opinion of the TCFB forensic examiner, it was highly unlikely that recent phone messages during the Relevant Period would have been deleted and overwritten.

26     If there were messages between Ng and the defendant during the Relevant Period, was it possible that no trace of those messages could be found in the mobile phones of _both_ the defendant and Ng, when those exhibits were seized very soon after, on 19 May 2014? For that to happen, it would have required the relevant data on the phones of _both the defendant and Ng_ to have been completely wiped out by new data within a short span of a few days. Such an occurrence was so unlikely as to be _impossible_.

27     Hence, in my judgment, the irresistible inference from the lack of evidence of messages between Ng and the defendant during the Relevant Period was that _no such messages were sent_. This severely undermined and seriously called into question the credibility of Ng’s assertion that he did send such messages to the defendant to report on bookmaking activities right up to the date of his arrest.

#### No objective evidence linking the defendant to bookmaking

28     Quite apart from the lack of objective evidence of communications between Ng and the defendant during the Relevant Period, there was also no objective evidence that the defendant was the owner of the SBOBET SMA account or had any connection with the bets shown in the Betting Records. While the Cash was seized from Ng’s home, no monies were seized from the defendant’s home. Nor were any illicit monies traced to any of her bank accounts. The raid on the defendant’s residence (at \[10\], above) disclosed no incriminating evidence. In short, no objective evidence was found by the police that positively linked the defendant to the activities of a bookmaker.

#### Ng’s testimony was not credible

29     The prosecution’s case therefore relied heavily on the testimony of Ng to provide the link between the defendant and the bets shown in the Betting Records. The crux of Ng’s evidence was that the defendant owned the SBOBET SMA account; and Ng was acting on her instructions at all material times (\[11\]-\[13\], above).

30     The defence submitted that Ng’s testimony was not credible. Ng said that he opened other agent accounts on the defendant’s instructions, but he did not explain when these instructions were given by the defendant, what instructions were given, how the instructions were given, or what he had to do in relation to the opening of accounts. Ng also said that the defendant’s monies were kept in a safe, and he would pass some cash to her and pass some money to “other people” based on her instructions, but there were no records at all of any of these transactions.[^12] When asked how he kept track of how much he owed to others or how much he was holding for the defendant, his response was incoherent:

> Generally, all the money that is--- yes, was in the pool, all collected---all the money was in the---collected was in the pool.[^13]

The defence submitted that Ng was unable to provide a logical account of the monies that he purportedly collected and safe-kept on behalf of the defendant.

31     The defence also highlighted that Ng’s testimony about whether the bet amounts were in S$ or HK$ was unclear. During examination-in-chief, Ng testified that the collection of the bets and the payouts were in S$.[^14] Under cross-examination, when Ng was asked whether the figure under “Cash Balance” at p 1 of the Betting Records was in S$ or HK$, he was “not quite sure”.[^15] He later said that the amounts were in S$.[^16] When further probed, he said that as far as SBOBET was concerned, it was in HK$.[^17] The defence highlighted that among the bets reflected in the defendant’s 1st Charge were bets placed by one Tay Han Seng (“**Tay**”). (Tay had pleaded guilty to _placing_ the bets _in HK$_,[^18] but the 1st Charge stated the same numerical bet amount _in S$_.) When Ng was asked whether Tay’s bets were placed in HK$, Ng said he “don’t know”.[^19]

32     The defence highlighted Ng’s evasiveness at some points during cross-examination:

> Q:\[...\] Sometime after your second interview session with the police – this was roughly about 2 weeks after your initial arrest and release – you telephoned Alicia. Do you recall that?

> A:Don’t remember.

> Q:And I’m instructed that during that telephone conversation, you threatened Alicia by saying that unless she helped you to repay this 800,000 to your brother-in-law, you were going to continue to say that she was your boss in this online betting business?

> A:Don’t remember.

> Q:And I am instructed that Alicia again responded to you to say that she could not help and suggested that you meet to talk in person with her, whereupon you just hung up the phone.

> A:I don’t know. I don’t remember.

> \[...\]

> Q:Did you at any time tell the police that the money seized from your home belonged to your brother-in-law?

> A:Don’t remember. [^20]

The defence submitted that Ng’s shifty answers of “don’t remember” and “don’t know” were clear signs that he was hiding the truth. Ng could have simply said that he disagreed, but did not.

33     I accepted the submission of the defence. I found Ng’s testimony about how he had purportedly acted on the defendant’s instructions and opened agent accounts, collected bets and distributed the proceeds was lacking in detail, vague and wholly unconvincing. He was not even able to say with certainty what currencies the bets were transacted in. His claim that he continued to send SMS messages to update the defendant during the Relevant Period was uncorroborated by any objective evidence. Indeed the absence of any contemporaneous phone records of such messages cast serious doubt on the truth of his testimony. His claim that the Cash found at his residence were bet monies belonging to the defendant was simply not credible considering that he maintained no documentary records, and no unaccounted monies were found at the defendant’s residence or in any of her bank accounts. Ng’s evasiveness under cross-examination further undermined his credibility. In short, I did not find Ng’s testimony implicating the defendant to be worthy of any credit.

#### No adverse inference from defendant remaining silent

34     The prosecution submitted that the defendant’s election to remain silent necessitated an adverse inference being drawn against her. The gist of the prosecution’s argument was as follows. The circumstances of the arrangement between Ng and her was a matter known only between the both of them. Ng testified that the SBOBET account belonged to her and that he had used the account to help her manage her bookmaking business. There were also evidence of the Betting Records, the Cash, the SMS Messages, and the expert report prepared by SI Lee that necessitated some explanation on her part. It was incumbent on her, as the only other person who knew the truth of the matter, to testify and offer her version of events if they differed from Ng’s. Given that she had chosen not to do so, Ng’s evidence stood uncontradicted. On the cumulative effect of the _prima facie_ evidence, the defendant’s failure to raise any defence at all established her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

35     The defence challenged the prosecution’s argument, and submitted that no adverse inference should be drawn against the defendant. There was nothing in the prosecution’s case that required her explanation. The prosecution had access to all the potentially relevant evidence: the defendant’s mobile phones, laptop, bank books – which were all seized. Yet nothing was adduced to fill the evidentiary gaps in the prosecution’s case. There was nothing in the Betting Records that linked the defendant to the SBOBET account, the bets received by Ng on that account and the money transacted by Ng on those bets. There were no records or any objective evidence that the Cash belonged to the defendant; no money was seized from the defendant’s home; there were no unaccounted cash deposits by the defendant into any of her bank accounts. The SMS Messages did not relate to the charges faced by the defendant: there was no evidence of any messages exchanged between Ng and the defendant during the Relevant Period. The expert report of SI Lee was of a generic nature and did not specifically implicate the defendant. It was thus submitted that there was nothing that required the defendant to explain or respond to.

36     I accepted the submission of the defence. There was no objective evidence implicating the defendant. Ng’s unconvincing testimony was undermined by the lack of any corroborative objective evidence. There was nothing in the prosecution’s case that called for an explanation from the defendant. Hence, I found no reason to draw any adverse inference from the defendant’s election to remain silent.

## Verdict

37     The following observation of the High Court in _Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 440</span> (at \[26\]) is apposite:

> \[...\] Even if the Defence is called, should the accused elect not to enter his defence, the court may still acquit him if, on a final evaluation of all the evidence adduced before it, it concludes that the charge has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt – a burden which never shifts to the accused.

38     In essence, the prosecution’s case rested on Ng’s bare assertions that he was acting for the defendant in managing an online soccer betting business, that he was acting on her instructions, and that he had been in communication with her during the Relevant Period. However, Ng’s testimony was unconvincing and wholly undermined by the lack of any corroborative objective evidence, as explained above. On a final evaluation of all the evidence, I found that the prosecution had not proven the charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I ordered a discharge amounting to an acquittal on all the 15 charges.
