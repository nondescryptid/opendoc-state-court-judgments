### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The accused, Mr Muhammad Qayyuum Bin Sulong, a 34 year-old male Singapore national had claimed trial to a charge of engaging in a conspiracy with one Mohamed Faridz Bin Abdul Azeez to commit robbery in **DAC 933871 - 2016** under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed). During the trial, the remaining charge of possession of an offensive weapon without a lawful purpose in a public place under s 6(1) Corrosive and Explosive Substance & Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 938964 -2016** was stood down. The proceeded charge and the stood down charge against him are as follows:

> **DAC 933871-2016** - Exhibit C1D (1st Charge (Amended))

> “…are charged that you, on or before 29 August 2016, in Singapore, did engage with one Muhamed Faridz bin Abdul Azeez …in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to commit robbery of money in the possession of one Ng Bok Wah, and in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 29 August 2016 at or about 9.28pm, at the vicinity of the 2nd floor lift landing of Blk 2 Hougang Avenue 3, Singapore, where the said Muhamed Faridz bin Abdul Aziz did commit robbery of a black coloured waist pouch containing:

>> (a)    Cash amounting to S$10,000;

>> (b)    One gold bracelet valued at S$300; and

>> (c)    One black colour mobile phone valued at S$30

> with total value of S$10,330, in the possession of the said Ng Bok Wah, and you have thereby committed an offence of robbery and committed an offence under section 392 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.”

> **DAC 938964 -2016** - Exhibit C2A (2nd Charge (Amended))

> “…are charged that you, on 1 September 2016 at or about 4.35 pm, at the shelter beside Blk 115 Bedok North Road, which is a public place, did have in your possession one foldable knife with blade of 3cm, otherwise than with lawful authority or for a lawful purpose and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapon Act, Chapter 65.”

2       On 19 July 2019, at the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the proceeded charge in **DAC 933871 - 2016** beyond a reasonable doubt. I did not accept his defence that was essentially a bare denial of his involvement in the robbery with the said Mohamed Faridz bin Abdul Azeez. I convicted the accused on the charge in **DAC 933871 - 2016**. The matter was adjourned for his Defence Counsel to make representations on the remaining charges as well as to take his client’s instructions.

3       Subsequently, on 30 August 2019, the accused pleaded guilty before me to his two remaining charges namely, the outstanding charge in **DAC 938964 -2016** and an additional charge of voluntarily causing hurt in **MCN 901106-2019** under s 323 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed). The additional charge is as follows:

> **MCN 901106 - 2019** - Exhibit C3 (3rd Charge)

> “…are charged that you, on the 1st day of January 2019, at about 3.06 am, at 3D River Valley Road, Clarke Quay, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Allen Kamal, _to wit_, by punching the said Allen Kamal once on his right jaw, causing bodily pain to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

4       After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charges before me, I imposed the following sentences:

> (i)      **DAC 933871 - 2016** – Three years’ and three months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane;

> (ii)      **DAC 938964 - 2016** – six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane; and

> (iii)      **MCN 901106 - 2019** – one month’s imprisonment.

I ordered the sentences for **DAC 933871 - 2016** and **MCN 901106 - 2019** to run consecutively. The global sentence imposed on the accused was three years’ and four months’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane with effect from 30 August 2019.

5       Dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction in **DAC 933871 - 2016** as well as his sentences in respect of all three charges in **DAC 933871 - 2016**, **DAC 938964 - 2016** and **MCN 901106 - 2019** on 30 August 2019. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

6       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial for DAC 933871 - 2016

7       During the trial, the Prosecution had called six witnesses to the stand to give evidence against the accused. They were:

## B.   Undisputed Facts

9       The undisputed facts in the present case are set out below:

> a)     Mohamed Faridz Bin Azeez (“Faridz”) got to know the accused sometime in early 2016 through their association with the Sio Kun Tong (“SKT”) secret society. The accused and Faridz are members of the same secret society and the accused is Faridz’s headman;

> b)     At the material time, Faridz would meet the accused once or twice a week over the weekend. They went clubbing and would have drinks as well as supper together;

> c)     The accused met Faridz sometime in the evening on 29 August 2016 at Geylang Lorong 16 and Faridz handed over contraband cigarettes that the accused had ordered;

> d)     Subsequently, on 29 August 2019 at 9.29 p.m. at the 2nd floor lift landing of Block 2 Hougang Avenue 3, Singapore, Faridz had committed robbery of a black coloured waist pouch containing:

>> (i)       Cash amounting to S$10,000;

>> (ii)       One gold bracelet valued at S$300; and

>> (iii) One black colour mobile phone valued at S$30

> with total value of S$10,330 in the possession of one Ng Bok Wah;

> e)     In the course of the night on 29 August 2016, Faridz had called the accused on his hand phone requesting the latter to pick him up;

> f)     The accused met Faridz once again at 9.32 p.m. on 29 August 2016 at the traffic light junction between Tampines Road and Hougang Ave 3 when the former picked him up in his silver coloured Qoo10 van;

> g)     The accused and Faridz then went to the accused’s girlfriend’s house at Block 101D Punggol Field;

> h)     Both the accused and Faridz were arrested on 1 September 2016 while they were together at Block 115 Bedok North Road, Singapore 460115;

> i)     At the time of his arrest, the accused was in possession of six pieces of $1,000 note, six pieces of $100 note, three pieces of $50 and one piece of $5 note and

> j)     At the material time in August 2019, the accused drove a silver Nissan NV350 van bearing the registration number GBE3290G with the Qoo10 stickers pasted on its left side.

## C.   Issue

10     The main issue before me was whether the accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Faridz to commit robbery of money in the possession of one Ng Bok Wah (“the victim”) on 29 August 2016.

11     In essence, it was the Prosecution’s case theory that:

> (a)     The accused was the mastermind of the robbery who had instigated Faridz to commit the robbery;

> (b)     The accused was intricately involved throughout the process by following the victim and Faridz close by in his Qoo10 van and serving as Faridz’s getaway driver after the deed was done and

> (c)     The accused had retained the bulk of the monies consisting of at least six $1,000 notes that was robbed from the victim.

12     In contrast, it was the case for the Defence that the accused had not committed the alleged offence under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed) in _DAC 933871 - 2016_. The main thrust of the defence was that the Prosecution’s key witness Faridz was an unreliable witness who had framed the accused. The accused believed that Faridz may have held a grudge against him as the accused had arranged for Faridz to be taught a lesson for flashing at a friend’s mother by another SKT member, namely Muhammad Farid Bin Azman (DW3).

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

13     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused and Faridz were members of the same secret society i.e. SKT gang. The accused was Faridz’s headman in the gang. It was also the Prosecution’s case that Faridz and the accused were close friends with no history of bad blood between them and met up regularly approximately twice a week during the period of July to August 2016.

14     It was submitted that sometime around 5.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. on 29 August 2016, Faridz had met up with the accused at Geylang Lorong 16, Singapore. The meeting between them was for the contraband cigarettes that the accused had ordered from Faridz which the latter delivered by placing them in the accused’s van. It was the Prosecution’s case that no one else was present apart from them and after the delivery of the cigarettes, Faridz proceeded to sit in the front passenger seat next to the accused, who sat in the driver’s seat.

15     It was submitted that it was during this time that the accused had informed Faridz about his plan to rob the victim, Ng Bok Wah whom he had described as an old man. The accused told Faridz that the old man had cash with him and that he wanted to rob him. It was also the Prosecution’s case that the victim, aged 64 years of age is a prolific gambler, who was well known for gambling in the vicinity of Geylang on a daily basis. For each occasion, the victim would ordinarily bring large amounts of money (ranging from thousands to over ten thousand dollars).

16     It was further submitted that after hearing about the plan from the accused, Faridz then proceeded to a nearby coffee shop to wait while the accused continued sitting in his parked van at Geylang Lorong 16. Sometime later, the accused called Faridz over to the van and pointed the victim out to him. It was the Prosecution’s case that Faridz then followed the victim until they boarded bus No. 62 at 8.52 p.m. at Geylang Lorong 23. While on the journey to Hougang, the accused had followed the said bus in his silver Qoo10 van. At about 9.05 p.m., the accused drove past the bus at Upper Paya Lebar Road. Throughout the journey, Faridz was in constant communication with the accused through his mobile phone and had informed the accused when he alighted from the bus.

17     It was also the Prosecution’s case that Faridz had followed the victim when the latter alighted from the said bus along Hougang Avenue 2 at about 9.19 p.m. After arriving at Block 2, Hougang Avenue 3, the victim and Faridz entered the lift together at 9.29 p.m. As the lift door opened at the second level, Faridz pushed the victim from behind causing the latter to fall and hurt his hands. Faridz then proceeded to snatch the victim’s black sling bag containing:

> (a)     Cash of at least $10,000, consisting of eight $1,000 notes;

> (b)     One black coloured mobile phone valued at about $30 and

> (c)     One gold bracelet valued at about $300.

18     It was submitted that after committing the robbery, Faridz had called the accused to inform him that he had robbed the victim and requested to be picked up. As Faridz was heading to the agreed rendezvous point, he saw the accused’s van at the traffic light junction of Hougang Avenue 3 and jumped in the vehicle at 9.32 p.m. After getting into the vehicle, Faridz had handed over the victim’s black sling bag to the accused, who drove them to Punggol. While at the Punggol apartment, the accused gave Faridz cash of $2,000 from the monies he had stolen from the victim earlier.

19     It was the Prosecution’s case that when the accused and Faridz were arrested on 1 September 2016, the accused was found with six $1,000 notes, which represented some of the remaining loot that was stolen from the victim. A gold iPhone was also seized from the accused, who deliberately refused to cooperate with the Police by providing a false password to the investigators.

#### The Law

20     It was the Prosecution’s case that to prove the charge against the accused, the following elements must be established, namely:

> (a)     The accused knowingly engaged with Faridz in a conspiracy to commit robbery as defined under s 390(2) Penal Code;

> (b)     An act pursuant to the conspiracy had taken place; that Faridz did in fact rob the victim.

21     It was submitted that with regard to the first element, the essence of conspiracy is agreement and a conspiracy may be proved by showing that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design. In the present case, it was for Faridz to rob the victim: _Lai Kam Loy & ors v PP_ \[1993\] SLR(R) 143.

22     It was further submitted that the second element of the charge was not disputed as the underlying act of robbery did take place as committed by Faridz. In committing theft of the victim’s black sling bag and its contents, Faridz did voluntarily cause hurt by pushing the victim from behind causing him to fall and injure his hands. This was the act committed in pursuance of the above conspiracy as particularised in the charge.

23     It was the Prosecution’s case that based on the totality of the evidence, the charge against the accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It was submitted that Faridz had provided consistent, credible and corroborated evidence of the accused’s role as the mastermind in the plan to rob the victim. It was further submitted that having pleaded guilty to his involvement in the offence against the victim, Faridz has no reason or incentive to perjure himself given the description of his close friendship with the accused at the material time.

#### Elaborate ruse by the accused to suggest that Faridz had framed him

24     It was also the Prosecution’s case that whilst the Defence has sought to alleged that Faridz did have a reason to frame the accused, such a claim was unmeritorious and inconsistent with the objective evidence. According to the Prosecution, the accused had concocted an elaborate ruse to suggest that Faridz had a motive to frame him. It was highlighted that this pertained to an incident where Faridz had “stripped and showed his genitals” to a friend’s mother, a 76-year old woman. According to the accused, he had instructed one Mohamed Farid bin Azman (DW3) to teach Faridz a lesson over the incident by slapping him. It was highlighted that DW3 was also a member of SKT and was working for the accused in the same company at the material time.

25     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused is an influential leader who was capable of giving out instructions that would be followed by his underlings i.e. DW3. It was submitted that this was evident by the fact that the accused did not personally confront Faridz over the alleged incident but had tasked DW3 instead. It was further submitted that there was no reason why DW3 would be unwilling to give false evidence in Court especially if this meant exonerating the accused, his childhood friend from an extremely serious offence.

#### Material inconsistencies by accused’s testimony and his CFD

26     It was highlighted that there were material inconsistencies in the accused’s testimony and the Case for the Defence (“CFD”) as to whose mother Faridz had flashed at (i.e. _Sopak_ or _Ahamad_’s mother?) as well as to when the incident had occurred (_May 2016_ or _mid August 2016?_). In addition, no other details specifying the time and place of the incident had been provided by the Defence.

27     It was further highlighted from the onset of his arrest to the filing of his CFD, to his evidence at trial, the accused had proffered varying and vacillating accounts to explain the six $1,000 notes that were found on him. It was submitted that Station Inspector Kalai Maran s/o Retanansamy (PW3) had testified that upon the accused’s arrest, his first account was that he had withdrawn the $1,000 notes from an ATM. When probed further as to which ATM could dispense such large denominations, the accused changed his account to state that the money was from his Qoo10 business. When confronted by PW3 as to how his Qoo10 business could pay that much and that all this could be verified with the company, the accused changed his account again to state that the money was from his barbershop business.

28     It was submitted that the accused’s CFD had stated that the monies found in the accused’s possession when he was arrested were _from the family’s barbershop_. No reference was made to state that these monies were from the Qoo10 business or withdrawn from an ATM. Yet during his examination-in-chief, the accused had testified that the six $1,000 notes came from both sources, i.e. his Qexpress and barbershop business. Nevertheless, during his cross-examination, the accused had confirmed that the six $1,000 notes did not come from his barbershop business but from his Qoo10 business, contrary to his examination-in-chief and his CFD. During his re-examination, however the accused had a change of tack and testified that the source of the monies were from Qexpress and barbershop business. It was the Prosecution’s case that viewed holistically, the accused had given wildly inconsistent and incoherent explanations for the six $1,000 notes that were found on him during his arrest and should be disbelieved entirely. It was also the Prosecution’s case that no discernible explanation had been provided by the accused to account for these material discrepancies in his evidence.

29     It was submitted that pursuant to s 169(1)(_c_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) as the Defence had put forth a case which was inconsistent with the CFD, the inference that should be drawn was that the accused was not a credible witness while the entire incident of Faridz flashing at a friend’s mother was nothing more than a fanciful fiction. It was also submitted that the accused was a witness bereft of credit, who had no qualms providing ever-shifting accounts of the night in question and in instigating his underlings in the ‘SKT’ secret society to lie on his behalf.

#### Accused had personally driven the van that was following the bus

30     It was submitted that the accused had personally driven the van following the same bus that the victim and Faridz were in while serving as the getaway driver by picking up the latter almost immediately (less than three minutes) after the robbery. It was the Prosecution’s case that Faridz had given direct evidence that he saw the accused driving the van while following the bus during the journey to Hougang. He was able to recognise the van because of its distinctive Qoo10 stickers.

31     It was further submitted that this was corroborated by the independent evidence of Wong Ter Fatt (“PW6”), a company representative of Qxpress Pte Ltd that manages the logistics of the Qoo10 online business. PW6 gave unequivocal evidence of the following:

> (a)     the motor-van (driving past the bus) shown in the photograph at serial number 16 of _Exhibit P3_ was a silver coloured Nissan NV350;

> (b)     the motor-van was known for its distinctive wing mirrors and had Qoo10 stickers on the left side of the vehicle;

> (c)     at the time in August 2016, there was _only_ one vehicle registered with Qxpress corresponding to the above description which was the accused’s van bearing registration number GBE 3290J

32     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had no innocuous reason for following the said bus apart from the inexorable inference that he was intricately involved in the plan to rob the victim by being readily available as Faridz’s getaway driver once the latter had accomplished the task of robbing the victim. It was submitted that the inference was bolstered by the alacrity with which Faridz was picked up almost immediately after the robbery. After committing the robbery at block 2 Hougang Avenue 3 at 9.29 p.m., Faridz had boarded the van at the nearby junction of Tampines Road and Hougang Avenue 3 barely three minutes later at 9.32 p.m. It was further submitted based on the above, the accused should be convicted of the charge of engaging in a conspiracy with one Mohamed Faridz Bin Abdul Azeez to commit robbery in **DAC 933871 - 2016** under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

33     After having considered the evidence of all six witnesses for the Prosecution as well as the oral submissions from both the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that the Prosecution had made out its case against the accused in respect of the charge in **DAC 933871 - 2016** on which he was being tried. I also found that there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible that satisfied each and every element of the proceeded charge. Accordingly, I called upon the accused to give evidence in his own defence. The accused elected to give evidence in his defence.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

#### Faridz’s evidence is unreliable

34     It was the case for the Defence that the accused had not committed the alleged offence. It was highlighted that the Prosecution had relied solely on Faridz’s evidence in order to prove its case against the accused. It was submitted Faridz was a co-accused whose evidence was unreliable and must therefore be rejected as his evidence on the several material points was false and/totally unsatisfactory.

35     It was submitted that Faridz had testified that he got to know the accused sometime in March 2016 when he was selling illegal cigarettes in Jurong. According to the Defence, this was false as Faridz had admitted under cross-examination that he got to know the accused sometime in early 2016 as fellow members of the SKT secret society and that he had helped the accused to move his belongings to his girlfriend’s house at Punggol.

#### Bad blood between Faridz and the accused

36     It was further submitted that Faridz had testified there was no bad blood between the accused and himself. According to the Defence, this was false. According to the accused, Faridz bore a grudge against him as the accused had arranged for Faridz to be punished for having exposed himself to an old lady. It was submitted that she is the mother of a mutual friend. Mohamed Farid Bin Azman (DW3) had confronted Faridz sometime in early 2016 at Blk 123 in Bedok and had slapped Faridz on the accused’s instructions. It was highlighted that Faridz was evasive and attempted to deny the incident. When confronted with the abovementioned incident in cross-examination, Faridz was defensive and had repeatedly stated that it has nothing to do with the case. The accused had admitted he had to take control because Faridz was under his charge in the secret society.

#### Purpose of the meeting on 29 August 2016

37     It was submitted that Faridz had claimed that he had met the accused on 29 August 2016 around 6 p.m. at Lorong 16 Geylang to deliver cigarettes to the accused. According to the Defence, this evidence was false as Faridz had met the accused on 29 August 2016 for the purpose of selling illegal cigarettes to Mohamad Feroz bin Hussain (DW2).

38     It was further submitted that DW2 had testified that he had met Faridz on 29 August 2016 at Lorong 16 Geylang and had purchased illegal cigarettes from him. DW2 had inquired from the accused where he could purchase illegal cigarettes and the accused had arranged the meeting between DW2 and Faridz. It was highlighted that the accused had also confirmed that he had ordered cigarettes from Faridz for DW2.

#### Faridz’s false evidence that he placed the cigarettes in the accused’s van

39     It was the Defence’s case that Faridz had falsely testified that he had delivered the cigarettes to the accused by placing them in his van. It was submitted that Faridz did not explain how he entered Bob’s van or where he allegedly placed the cigarettes inside the van. It was highlighted that DW2 had testified that he had received the cigarettes from Faridz in a black plastic bag at the carpark outside Palace Hotel 81 on Lorong 16 and he had then proceeded to Lorong 14 to put the cigarettes in his car.

#### The alleged conversation in the accused’s van

40     It was the Defence’s case that Faridz had falsely testified that he had entered the accused’s van, sat in the passenger seat and talked to the accused. Both the accused and DW2 had testified that the accused and Faridz had walked towards the coffeeshop after DW2 collected the illegal cigarettes from Faridz. DW2 had joined them at the coffeeshop after depositing the cigarettes in his car.

#### The allegation that the accused had informed that the old man was carrying cash

41     With respect to Faridz’s allegation of the conversation was about the case in which he robbed the old man, it was submitted that his account of his alleged conversation was notoriously vague. It was further submitted that initially he did not state that the accused had given him instructions to rob the old man. When he asked to elaborate, Faridz had stated that the accused had told him that he was ‘aiming for the old man’. However, when he was questioned why the accused was aiming for this particular old man, he stated that he had no answer. It was the Defence’s case that the allegation that the accused had informed that the old man was carrying cash was blatantly false as this was in order to implicate the accused. It was submitted that both the accused and DW2 had testified that there was no conversation between Faridz and the accused in the van.

#### The alleged conversation about following the old man

42     It was submitted that Faridz had admitted that the effect of the ‘Epam’ that he had consumed drove him to commit the offence. It was highlighted that Faridz had vaguely alleged that the conversation in the van also involved the topic of following the old man. It was further submitted that once again, this allegation was notoriously vague even when he was questioned as to how the accused pointed out the old man, Faridz gave an incoherent answer.

#### The meeting at the coffeeshop on Geylang Lorong 16

43     It was submitted that Faridz had alleged that he waited at the coffeeshop together with the accused. He further alleged that the accused pointed out the old man while waiting at the coffeeshop. It was the Defence’s case that Faridz’s account of the coffeeshop meeting was refuted by both the accused and DW2 and all three of them were at the coffee shop. According to the Defence, the accused had introduced Faridz to DW2. They had some beverages and the accused left the coffee shop. DW2 left the coffeeshop a short while later. Both of them had observed that Faridz was under the influence of drugs. It was submitted that this was also confirmed by Faridz when he admitted that he had consumed ‘Epam’ on that day.

#### The allegation that the accused was following the bus

44     It was submitted that Faridz had alleged that he had followed the old man and boarded the bus together with him. He further alleged that the accused had followed his bus in his van. It was the Defence’s case that Faridz’s account was once again unreliable and replete with errors. He described the van as a ‘red’ Qoo10 van. Faridz then contradicted himself by stating that the colour of the vehicle is grey. Upon being shown pictures of the van, he stated that the original colour of the vehicle is silver.

45     It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution placed much reliance on Faridz’s evidence that the accused had followed the bus. It was submitted that the Prosecution had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the van that was seen in the CCTV footage is the van that was driven by the accused on 29 August 2016. It was further submitted that the Prosecution did not rebut the evidence of Wong Ter Fatt (PW6) and the investigating officer Kalai Mahran s/o Retanamsamy (PW3).

46     It was highlighted that PW6 was the group leader and Senior Manager of QXpress. He had stated that he had requested for and received records of vehicles deployed by all 13 vendors including Is Smiling Express. He had produced the log card of the van that was driven by the accused at the material time (_Exhibit P4_). He further clarified that he had asked each of the contractors whether they had the vehicle’s bearing the registration number GPE3297J which was the registration number of the accused’s van. Under cross-examination, he had also agreed that there had been a silver coloured vehicle and vans of the same model that may not have been specified by the contractors. It was also significant to note that the Prosecution did not call any of the vendors. It was the Defence’s case that PW6’s evidence in relation to the vehicles deployed by the vendor was at best hearsay.

47     It was submitted that PW3 gave evidence in rebuttal in an attempt to establish that the locations shown in the photographs marked as _Exhibit P5, Exhibit P6_ and _Exhibit P7_ and situated along bus route number 62. It was the Defence’s case that _Exhibit P5_ to _Exhibit P7_ had been printed by the learned DPP and given to PW3. PW3 further admitted that he did not physically verify the locations showing the photographs. It was submitted that PW3’s rebuttal evidence was therefore based on unverified facts and should be rejected.

#### Faridz’s false allegation that the accused gave him a part of the stolen money

48     It was submitted that Faridz had alleged that he had given the accused the bag that contained the stolen money and that the latter had opened the bag and had shown him the money inside the bag. He had further alleged that the accused’s had given him $2,000 of the stolen money after they reached the accused’s girlfriend’s house.

49     It was the Defence’s case that this evidence was entirely contrary to the facts set out in Paragraph 26 of the Statement of Facts marked _Exhibit D1_ that Faridz had pleaded guilty to. According to Paragraph 26 of the Statement of Facts, Faridz had snatched a black waist pouch from the victim containing the money. Faridz then went to East Coast Park by taxi and threw the black waist pouch into the dustbin. Thereafter Faridz took a taxi to the accused’s girlfriend’s house in Punggol. When confronted with the Statement of Facts, Faridz PW1 claimed that he was disputing the facts therein and stated that it was just for the purpose of reducing the sentence. It was submitted that the Statement of Facts was drafted by the Prosecution and the facts therein must be taken as true and correct. It was further submitted Faridz’s evidence in this case contradicts the Statement of Facts was therefore demonstrably false.

#### The accused’s account of the events of 29 August 2016

50     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had given a candid and fruitful account of the events that transpired on 29 August 2019. At the outset, he had no hesitation in disclosing that he was a member of the SKT Secret Society and that Faridz was a fellow member of this society.

51     It was submitted that the accused had admitted that he got DW3 to teach Faridz a lesson because his actions were reprehensible and could not be taken lightly in the secret society. It was further submitted that the accused had admitted that he had contacted Faridz and arranged for DW2 to purchase cigarettes from Faridz. The accused had also admitted that he had specified the rendezvous at the parking lot outside Palace Hotel 81 at Lorong 16 in Geylang.

52     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had arrived in his van parked at Lorong 18 Geylang and proceeded on foot to the agreed meeting place. The accused was the first to arrive followed by Faridz who was driving a blue coloured Mitsubishi Lancer while DW2 had arrived on foot. Faridz gave DW2 the illegal cigarettes in a red-coloured plastic bag and DW2 then gave Faridz the money for the cigarettes. The accused and Faridz had walked to the coffeeshop on Lorong 16 Geylang while DW2 went to deposit the cigarettes in his vehicle. DW2 then joined them at the coffeeshop a few minutes later.

53     It was submitted that during the meeting at the coffeeshop, the accused had observed that Faridz was not normal. According to the acused, Faridz was stuttering, stammering and repeating himself. The accused had gone to the coffeeshop in order to introduce Faridz to DW2 and to facilitate any further cigarette transactions between them.

54     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had left the meeting after a brief conversation. After leaving Geylang, he drove in the direction of Punggol to his girlfriend’s house and provided a detailed description of the route he followed. Before he reached Punggol, Faridz had called the accused and requested him to collect him at several locations in Hougang. The accused then drove to the different locations specified by Faridz.

55     It was submitted that Faridz had also specified the En-Naeem Mosque as a pickup location. The accused then proceeded towards the En-Naeem Mosque. Before he could reach the mosque, Faridz had dashed into the accused’s vehicle. It was further submitted that the accused was shocked and did not know how to react as he was focusing on the road. According to him, Faridz was panting and told the accused to drive off. The accused did not observe Faridz carrying anything.

56     It was the Defence’s case that as they reached Block 101D Punggol, Faridz had alighted from the van. He informed the accused that he wished to go to a convenient store opposite Block 101D of Punggol. The accused then parked his van in a multi-storey carpark and proceeded to his girlfriend’s unit in block 101D. Faridz was waiting for him outside the flat. The accused had a shower while Faridz remained in the dining/living area of the flat. After he finished his shower, Faridz requested him to drive him back to Lorong 16 Geylang and the accused had acceded to his request.

#### The accused accounted for the $6,755 found in in his possession at the time of his arrest

57     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had produced his bank statements for the period 31 May 2016 to 31 August 2016 (_Exhibit D4_). It was submitted that this showed a consistent pattern of deposits of monies earned from the accused’s Qoo10’s delivery. It was submitted that these monies were deposited by the main contractor, one ‘Mohd Ismail’ every Friday. The statement of account for August 2016 showed that, Mohd Ismail had deposited $3,114, $2,658, $3,074 and $2,692 on 5th 12th 19th and 26th August 2016 respectively. It was further submitted that the bank statements for June and July 2016 also show a similar pattern of deposits by Mohd Ismail. It further showed that the accused had withdrawn substantial sums of cash from his bank account.

58     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had also testified that the revenue of his barber shops were collected every three days and changed into larger denominations at the Ho Bee jewellery shop and Jabba’s Money Changing Business. He would then keep this money in a bag at home. It was submitted that the accused’s mother, Hajarah Bee bte Abdul Ghani (DW4) had corroborated the accused. She had testified that the accused brought the collection of the barber shops home and it was kept in a pouch. It was also the Defence’s case that a moneychanger, Jaabar Eusof s/o Sarbudeen (DW5) had also corroborated the accused’s evidence. It was submitted that he had confirmed that the accused changed a smaller denomination of money into bigger notes once or twice a week.

59     It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution has not established the charge beyond reasonable doubt. The accused had given a complete and candid account of the events of his interaction with Faridz on 29 August 2016. Furthermore, the accused had fully accounted for the money that was found in his possession at the time of his arrest.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

#### Purported interactions at the coffeeshop between Faridz, the accused and DW2

60     The Prosecution had highlighted that it was the Defence’s submissions on the purported interactions between Faridz, the accused and DW2 at the coffeeshop was such that the accused would have had no time to speak to Faridz about the plan to rob the victim. In reply, it was submitted that it was also the Defence’s case that DW2 was the intended purchaser of the cigarettes from Faridz and not the accused. It was the Prosecution’s case that this meeting involving DW2 had never happened.

61     It was submitted that with regard to the description of the length of the meeting at the coffeeshop, it was highlighted that DW2 had testified during both his examination-in-chief and cross-examination that the meeting had lasted for an hour. It was further submitted that the duration was inconsistent and in stark contrast with the description at paragraph 6 of the CFD where the Defence Counsel had stated that “…_The duration of this meeting at the coffeeshop lasted about 5 to 10 minutes_…”

62     It was the Prosecution’s case that why this meeting never took place was the inherent illogical nature of DW2’s evidence about why he was there at the coffeeshop. With regard to DW2’s evidence, prior to going to the coffeeshop he had allegedly received a shipment of cigarettes from Faridz. It was highlighted that DW2’s purported aim of meeting with Faridz to begin with was to source for illegal contraband cigarette suppliers. Notwithstanding this purported aim, for the entire hour that DW2 had came to be at the coffeeshop, during his testimony he admitted that he had not asked for Faridz’s contact details.

63     It was submitted that DW2 had claimed that he had left the location and did not want to have any dealings with Faridz because he thought Faridz was high on drugs. He had also admitted that this was his observation that he made at the start and he wanted to have no affiliation with potential drug offenders. Notwithstanding that, DW2 had claimed in his testimony that he stayed at the coffeeshop for a further one hour even though he wanted to have nothing to do with Faridz. It was the Prosecution’s case that this evidence was illogical and it was reiterated that the meeting had never happened.

## G.   Defence’s Reply

64     In response to the Prosecution’s reply submissions, it was submitted that DW2 had given a reasonable and credible explanation for not wanting to have Faridz’s number. It was submitted that on that particular day, there were no illegal cigarettes around for sale around Geylang due to the raid that had been conducted. He had therefore reached out to the accused person. It was further submitted that the accused had facilitated the meeting between DW2 and Faridz. It was the Defence’s case that DW2 had testified that he had other sources from which he could buy cigarettes. Therefore, he did not see the need to contact Faridz in future and hence did not exchange numbers with Faridz.

65     In response to the Prosecution’s position that the meeting itself never took place, it was submitted that the accused and DW2 had confirmed that there was indeed such a meeting. In relation to the Prosecution’s submissions that DW2 was trying to help the accused because he is a friend by giving false evidence, this was rejected by DW2.

## H.   Assessment of Evidence

66     The accused had claimed trial to a charge of engaging in a conspiracy with one Mohamed Faridz Bin Abdul Azeez to commit robbery in **DAC 933871 - 2016** under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed). In relation to this charge, it was brought to my attention that his co-accused Mohamed Faridz Bin Abdul Azeez had pleaded guilty earlier on 3 November 2016 to a related reduced charge of snatch theft under s 356 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed) in **DAC 933872 - 2016** and was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment.

67     In view of the undisputed facts as set out at paragraph 9 above, the main issue before me was whether the accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Faridz to commit robbery of monies, the gold bracelet and the mobile phone in the possession of one Ng Bok Wah (“the victim”) on 29 August 2016. I was mindful that the accused and Faridz were together both prior and after Faridz had committed robbery of the black coloured waist pouch and its contents from the victim on 29 August 2019 at 9.29 p.m. What I had to determine was whether the accused was involved in this robbery and whether he had knowingly engaged with Faridz in a conspiracy to commit robbery as defined under s 390(2) Penal Code.

68     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused was the mastermind of the robbery who had instigated Faridz to commit the robbery. In contrast, the accused denies being involved in this conspiracy to rob the victim and the main thrust of the defence was that the Prosecution’s key witness Faridz was an unreliable witness who had framed the accused.

69     In the present case, after a careful assessment of the evidence before me, I accepted Faridz’s unequivocal evidence and found that sometime around 5.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. on 29 August 2016 Faridz had met up with the accused at Geylang Lorong 16, Singapore. They had met for Faridz to deliver the contraband cigarettes that the accused had ordered from him. After Faridz had placed the cigarettes in the accused’s van, as they sat together in the van, it was then that the accused told Faridz of his plan to rob the victim. I agreed with the Prosecution that as a headman in the SKT, the accused is an influential leader who was capable of giving out instructions that would be complied by his loyal underlings such as DW2, DW3 as well as Faridz.

70     Furthermore, from the facts it was clear that the accused and Faridz were close friends who frequently spent time together and were even arrested while they were together at Block 115 Bedok North Road on 1 September 2016 for the present case. In my view, it was under these circumstances that the accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Faridz to commit robbery on the victim. It was clear from that the facts that the accused was the mastermind of the plan to commit robbery on the victim a known prolific gambler who was known to carry large sums of the money in the Geylang area.

71     I also accepted Faridz’s evidence that after the accused had identified the victim to him, Faridz then followed the victim until they boarded bus No. 62 at 8.52 p.m. at Geylang Lorong 23. The accused had followed the said bus in his silver Qoo10 van. I accepted Faridz’s evidence that he had seen the accused driving his van while following the bus during the journey to Hougang. He was able to recognise the van because of its distinctive Qoo10 stickers. His evidence was corroborated by the objective evidence from the various footages obtain from various sources in _Exhibit P3_ tendered by the Prosecution that showed the movement of Faridz, the victim and the accused at the material points in time on 29 August 2016.

72     I further accepted Faridz’s evidence that throughout the journey, he was in constant communication with the accused through his mobile phone and had informed the accused when he and the victim alighted from the bus. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had personally driven his van that followed the bus that the victim and Faridz were in and that he had also served as the getaway driver when he picked Faridz up shortly after the robbery. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had no other reason for following the said bus apart from the fact that he was intricately involved in the plan to rob the victim by being readily available as Faridz’s getaway driver once the latter had accomplished the task of robbing the victim. To my mind, it was not coincidental the way the accused had picked Faridz up almost immediately after the robbery as the words and actions of both the accused and Faridz indicated their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design for Faridz to rob the victim and for the accused to facilitate his getaway after the robbery.

73     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused and Faridz were close friends with no history of bad blood between them and they met up regularly approximately twice a week during the period of July to August 2016. Hence, I found that there was no reason for Faridz to frame the accused for the present charge because the latter had purportedly arranged for DW3 to teach him a lesson for flashing at the mother of a mutual friend.

74     On the facts, I found that the accused had given inconsistent and incoherent explanations for the six $1,000 notes that were found on him during his arrest. Apart from the discrepancies as to the source of the six $1,000 as highlighted by the Prosecution, I noted that at paragraph 18 of the CFD, states that “_The accused would periodically withdraw cash in large denominations for his business transactions. The large denominations would then be changed into smaller denominations at various pawnshops or 4D shops._” This was yet another inconsistent as well as contradictory reason provided by the Defence to account for the monies that were found on the accused. On this basis, I agreed with the Prosecution that no discernible explanations had been provided by the accused to account for the monies that were found on him during his arrest as well as the material discrepancies in his evidence. Furthermore, pursuant to s 169(1)(_c_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) as the Defence had put forth a case which was inconsistent with the CFD, I found that the accused was not a credible witness.

75     I rejected his defence that he suspected that Faridz had framed him after the accused had punished him through DW3 for flashing at a friend’s mother. To my mind, this was an afterthought without any basis designed to deflect the accused’s involvement in the robbery that was committed on the victim. As highlighted by the Prosecution, there were material inconsistencies in the accused’s testimony and the CFD as to whose mother Faridz had flashed at i.e. _Sopak_ or _Ahamad_’s mother as well as to when the incident had occurred i.e. _May 2016_ or _mid August 2016_. In addition, no other details specifying the time and place of the incident had been provided by the Defence. Furthermore, I agreed with the Prosecution that Faridz having pleaded guilty to his involvement in the offence against the victim, he had no reason or incentive to perjure himself given his close friendship with the accused at the material time.

76     I also rejected DW2 evidence that he was present with the accused and Faridz on 29 August 2016. I found that his testimony as to the length of the meeting at the coffeeshop was inconsistent and in stark contrast with the description at paragraph 6 of the CFD where it was stated that it has lasted about 5 to 10 minutes_._ I agreed with the Prosecution that DW2’s meeting with Faridz and the accused never took place due to the inherent illogical nature of DW2’s evidence as to why he was present at the coffeeshop. It was the Defence’s case that the accused had introduced DW2 to Faridz as he needed to get illegal contraband cigarettes from another supplier as they had become unavailable due to a raid in Geylang. Yet, in the course of their alleged meeting at the coffeeshop, DW2 confirmed that he had not make any attempts to obtain Faridz’s contact details.

77     According to DW2, it was because Faridz was high on drugs and he did not want anything to do with him. Nevertheless, he testified that he was at the coffeeshop with Faridz and the accused for an hour. His Counsel had sought to explain the reason why DW2 had not obtained Faridz’s contact as by arguing that DW2 had testified that he had other sources from which he could buy cigarettes. Therefore, he did not see the need to contact Faridz in future and hence did not exchange numbers with Faridz. To my mind, if that was truly the case, there was thus no need for DW2 to meet Faridz on 29 August 2016 to obtain the cigarettes in any event.

78     DW3 had testified that sometime at the end of May or June 2016, he had given Faridz a tight slap as instructed by the accused to teach Faridz a lesson for flashing at Sopak’s mother. This was consistent with the accused’s testimony that he had instructed DW3 to teach Faridz a lesson sometime in May 2016. As highlighted earlier, this is clearly contradictory to the CFD where it was stated that the flashing incident took place in mid-August 2016 after Faridz had flashed at one Ahamad’s mother. Based on the above, I found that DW3 was not a credible witness and rejected his evidence on his role in teaching Faridz’s a lesson. It was clear that DW3 would be willing to give false evidence in Court especially if this meant exonerating the accused, his childhood friend from an extremely serious offence.

79     Consequently, I rejected the Defence’s case that Faridz had framed the accused because the accused believed that Faridz may have held a grudge against him for getting DW3 to teach him a lesson for flashing at a mutual friend’s mother. Based on a careful consideration of all the evidence before me, I found that the accused’s attempts to exculpate himself was wholly incapable of belief, primarily because of the evasive and shifting nature of his evidence whenever confronted with an inconsistency. Accordingly, I disregarded his evidence as I found that he was not a credible witness.

80     In summary, I found that the accused was the mastermind of the robbery who had instigated Faridz to do so. I also found that he was intricately involved throughout the process by following close by, serving as Faridz’s getaway driver after the deed was done and retaining the bulk of the monies that was robbed from the victim. Consequently, I rejected his defence that Faridz bore a grudge against him and had implicated him in the present charge to frame him.

81     Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the Prosecution had established its case beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had engaged in a conspiracy with one Mohamed Faridz Bin Abdul Azeez to commit robbery in **DAC 933871 - 2016** under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed). I found him guilty and convicted him on the said charge.

82     Subsequently, on 30 August 2019, the accused pleaded guilty before me to his two remaining charges namely, the outstanding charge in **DAC 938964 -2016** and an additional charge of voluntarily causing hurt in **MCN 901106-2019** under s 323 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).

## Statement of Facts

83     The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) prepared by the Prosecution that the accused admitted to without qualification is as follows:

> **“I**.     **INTRODUCTION**

> 1.    The accused is one Muhammad Qayyuum Bin Sulong, a 34-year old Singaporean male (date of birth: 17 January 1985.

> **II**.     **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2nd CHARGE (DAC-938964-2016)**

> 2.    On 1 September 2016 at about 4.35 p.m., the accused was placed under arrest at the shelter beside Blk 115 Bedok North Road, which is a public place. During his arrest, a foldable knife with a blade length of 3 cm was seized from his possession. Investigations revealed that the accused did not have lawful authority to possess the knife in public.

> 3.    The accused subsequently admitted to buying the said knife at a night market sometime prior to his arrest. By having the said knife in his possession in a public place without lawful authority or purpose, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed).

> **III**.     **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3rd CHARGE (MCN-901106-2019)**

> 4.    This offence was committed by the accused while he was on court bail.

> 5.    The victim is Allen Kamal, a 35-year old American national.

> 6.    The witnesses, who were all police officers on duty at the material time, are Sergeant Yuvarani d/o Mahendran, Station Inspector Ang Siao Siong, and Senior Staff Sergeant Chen Tianxiang Ivan.

> 7.    In the early morning of 1 January 2019, the victim was at a club (The Pump Room) in Clark Quay with a group of friends. The accused was likewise spending time at the same club with another groups of friends and had consumed alcohol on that night.

> 8.    Sometime prior to 2.45 a.m., friends from the victim’s group got into a dispute with friends from the accused’s group as they were leaving the club. During this time, members from both groups started shouting at the other side at 3D River Valley Road.

> 9.    Fortuitously, the witnesses, who were on duty at the time were patrolling in the vicinity. They attempted to keep the peace by physically separating both sides involved in the conflict. During this time, the victim raised his middle finger and pointed it in the general direction of the accused and his friends.

> 10.    Angry and upset, the accused went over to the victim and punched him once in the jaw while challenging the victim to fight him at about 3.06 a.m. The victim, however, did not retaliate. The accused and the victim were subsequently separated by the police officers on duty who witnessed the assault, while the accused was placed under arrest thereafter.

> 11.    Due to the accused’s punch, the victim felt bodily pain but did not seek medical treatment. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 12.    The accused stands charged accordingly.

## J.   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

#### DAC 933871 - 2016

85     In the Prosecution’s address on sentence for the charge under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code, the Prosecution had sought an uplift of the sentence from the mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane but left the specific quantum to the Court. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had not displayed an iota of remorse in the conduct of his defence at trial. He had concocted an elaborate ruse to suggest that Faridz had a motive to frame him. This involved getting multiple witnesses to lie for him and these witnesses consisted of his underlings within the same secret society. The Prosecution highlighted the premeditated nature of the offence as a whole whereby he had deliberately targeted a vulnerable elderly victim. It was submitted that the accused had attempted to obstruct justice by deliberately giving the wrong password to the investigating officers because he knew the incriminating contents of his communication with Faridz would be found on his hand phone.

#### MCN 901106-2019

86     Next, in respect of the s 323 Penal Code charge, it was submitted that the custodial sentence had been crossed but had left the specific quantum of the sentence to the Court. It was highlighted that the accused had two previous antecedents in 2004 under s 323 Penal Code and a previous antecedent in 2011 under s 324 Penal Code where he was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

87     With regard to the aggravating factors, firstly it was highlighted that the present offence was committed while he was on bail and in the middle of an ongoing trial. Secondly, it was submitted that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the assault. Thirdly, it was further submitted that the accused committed the offence in full view of police officers who were attempting to keep the peace and had just separated the two sides involved in the doubled conflict. It was the Prosecution’s case that this underscores a blatant disregard for police authority.

88     It was highlighted the factors that detracted from the accused’s culpability were namely the victim’s provocative act of pointing the middle finger at the accused and his group of friends and the fact that the injuries suffered by the victim was relatively minor, namely bodily pain. Nevertheless, in light of his antecedents and the aggravating factors present, the custodial threshold had been crossed.

#### DAC 938964 -2016

89     With regard to the second charge of possession of an offensive weapon under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapon Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev.Ed.)), the Prosecution had indicated that the benchmark sentence was six months imprisonment but did not make any particular address on the specific quantum.

## K.   Mitigation

90     In his written mitigation, Defence Counsel had submitted that the mandatory minimum sentence must be two years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. It was the Defence’s case that the meetings took place before 7.00 p.m. and therefore the minimum sentence should be penned at 2 years’ and 6 strokes and not three years’ and 12 strokes as contended by the Prosecution.

91     It was highlighted that Faridz’s account of his alleged conversation was notoriously vague as initially he did not state that the accused had given him instructions to rob the old man. When he was requested to elaborate, Faridz stated that the accused told him that he was aiming for the old man. However, when he was questioned why was the accused aiming for this particular old man, he had no answer.

92     It was further submitted that Faridz had vaguely alleged that the conversation in the van also involved the topic of following the old man. Once again, this allegation was notoriously vague even when he was asked leading questions as to how the accused had pointed out the old man. It was the case for the Defence that given the ambiguity of Faridz’s account of his conversation with the accused, there was no clear evidence that Faridz’s acts were in consequence of the conversation with the accused.

93     Under s 109 Penal Code, it was submitted that there must be a clear nexus between the abetment and offence in order for the abettor to be punished with punishment provided for the crime. Defence Counsel referred to the High Court in _Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athananasius v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 826</span> on the elements of abetment. It was further submitted that the accused’s role was confined to assisting Faridz to leave the vicinity from which he had committed the offence. It was the case for the Defence that the accused’s involvement was confined to events after the offence. As his involvement in this incident was very minimal, no uplift in sentence was warranted.

94     In respect of the charge of possession of the foldable knife with the 3 cm blade, it was submitted that it was an instrument with a dual purpose of a money clip with a sharp end. According to his Counsel, he had bought it at a night market prior to his arrest. The accused had used it as part of his work to open boxes and also as a purse to store money. It was submitted that the benchmark sentence of six months was grossly excessive and a sentence of no more than four weeks was justified.

95     In respect of the charge of voluntarily causing hurt, it was submitted that the accused was solely trying to keep the peace. In the course of doing so, the victim had belligerently pointed his middle finger at the accused. It was further submitted that given the tense situation that was prevailing, this was an extreme act of provocation by the victim. According to Defence Counsel, the accused was simply reacting to this act of provocation. Upon being approached by the police, he had immediately surrendered himself and co-operated with the police. As the Prosecution had no specific address for this charge, the Defence similarly had no submissions on sentence.

## L.   Prosecution’s Reply

96     In response to the Defence Counsel’s submissions on the appropriate sentence, it was submitted that the literal wording of s 392 Penal Code states that if the robbery is committed after 7 p.m. and before 7 a.m., the punishment is not less than three years’ imprisonment and not less than 12 strokes. This is irrespective of whether it was a charge of abetment by instigation or conspiracy as to when the instigating words were said or when the conspiracy was hatched.

97     In the present case, the charge was framed under that of conspiracy and it was submitted that in any case the accused was involved throughout at all stages from the planning to the following of the victim and finally picking up the accused after the robbery was committed. It was further submitted that even if the Defence Counsel’s positon was taken at its highest, this would still result in the mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ and 12 strokes.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### **DAC 933871 - 2016** - s 392 read with 109 Penal Code

101    In the present case, the accused had claimed trial to a charge of engaging in a conspiracy with one Mohamed Faridz Bin Abdul Azeez to commit robbery under s 392 read with s 109 Penal Code. The Prosecution had sought an uplift of the sentence from the mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane as the accused had not displayed an iota of remorse in the conduct of his defence at trial. It was submitted that he had concocted an elaborate ruse to suggest that Faridz had a motive to frame him, had multiple witnesses to lie for him and these witnesses consisted of his underlings within the same secret society. The Prosecution had also highlighted the premeditated nature of the offence as a whole whereby he had deliberately targeted a vulnerable elderly victim.

102    In contrast, despite having being convicted on the charge, Defence Counsel in his plea in mitigation continued to maintain that there was ambiguity of Faridz’s account of his conversation with the accused and there was no clear evidence that Faridz’s acts were in consequence of the conversation with the accused. In addition, despite my finding that he was the mastermind in the commission of his offence, it was submitted that the accused’s involvement was confined to events _after_ the offence and as his involvement in this incident was very minimal, no uplift in sentence was warranted. It was further the Defence’s case that the meetings took place before 7.00 p.m. and therefore the minimum sentence should be penned at 2 years’ and 6 strokes.

103    To my mind, the position of the Defence is indicative of his lack of remorse for this offence. Furthermore, as he had claimed trial to the said charge, he was not entitled to any discount in sentencing that is usually afforded to an accused who had pleaded guilty. As the accused was the mastermind who was intricately involved throughout the process of the robbery, I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift in the sentence was warranted. I also disagreed with Defence Counsel’s submissions that as the meetings took place before 7.00 p.m., therefore the minimum sentence should be penned at 2 years’ and 6 strokes. Accordingly, after taking into account the accused’s level of culpability and the degree of harm caused, I imposed a sentence of _3 years’ 3 months imprisonment_ and _12 strokes_ of the cane.

#### **DAC 938964 -2016** - s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapon Act

104    The accused had pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of an offensive weapon, namely a foldable knife with a blade length of 3 cm in a public place without any lawful authority or lawful purpose under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapon Act. The foldable knife was found in his possession when he was arrested on 1 September 2016 at the shelter beside Blk 115 Bedok North Road, which is a public place. According to the accused, he had purchased the knife at a night market prior to his arrest.

105    As correctly submitted by the Prosecution, the usual sentence or starting point for such an offence was six months’ imprisonment as well as the mandatory minimum six strokes of the cane: see _Public Prosecutor v Kwan Wing Khuen_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 287</span>. The Prosecution did not seek any specific quantum of imprisonment while the Defence suggested a sentence of no more than four weeks’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the knife had a dual purpose as it was a money clip with a sharp end.

106    As the accused had pleaded guilty to the said charge, I was of the view that a sentence was _six months’ imprisonment_ and _six strokes_ of the cane was just and appropriate. A sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was wholly inappropriate as it was even lower than the usual sentence of three months’ imprisonment imposed for a related lower charge for possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or purpose under s 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev. Ed.). This offence is punishable with an imprisonment term of not exceeding two years with no provision for caning.

#### **MCN 901106-2019** - s 323 Penal Code

107    The accused had also pleaded guilty to a charge of voluntarily cause hurt to one Allen Kamal under s 323 Penal Code by punching one Allen Kamal once on his right jaw, causing bodily pain to him after a dispute at 3D River Valley Road, Clarke Quay, Singapore.

108    It was the Prosecution’s case that there were aggravating factors present. Firstly, the offence was committed while he was on bail and in the middle of an ongoing trial for _DAC 933871 - 2016_. Secondly, it was submitted that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the assault. Thirdly, it was further submitted that the accused committed the offence in full view of police officers who were attempting to keep the peace and who had just separated the two sides involved in the doubled conflict. The accused also had similar previous antecedent under s 323 Penal Code and s 324 Penal Code, it was the Prosecution’s case that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

109    It was the Defence’s case that the accused had only tried to keep the peace. In the course of doing so, the victim had belligerently pointed his middle finger at the accused. It was submitted that given the tense situation that was prevailing, this was an extreme act of provocation by the victim and the victim had reacted to this provocation.

110    After having considered the victim’s act of pointing the middle finger at the accused and his group of friends, the relatively minor injuries suffered by the victim was relatively minor, namely bodily pain as well as his similar antecedents, I imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment.

## Global sentence

111    After having decided on the individual sentences, I had to decide which of the sentences should run consecutively. This was because by virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), I must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

112    In the present case, I was of the view that the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct could be encompassed in two consecutive sentences. Hence, I ordered the sentences for **DAC 933871 - 2016** and **MCN 901106 - 2019** to run consecutively as they were separate and distinct offences and the sentence for the remaining charge in **DAC 938964 - 2016** to run concurrently. His total sentence was **three years’ 4 months’ imprisonment** and **18 strokes** of the cane with effect from 30 August 2019.

113    Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal on 30 August 2019 against his conviction in **DAC 933871 - 2016** as well as his sentences in respect of all three charges in **DAC 933871 - 2016**, **DAC 938964 - 2016** and **MCN 901106 - 2019.** I ordered the commencement of his imprisonment to be stayed and he is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
