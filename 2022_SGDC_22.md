Upon their conviction, the accused persons further admitted and consented for the remaining 36 charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The total amount of gratification involved for the proceeded charges amounted to $493,035.15. The total amount of gratification involved for all the charges, including the TIC charges, amounted to **S$595,230.77**.

## The Charges

4       The charges against Koh and Low were similarly framed, save that Koh was named as the recipient of the gratification, while Low was named as the giver of the gratification. The table of summary of the proceeded charges are as follows:

8       The Prosecution has appealed against the sentences imposed on both accused persons. Low has appealed against the sentence imposed on him. There was no appeal from Koh. I now set out the reasons for the sentences imposed.

## The Joint Statement of Facts (JSOF)

9       The Joint Statement of Facts (JSOF) which both accused persons admitted to without qualification are as follows:

> **I.**      **THE ACCUSED**

> 1    The first accused is **Koh Siong Wee Ivan** (“**Koh**”), a male 50-year-old Singapore citizen (DOB: 5 February 1970) (NRIC: XXX). Koh was employed by the NLB on 6 October 2003 as Manager, Product Development. At the material time (i.e. between 2005 and 2010), Koh was a Manager in NLB’s Digital Library Services Department (subsequently known as Digital Resource Services Department).

> 2    Between 2001 and 2009, Koh was also the sole director of a company, Speedcuts Pte Ltd (“**Speedcuts**”). Speedcuts provided hair cutting services.

> 3    The second accused is **Low Pok Woen** (“**Low**”), a male 51-year-old Singapore citizen (DOB: 23 October 1968) (NRIC: XXX). He was also known as Daniel. At the material time (i.e. between 2005 and 2010), Low was a director and shareholder of the following companies:

>> a.    Database Resource Services Pte Ltd (“**DRSPL**”);

>> b.    JCD Crossmedia Pte Ltd (“**JCD**”); and

>> c.    W3.XS Pte Ltd (“**W3**”).

> 4    All of the above three companies were in the business of providing digital content, e.g. digital databases, electronic books (“**e-books**”) and electronic comics (“**e-comics**”) to the National Library Board (“**NLB**”).

> 5    Between 2001 and 2005, Low was an employee of Speedcuts.

> **II.**      **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 6    On 21 February 2014, one Loy Wee Ing, the Senior Assistant Director of NLB lodged a police report (Report No. A/20140221/2137) informing that Low’s companies may have committed fraud and falsification of document in the course of its supply of digital content to NLB since 2005. He also informed that Koh was either involved in or had supervised NLB’s procurements from Low’s companies.

> 7    The Commercial Affairs Department (“**CAD**”) of Singapore therefore commenced investigation into Low’s companies. CAD eventually took no further action in respect of the alleged forgery and falsification of documents offences. However, in January 2016, the case was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“**CPIB**”) for investigation by CAD.

> **III.**      **THE NATIONAL LIBRARY BOARD**

> 8    NLB is a statutory board established under the National Library Board Act (Cap 197, 2014 Rev Ed). NLB reports to the Ministry of Communications and Information.

> 9    NLB manages the National Library, 26 public libraries and the National Archives. Its functions include:

>> a.    to establish libraries and to promote reading and encourage learning through the use of libraries;

>> b.    to provide a repository for library materials published in Singapore that are deposited with and preserved by the NLB under what is referred to as legal deposit;

>> c.    to acquire a comprehensive collection of library materials including online materials relating to Singapore and its people;

>> d.    to compile and maintain a national union catalogue and a national bibliography;

>> e.    to provide a repository of archives of national or historical significance and to facilitate access to these archives; and

>> f.    to record, preserve and disseminate the history of Singapore through oral history.[^1]

> 10    At the material time, the NLB was categorised into two groups – (a) the Public Library Group (who were responsible for the public libraries under NLB’s purview); and (b) the Reference Library Group (who were responsible for the National Library and reference libraries under NLB’s purview). Both groups operated distinctly under the NLB.

> 11    Sometime around 2004 or 2005, there was a strategic move within NLB towards digitalisation. Digitalisation refers to maintaining of informative digital databases, procuring of electronic resources such as e-books and e-comics and microfilming of old books. The digital databases, e-book and e-comics maintained by NLB can be accessed online by NLB members.

> 12    The NLB’s Digital Resources Services Department (“**DRS**”) was formed and tasked to champion this strategic move. DRS was responsible for identifying suitable electronic resources, as well as procuring those resources, on behalf of the whole of NLB. Buddharaju Lakshmi Narayana Raju (“**Raju**”) was appointed as Director of the DRS; he was the first-in-command within DRS.

> 13    Sometime in 2005, Koh was appointed as a Manager in DRS. He was the second-in-command within DRS. As the second-in-command of DRS, he reported only to Raju. Amongst other duties, Koh oversaw DRS’ human resources, budget and administrative matters.

> 14    At the material time, all employees and staff of NLB, including Koh, signed a Statement of Commitment agreeing to be bound to the NLB’s Code of Ethics and Conduct. Amongst other responsibilities, employees and staff of NLB, including Koh, were dutybound to take reasonable steps to avoid and disclose any conflict of interest. NLB employees and staff, including Koh, were also not permitted to make improper use of inside information or one’s authority in order to gain a benefit. They were required at all times to uphold NLB’s values and in the integrity and good reputation of NLB.

> **IV.**      **THE NATIONAL LIBRARY BOARD’S PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR DIGITAL RESOURCES**

> 15    At the material time, the process for the procurement digital resources in NLB was as follows:

>> a.    Under Koh’s supervision, DRS librarians searched for suitable digital resources for NLB to acquire. Their duties included sourcing for vendors who supplied the said resources.

>> b.    When a potential resource was identified and shortlisted, DRS was required to seek the input of librarians from the Public Library Group and the Reference Library Group. The librarians in these groups would decide on whether the shortlisted resource was suitable for NLB to acquire in accordance with their internal pre-decided set of requirements and guidelines (the “**Priority List**”) and provide their recommendations accordingly.

>> c.    If the shortlisted resource was found to be suitable by the Public Library or the Reference Library Groups, Koh and his team of DRS librarians would contact either the authorised publisher or the vendor for the shortlisted resource. They were also authorised to negotiate (but not agree) with the said publisher or vendor on the price to subscribe to the said resource. The subscription would accordingly allow NLB users and members of the public to access the said digital resource either online or through NLB’s computers at its premises.

>> d.    Once the terms of the subscription, the contract period, and a subscription price was tentatively agreed between the respective DRS librarian and the authorised vendor or publisher, the said DRS librarian would make an assessment on whether the shortlisted digital resource was suitable for NLB. The DRS librarian would take into consideration the price, the degree of demand, and whether it suited NLB users’ needs, amongst other considerations.

>> e.    If the DRS librarian was satisfied with the authorised vendor or publisher’s proposal, the respective DRS librarian would draft approval papers to Raju via Koh recommending NLB’s procurement of the said resource. Amongst other content, the DRS librarian would indicate –

>>> (i)    the price of the resource;

>>> (ii)   the likely estimated or predicted usage of a particular resource by NLB members;

>>> (iii)   the estimated cost-per-usage of the resource;

>>> (iv)   whether the resource could be procured from another authorised vendor or publisher;

>>> (v)    the Public Library and Reference Library Groups’ finding on the resource’s suitability; and

>>> (vi)   the DRS librarian’s final recommendation and assessment on whether to support NLB’s procurement of the resource’s subscription. This would include whether the estimated cost-per-usage justified the acquisition of the resource.

>> f.    Once completed and sent to Koh, Koh would vet the draft approval paper. If Koh agreed with the contents of the draft approval paper, he would forward them to Raju for the latter’s ultimate approval and indicate his support for the librarian’s recommendation. It was also not uncommon for Koh himself to prepare approval papers for renewal of digital resources to Raju in support of NLB’s procurement of particular digital resources. Occasionally, Koh put up approval papers with the DRS librarians’ evaluations for NLB to subscribe to the digital resources (see paragraph \[31\]\[(h) and (i)\] below).

>> g.    As Director of the DRS, Raju would make the final assessment on whether the shortlisted resource recommended by the DRS librarian or Koh should be procured by the NLB. In coming to a decision, he would rely heavily on their recommendations and the information they stated in their approval paper.

>> h.    If Raju approved the said approval paper, Koh or the DRS librarian would submit the said approval paper to NLB’s Finance department for processing.

> 16    The process for renewing an existing subscription of the specific digital resource in NLB was similar to that stated at paragraph \[15\] above, with one material difference: The respective DRS librarian would include two additional considerations in their approval paper to Koh, and subsequently, to Raju, namely:

>> a.    the actual usage by NLB users of the subscribed resource; and

>> b.    the cost-per-usage incurred by NLB.

> 17    In deciding whether to renew the subscription of a specific resource, Raju would consider the actual usage by NLB users of the subscribed resource, whether the actual usage matched with the initial estimated or predicted usage of a particular resource in the previous approval paper, and whether the actual cost-per-usage justified the renewal of the resource, amongst other considerations. He would also rely heavily on the information provided by the respective DRS librarian or Koh who sent him the approval paper.

> **V.**      **BACKGROUND TO THE CORRUPT SCHEME BETWEEN LOW AND KOH**

> 18    Koh learned about NLB’s strategic move towards digitalisation sometime in 2004. Koh shared NLB’s move towards digitalisation with Low. He told Low that Low could explore the business opportunity of providing digital content to NLB to earn a living.

> 19    Subsequently, Koh introduced him to one Terrence Shan Chee Hoong (“**Terrence**”). Koh met Terrence while working in NLB. Koh introduced Low to Terrence as Terrence previously worked as a salesperson and manager for an overseas database publisher. As Terrence had knowledge in the digital content field, Low and Terrence exchanged contacts before parting ways.

> 20    About a month later, Low met Terrence again. At this meeting, Low brought up the idea of exploring the business opportunity to provide digital content to NLB, and in Singapore generally. Terrence was interested in the business opportunity and proceeded to conduct research on the topic and contact overseas publishers. Finding the response from overseas publishers encouraging, Low and Terrence incorporated a company as an authorised vendor for overseas publishers. Profit would be generated for the company whenever a customer subscribed to overseas publishers’ digital resources through the company. Upon such customers’ payment of the subscription fee to the company, the company would receive about 30% of the subscription fee as commission (“commissions” or “profits”) per contract, and forward the remaining fees collected to the overseas publisher. Low would subsequently adopt the same business model in his other two companies, JCD and W3.

> 21    On 17 November 2005, Low incorporated DRSPL to provide digital resources to NLB. Terrence invested money into DRSPL, and owned 30% of DRSPL’s shares. The rest of DRSPL’s shares were owned by Low; there were no other shareholders at the time of incorporation. Sometime in 2006 or 2007, Low’s sister, one Tricia Low Nyuk Foon, joined DRSPL to assist Low in the administrative matters relating to DRSPL. She was paid a monthly salary. In 2014, Low transferred all his shares in DRSPL to Tricia after the CAD commenced their investigations into the company.

> 22    Following DRSPL’s incorporation, Low and Terrence started to sign contracts with overseas publishers and acquired the legal rights to distribute their content in Singapore. Thereafter, they marketed their products to NLB following Koh’s disclosure to Low about NLB’s plan for digitalisation. Low also asked Koh to introduce him to his colleagues who would evaluate the digital resources NLB procured, which Koh did. Low then contacted Koh’s colleagues and introduced DRSPL’s content to them by offering them free access the overseas publishers’ databases for a trial period.

> 23    Subsequently, in January 2007 and May 2009 respectively, Low incorporated another two companies, JCD and W3. Low also supplied digital resources to NLB through these two companies. Low was the only person who was overall-in-charge of all three companies: DRSPL, JCD and W3.

> 24    NLB was the biggest customer of Low’s three companies. Between November 2005 and November 2009, NLB procured:

>> a.    USD 703,075.61 and SGD 5,436,167.73 of digital resources from DRSPL;

>> b.    SGD 512,700 of digital resources from JCD; and

>> c.    SGD 39,164.42 of digital resources from W3.

> **VI.**      **THE CORRUPT SCHEME BETWEEN LOW AND KOH**

> 25    In November 2005, Koh started asking Low for money for various personal purposes.

> 26    Low set aside about 30% of all the profits earned from his three companies’ subscription contracts with NLB to be given as gratification to Koh. Low set aside the monies in a pool (“**30% pool**”) as a reward for Koh’s help to advance Low’s business interests with NLB. Of the remaining 70% of the profits, Low kept aside about 40% for himself and about 30% for Terrence.

> 27    Whenever Koh requested money from Low, Low would take the amount requested from the 30% pool which Low had specifically set aside for Koh, to give to Koh.

> 28    During the material time, Koh requested money from Low for the various purposes, including:

>> a.    to spend on Koh’s personal expenses;

>> b.    to pay the business expenses of Speedcuts, Koh’s side business; and

>> c.    to pay the business expenses of Promopower, a business operated by Koh’s sister, Koh Geok Khing (“**Khing**”).

> 29    In return, Koh would advance Low’s business interests with NLB. The money being paid by Low to Koh and Khing between November 2005 and November 2009 was gratification to Koh as a reward for Koh’s help in advancing Low’s business interests with NLB.

> 30    Examples of how Koh advanced Low’s business interests are below.

> 31     **Firstly**, despite receiving moneys out of the subscriptions paid by NLB to Low’s companies, Koh and Vernon, put up numerous approval papers between November 2005 and November 2009, recommending to Raju the subscription of, and subsequent renewals of, numerous digital resources provided by Low’s companies. Examples can be found below:

>> a.     _Annex 1(a)_ _: Proposal to Subscribe to E-books, including World E-Library dated 28 Sept 2005 costing up to S$500,000;_

>> b.     _Annex 1(b)_ _: Proposal to Subscribe to Jupiter Research costing USD 216,000 dated 23 Jan 2006 by Vernon;_

>> c.     _Annex 1(c):_ _Proposal to Subscribe to Colombia University Press databases dated 13 January 2005 costing USD 20,300 per annum by Vernon;_

>> d.     _Annex 1(d):_ _Proposal to Subscribe to Informa dated 23 Feb 2006 costing S$561,798 by Vernon;_

>> e.     _Annex 1(e):_ _Proposal to Renew TumbleBooks Collection – Tumble Readables and Tumble Talking Books dated Dec 15, 2006 costing S$109,892.16 by Koh;_

>> f.     _Annex 1(f):_ _Proposal to Renew TumbleBooks Collection – Tumble Readables and Tumble Talking Books dated Sept 10, 2007 costing S$29,640 by Koh;_

>> g.     _Annex 1(g):_ _Proposal to Renew TumbleBooks Collection – Tumble Readables and Tumble Talking Books dated April 7, 2008 costing S$87,216 by Koh;_

>> h.     _Annex 1(h):_ _Proposal to Subscribe to Malay E-Magazines and E-books dated June 13, 2006 costing USD 289,520 by Koh; and_

>> i.     _Annex 1(i):_ _Proposals to Subscribe to Chinese Popular E-Comics dated September 28, 2007 costing S$160,000 by Koh._

> 32    Had the approver of the above papers (Raju) known that Vernon and/or Koh were receiving gratification from the vendor supplying the digital resources recommended in the paper, he would not have approved the procurement recommended in the papers. He would have reassigned the resource to another librarian who was not related to the vendor to make an independent assessment of whether the procurement was justified.

> 33     **Secondly**, Koh communicated confidential information to Low with regard to the digital resources that NLB was interested in. With this information, Low could now source the market selectively and supply those resources to NLB when the opportunity came. In particular, Koh communicated the Priority List (see \[15\]\[(b)\] above) and priorities that NLB assigned to each type of digital resource so that Low could: (a) focus his attention on the high priority resources; and (b) know which resources could be sold at a higher price to NLB, as they were highly prioritised by NLB for procurement. An example of Koh communicating such confidential information to Low can be found in:

>> a.     _Annex 2(a)_ _: Email entitled Fw\_ PLS Requirements FY08; and_

>> b.     _Annex 2(b)_ _: Attachment entitled PLSG Requirements FY07 v2_.

> 34     **Thirdly**, Koh communicated confidential information to Low, regarding the metric by which NLB assessed whether a particular digital resource was worth procuring or renewing. In particular, Koh forwarded the minutes of the meeting of NLB’s Chief Executive’s Office Group Management Committee dated 21 May 2008 to Low. At this meeting, it was decided that the Key Performance Indicator (“**KPI**”) that DRS should track and report should be the cost-per-access for databases, rather than the number of databases subscribed to. The communication of this information can be found in:

>> a.     _Annex 3(a)_ _: Email entitled Fw\_CE's Office Group MC – minutes;_

>> b.     _Annex 3(b)_ _: Attachment entitled KPI Defn Template_;

>> c.     _Annex 3(c)_ _: Attachment entitled CEGMC\_21May08\_Minutes\_KPIs_; and

>> d.     _Annex 3(d)_ _: CEGMC\_21May08\_MattersArising._

> 35     **Fourthly**, one of the key metrics used by NLB to measure the cost effectiveness of databases was cost-per-usage of a database. However, even when Koh found out that usage statistics of one of the databases supplied by Low – namely, Jupiter Research database – were distorted because they included hits by webcrawlers, Koh did not report this to his superiors in NLB. Instead, he advised Low as follows:

>> a.    In _Annex 4(a)__: Email entitled FYI\_ Jupiter Usage- Could b a problem\__, Low expressly alerted Koh that suspicions could be aroused that DRSPL “used to be clicking the Jupiter database from our side …”

>> b.    In _Annex 4(b)__: Email entitled Re\_ Requesting for Explanation for the Drop in Jupiter Stats_, Koh told Low that since NLB had not requested DRSPL to investigate where the hits for Jupiter Research came from, Low need not explain to NLB that the previous usage statistics included webcrawler traffic.

> 36     **Fifthly**, Koh was responsible for overseeing the negotiation of the price of digital resources procured by NLB from its vendors. However, in relation to the renewal of the World Ebook Library database, Low told Koh that “we have been clicking on our end jus \[sic\] like any other months”. When Low suggested renewing this database at the same price, as the price had just been increased at the last renewal, Koh responded that Low should “increase and let me bargain down” as it could not be seen that Koh simply agreed to the price that Low suggested. In response, Low told Koh that he would increase the price by 5% from $330,000 to $346,500. This can be seen in:

>> a.     _Annex 5_ _: Email entitled Re\_ WEL renewal._

> 37     **Sixthly**, as stated above, although Koh was responsible for overseeing the price negotiations digital resources, Koh advised Low on what prices to quote to NLB for new digital content that Low was considering proposing to NLB. An example can be found in:

>> a.     _Annex 6_ _: Email entitled Re\_ Business Inquiry – ARComics._

> 38     **Seventhly**, whilst DRSPL was negotiating the possible termination of Naxos and SheetMusic, which were databases provided by DRSPL to NLB, with one Eugene Tan Hwi Choon, who was Koh’s subordinate in NLB, Koh provided advice and confidential information to Low about how to conduct the negotiation. This can be seen as follows:

>> a.    In _Annex 7(a)__: Email entitled Re\_ Naxos Music Library Renewal Subscription FY2009_, Koh informed Low that the librarians have already approved the renewal of these databases, but Eugene was looking for a lower price.

>> b.    In _Annex 7(b)__: Email entitled Re\_ Naxos and SheetMusic_, Koh told Low that he would do his ‘usual “innocent” selling Naxos as back-up’ within NLB.

> 39     **Eighthly**, Koh advised Low that he should sign off using a different name for each of the three companies under his control. Low agreed and used the fictitious names “Sam” and “Nicholas” when corresponding with NLB on behalf of JCD and W3 respectively, so that NLB does not realise that all three companies were “one man” companies under the control of Low.

> 40     **Ninthly**, Koh got one of the databases supplied by Low – Informa – approved for renewal. Koh can be seen telling Low that he got the resource renewed “superbly” and “with a covert plan” as follows:

>> a.     _Annex 8_ _: Email thread entitled Re\_ Catching up and Update - From DRS Singapore._

> 41    Between November 2005 and November 2009, Low kept detailed records of the gratification he paid to Koh as reward for Koh advancing Low’s business interests with NLB:

>> a.    Low kept spreadsheets detailing how much of each payment received by Low’s companies from NLB was to be set aside as Koh’s “commission”.

>> b.    Low also kept a spreadsheet of how much gratification he in fact paid to Koh and Khing as a reward for Koh advancing Low’s business interest with NLB. This spreadsheet recorded gratification paid to Koh and Khing between November 2005 and July 2008.

>> c.    For gratification paid between July 2008 and November 2009, Low kept deposit slips recording the gratification paid to Koh and Khing. On these slips, Low occasionally wrote the payment from NLB out of which the gratification to Koh was being paid.

> 42    The spreadsheets and deposit slips maintained by Low were recovered and reviewed by the CPIB during investigations.

> **VII.**      **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGES UNDER SECTION 6 PCA**

> 43    Between November 2005 and November 2009, Low corruptly gave 51 sums of gratification totalling SGD 581,730.77 to Koh and/or his nominees. The 51 sums of gratification were corruptly given to Koh in his capacity as an agent of NLB, as a reward for advancing Low’s business interests NLB. The 51 sums of gratification were corruptly received by Koh and/or Koh’s nominees (on Koh’s behalf) as a reward for Koh advancing Low’s business interests with NLB.

> **Proceeded charges**

> 44    On the dates set out below, Low did corruptly give gratification of the following sums to Koh, in his capacity as an agent of NLB, _namely_, a manager of DRS, as a reward for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, _to wit_, advancing Low’s business interests with NLB. The same were corruptly received by Koh, in his capacity as an agent of NLB, _namely_, a manager of DRS, as a reward for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, _to wit_, advancing Low’s business interests with NLB.

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image4.png)

> 45    In his statement to CPIB (dated 25 July 2016), Low claimed that Koh did not return the “loans” stated above and that Koh did not mean to return the “loans”. Low informed that he did not chase Koh for payment.

> 46    At the material time, Koh was duty bound by the NLB’s Code of Ethics and Conduct to avoid a conflict of interest and to uphold the rules as stated at paragraph \[14\] above.

> 47    By virtue of the above, Low committed 18 offences under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“**PCA**”). Koh committed 18 offences under s 6(a) PCA.

> **VIII.**      **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGES UNDER SECTION 5 PCA**

> 48    One of the librarians who reported to Koh was **Lee Tsu Tsuan Vernon** (“**Lee**”), a Senior Librarian of DRS in NLB. Lee’s job scope included reviewing the digital resources supplied by Low’s companies. Low was aware that Lee reviewed the digital resources supplied by his companies, having been so informed by Koh.

> 49    On various occasions between November 2005 and March 2006, Koh told Low that Lee had approached Koh for loans. As Koh was not financially strong, he could not give Lee a loan. Koh therefore brought the matter up to Low. Unknown to Low, between 2005 and 2006, Lee had helped Koh to promote Speedcuts (the business that Koh was operating on the side) on an _ad hoc_ basis. To remunerate Lee, Koh told Low that Lee needed money and suggested that Low loan Lee money.

> 50    Low gave money to Lee, through Koh, because he was aware that Lee’s job scope included reviewing the digital resources provided by his companies. Low did not want Lee to give bad reviews of the digital resources which Low supplied to NLB. When Koh received the sums of money from Low to be given to Lee, he knew that Low gave money to Lee because Low did not want Lee to write bad reviews of the resources that Low was supplying to NLB.

> 51    On the dates set out below, Low did corruptly give gratification of the following sums to Koh, for the benefit of Lee, as an inducement to Lee, an officer of a public body, _namely_, a Senior Librarian of NLB, to advance Low’s business interests with NLB. The same were corruptly received by Koh, for Lee, as an inducement to Lee, an officer of a public body, to do acts to advance Low’s business interests with NLB.

> 52    Neither Lee nor Koh made any repayment of the S$8,500 to Low.

> 53    Lee did not receive the said $2,000 and the $6,500 respectively from Koh with a corrupt intent. Rather, Lee believed that the said monies he received was payment for work that he had done for Koh to promote Speedcuts. No further action was taken against Lee.

> 54    By virtue of the above, Low committed two offences under s 5(b)(ii) PCA. Koh committed two offences under s 5(a)(ii) PCA.

> 55    Out of the SGD 581,730.77 Low corruptly gave to Koh and/or his nominees as gratification, Koh returned to Low $352,730.77.

10     The salient facts of the JSOF revealed that in October 2003, the first accused, Koh was employed as a Manager by the National Library Board (“NLB”). As the Manager of the NLB, he was an agent of NLB. The NLB is a statutory board established under the National Library Board Act and reports to the Ministry of Communications and Information.

11     Between 2001 and 2009, Koh was also the sole director of a company, Speedcuts Pte Ltd (“Speedcuts”). Speedcuts provided hair cutting services. Between 2001 and 2005, the second accused, Low was an employee of Speedcuts.

12     The JSOF revealed that sometime around 2004 or 2005, there was a strategic move within NLB towards digitalisation so that the digital databases, e-books, and e-comics maintained by NLB can be accessed online by NLB members. The NLB’s Digital Resources Services Department (“DRS) was formed and tasked to champion this strategic move.

13     DRS was responsible for identifying suitable electronic resources as well as procuring those resources on behalf of the whole of NLB. Mr Buddharaju Lakshmi Narayana Raju (“Raju”) was appointed as the Director of the DRS, and he was the first-in-command within DRS. In 2005, Koh was appointed as a Manager and second-in-command of DRS. As the second-in-command of DRS, Koh reported only to Raju. Amongst other duties, Koh oversaw DRS’ human resources, budget and administrative matters.

14     At the material time, all employees and staff of NLB, including Koh, signed a Statement of Commitment agreeing to be bound to the NLB’s Code of Ethic and Conduct. Amongst other responsibilities, employees and staff of NLB, including Koh, were duty-bound to take reasonable steps to avoid and disclose any conflict of interest. They were also not permitted to make improper use of inside information or one’s authority to gain a benefit. They were required at all times to uphold NLB’s values and in the integrity and good reputation of NLB.

### NLB’s procurement process for digital resources

15     I do not propose to go into the details of the process for the procurement of digital resources in NLB which have been set out in paragraphs 15 to 17 of the JSOF. Suffice for me to note, under Koh’s supervision, the DRS librarians searched for suitable digital resources for NLB to acquire. Their duties included sourcing for vendors who supplied such resources. If the shortlisted resources were found suitable by the librarians in the Public Library Group and the Reference Library Group for NLB to acquire in accordance with their internal pre-decided set of requirements and guidelines (the “Priority List”), Koh and his team of DRS librarians would contact either the authorised publisher or vendor to negotiate (but not agree) with the said publisher or vendor on the price to subscribe to the said resource.

16     If the DRS librarian was satisfied with the authorised vendor or publisher’s proposal, the officer would draft approval papers to Raju via Koh recommending NLB’s procurement of the said resource. Koh would vet the draft approval paper and if he agreed with the contents, he would forward them to Raju for the latter’s ultimate approval, and indicate his support for the librarian’s recommendation. Occasionally, Koh himself also prepared approval papers for renewal of digital resources to Raju. While Raju would make the final assessment on whether the shortlisted resource recommended should be procured by NLB, he would rely heavily on the recommendations of the DRS librarian or Koh and the information stated in their approval paper.

17     For the renewal of an existing subscription of digital resource, the DRS librarian would follow a similar process and would include the actual usage by NLB users of the subscribed resource, and the cost-per-usage incurred by NLB in their approval paper to Koh and subsequently, to Raju, to consider whether the actual usage matched the initial estimated or predicted usage, and whether the actual cost-per-usage justified the renewal, amongst other considerations. Raju would also rely heavily on the information provided by the respective DRS librarian or Koh who sent him the approval paper.

### Background to the corrupt scheme between Low and Koh

18     Koh learned about NLB’s strategic move towards digitalisation sometime in 2004. He shared this with Low and told Low that he could explore business opportunity of providing digital content to NLB to earn a living.

19     Subsequently, Koh introduced Low to one Terrence Shan Chee Hoong (“Terrence”) who previously worked as a salesperson and manager for an overseas database publisher, and had knowledge in the digital content field. At a meeting between Low and Terrence, they explored the idea of exploring business opportunity to provide digital content to NLB, and in Singapore generally.

20     On 17 November 2005, Low incorporated Database Resource Services Pte Ltd (“DRSPL”) to provide digital resources to NLB. Terrence invested money into DRSPL and owned 30% of DRSPL’s shares. The remaining 70% shares were owned by Low, who was both a director and shareholder of DRSPL. Following DRSPL's incorporation, Low and Terrence started to sign contracts with overseas publishers and acquired legal rights to distribute their content in Singapore. Thereafter, they marketed their products to NLB following Koh’s disclosure to Low about NLB’s plan for digitalisation. Low also asked Koh to introduce him to his colleagues who would evaluate the digital resources NLB procured, which Koh did. Low then contacted Koh’s colleagues and introduced DRSPL’s content to them by offering them free access to the overseas publishers’ databases for a trial period.

21     Subsequently in January 2007 and May 2009, Low incorporated another two companies, JCD Crossmedia Pte Ltd (“JCD”) and W3XS Pte Ltd (“W3”) to supply digital resources to NLB. Low was the only person who was overall-in-charge of all three companies, DRSPL, JCD and W3. NLB was the biggest customer of Low’s three companies.

### The corrupt scheme between Low and Koh

22     In November 2005, Koh started asking Low for money for various personal purposes.

23     Low set aside about 30% of all the profits earned from his three companies’ subscription contracts with NLB to be given as gratification to Koh. Low set aside the monies in a pool (“30% pool”) as a reward for Koh’s help to advance Low’s business interest with NLB. Of the remaining 70% of the profits, Low kept aside about 40% for himself and about 30% for Terrence.

24     Whenever Koh requested money from Low, Low would take the amount requested from the 30% pool which Low had specifically set aside for Koh, to give to Koh.

25     During the material time, Koh requested money from Low for the various purposes, including:

> (a)     to spend on Koh’s personal expenses;

> (b)     to pay the business expenses of Speedcuts, Koh’s side business; and

> (c)     to pay the business expenses of Promopower, a business operated by Koh’s sister, Koh Geok Khing (“**Khing**”).

26     In return, Koh would advance Low’s business interests with NLB. The money being paid by Low to Koh and Khing between November 2005 and November 2009 was gratification to Koh as a reward for Koh’s help in advancing Low’s business interests with NLB.

27     Examples of how Koh advanced Low’s business interests are listed in paragraphs 31 to 40 of the JSOF. These include putting up numerous approval papers between November 2005 to November 2009, recommending to Raju the subscription of, and subsequent renewals of, numerous digital resources provided by Low’s companies. Had Raju known that Koh was receiving gratification from the vendor supplying the digital resources recommended in the paper, he would not have approved the procurement recommended and would have reassigned the resource to another librarian who was not related to the vendor to make an independent assessment.

### Facts pertaining to the proceeded charges under section 6 PCA

28     Between November 2005 and November 2009, Low corruptly gave 51 sums of gratification totalling S$581,730.77 to Koh and/or his nominees. The 51 sums of gratification were corruptly given to Koh in his capacity as an agent of NLB, as a reward for advancing Low’s business interests in NLB. The 51 sums of gratification were corruptly received by Koh and/or Koh’s nominees (on Koh’s behalf) as a reward for Koh advancing Low’s business interests with NLB.

29     The dates and the amount of gratification and the mode of delivery for the 18 proceeded charges are set out above in paragraph 44 of the JSOF.

30     At the material time, Koh was duty bound by the NLB’s Code of Ethics and Conduct to avoid a conflict of interest and to uphold the rules stated therein.

### Facts pertaining to the proceeded charges under section 5 PCA

31     The JSOF further revealed that one of the librarians who reported to Koh was Lee Tsu Tsuan Vernon (“**Lee**”), a Senior Librarian of DRS in NLB. Lee’s job scope included reviewing the digital resources supplied by Low’s companies. Low was aware that Lee reviewed the digital resources supplied by his companies, having been so informed by Koh.

32     On various occasions between November 2005 and March 2006, Koh told Low that Lee had approached Koh for loans. As Koh was not financially strong, he could not give Lee a loan. Koh therefore brought the matter up to Low. Unknown to Low, between 2005 and 2006, Lee had helped Koh to promote Speedcuts (the business that Koh was operating on the side) on an _ad hoc_ basis. To remunerate Lee, Koh told Low that Lee needed money and suggested that Low loan Lee money.

33     Low gave money to Lee, through Koh, because he was aware that Lee’s job scope included reviewing the digital resources provided by his companies. Low did not want Lee to give bad reviews of the digital resources which Low supplied to NLB. When Koh received the sums of money from Low to be given to Lee, he knew that Low gave money to Lee because Low did not want Lee to write bad reviews of the resources that Low was supplying to NLB.

34     On or about 4 November 2005 and 24 March 2006, Low corruptly gave gratification of $2,000 and $6,500 to Koh, for the benefit of Lee, as an inducement to Lee, an officer of a public body, _namely_, a Senior Librarian of NLB, to advance Low’s business interests with NLB. The same were corruptly received by Koh, for Lee, as an inducement to Lee, an officer of a public body, to do acts to advance Low’s business interests with NLB.

35     Neither Lee nor Koh made any repayment for this sum of $8,500 to Low. Lee believed that the said monies he received was payment for work that he had done for Koh to promote Speedcuts.

36     Finally, the JSOF revealed that out of S$581,730.77, Low corruptly gave to Koh and/or his nominees as gratification, Koh returned to Low $352,730.77.

## Application for Newton Hearing by the Prosecution and Koh

37     After the plea of guilt were recorded from both accused persons, the respective mitigation plea and the submissions on sentence were adjourned pending the resolution of several factual issues which were to be resolved by way of a Newton Hearing. The issues were as follows:

> (a)     The sums of gratification in the form of “loans” that were re-paid by Koh to Low as the remaining amount unpaid would be the subject of a penalty order to be imposed under section 13 of the PCA (“**Penalty Issue**”);

> (b)     To what extent the information set out in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the JSOF communicated by Koh to Low was considered “insider information”, and whether such confidential information was communicated to other suppliers of NLB (“**Confidentiality Issue**”);

> (c)     Koh’s role and the extent of his influence on the approval process in the procurement and renewal of the digital resources in NLB (“**Procurement Role Issue**”).

38     In this respect, Mr Wilson Foo, the learned counsel for Low informed the Court that as the penalty order was sought only against Koh, that Low did not keep accurate records of the repayments, and that Koh’s precise role in NLB was not within Low’s knowledge, Low was not seeking for a Newton Hearing. However, Low was prepared to offer himself as a witness to either the Prosecution or Koh for the Newton Hearing.

39     Accordingly, the matter was adjourned for a Pre-Trial Conference for parties to be assigned with suitable hearing dates for the Newton Hearing to be heard before me.

40     In the interim period, the Court was informed that the parties have had extensive discussions and were able to resolve the three disputed factual issues and that a Newton Hearing was no longer necessary. In respect of (a) the Penalty Issue, the parties agreed that the eventual amount of penalty to be imposed by the Court is **S$229,000/-** as the remainder sum of S$352,730.77 has been repaid to Low. On (b) the Confidentiality Issue, the Prosecution accepted the position that while the internal emails and internal minutes of meetings that Koh had communicated to Low were themselves confidential documents, the information contained therein was not confidential in nature. Finally, in respect of (c) the Procurement Role Issue, the parties agreed to a description of Koh’s role in NLB’s procurement process which was set out in Annex A of Koh’s mitigation plea.

41     With the parties’ agreement that there was no necessity for any witnesses to be called at a Newton Hearing, the parties proceeded to file their respective mitigation pleas, sentencing submissions, and replies to the submissions respectively.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

42     In the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions, the learned DPP highlighted the difficulties in relying on sentencing precedents to determine the sentences to be imposed on Koh and Low for the section 6 PCA offences. The Prosecution highlighted that cases with such a large quantum of bribes and involving a public servant employed by a public body, have been rare in Singapore. The precedents were generally either involved much lower quantum of gratification or were purely private sector cases where the public service rationale is not engaged. Thus, the Prosecution urged this Court to avoid applying a precedent-based sentencing approach in this case.

43     The Prosecution highlighted the recent case of _Takaaki Masui v PP and another appeal and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 265</span> (“_Masui_”), where Justice Chan Seng Onn, developed a sentencing framework for “purely private sector corruption” offences, i.e. private sector agents performing purely commercial functions that do not engage the public service rationale. The learned DPP submitted that it would not be appropriate for this Court to modify the framework to account for the public service rationale, neither would it be open to this Court to formulate a general sentencing framework for all section 6 PCA offences.

44     The learned DPP further highlighted the recent decision of the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _PP v Wong Chee Meng and Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 144</span> (“**Wong Chee Meng**”) and submitted that this Court should apply the five-step sentencing framework for offences committed under section 6 read with the enhanced punishment provision in section 7 PCA as laid down in _Wong Chee Meng_, but accord an “appropriate sentencing discount” to Koh and Low on account of their charges being framed under section 6 PCA _simpliciter_, where the maximum imprisonment term is five (5) years instead of seven (7) years under the enhanced punishment provision.

45     The Prosecution submitted that but for the fact that the charges in this case were not framed under section 7 PCA, the _Wong Chee Meng_ sentencing framework would have been squarely applicable. Based on an application of the framework, the Prosecution submitted that this case fell within the middle-end of the moderate category for harm, and spanned across the medium category for culpability. After adjustments for offender-specific factors to the indicative starting sentences, and adjustments to account for the totality principle by running three of the section 6 PCA sentences consecutively, the cumulative sentence yielded would be **78 months’ imprisonment**.

46     As a summary, I have reproduced the Prosecution’s table of proposed sentences seeking for three sentences to run consecutively with a slight reduction of the individual sentences of between one and two months, on account of the totality principle.

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image6.png)

47     Thus, the Prosecution submitted that the cumulative sentence yielded by applying the _Wong Chee Meng_ framework is **78 months’ imprisonment** (comprising of 21 + 24 + 33 months’ imprisonment) for the section 6 PCA charges.

48     Given that the maximum imprisonment term for the section 6 PCA charges is five years, the sentence yielded by the _Wong Chee Meng_ framework must be calibrated downwards proportionately to account for the lower maximum imprisonment sentence. This was done by dividing the global sentence of 78 months’ imprisonment by a denominator of seven (7) years and then multiplied by five (5) years, yielding a global sentence of **56 months’ imprisonment**.

49     To the best of the Prosecution’s knowledge, such a novel downward mathematical adjustment has not been done before. However, the Prosecution submitted that the present section 6 PCA _simpliciter_ offences were identical to the factual scenarios in the aggravated section 6 read with the enhanced section 7 PCA offence. Given that the only variable is the prescribed maximum imprisonment terms, the Prosecution submitted that such a downward calibration would be appropriate in principle.

50     For the offences under section 5 PCA, the learned DPP submitted for a sentence of **four (4) months’ imprisonment** based on the sentencing precedents cited involving similar amounts of gratification. The learned DPP further submitted that the sentence for one of the section 5 PCA charge should run consecutive to the 56 months’ imprisonment as they were separate criminal transaction, involving an unrelated party.

51     Accordingly, the Prosecution sought a global sentence of **60 months’ imprisonment** (comprising of 56 + 4 months’ imprisonment) for each of the accused persons.

52     The Prosecution also sought a penalty order under section 13(1) of the PCA against Koh for a sum of **S$229,000/-** as this sum comprised all the gratification Koh had received from Low, but excluded the amount parties agreed to have been repaid by Koh to Low.

53     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that a fine ought to be imposed on Low in addition to the imprisonment term to “disgorge the offender’s substantial benefit from his offending” or to “disgorge any profits which the offender may have made from his illegal behaviour”. The Prosecution urged the court to impose a fine of **S$352,730.77** as being the amount repaid by Koh to Low, which was no longer subject to a section 13 PCA penalty order. The Prosecution submitted that if the fine was not imposed on Low, Low would receive a substantially more lenient sentence than Koh and that would be a clear violation of the parity principle.

54     The Prosecution submitted that the global fine of **SGD 352,730.77** could be achieved in the following manner:

> (a)     By imposing a fine of S$20,000/- for 17 of the section 6 PCA charges faced by Low and a fine of S$12,730.77 for the remaining section 6 PCA charge (i.e. S$340,000 + S$12,730.77 = S$352,730.77).

55     Further, the Prosecution urged this Court to not impose any default imprisonment terms in respect of the fines imposed on Low as the Prosecution wished to reserve the right to apply for the appropriate enforcement orders, including an attachment of the bank accounts seized from Low by CPIB in the event that Low intimates that he was unwilling or unable to pay the fines imposed in full.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence for Koh

56     In the mitigation plea, the learned counsel for Koh, Mr Tan Hee Joek highlighted Koh’s background and that Koh and Low first met in 1991 when they were both pursuing their respective tertiary studies in Murdoch University at Perth, Australia. They shared lodgings while studying there and became close friends. When they returned to Singapore in 1994, they remained in constant contact as close friends and their relationship was akin to kinship.

57     Mr Tan highlighted that Koh was tasked to source for e-content to be supplied to NLB and Koh had also approached other contractors to submit their e-content to NLB. Low was interested in entering this market and he had legitimately obtained the exclusive rights to supply various e-content to NLB. During the material time, NLB had procured some of the e-content supplied by Low while also rejecting other e-content recommended by Low, neither were all such e-content subscription renewed by NLB.

58     Mr Tan submitted a write up of Koh’s role vis-à-vis the Approving Authority and the Selectors (Professional Librarians) and likened his role to that of a hospital administrator, who was only the one that gathered requirements and put up the paper to purchase what was wanted by the qualified doctors and professions (like the Librarians in NLB) as they were the only ones able to evaluate, select and recommend the required drugs, vaccines, etc. (like the e-books for NLB).

59     In 2005, Koh encountered a crisis when his marriage broke down. After separating from his wife from 2005, they divorced in 2009. When Koh encountered financial problems from 2006 to 2009 such as when Speedcuts encountered cash flow issues, he turned to Low for loans. Koh also turned to borrow from Low when his elder sister’s business known as Promopower Pte Ltd encountered cash flow issues. Other than loans, Koh borrowed from Low to tide over the tough period he was experiencing, such as for meals, holidays, etc.

60     Mr Tan submitted that the sentencing framework developed in _Wong Chee Meng_ was not intended to apply generally to all offences under sections 5 and 6 of the PCA. The Court had rejected the Prosecution’s suggestion that “a sentencing framework for the aggravated form of the offence under section 6 read with section 7 of the PCA can be adapted for use with the basic offence under section 6 simply by making, a downward adjustment to the indicative sentencing ranges to account for the lower sentencing range prescribed by the statute”.

61     Notwithstanding that, Mr Tan submitted that the sentencing considerations set out in _Wong Chee Meng_’s case can be usefully referred to in the present case in ascertaining the appropriate punishment to be imposed against Koh.

62     The learned counsel, Mr Tan highlighted Koh’s clean record and submitted that his plea of guilt clearly indicated his remorse and regret, and he has cooperated fully with CAD and CPIB throughout their investigations.

63     Like the Prosecution, Mr Tan submitted that there was a dearth of cases involving statutory board officers who obtained gratification to advance the business interest of private entities with the statutory board. Mr Tan invited the Court to draw guidance from the sentences imposed for similar private sector corruption cases such as _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 134</span>, _PP v Tee Fook Boon Andrew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 192</span> and _Takaaki Masui_ as the starting point, and which cases have more aggravating factors in terms of the instances of bribes and the bribe amount, and to impose an uplift due to the public service rationale aggravating factor that exists for the present case.

64     Drawing guidance from these cases to calibrate an uplift for the public service rationale while balancing it against the aggravating factors, Mr Tan proposed that the Court impose the following sentences on Koh:

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image7.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image8.png)

65     The learned counsel invited this Court to consider ordering the imprisonment sentences for four charges to run consecutively (i.e. the 1st, 9th , 27th and 56th charges) making a global sentence of **46 weeks’ imprisonment and $280,000[^2] fine**.

66     Mr Tan further submitted that the penalty order under section 13 PCA should not include amounts that Koh had returned to Low, and majority of the amounts were loans given by Low to the Speedcuts and Promopower businesses. Mr Tan submitted that an order of penalty should be for the amount of $229,000/- (being $581,730.77 less $352,730.77).

## Mitigation and Defence’s Sentencing Submissions for Low

67     In his mitigation plea, the learned counsel, Mr Wilson Foo highlighted that Low was untraced and this is his first infraction with the law. The learned counsel also highlighted the friendship between Low and Koh preceding the offences and that their friendship was not tainted at the outset by a corrupt intent.

68     When Low and Koh first met in 1991 when they were studying in Australia at Murdoch University, Koh was Low’s senior at the University. Their friendship developed and blossomed and during the course of their friendship, Koh would borrow monies from Low when Koh developed a gambling addiction. Due to their close friendship, Koh’s family treated Low as a close family friend and would constantly look out for him, including recommending him for employment and offering him a roof over his head rent-free.

69     Low felt a sense of gratitude towards Koh’s family and the opportunity to repay the kindness arose when Low found success due to NLB’s strategic move towards digitalisation.

70     The learned counsel, Mr Foo submitted that there was little loss suffered by NLB as Low’s company was the sole distributor of the databases and thus had a monopoly over the supply of the database in question. NLB may well have procured the databases and e-products even if no corruption had taken place.

71     Mr Foo highlighted that Low has pleaded guilty and was genuinely remorseful for his actions. He has cooperated with the authorities and also agreed to be a prosecution witness even before Koh decided to plead guilty to the offences.

72     The learned counsel, Mr Foo submitted that the sentencing considerations in _Wong Chee Meng_ and _PP v Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 166</span> (“_Marzuki_”) overlapped and in determining the appropriate sentence for a section 6 PCA offence, the offence-specific factors and offender-specific factors would be helpful to the court in considering the appropriate sentence.

73     In this regard, Mr Foo submitted that NLB did not suffer any direct pecuniary loss and the harm caused was on the low end of the scale. As for Low’s culpability, Mr Foo submitted that it would at most be on the higher end of the slight category as Koh was the prime mover behind the offences and not Low, who felt a sense of gratitude and indebtedness to Koh and his family, and was easily influenced by Koh. Koh was clearly the dominant party and this was a unique case where the receiver was actually cultivated by the giver.

74     Mr Foo further cited the cases of _Marzuki_ and _Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP_ \[1997\] 2 SLR (R) 253, and also the private sector corruption cases due to the death of public sector cases involving a high amount of gratification, and urged the Court to apply a proportionate uplift to take into account the public service rationale, which Mr Foo submitted that it should be one and half times of the usual sentence in a private sector corruption case.

75     Mr Foo also submitted that three of the section 6 PCA offences run consecutively, making a global sentence of **18 months’ imprisonment**.

76     As for the s 5 PCA charges, Mr Foo submitted for a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment (for the amount involving $2,000/-) and 4 weeks’ imprisonment (for the amount involving $6,500). Applying the totality principle, Mr Foo submitted for a global sentence of not more than **14 months’ and four (4) weeks’ imprisonment**.

77     The learned counsel submitted that the individual breakdown of the global sentence for Low should be as follows:

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image9.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image10.png)

78     On the issue of the fine sought by the Prosecution, Mr Foo informed the Court that Low instructed him that he did not have the means to pay for the fine in excess of $300,000/- sought by the Prosecution. The learned counsel also submitted that a fine was not appropriate as unlike a penalty to disgorge the corrupt monies, the fines in this case would be punitive. The case of _Koh Jaw Jung v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 251</span> cited by the Prosecution could be distinguished as the rationale for imposing a confiscatory fine in that case was to disgorge the profit, gain or benefit received by the offender in respect of prostitution offences.

## Sentencing Considerations

### Whether the Court should apply the Wong Chee Meng sentencing framework

79     I first begin by addressing the various sentencing options submitted by the parties, and whether this Court should apply the _Wong Chee Meng_ sentencing framework to the present case.

80     Having carefully considered the respective submissions of the parties, and bearing in mind the clear hesitation expressed by the Honourable Chief Justice in _Wong Chee Meng_ that a sentencing framework for the aggravated form of the offence under section 6 read with section 7 of the PCA can be adapted for use with the basic offence under section 6 by simply making, as suggested by the Prosecution, a downward adjustment to the indicative sentencing ranges to account for the lower sentencing range prescribed by the statute, I was in agreement with both learned counsel for the Defence that it would not be appropriate for this Court to adopt the Prosecution’s novel sentencing approach of applying the sentencing framework to derive at the sentences for Koh and Low, as if the Prosecution had proceeded under the enhanced punishment provision under section 7 of the PCA.

81     The learned DPP submitted that but for the Prosecution’s exercise of their discretion not to frame the charges under section 7 PCA, the _Wong Chee Meng_ framework would have been squarely applicable to the present case. With great respect to the learned DPP, I was not persuaded by this submission as in my view, it would only be fair that the Court sentences an accused person based on the charge as preferred by the Prosecution, and not on the premise that the Prosecution could have preferred a more serious charge but chose not to do so. It would not be correct for the Court to approach sentencing on the basis that the accused persons could have been liable to an enhanced punishment had the Prosecution so decided to proceed, and by extension, applying the sentencing framework, notwithstanding that the public service rationale was triggered in this case.

82     In _Ng Sae Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 191</span> at \[70\] and \[71\] (“_Ng Sae Kiat_”), the Court of Three Judges, in the Magistrate’s Appeals, rejected the Prosecution’s submissions to take into account benchmarks sentences for Penal Code offences in determining the appropriate sentence in that case which concerned offences under the Security and Futures Act. The Court held that it is not permissible for the Court to take into account sentencing benchmarks for other offences in deciding the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the offenders. The onus lies on the Prosecution to frame an appropriate charge in light of the available evidence. Once an accused has pleaded guilty, the Court should not consider the possibility that “an alternative – and graver – charge might have been brought and treat him as though he had been found guilty of the graver charge” (_Sim Gek Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 185</span> at \[15\].

83     While the comparison in _Ng Sae Kiat’s_ case involved different statutory offences, nevertheless, I was of the view that the principle remains applicable. The Prosecution has the discretion to decide what charges to prefer against the accused persons. In the present case, the Prosecution could have preferred the more serious charges attracting the enhanced punishment under section 7 of the PCA but did not do so. The accused persons pleaded guilty on that basis to the lesser charges under section 6 of the PCA. In all fairness to the accused persons, I did not think it is open to the Prosecution to contend that the accused persons ought to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing benchmarks or framework laid down for an enhanced punishment under section 7 PCA, notwithstanding that the sentence derived at would be mathematically reduced in accordance with the statutory prescribed punishments.

84     More critically, I was not entirely convinced that it would be permissible for this Court to approach sentencing in the manner as suggested by the prosecution, which is to apply the sentencing framework in _Wong Chee Meng_ to derive at the sentence, and then simply applying a mathematical formula of dividing the derived sentence by seven (7) years and multiplying it by five (5) years, based on the statutory maximum sentences to achieve the final sentence against the accused persons.

85     A section 6 PCA offence encompasses a broad spectrum of different corrupt transactions involving agents, and it would cover different factual scenarios. Notwithstanding that the public service rationale was engaged in the present case, I did not think that it would be correct in principle to simply apply the sentencing framework developed under the enhanced section 7 PCA and deduced the notional sentence in the mathematical precision advanced by the Prosecution.

86     One of the reasons stated by the Prosecution in support of adopting the _Wong Chee Meng_ sentencing framework was that there is an “under-utilisation of the sentencing spectrum” as seen in a clustering of sentences at the lower end of the sentencing spectrum. The Prosecution submitted that the sentences have largely tended towards the lower end of the spectrum. However, in absence of any detailed analysis to show that the full spectrum of punishment had not been considered by the sentencing Courts, I was of the view that we should not be too quick to come to this conclusion. After all, as observed and informed by the Prosecution, the precedents generally either involved much lower quantum of gratification or were purely private sector cases where the public service rationale was not engaged.

87     Whilst I hesitate to adapt the _Wong Chee Meng_ sentencing framework for the present case in the manner as suggested by the Prosecution, nevertheless, I was of the view that the relevant sentencing considerations, namely, the non-exhaustive offence-specific factors and offender-specific factors would be able to guide this Court in arriving at an appropriate sentence. These sentencing factors were similarly identified in _Takaaki Masui_ when Justice Chan modified the two-stage, five-step sentencing framework to resolve the problems faced by the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in that case. Justice Chan’s framework is broadly similar to the _Wong Chee Meng_ framework in that it uses a harm-culpability matrix, save that the quantum or value of gratification received or given is a factor going towards both “harm” and “culpability” for the purposes of the Modified Framework.

88     I now turn to consider these factors of “harm” and “culpability”.

### Offence-specific factors – Factors going towards “Harm”

89     I agreed with Prosecution that several offence-specific factors going towards harm were triggered. Low benefited extensively from the corrupt scheme with Koh acting as an insider in NLB and provided invaluable assistance and support to Low. Despite the clear conflict of interest, Koh either personally prepared or vetted approval papers, recommending products supplied by Low. For this, Low had set aside 30% of all the profit he made from the NLB contracts.

90     As evident from the JSOF, Koh had actively advised and guided Low in the background. Whilst his subordinate, one Eugene Tan Hwi Choon was suggesting that the Naxos Music Library Renewal subscription might be terminated, Koh was emphatic to Low that the Librarians have already approved the renewal and that Eugene wanted the price lowered. Koh also told Low that he would be doing his usual “innocent” selling of Naxos as back-up. This was evident in his email of Monday, 7 April 2008 at 12:23 pm and it clearly showed that Koh was prepared to use his position in NLB to promote the database supplied by Low.

91     In one email dated Friday, 21 November 2008 at 5:40pm, Koh took credit for getting the Informa database renewed and that it was “supery done by him with a covert plan”. Koh told Low that he had “better thank him a lot”. Another example of the extent to which Koh would go through to advance Low’s business interest was in the renewal of the World Ebook Library database. When Low suggested the renewal at the same price, as the price had just been increased at the last renewal, Koh initiated a charade by asking Low to increase the renewal price and let him bargain it down as it could not be seen that he would agree to the price “just like that”.

92     Given these aggravated examples of how Koh was advancing Low’s business interest from within NLB, Koh’s mitigation plea that the decision whether to enter such contracts did not rest with Koh but with the Approving Authority should be given very little or no weight at all. As rightly highlighted by the learned DPP, Koh’s loyalty was pledged to Low, not NLB. Koh was clearly advancing Low’s interest, and not that of his principal’s. This was certainly an egregious form of corruption.

93     I next turn to the question of whether there was any loss or harm caused to NLB. Mr Tan submitted that there was no evidence of any actual loss caused to NLB for the e-content subscribed. Similarly, Mr Foo submitted that NLB did not suffer any direct pecuniary loss. Therefore, the Defence submitted that the harm caused was on the low end of the scale.

94     On the other hand, the learned DPP submitted that actual harm was caused to NLB as the agent-principal relationship with Koh had been grossly suborned. I agreed with the prosecution. As revealed in the JSOF, the Director of DRS Raju relied heavily of Koh’s recommendations in deciding to approve the procurements. Had Raju known that Koh has a pecuniary interest in the procurement of Low’s resources, he would not have approved the recommendations and would have reassigned the resource to another librarian who was not related to the vendor to make an independent assessment.

95     In this respect, I agreed with the Prosecution that the procurement process that NLB had put in place to obtain digital content was fundamentally compromised by Koh, who was receiving bribes from Low. Quite clearly, Koh who has an interest in the outcome of the procurement was in a position to shape critical inputs into the decision-making process.

96     At this juncture, I pause to make an observation. Koh continued to be involved in the Speedcuts business until 2012. His continued involvement in Speedcuts business was openly declared in writing to NLB annually. Given that Koh has declared his business interest in Speedcuts to NLB, he must surely know that he was in a position of conflict in respect of his close friend’s companies and business of providing digital content to NLB whenever he prepared the approval papers or recommendations. For reasons best known only to Koh, he chose not to divulge or reveal this close relationship with Low to his Director, Raju or NLB’s management.

97     In my judgment, there was also harm caused to NLB when Koh found out that the usage statistics of one of the databases supplied by Low, namely the Jupiter Research database, were distorted because they included hits by webcrawlers. Instead of reporting this to his superiors in NLB, Koh concealed it and advised Low in his email of Monday, 17 March 2008 at 5:22 pm to be less than candid with NLB and suggested that Low need not disclose this to NLB since NLB did not officially ask Low to investigate where the hits came from.

98     In relation to the World Ebook Library renewal, apart from engaging in a charade with Low, Koh also knew that Low had been inflating the usage numbers by clicking the resources on his own end from an email sent to him by Low on 9 November 2008 at 15:23 hrs. Koh did not report this to his superiors even though he knew that cost-per-usage of a database was one of the key metrics used by NLB to access the cost effectiveness of the database.

99     Furthermore, deception was practised on NLB when Koh advised Low to sign off using different names for each of the three companies under his control. Low agreed and used the fictitious names “Sam” and “Nicholas” when corresponding with NLB on behalf of JCD and W3 respectively so that NLB would not realise that all three companies were under Low’s control.

100    As for the other factors going towards the “harm” element, all three parties agreed that there was no evidence that there was loss to third parties, public disquiet, or that the offences were committed as part of a group or syndicate and the involvement of a transnational element.

### Offence-specific factors – Factors going towards “Culpability”

101    Mr Tan submitted that there was low level of planning and premeditation in this case. Mr Foo submitted that Low was less culpable than Koh who was the prime mover and the dominant party. The learned DPP submitted that there was a high degree of planning and premeditation, as well as a high level of sophistication.

102    In my view, it was not entirely clear from the JSOF that Koh and Low had from the onset, schemed to have Low incorporate DRSPL to provide digital content to NLB in order for the facilitation of the corrupt arrangements. Instead, the JSOF suggested that Koh had only told Low to explore the business opportunity of providing digital content to NLB to earn a living when Koh shared NLB’s strategic move towards digitalisation in 2004 with Low. However, there was certainly a degree of planning and premeditation when Low incorporated two other companies, JCD and W3 in January 2007 and May 2009 respectively to also provide digital resources to NLB but using fictitious names when corresponding with NLB.

103    As to whether both Koh and Low had been motivated by greed, Mr Tan submitted that Koh had received payments from Low in the time of his personal needs and not out of greed. Furthermore, Koh stopped receiving monies from Low after his personal finances were settled and stable by around 2009. On the other hand, the Prosecution highlighted that both Koh and Low were willing parties to the corrupt scheme and were clearly motivated by greed. In support of this submission, the Prosecution highlighted that NLB procured digital resources worth about S$7 million from Low’s companies between November 2005 and November 2009. The total gratification received amounted to S$581,730.77, one of the largest sums received in public sector corruption in Singapore.

104    In my judgment, when the two companies, JCD and W3 were incorporated in January 2007 and May 2009 respectively to also provide digital resources to NLB but using fictitious names when corresponding with NLB, the motivations must surely be to increase the supply of e-products and databases through Low’s companies and to capture the market share of the resources supplied to NLB without arousing the suspicions of NLB. To some extent, I agreed with the prosecution that the considerations must have been motivated by monetary considerations and both Low and Koh were driven by greed.

105    As to the extent of the offender’s abuse of position and breach of trust, given that Koh was the Manager of NLB’s DRS and second-in-command within the department, and considering the extent to which Koh had advanced Low’s business interests with NLB, and that Koh had no qualms in forwarding and sharing confidential documents with Low such as Minutes of Meeting of NLB’s CEO Group Management Committee, I was of the view that Koh had abused his relatively senior position in NLB.

106    Finally, I would observe at this juncture that the period of the corrupt gratification obtained spanned some four (4) years between 2005 and 2009. However, I was mindful that the sentencing court should be careful not to regard this as a separate aggravating factor as there were several charges, including the 33 TIC charges under section 6 PCA, and that this could be addressed at the point in deciding the consecutive sentences.

### Mitigating Factors

107    As for the mitigating factors, I accepted the submissions of the learned counsel that both accused persons were untraced and remorseful for having committed these offences. I was of the view that some weight ought to be given to the accused persons for having pleaded guilty to the charges.

108    Furthermore, as pointed out by the learned counsel Mr Tan, the factual issues were largely resolved in favour of Koh without the need for a Newton Hearing, and that would have saved the State resources from having to proceed for a Newton Hearing after their guilty pleas were recorded.

### Principle of Parity of Sentencing – Whether the Court should impose additional fines on Low

109    I next turn to the issue of parity of sentencing. The Prosecution submitted that both Koh and Low should be sentenced similarly. While Koh was the one in egregious breach of his duties as an officer of a statutory board, Low had benefitted much more extensively in the corrupt scheme.

110    On the other hand, Mr Foo submitted that Low should be viewed as less culpable than Koh. His learned counsel highlighted that it was Koh who initiated and guided Low in securing contracts with NLB and advised Low on what prices to quote to NLB, and Koh even initiated the price bargaining charade and the using of fictitious names for the two other companies.

111    The principle of parity of sentencing as between the giver and recipient of gratification is not an inflexible or rigid rule. As stated by the Honourable Chief Justice Menon in _Wong Chee Meng_, the sentencing court must have in mind all the relevant factors, including the degree of culpability of each offender and his or her unique circumstances.

112    Having carefully considered the matter, in particular, the background to their close friendship and the facts revealed in the JSOF, I was in agreement with the learned counsel Mr Foo that Koh was clearly the dominant party, and there appeared to be some truth that Koh was the prime mover behind the present series of offences.

113    In this respect, I was not able to agree with the Prosecution that Low would receive a substantially more lenient sentence than Koh if a fine was not imposed by the Court to disgorge the amount that would otherwise be subjected to a penalty order if not for the repayment by Koh. In my judgment, an appropriate imprisonment term to be imposed against Low would be broadly consistent with the sentence to be imposed against Koh, proportionate to his wrongdoing, and would be able to serve as a deterrence, as well as meet the ends of justice.

114    Furthermore, as informed by the learned counsel, Low did not have the means to pay the substantial fines and he had been co-operative with the authorities. The funds in the seized companies’ bank accounts, even though controlled by Low, should not be subjected to a disgorgement order by way of a fine against Low. To impose additional fines against Low would be punitive. I also considered Mr Foo’s submission that Low did not keep track of the precise amount repaid by Koh and it was the prerogative of the Prosecution and Koh to agree on the quantum of the penalty to avoid a Newton Hearing which did not concerned Low. Hence, the Prosecution’s _volte-face_ submission for the substantial fine quantum against Low, when they had not previously done so, was effectively a “back-door” application of section 13(1) of the PCA but as against the giver, Low.

115    Whilst I acknowledged that the subscription contracts entered with NLB were tainted with corrupt payments by Low, I would not go so far as to characterize the contractual payments and profits earned by Low’s companies as “ill-gotten gains” and proceeds of crime. In the circumstances, I was not minded to exercise my discretion to impose the additional fines sought by the Prosecution against Low for the individual charges in order to make up the total sum of $352,730.77.

### Sentences Imposed

116    The Prosecution has helpfully collated several public sector corruption cases prosecution under section 6 PCA at **Annex A** of their submissions. While the prosecution submitted that these precedents could not be relied upon in the present case as no logical trend could be discerned, nevertheless, these cases clearly showed that where the public service rationale was engaged, a custodial sentence is generally imposed, even where the sum of gratification involved was a relatively small amount. As observed by Rajah JA in _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span>, the quantum of gratification directly reflects the culpability of both the receiver and giver; an accused person who gives or receives a larger bribe is generally to be regarded as more blameworthy.

117    In the present case, I note that the individual amount involved in the proceeded section 6 PCA offences were not small, ranging from a sum of $8,000/- to as high as $70,000/-. Having considered the above offence-specific factors going towards harm and culpability, I was of the view that the imprisonment term to be imposed for each of these charges should be appropriately calibrated to reflect the gravity of these offences, bearing in mind that the Court should utilise the full range of the sentencing spectrum.

118    In respect of Koh, I was of the view that for the charges involving an amount of $8,000/- and $10,000/- (i.e. the 9th, 10th and 34th charges), a custodial sentence of nine (9) months’ imprisonment for each charge would be appropriate. For the 23rd and 50th charges involving a sum of $16,000/- and $16,535.15, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge would be appropriate.

119    For the five charges involving a sum of $20,000/- (i.e. the 1st, 15th, 29th, 32nd and 35th charges), I was of the view that a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for each charge would be appropriate. For the four charges involving the sum of $25,000/- and $30,000/- (i.e. the 5th, 30th, 13th and 47th charges), I was of the view that a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for each charge would be appropriate.

120    For the 46th and 51st charges involving a sum of $36,000/- and $40,000/-, I imposed a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment and 21 months’ imprisonment. In respect of the two charges involving the highest amount of $70,000/- (i.e. 27th and 40th charges), I was of the view that a sentence of 33 months’ imprisonment for each charge would be appropriate.

121    Finally, in respect of the two charges under section 5 PCA, I agreed with the Prosecution that based on the precedents cited involving similar amounts of gratification, a sentence of four (4) months’ imprisonment for each charge was justified.

122    Having regard to the totality principle, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to order three of the sentences to run consecutively, namely, the 1st, 27th and 56th charges (i.e. 15 + 33 + 4 months’ imprisonment), making an aggregate sentence of **52 months’ imprisonment** for Koh.

123    In respect of Low, I found some merit in his learned counsel’s submission that Low should be viewed as less culpable than Koh as it was Koh who initiated and guided Low in securing the contracts with NLB. To that end, it would be appropriate to calibrate the individual custodial sentences against Low slightly downwards of two months, bearing in mind that it should adequately reflect Low’s role and culpability in the corrupt scheme between them, and not lead to a substantially more lenient sentence for Low and thereby violating the principle of parity.

124    As such, for the charges involving an amount of $8,000/- and $10,000/- (i.e. the 9th, 10th and 34th charges), I was of the view that it would be appropriate to impose a custodial sentence of seven (7) months’ imprisonment for each charge. For the 23rd and 50th charges involving a sum of $16,000/- and $16,535.15, I imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment.

125    For the five charges involving a sum of $20,000/- (i.e. the 1st, 15th, 29th, 32nd and 35th charges), a sentence of 13 months’ imprisonment for each charge was imposed. For the four charges involving the sum of $25,000/- and $30,000/- (i.e. the 5th, 30th, 13th and 47th charges), a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment for each charge was imposed.

126    As for the 46th and 51st charges involving a sum of $36,000/- and $40,000/-, I imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and 19 months’ imprisonment. In respect of the two charges involving the highest amount of $70,000/- (i.e. 27th and 40th charges), a sentence of 31 months’ imprisonment for each charge was imposed.

127    Finally, in respect of the two charges under section 5 PCA, I was of the view that both Low and Koh were equally culpable when Low agreed to corruptly give gratification to Vernon Lee through Koh because he did not want Vernon Lee to write bad reviews of the resources that Low was supplying to NLB. As such, I imposed the same sentence as Koh of four (4) months’ imprisonment for each charge.

128    Having regard to the totality principle, and as with Koh, I ordered three of the sentences to run consecutively, namely, the 1st, 27th and 56th charges (i.e. 13 + 31 + 4 months’ imprisonment), making an aggregate sentence of **48 months’ imprisonment** for Low.

129    I would add that having carefully surveyed the section 6 PCA cases cited by the Prosecution where the public service rationale was engaged, the aggregate sentences meted out against Koh and Low would qualify as one of the more severe sentences imposed by the Courts. In my judgment, this was clearly warranted given that the corrupt scheme was prolonged and had continued for about four years, the large quantum of the gratification involved which exceeded $500,000/-, and the egregious breach of Koh’s duties as an officer of a statutory board.

130    The other group of cases where the offenders received substantial custodial sentences involved law enforcement officers where the offenders were under a duty to act but had abused that duty in return for gratification. These cases would broadly fall into the second category of factual patterns discussed in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 117</span>. The only outlier was the case of _PP v Madhavan s/o Rajagopal_ (DAC 39839/2001 & Ors) where the offender was a customer services officer with the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (“SATS”). He pleaded guilty to five charges under section 6(a) PCA for corruptly receiving gratifications to assist foreigners without travel documents to enter other countries. Another 10 similar charges were taken into consideration. The total amount of gratification involved was $34,784/-. The offender was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment for three of the PCA charges, and four years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the remaining two PCA charges. The offender received a total sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

131    In summary, having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the accused persons were sentenced to the following:

![]([2022] SGDC 0022_Image/[2022] SGDC 0022_image11.png)

132    I further ordered that three of the sentences, namely, the 1st, 27th and 56th charges to run consecutively. The total sentence imposed for Koh was **52 months’ imprisonment**, and **48 months’ imprisonment** for Low. I was of the view that the aggregate sentences for each of the accused persons would serve as a sufficient deterrent sentence and send a clear message that such egregious corrupt practices in the public service would not be tolerated.

133    I further ordered that Koh pay a penalty in the sum of $229,000, which I was informed that the amount has been surrendered to the IO.

134    The Prosecution and Low being dissatisfied with the sentences imposed have appealed against the sentences. There was no appeal from Koh. At the time of writing my Grounds of Decision, both Koh and Low are serving sentence.
