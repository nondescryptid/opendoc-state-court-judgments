3       The Accused was sentenced to **10 weeks' imprisonment**. The Accused being dissatisfied filed an appeal against his sentence. He is on bail pending appeal.

4       These are the grounds for the sentence imposed.

## The Charge

5       The proceeded charge read as follows:

> **MAC-909421-2020**

> You… charged that you, between 11th April 2020 and 16th May 2020, in Singapore, did carry on the business of a providing payment service in Singapore, to wit, you accepted money in Singapore amounting to a total of $208,890/- across 38 transactions into your POSB account No. XXX, for the purpose of transmitting the money to persons outside Singapore, while you did not have in force a licence that entitles you to do so and you are not an exempt payment service provider, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1) and punishable under Section 5(3)(a) of the Payment Services Act 2019.

## Statement of Facts

6       The Statement of Facts (SOF) which the Accused admitted without qualification are as follows:

> 1.    The accused is Tan Khoon Yong, a 40-year-old male Singapore Citizen. He is a freelance broker in car trade and a parcel deliverer.

> 2.    The accused’s POSB bank account number is XXX.

> _Facts relating to the Charge_

> 3.    Sometime in end-2017, the accused got acquainted with a Malaysian Chinese male named “Lina” who is based in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The accused had acted as a middleman to source for car spare parts and supply them to Lina, in the process earning a commission. The last business transaction in relation to car spare parts the accused had with Lina was in the last quarter of 2019.

> 4.    Sometime after the Circuit Breaker measures were imposed in Singapore on 7 April 2020, Lina asked the accused to receive monies in his POSB account and perform overseas bank transfers to other Malaysian bank accounts on Lina’s behalf, in exchange for a commission. Lina told the accused that the monies were from Lina’s Malaysian workers who were unable to travel to Malaysia and therefore could not send monies back to Malaysia. The accused did not know who these Malaysian workers were, and he never met or communicated with them. The accused also did not know or verify the source of the funds he was to receive in his POSB account. Nevertheless, the accused agreed to provide Lina the service of accepting money in his Singapore POSB account for the purpose of transmitting the money to persons outside Singapore via overseas bank transfer.

> 5.    From **11 April 2020 to 16 May 2020**, the accused carried on the business of providing a payment service in Singapore. Pursuant to the accused’s agreement with Lina, he received 38 inward transactions into his POSB account amounting to **$208,890/-**. After the monies were transferred into the accused’s POSB account, Lina called the accused to inform him that the monies had been transferred to the accused’s account. Lina then instructed the accused to make overseas bank transfers to Malaysian bank accounts belonging to unknown persons in Malaysia by telling him the amount and account number to transfer to. From 11 April 2020 to 16 May 2020, the accused used his POSB mobile iBanking application to make 32 outward overseas transfers, via Overseas Remittance, to various different Malaysian bank accounts nominated by Lina amounting to $203,724.68.

> 6.    The monies received by the accused in his POSB account pursuant to his agreement with Lina are as follows:

> 7.    After each transaction or after a few transactions, the accused would retain some amounts of the monies received in his POSB account as his commission, ranging from $83 to $270 each time. The total amount of commissions the accused received from Lina was **$5,165.32**.

> 8.    The accused does not have a licence that entitles him to carry on the business of providing a cross-border money transfer service in Singapore and is not an exempt payment service provider of cross-border money transfer services either.

> 9.    $6,000 of the $208,890 received in the accused’s POSB account has been established to be proceeds of crime transferred to the accused’s bank account by a victim of an e-commerce cheating scam:

>> a.    On 20 May 2020, Wilson Quah Wei Jun made a police report at Changi Neighbourhood Police Centre that he had been deceived into transferring $6,000 to POSB Account number XXX on 14 May 2020 in relation to his online purchase of four units of iPhone 11 Pro Max from “Boss”, after coming across an advertisement on Facebook. Police investigations established this POSB account to be the accused’s POSB account.

> 10.    It is suspected that the remaining funds received in the accused’s POSB account are criminal proceeds from drug-related offences in connection to an illegal drug-related entity.

> 11.    The accused’s POSB account was seized by the Police on 20 May 2020, with an available balance of $7,952.43, after the police report was lodged on 20 May 2020 in connection to this case. The seized funds includes all the commissions the accused received from Lina. The accused only stopped providing the payment service to Lina after his POSB account was seized.

> 12.    The identity and whereabouts of Lina has not been established by the Police to-date, despite the accused having provided Lina’s alleged phone number to the Police. The accused did not provide the Police any other detailed particulars relating to the identity and location of Lina.

> 13.    The accused has made no restitution to date.

> 14.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has carried on the business of providing a cross-border money transfer service of accepting money in Singapore in his bank account for the purpose of transmitting the money to persons outside Singapore. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 5(3)(a) of the Payment Services Act 2019 (No. 2 of 2019).

## Antecedents

7       The Accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of **two (2) months’ imprisonment** would be appropriate for the following reasons:

> (a)     General deterrence is the main sentencing consideration for offences under s 5(1) PSA;

> (b)     The accused’s culpability was medium and the harm caused by the offence was moderate;

> (c)     The sentence sought was consistent with the sentencing precedents under s 5(1) PSA.

#### The main sentencing consideration is deterrence

9       The Prosecution submitted that the main sentencing consideration for an offence punishable under s 5(3) of the PSA is deterrence. The offence was not a mere regulatory breach of licencing laws. Instead, the offence was one involving the receipt and transfer of actual criminal proceeds from cheating offences. The accused acted as an accessory for money laundering.

10     Hence, a strong deterrent sentence was warranted as a deterrent sentence properly accounts for Parliament’s intention to curb the risk of money laundering via payment services in Singapore. Further, the prosecution submitted that offences involving scams and money mule offences are increasingly prevalent, and such offences also threaten the integrity of Singapore’s financial and banking system.

#### Factors relevant to harm and culpability for offences under s 5(3) PSA

11     The prosecution cited the case of _PP v Lange Vivian_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 11</span> (“_Lange Vivian_”), the first prosecution for an offence under s 5 of the PSA where the court endorsed the offence-specific and offender-specific factors proposed in assessing an offender’s culpability and the harm caused by the s 5(1) PSA offence (see _Lange Vivian_ at \[22\]).

12     In this regard, the relevant sentencing factors are as follows:

13     Applying the sentencing factors to the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the harm caused was **moderate** given (a) the significant number of transactions; (b) the significant total amount of monies received which amounted to **$208,890/-** pursuant to the unlicensed payment service (the highest amount out of the concluded cases thus far); and (c) that a significant amount of monies was traceable to actual criminal conduct.

14     As for culpability, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was **medium** culpability given that (a) he had offended for a long duration of more than a month; (b) he had reason to suspect that the monies were criminal proceeds but continued to blindly obey the instructions to transfer money and would have continued to do so had his bank account not been frozen by the Police; (c) the accused profited from the offence and received a high amount of commission of **$5,165.32**; (d) there was a transnational element involved as the funds were remitted to unknown Malaysian recipients; (e) the Accused played a critical role in facilitating the receipt of funds and diverting them overseas; and (f) the Accused only stopped his activities when the Police seized his bank account.

15     The Prosecution submitted that the present case was more aggravated than the cases of _Lange Vivian_, _PP v Marzuki bin Zakaria_ (SC-908948-2020) and _PP v Chen Jiantao_ (SC-900047-2020) and hence, a sentence of two (2) months’ imprisonment was justified.

16     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing precedents under the now repealed Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act 1979 (“**MCRBA**”) should not be relied upon in sentencing for PSA offences as the PSA is designed to target a much wider array of payment services, whereas the MCRBA was narrowly limited to “money-changing business” \[s 5(1)\] and “remittance business” \[s 6(1)\].

17     Moreover, the PSA is intended to address the difficulties precipitated by the increased autonomy and immediacy of payment transfers in the current technological landscape. While traditional methods of cross-border payments were very much limited to physical money-changing or remittance by a licenced remittance agency, advancements in financial technology meant that there is now a wider suite of methods by which cross-border transfers of money can be made.

18     The barriers to entry to run a payment service business are much lower, such that small and new players are able to seamlessly participate in the financial sector. Laypersons, like the Accused, are equipped to act as individual players in the payment services sector simply by using their personal bank account and mobile internet banking facilities. The decentralisation of unregulated payment services makes these offences much more difficult to detect and trace. This could only be remedied by a strictly deterrent stance towards unlicensed payment service providers.

19     The Prosecution argued that the PSA sentencing precedents were the most relevant to the present case and should be relied on instead of the outdated MCRBA precedents.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

20     The Defence submitted that a fine of not more than $10,000/- would be an appropriate sentence.

21     The Defence highlighted the Accused’s background and the circumstances leading to the commission of the offence. The Accused was approached for a favour in around April 2020 by one “Lina”, a 40 year-old Malaysian male, who used to purchase spare car parts from the Accused back in 2018. Lina had sought the Accused’s help to receive the salaries of Malaysian workers who were unable to return to Malaysia during the circuit breaker period into his personal bank account and to transfer the salaries to their Malaysian bank accounts.

22     The Accused was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to render assistance out of sympathy for the Malaysia workers and their families. The Accused did not know the identity of these workers. After each payment was made into the Accused’s bank account, Lina would call him with the transaction details and instructions, and in return, Lina would direct him to retain a small commission of around S$50/- to S$100/- per transaction and sometimes more.

23     His learned counsel also highlighted the following salient factors:

> (a)     The Accused was a first offender. He is truly remorseful and has pleaded guilty. He has also rendered his fullest cooperation to the Police.

> (b)     The period of offending was short, with 38 transactions made over the course of only one month. The personal gain was only around S$5,000/-.

> (c)     The offence was not sophisticated. Monies were simply transferred in and out of the Accused’s bank account on the instructions of Lina. There was no effort to bypass official banking channels and tracing was possible.

> (d)     The Accused maintained that he did not know that his actions amounted to an offence, but he accepted that ignorance of the law is no defence and that he must be punished.

> (e)     The Accused did not enter into the arrangements with Lina for financial gain but had done so out of sympathy for the Malaysian workers, whom he believed were stranded in Singapore during the lockdown.

24     His learned counsel further submitted that the custodial threshold has not been crossed on these facts and that the case of _Lange Vivian_, where the offender was sentenced _inter alia_ to an imprisonment term of four weeks for an offence under Section 5 of the PSA could be distinguished on its facts.

25     The Defence also relied on the decision in _PP v Abdul Bashar Khan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 203</span> (referred to at \[40\] of the judgment in _Lange Vivian’s case_) (_“Abdul Bashar Khan”_), where the offender’s sentence was reduced on appeal from three months’ imprisonment with a fine of S$50,000/- to six weeks’ imprisonment with a fine of $50,000/-. His learned counsel submitted that the present factors were less egregious and the Accused’s culpability lied at the lower end of the spectrum, whereas that the harm caused was moderate, at best.

## Sentencing Considerations

26     In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, the key issue before the Court was whether the custodial threshold was crossed in this case, and if so, what would be an appropriate length of custodial sentence.

27     Having carefully considered the respective submissions of the parties, I was of the view that the custodial threshold was crossed and that a sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence.

28     First, I note that the sentences imposed for the offence under s 5(1) PSA has been one of custodial sentence as seen in the cases of _Lange Vivian_, _Marzuki Bin Zakaria_ and more recently _Chen Jiantao_. A common thread running through these cases was that part of the amount of monies received were tainted from scams or proceeds of crime.

29     In the present case, about $6,000/- of the more than $200,000/- received in the Accused’s bank account has been established to be proceeds of crime transferred to the Accused’s bank account by a victim of an e-commerce cheating scam. The monies were not recoverable. As for the remaining funds received in the Accused’s bank account, they were suspected to be criminal proceeds from drug-related offences in connection to an illegal drug-related entity.

### The predominant sentencing consideration is deterrence

30     In my view, the predominant sentencing consideration for an offence of this nature must be one of general deterrence. In this respect, I agreed with the Prosecution that the offence in question was not a mere regulatory breach of licencing laws under the PSA. Instead, the offence was essentially one involving the receipt and transfer of actual criminal proceeds from cheating offences and the Accused was effectively acting as an accessory for money laundering.

31     In return, he received commissions for his role in the transactions, and in this case, the total amount of commissions earned by the Accused amounted to more than $5,000/-.

### Legislative background of PSA and Parliament’s intention

32     When Parliament enacted the PSA, it was in part to address the risks associated with new payment methods arising from the transformation brought about by the Financial Technology or FinTech. Parliament recognised that advancements in financial technology, which had enabled “more convenient, faster and cheaper payments”, had also given rise to “new risks”, necessitating a review of the regulatory framework [\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

33     As stated by the then-Minister for Education Mr Ong Ye Kung’s Second Reading speech for the Payment Services Bill on 14 January 2019)[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2):

> The second risk is that payment services may be used for ML/TF \[_note: refers to money laundering and terrorism financing_\], such as through illicit cross border transfers, anonymous cash based payment transactions, structuring of payments to avoid reporting thresholds or the raising or layering of assets or funds for ML/TF purposes. MAS studies the business model of each payment service to determine where regulatory measures should be imposed. The appropriate AML/CFT \[_note: refers to anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism_\] requirements will be imposed on relevant licensees through Notices issued under the MAS Act.”

34     The PSA licencing regime has a clear anti-money laundering function. As then-Minister for Education pointed out, licenced payment service providers are required to meet the anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism requirements (“**AML/CFT**”) set by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and are subject to regulatory oversight. Thus, there is a strong public interest justification to censure the provision of payment services outside of the PSA licensing regime because unlicensed participants in the shadow financial system are unregulated and do not comply with AML/CFT requirements.

35     It bears repeating that such range of payment services may easily be used for money laundering and terrorism financing due to the anonymous payment transactions and borderless nature of the transactions. Furthermore, an offence of this nature clearly threatens the integrity and reputation of our financial banking system.

36     Due to the ease of such transactions where there are literally no transaction costs and no barriers to entry, money mule offences are also increasingly prevalent. As rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, money mules are an essential component in the ecosystem of financial crime because they help criminals layer their illicit gains through a complicated and tangled web of transactions. They could seriously hinder investigative efforts to trace and recover these monies, and the potential to cause great harm. Hence, their participation in the enterprise of moving and dissipating criminal proceeds must be strongly deterred.

37     In short, a deterrent sentence was warranted to address one of the key risks that the PSA sought to address, namely, the mischief of using such payment services for money laundering and terrorism financing. In my view, there was a clearly a strong public interest justification to ensure that unlicensed payment service providers do not recklessly or carelessly partake in the laundering of illicit criminal proceeds and, in doing so, facilitate the retention of proceeds of crime by criminal personalities or entities.

38     Turning to the facts of this case, the risk of money laundering did in fact materialised. This was mainly due to the Accused’s utter lack of due diligence on the nature or source of funds that he had received from Lina. He did not bother to enquire the identities of the persons who transferred the monies into his bank account and readily agreed to provide Lina the payment service and followed the instructions to make the overseas bank transfers to unknown persons.

39     I was not able to accept his learned counsel’s submission that the Accused did not enter into the arrangements with Lina for financial gain but had done so out of sympathy for the Malaysian workers or that he had no reason to suspect that the monies were tainted. As revealed in the SOF, the Accused agreed to receive the monies and perform the transfers in return of earning commissions when he neither knew who these workers were nor what kind of work were they engaged in for that matter.

40     The varied sums of monies deposited into his bank account which ranged from $100/- to $11,000/- and the frequent incidents of such transactions would have raised suspicion that they were not mere salary payments. Yet, the Accused chose to blindly comply with Lina’s instructions for over a course of about a month in return for the easy commissions earned.

### Relevant sentencing factors going towards harm and culpability

41     I considered the sentencing factors relevant to the harm and culpability of the offence, and in this regard, I found that the offence-specific and offender-specific factors set out in _Lange Vivian_ were most helpful.

42     In respect of the offence-specific factors relating to harm, I considered the following key factors:

> (a)     a significant number of transactions were performed: **38** inward transfers and **32** outward transfers. In this respect, I was not able to agree with the learned counsel’s submission that the period of offending was short when 38 transactions were made over the course of one month;

> (b)     a significant amount totalling **$208,890/-** was received pursuant to the unlicensed payment service, which was the highest amount out of the cases concluded under s 5(3) PSA thus far. Both the number of transactions and the total amount involved represented the degree of the violation to the integrity of the payment ecosystem. This was not the case where it was a one-off or a few transactions and where the value involved was a small sum; and

> (c)     a significant amount of the monies received and transferred by the accused, **$6,000/-**, was traceable to actual criminal conduct. In addition, the remaining funds were suspected to be proceeds from drug-related offences. As rightly observed by the learned District Judge in _Lange Vivian_, the fact that the funds were tainted by crime meant that the offence was not purely regulatory in nature, and that at \[24\], “_the very money laundering risk which the PSA was intended to address had presented itself in this case_.”

43     In respect of the offence-specific factors relating to culpability, I considered mainly the following factors:

> (a)     the Accused offended for a period of more than one month unlike the offender, _Lange Vivian_, whose offence was who committed within a relatively shorter period of only 2 days;

> (b)     the transactions were large in quantity and frequent, and the Accused must have reason to suspect that the monies he was handling were criminal proceeds. Yet, he continued to play a critical role and performed these overseas transfers, and would have continued to do so if not for the Police’s action to freeze his bank account.

> (c)     the Accused profited from the offence as he had received a commission of about **$5,165.32**. As stated above, I was not able to accept his mitigation plea he did not enter the arrangements with Lina for financial gain but did so out of sympathy for the unknown Malaysian workers. Similarly, I was not able to agree with his learned counsel’s submission that the commission he earned was only a small sum. In my view, the accused was clearly motivated by the easily-earned commissions and the financial gain that he stood to benefit by blindly following Lina’s directions.

> (d)     there was also a transnational element involved as the Accused remitted all the money to unknown Malaysian recipients.

44     In my view, the Accused’s offending could be said to be of moderate harm and medium culpability, and I could not agree with the learned counsel’s submission that the Accused’s culpability fell at the low end of the spectrum.

### The MCRBA Sentencing Precedents

45     For completeness, I shall deal with the issue of whether the sentencing precedents under the repealed Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act 1979 (“**MCRBA**”) should be relied upon in sentencing for PSA offences. This issue was also considered in the case of _PP v Chen Jiantao (MAC 907914 of 2021)_ where the Court agreed with the Prosecution that there was a sound basis not to rely on the precedents for the MCRBA offences.

46     It was observed that there was no High Court guidance (in any reported judgment) on the appropriate sentencing approach for a s 6 MCRBA offence of carrying on a remittance business without a valid remittance licence. Secondly, the sentences meted out in the past two decades under the MCRBA have congregated in the lower range of the sentencing spectrum of up to two years imprisonment, and there appeared to be no explanation why this was justifiable. Thirdly, the precedents after 2003 do not appear to have taken into account the custodial sentences imposed by the High Court in _PP v Mohideen Kunji Mohamed Rafi_ (CR 16 of 2002) and _PP v Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook_ (CR 17 of 2002); and also the case of _PP v Shahabudeen s/o Asappa Abdul Hussian_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 122</span>.

47     I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentencing precedents under the repealed Money-Changing and Remittance Business Act 1979 (“**MCRBA**”) should not be relied upon in sentencing for the PSA offences and would associate myself with the sound reasoning of the learned District Judge in _PP v Chen Jiantao_ (at \[2\]). In my judgment, the more recent PSA sentencing precedents were more relevant to the present case, as compared to the more outdated MCRBA precedents.

48     In the case of _Abdul Bashar Khan_, quite apart from the fact that it involved an offence under the now-repealed MCRBA, the offender in that case did not use his personal bank account to illegally remit money overseas even though the total amount involved was very large. He had merely forwarded the funds through a licenced remittance agent and had no other role in the international cross trading arrangement. On appeal, he received a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $50,000/- in default two months’ imprisonment.

49     As for the case of _Lange Vivian_ where the offender received four weeks’ imprisonment, the offender dealt with only $2,200/- of criminal proceeds over a two-day period from 13 bank transfers, notwithstanding that the offender took steps to avoid detection and there was some level of sophistication employed in the commission of the offence. Likewise, in _Chen Jiantao_, the offender received an amount of $39,000/- across two transactions over three days in Singapore and transmitted the funds to bank accounts in China. He had operated such a service for at least four months before he was arrested and he was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. The present case involved a staggering sum of $208,890/- across 38 transactions, and the amount traced to criminal activity was also higher than the cases of _Lange Vivian_, _Marzuki bin Zakaria_, and _Chen Jiantao_.

## Conclusion

50     Having carefully considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, in particular, the high amount of criminal proceeds, the duration of the offence, the commission that the Accused had earned, and the strong public interest to deter like-minded offenders, I was of the firm view that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case.

51     In deciding on the appropriate length of the custodial sentence, I considered the sentencing precedents for the PSA offences, and I gave due weight to the fact that this was the accused’s first brush with the law. Further, I accepted that the Accused had cooperated to the Police and was truly remorseful for having committed the offence. If not for these mitigating factors, I would have been minded to impose a higher imprisonment term.

52     All considered, I was of the view that a sentence to **10 weeks imprisonment** would be an appropriate sentence.

53     The Accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently on bail pending appeal.
