\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9436/2020/01.\]

26 June 2020

### District Judge Samuel Hwa Kuan Chua:

1       The Accused is Karpaya Jegathesan, a 53-year-old male Singapore citizen. He claimed trial to one charge under section 8(b)(i) p/u section 33(4) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) p/u section 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (DAC-909492-2019). Another charge under section 50V(3)(c) Prisons Act p/u section 50Y(1)(a) Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (MAC-912642-2018) was stood down. The Accused was self-represented at the trial.

2       The charge states:

> You … are charged that you, on or before 17 December 2018, in Singapore, did consume a "Class A" controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, 2-\[l-(5-Fluoropentyl)-IH-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(i) of the said Act,

> and further,

> that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 13 January 2017 in District Court No. 24 vide DAC 946237/2015, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, methamphetamine, under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished with enhanced punishment under section 33(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed),

> and further,

> that you, from 7 April 2018 to 5 May 2019, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(l) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), and, while the remission order is in effect, you, on 17 December 2018, committed the aforesaid offence, and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(l)(b) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(l)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 140 Days from 17 December 2018 to 5 May 2019 for that offence. (_sic._)

3       The Prosecution called seven witnesses to prove its case. At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I called on the Accused to give his defence under section 230(1)(j) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The Accused gave his defence and, with the Prosecution’s assistance, called one witness for the defence. The Prosecution thereafter called four rebuttal witnesses.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Case

4       On 17 December 2018, at about 10.00pm, the Accused reported for his routine urine test at the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) office at Bedok Police Division.[^1] Staff Sergeant Muhammad Fauzan Bin Abdul Jalel (“SSgt Fauzan”) was attached to the CNB office at Bedok Police Division and was the urine escorting officer for the Accused.[^2] SSgt Fauzan had been handed a tray containing a test tube which in turn contained a pipette. A label containing the Accused’s personal particulars was pasted on the test tube. SSgt Fauzan called out the Accused’s name, as stated on the label.[^3] SSgt Fauzan instructed the Accused to wash his hands and to take one red-capped master bottle from a container with more than 20 similar bottles and two blue-capped smaller bottles from another container with more than 20 similar bottles. All the bottles were wrapped in plastic packaging.[^4] The Accused tore off the plastic packaging from the three bottles. SSgt Fauzan escorted the Accused to the toilet and watched him urinate into the master bottle. Thereafter, SSgt Fauzan escorted the Accused out of the toilet to a nearby work desk, where SSgt Fauzan asked the Accused for his National Registration Identity Card (“NRIC”) number and matched it against the NRIC number that was stated on the label.[^5] SSgt Fauzan instructed the Accused to transfer the urine specimen from the red-capped master bottle into the two blue-capped smaller bottles. Thereafter, SSgt Fauzan siphoned the urine specimen that remained in the master bottle and transferred it into the test tube that bore the label with the Accused’s personal particulars. SSgt Fauzan handed the tray containing the test tube to his colleague for the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) to be conducted.[^6] SSgt Fauzan sealed both blue-capped bottles with masking tape and heat-sealed the plastic packaging into which the blue-capped bottles were placed. The plastic packaging bore a label with the Accused’s personal particulars. SSgt Fauzan handed the labelled plastic packaging containing both bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen to the Accused, and instructed him to hold it at all times.[^7]

5       Sergeant Lin Yuanzhun Brandon (“Sgt Brandon”) was attached to the CNB office at Bedok Police Division and was the IUT operator at the material time.[^8] The urine reporting cards of the urine supervisees were handed to Sgt Brandon for registration. Sgt Brandon registered the Accused by scanning the Accused’s urine reporting card. The Accused’s barcode label was printed by the system and Sgt Brandon pasted the barcode label onto the test tube. The labelled test tube was then taken over by the urine escorting officer who escorted the Accused to the toilet for his urine specimen to be procured.[^9] Upon being handed back the labelled test tube containing the Accused’s urine specimen by the urine escorting officer, Sgt Brandon placed it inside the IUT machine for processing.[^10] The Accused’s urine specimen tested positive in the IUT.[^11] Sgt Brandon printed out the labels for both bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen to be sent to the Health Sciences Authority for analysis (“the HSA labels”), and handed the HSA labels to the sealing officer to seal the two blue-capped bottles.[^12] On 17 December 2018, at 10.16pm, Sgt Brandon lodged a police report against the Accused for having his urine specimen tested positive during his routine urine reporting.[^13]

6       Having been handed the HSA labels by Sgt Brandon, SSgt Fauzan called the Accused and instructed him to witness the sealing of the two blue-capped bottles containing his urine specimen. The Accused handed the plastic packaging containing the two blue-capped bottles of his urine specimen to SSgt Fauzan, who checked the HSA labels against the labelled plastic packaging.[^14] SSgt Fauzan sealed both bottles with the HSA labels. Thereafter, SSgt Fauzan placed both labelled bottles on top of two locked metal containers. He instructed the Accused to check his particulars on the two sealed bottles, and to place one bottle into each of the two locked metal containers. SSgt Fauzan then placed the two locked metal containers into the refrigerator.[^15]

7       Sergeant Mohammad Hambali Bin Amir (“Sgt Hambali”) was attached to the CNB office at Bedok Police Division. On 18 December 2018, at about 10.50am, Sgt Hambali obtained the two locked metal containers containing various urine specimens from a freezer in the CNB office and dispatched the said metal containers to HSA for analysis. The urine specimens in the locked metal containers included the two bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen. The metal containers were unlocked only at HSA by an HSA analyst.[^16]

8       Goh Mei Ling Evelyn (“Evelyn”) and Ng Chee Ann (“Ng”) were analysts at HSA’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory.[^17] Evelyn and Ng testified that the two bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen were received at HSA in locked security boxes from Sgt Hambali. An HSA officer opened the box and checked the particulars of the urine specimens against the submission form accompanying the boxes. The HSA officer proceeded to register each urine specimen upon confirming that the details were in order. The Accused’s urine specimen was among the specimens submitted and was registered with the case number 1833-12046. Evelyn testified that she verified the specimen with the submission form and made sure that the signature was present and the security seal was intact.[^18] Ng also testified that the Accused’s signature was on the bottle containing his urine specimen.[^19]

9       Evelyn and Ng testified that the Accused’s urine specimen as contained in the two bottles marked “C-SG-18-01477-1 KARPAYA JEGATHESAN SXXX” and “C-SG-18-01477-2 KARPAYA JEGATHESAN SXXX” was separately analysed and was found to contain 2-\[l-(5-Fluoropentyl)-IH-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, which they referred to as 5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA metabolite in short.[^20]

10     Evelyn and Ng testified that the consumption of 5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or 5-Fluoro-EDMB-PINACA would result in the 5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA metabolite being found in the urine specimen.[^21] 5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or 5-Fluoro-EDMB-PINACA are synthetic cannabinoids which are commonly known as “mushrooms”.[^22] They are usually dissolved and sprayed on tobacco or vegetable matter, and then consumed by smoking.[^23] They can be detected in a person’s urine specimen for a few days after the last consumption.[^24]

11     Following her analysis of the Accused’s urine specimen, Evelyn prepared a certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1833-12046-002-11 dated 31 December 2018.[^25] Thereafter, the Accused’s urine specimen was disposed of.[^26]

12     Following his analysis of the Accused’s urine specimen, Ng prepared a certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1833-12046-001-11 dated 2 January 2019.[^27] Thereafter, the Accused’s urine specimen was disposed of.[^28]

13     Leo Wen Quan (“Leo”) was the CNB Investigation Officer assigned to the Accused’s case.[^29] Through Leo, the Prosecution tendered the following documents:

> (a)     The Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions in respect of the Accused, which stated that on 13 January 2017 in District Court No. 24 vide DAC 946237/2015, the Accused was convicted of consumption of a specified drug, namely, methamphetamine, under section 8(b)(ii) MDA and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment,[^30]

> (b)     The Remission Order under Section 50I Prisons Act, which stated that the Accused was subjected to a remission order from 7 April 2018 to 5 May 2019;[^31]

> (c)     The Summary Sheet from the Singapore Prison Service, which stated that the Accused had 140 days remaining on his remission order as at the date of his offence on 17 December 2018;[^32] and

> (d)     A series of Discharge Summary reports from Changi General Hospital (“CGH”), which showed, _inter alia_, that the Accused was admitted into CGH on 29 November 2018 and was discharged from CGH on 12 December 2018.[^33]

14     Leo testified that he had requested CGH for all the Accused’s discharge summaries for a six month period until 17 December 2018, i.e. the date of the Accused’s positive urine test. Apart from the abovementioned discharged summaries which were tendered through Leo, there were no other discharge summaries from CGH for the period 13 to 17 December 2018.[^34]

15     Leo further testified that the Accused was not authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to consume the controlled drug that was found in the Accused’s urine specimen.[^35]

16     While cross-examining Leo, the Accused requested Leo to assist him in obtaining:

> (a)     The two medical certificates that he had submitted to the CNB office at Bedok Police Division;[^36] and

> (b)     His urine reporting card that he had kept in his wallet.[^37]

17     Senior Station Inspector Tang Teck Kim (“Tang”) was seconded from the Singapore Police Force to the Singapore Prisons Service as a provost officer, whose job scope was to conduct investigations for breaches under the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme.[^38] He had traced the Accused’s whereabouts one week prior to 17 December 2018. In so doing, he had obtained a series of “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists” from Selarang Halfway House for the period 11 to 17 December 2018.[^39] The “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists” showed that the Accused was hospitalised in CGH’s Isolation Ward on 11 December 2018[^40] and was discharged from CGH on 12 December 2018, whereupon he was required to return to Selarang Halfway House by 2300 hours that day.[^41] The “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists” also showed that the Accused was given time off from Selarang Halfway House on 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 December 2018 and that the Accused had left the Halfway House on those dates at 1900 hours, 1030 hours, 1830 hours, 1500 hours and 1210 hours respectively:[^42]

> (a)     13 December 2018 from 1900 hours to 2300 hours;[^43]

> (b)     14 December 2018 from 1030 hours to 2230 hours;[^44]

> (c)     15 December 2018 from 1830 hours to 2200 hours;[^45]

> (d)     16 December 2018 from 1500 hours to 2359 hours;[^46] and

> (e)     17 December 2018 from 1210 hours to 2359 hours.[^47]

18     Tang explained that these “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists” had been prepared ahead of time on 9 December 2018. As the Accused was still hospitalised in CGH’s Isolation Ward as at 9 December 2018, the “Remarks” column for 11 to 16 December 2018 accordingly stated “Hospitalised – CGH Isolation Ward”. It was subsequent to the preparation of the “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists” on 9 December 2018 that the Accused was discharged from CGH on 12 December 2018.[^48]

## Summary of the Accused’s Defence

19     The Accused gave evidence in his defence. While he agreed that he was admitted into CGH on 28 November 2018, he claimed that he was discharged only on 17 December 2018,[^49] whereupon he sought financial assistance from the Medical Social Services office and was given $3 by a female Malay social worker to go for his routine urine test at the CNB office at Bedok Police Division and to return to Selarang Halfway House.[^50] After obtaining his transport money, he collected his medication from CGH’s pharmacy and went for his routine urine test at the CNB office at Bedok Police Division, where he handed the two medical certificates to an officer there.[^51] His urine tested positive for opiates. A statement was recorded from him, and he deposited the two bottles of his urine specimen into the “urine box”, which he claimed had no padlock.[^52] Thereafter, he left the CNB office and returned to Selarang Halfway House.[^53] It was the Accused’s case that as he had gone to the CNB office for his urine test immediately upon his discharge from CGH on 17 December 2018,[^54] he could not have any opportunity to consume the controlled drug that was found in his urine specimen.[^55] He claimed that the controlled drug in his urine specimen could have resulted from the medication, food or drink that he had consumed while he was hospitalised in CGH or that the urine bottles containing his urine specimen could have been swopped by officers at the CNB office or at HSA.[^56]

20     The Accused claimed that apart from the two medical certificates that he had referred to earlier, there was another medical certificate from CGH which he had obtained on 17 December 2018 and which stated that he was unfit for duty until 16 December 2018. The Accused was not able to produce that medical certificate.[^57]

21     As requested by the Accused, the Prosecution, with the Investigation Officer’s assistance, obtained the two medical certificates which the Accused had handed to the CNB office on 17 December 2018. The Accused tendered both medical certificates in his Defence:[^58]

> (a)     Medical certificate from CGH bearing reference number RES2018239710 and dated 12 December 2018, stating that the Accused was unfit for duty for a period of 15 days from 28 November 2018 to 12 December 2018 (inclusive), and that the Accused had been admitted on 28 November 2018 and discharged on 12 December 2018;[^59] and

> (b)     Medical certificate from HL Family Clinic & Surgery (Bedok) Pte Ltd (“HL Family Clinic”) bearing reference number MC/82918 and dated 13 December 2018 (time-stamped 9.02pm), stating that the Accused had visited the clinic on 13 December 2018 and was unfit for work for two days from 13 to 14 December 2018.[^60]

22     The Accused also tendered:

> (a)     His urine reporting card;[^61] and

> (b)     A compilation of documents that he had received from CGH, comprising 18 pages.[^62]

23     In cross-examination, the Accused agreed that he had visited HL Family Clinic & Surgery (Bedok) Pte Ltd on 13 December 2018 and that he could not have obtained the medical certificate from the clinic unless he was not in CGH on 13 December 2018.[^63] When asked by the Court why he had visited HL Family Clinic on 13 December 2018, the Accused stated “I think I was still feeling very sick that day, Your Honour. I was suffering from tuberculosis, I went to get an MC for a day, and I was given for 2 days, Your Honour.”[^64] He claimed that he was also suffering from some chest pains.[^65] He stated that he was prescribed medication for tuberculosis after the doctor had checked his condition.[^66] When asked by the Court whether he had submitted the medical certificate to the CNB office, the Accused stated “I remember submitting this medical certificate from HL Family Clinic & Surgery”.[^67]

24     The Accused testified that it was possible for him to leave Selarang Halfway House on a daily basis and that it was necessary for him to do so every day because the Halfway House only provided breakfast and he had to take care of his lunch and dinner arrangements.[^68] When he left the Halfway House, he would work at times, visit his elder brother or try to search for a job.[^69] He stated that if he was working, he had to report back to the Halfway House by 12 am. If he was unemployed, he could spend about 12 hours outside.[^70]

25     The Accused informed the Court that he wanted to call the medical social worker at CGH to testify that she had given him $3 on 17 December 2018.[^71]

26     With the Prosecution’s assistance, the Accused called Fadhiilah Binte Ismail (“Fadhiilah”) to testify in his defence. Fadhiilah was a medical social worker at CGH who was stationed at Ward 17, which was an isolation ward for patients with various precautions.[^72] Her only interaction with the Accused was on 4 December 2018, after he was transferred to Ward 17 on 3 December 2018 and was referred to her for financial assistance.[^73] Upon reviewing the Accused’s case, Fadhillah noted that he was already receiving financial assistance from the social service office and that the assistance covered his hospitalisation stay and full treatment cost. He therefore did not require further financial assistance.[^74] Fadhillah did a psychosocial assessment on the Accused to find out more about him and to talk about his Tuberculosis condition and his plans upon being discharged from CGH.[^75] Fadhiilah testified that the Accused was discharged well from Ward 17 on 12 December 2018, with a series of appointments with various clinics for his follow-up medical treatment.[^76] The Accused was not given any follow-up appointment with medical social services.[^77] Fadhiilah testified that the Accused’s last known interaction with CGH’s medical social services was on 12 December 2018 when her social work assistant, a Mdm Mariam, gave the Accused financial assistance for his transport money home.[^78]

27     During cross-examination by the Accused, Fadhillah reiterated that the Accused was transferred to Ward 17 on 3 December 2018 and was discharged from Ward 17 on 12 December 2018.[^79] She had thereafter closed the Accused’s case on 13 December 2018, which showed that all interventions had been completed. She confirmed that neither she nor any other Muslim officer had attended to the Accused on 17 December 2018.[^80]

## Prosecution’s Rebuttal Witnesses

28     The Prosecution called four rebuttal witnesses. Joey Wu Zuyi (“Joey”) was an Executive at the CGH Medical Records Office’s Health Information Management Services.[^81] She had processed the Investigation Officer’s request for information on whether there were records that the Accused had visited CGH from 13 to 17 December 2018.[^82] Joey testified that there was no visit to CGH by the Accused from 13 to 17 December 2018.[^83] When asked about the Accused’s claim that he was in CGH on 17 December 2018 and had received a CGH medical certificate on that day, Joey testified that in order for a medical certificate to be issued, the doctor would have to see the patient in person before issuing the medical certificate. Since the Accused had not visited CGH from 13 to 17 December 2018, no medical certificate would have been issued to him.[^84]

29     Joey testified that based on CGH’s records, the Accused was admitted to Ward 34 on 28 November 2018.[^85] On 3 December 2018, he was transferred to Ward 17.[^86] On 12 December 2018, he was discharged from Ward 17.[^87] With reference to the length of stay (i.e. 14 days) that appears under “Admission Information” in the Accused’s Inpatient Discharge Summary,[^88] Joey testified that the length of stay referred to a patient’s total stay in CGH.[^89] She further testified that the reference to Ward 17 under “Dept/ Location/ Class” reflected the ward that the Accused was discharged from (i.e. Ward 17), and did not mean that he had stayed in Ward 17 for 14 days.[^90] In response to the Accused’s assertion that his medication had been given to him on 17 December 2018, she testified that a patient’s medication would be given to him on the same day of his discharge and that it was not possible for a patient to return a few days after his discharge to collect his medication.[^91]

30     Mohamed Fazli Bin Talip (“Fazli”), Zafi Alihussein Dohadwala (“Zafi”) and Mohamed Ismail Bin Abdul Moien (“Ismail”) were working as Operations Executives at Selarang Halfway House in December 2018.[^92] They testified that they had processed the Accused’s time off from the Halfway House on 15, 16 and 17 December 2018 respectively,[^93] and had personally interacted with him and witnessed his exit from the Halfway House on those dates and at the times stated in the “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists”.[^94]

31     The Prosecution tendered the Selarang Halfway House’s Daily Operations Log for 15 December 2018. According to the entry at 0936 hours, a Staff Nurse Nadia from CGH’s Ward 17 had telephoned Selarang Halfway House and informed Operations staff one Kas that the Accused’s appointment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Tuberculosis Control Unit was on 18 December 2018 at 1100 hours. Fazli testified that he informed the Accused of his appointment.[^95] According to the entry at 1812 hours, Fazli informed the Accused that the Deputy Executive Director of the Halfway House had instructed the Accused to place his medication at the front office in order for the Halfway House to administer the medication to the Accused as prescribed. The Accused refused to surrender his medication. Fazli informed the Accused that if the Halfway House could not account for the consumption of his medication, the Accused would have to continue his treatment elsewhere.[^96]

## Analysis of the Evidence

32     With effect from 1 May 2018, the First Schedule to the MDA lists 2-\[l-(5-Fluoropentyl)-IH-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and its hexanoic acid isomers and their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group as "Class A" controlled drugs, the unauthorised consumption of which is an offence under section 8(b)(i) of the Act.

33     On 17 December 2018, CNB officer SSgt Fauzan required the Accused to provide his urine specimen under regulation 15(3)(f) Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations for a urine test to be conducted. The Accused’s urine specimen was procured and transferred into two bottles which were then sealed and deposited into two locked security boxes, in accordance with the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations. The locked security boxes containing both bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen were thereafter collected and delivered to HSA by Sgt Hambali in accordance with the Second Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations. Urine tests were separately conducted on each of the two parts of the Accused’s urine specimens by different HSA analysts, namely, Ng and Evelyn, pursuant to Regulation 5 Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations.

34     Upon analysis by Ng and Evelyn, both parts of the Accused’s urine specimen were separately found to contain 2-\[l-(5-Fluoropentyl)-IH-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomers or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, as evidenced in the respective signed certificates that they had issued under section 16 MDA (P3 and P4).

35     The Accused’s defence was that he had been hospitalised in CGH from 28 November 2018 to 17 December 2018, and upon his discharge on 17 December 2018 had immediately reported for his urine test at Bedok Police Division’s CNB office. Having no opportunity to have consumed the controlled drug between his discharge from CGH and the procurement of his urine at the CNB office, he alleged that the controlled drug in his urine specimen was the result of medication, food or drink that he had consumed during his hospitalisation in CGH, or that the bottles containing his urine specimen had been swopped either by CNB officers or HSA officers.

36     CGH’s Medical Records Office executive Joey Wu Zuyi testified that the Accused was admitted into CGH Ward 34 on 28 November 2018 and was transferred to Ward 17 on 3 December 2018, after which he was discharged from Ward 17 on 12 December 2018. She testified that there were no records of the Accused receiving treatment in CGH from 13 to 17 December 2018, which also meant that no medical certificate could have been issued to the Accused for the period after 12 December 2018. This was corroborated by CGH medical social worker Fadhiilah who was stationed in Ward 17, and who attended to the Accused on 4 December 2018 to assess his need for financial assistance and to conduct a psychosocial assessment on him. Fadhiilah confirmed that the Accused was discharged from Ward 17 on 12 December 2018, and that medical social services had upon his discharge on 12 December 2018 provided him with transport money home. Having completed all necessary intervention for the Accused, Fadhiilah closed his case on 13 December 2018.

37     The evidence of Operations Executives Fazli, Zafi and Ismail from Selarang Halfway House and the entries in the “Time Off Approval / Rejection Lists” for 11 to 17 December 2018 clearly showed that the Accused was discharged from CGH on 12 December 2018, returned to Selarang Halfway House on the same day and was thereafter given time off from the Halfway House every day from 13 to 17 December 2020. In fact, Fazli, Zafi and Ismail had personally interacted with the Accused, processed his time off and witnessed him leaving the Halfway House on 15, 16 and 17 December 2018 respectively. The Daily Operations Log also documented the interaction that Fazli had with the Accused at 0936 hours and 1812 hours on 15 December 2018.

38     Apart from his bare assertion that he was discharged from CGH only on 17 December 2018 (instead of 12 December 2018), the Accused did not adduce any evidence to challenge the Prosecution’s case as to the date of his discharge from CGH and his subsequent movements. In fact, the Accused’s assertion was contradicted by the very documents that he had adduced in his defence. First, the CGH medical certificate bearing reference number RES2018239710 and dated 12 December 2018 clearly stated that the Accused was unfit for duty for a period of 15 days from 28 November 2018 to 12 December 2018 (inclusive), and that the Accused had been admitted on 28 November 2018 and discharged on 12 December 2018.

39     Second, the HL Family Clinic medical certificate bearing reference number MC/82918 and dated 13 December 2018 clearly stated that the Accused had visited the clinic on 13 December 2018 and was unfit for work for two days from 13 to 14 December 2018. Had the Accused been hospitalised in CGH from 13 to 17 December 2018, he would not have been able to visit the clinic. Neither would there have been a need for him to have done so since his medical needs would have been taken care of within CGH. There would also have been no need for him to have obtained a medical certificate to excuse him from his urine reporting obligations on 13 December 2018 (a Thursday).

40     Third, the CGH documents that the Accused tendered in his defence similarly contradicted his assertion that he was hospitalised in CGH from 13 to 17 December 2018. Page 1 of the Inpatient Discharge Summary on page 9 of D4 stated that he was admitted on 28 November 2018 and was discharged on 12 December 2018. Page 3 of the abovementioned Inpatient Discharge Summary stated “Patient discharged stable on 12/12/18”. The referrals for appointments at other specialist clinics were all dated 12 December 2018 and all stated that the Accused was admitted “from 28/11/18 – 12/12/18”.[^97]

41     When invited to explain the contradictions in his case, the Accused claimed:

> (a)     that he could not recall the exact date and the circumstances surrounding his visit to HL Family Clinic;[^98]

> (b)     that he had visited HL Family Clinic in August 2018 and not on 13 December 2018;[^99]

> (c)     that the HL Family Clinic medical certificate dated 13 December 2018 was forged;[^100]

> (d)     that he had not provided the HL Family Clinic medical certificate dated 13 December 2018 to the CNB office on 17 December 2018;[^101] and

> (e)     that he had on 17 December 2018 submitted to the CNB office a CGH medical certificate for the period 13 to 16 December 2018, which had since disappeared.[^102]

42     In respect of the Accused’s allegation that the controlled drug in his urine specimen might have resulted from the medication that he had been prescribed during his hospitalisation in CGH, HSA analyst Evelyn testified that none of the 20 medications that the Accused had been prescribed would give rise to the controlled drug in the Accused’s urine specimen.[^103] Both HSA analysts Evelyn and Ng testified that it was the consumption of only 5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or 5-Fluoro-EDMB-PINACA (commonly known as “mushroom”) would result in the controlled drug being detected in the Accused’s urine specimen.[^104]

43     I found the Accused to be a witness whose testimony was illogical, internally inconsistent, and contradicted by all other oral and documentary evidence adduced in the trial (including his own defence exhibits).

## Decision on Conviction

44     Having assessed the evidence in its totality, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted him on the charge accordingly.

45     Upon the Accused’s conviction on DAC-909492-2019, the Prosecution applied for the stood down charge (MAC-912642-2018) to be withdrawn pursuant to section 147 CPC. Accordingly, I ordered a Discharge Amounting to an Acquittal in respect of MAC-912642-2018.

46     The Accused admitted to having the following drug-related antecedents:

47     Section 33(4) MDA states that “If any person convicted of an offence under section 8(b) or 31(2) is again convicted of an offence under section 8(b) or 31(2), he shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 3 years unless he is punished under section 33A for that same offence.”

48     The Prosecution submitted for the Accused to be sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment and with enhanced punishment of 70 days’ imprisonment under section 50T Prisons Act.

49     In mitigation, the Accused pleaded for leniency and urged the Court to backdate his sentence to 29 December 2018 when he was first remanded.

## Decision on Sentence

50     I sentenced the Accused to the mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 70 days’ imprisonment under section 50T Prisons Act, backdated to 29 December 2018, the date that he was first remanded.

51     In deciding to impose an enhanced punishment on the Accused under section 50T Prisons Act and in calibrating the length of the enhanced punishment at 50% of the maximum 140 days’ imprisonment that he was liable to be punished with, I noted that the Accused’s remission period was from 7 April 2018 to 5 May 2019 (about 13 months), and that he had re-offended on or before 17 December 2018, about eight months into his remission period, with five months remaining. I also noted that the present offence of drug consumption was similar in nature to the offences for which he had been placed on remission, namely drug consumption and drug possession, which showed his recalcitrance in respect of drug-related offences and the limited deterrent effect that his previous incarceration had had on him.

## Conclusion

52     The Accused was dissatisfied with my decision and appealed against his conviction and sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.
