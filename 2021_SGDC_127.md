Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 22/2021.\]

15 July 2021

### District Judge Ng Tee Tze Allen:

## Introduction

1       On 30 May 2015 just before 10.00pm, an accident took place between the plaintiff who was riding his motorcycle FX7326S (the “plaintiff’s motorcycle”) and the defendant who was driving his car SKK1336L (the “defendant’s car”) along Brickland Road. Brickland Road is a two-way road with three lanes on each side. Both parties were heading towards Chua Chu Kang. The plaintiff was changing from the leftmost lane to the rightmost lane, and the defendant was travelling straight on the rightmost lane. Seconds after the plaintiff entered the rightmost lane, the defendant’s car collided into the rear of the plaintiff’s motorcycle.[^1] The plaintiff lost control of his motorcycle, fell, and sustained injuries.

## Issues

2       The action was bifurcated and the trial was on liability only.

3       The defendant accepted responsibility for the accident but argued that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.[^2] The plaintiff disagreed, arguing that the defendant was fully to blame. As such, the key issues before me were: (a) whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, and (b) if so, how liability should be apportioned.

4       Having considered the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I found the plaintiff to be contributorily negligent. I apportioned liability at 20% to be borne by the plaintiff and gave interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff to the extent of 80% of the damages to be accessed.

5       The plaintiff has appealed against my decision. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Whether the plaintiff was contributory negligent

6       Even though the defendant accepted responsibility for the accident,[^3] this did not automatically mean that he was fully liable. The doctrine of contributory negligence provides him with a partial defence assuming the plaintiff could have prevented the accident. The focus here is on the plaintiff. His right to damages may be reduced if: (a) he ought to have objectively foreseen that his failure to act prudently could result in hurting himself, and (b) he failed to take reasonable measures to guard against that foreseeable harm: _Asnah Bte Ab Rahman v Li Jian Lin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> (“_Li Jian Lin_”) at \[1\], \[18\].

7       In my view, it was objectively foreseeable that failing to change lanes prudently could lead to injuries. Vehicles travel at high speeds, and road accidents are not uncommon. As the Court of Appeal observed in _Li Jian Lin_ \[30\], “accidents inevitably occur” for many reasons including “fatigue or distractions”. While most road users comply with traffic rules, “one must recognise that humans are not infallible and do suffer from occasional lapses”. Indeed, “inattention” is identified as a “common cause of traffic accidents” at page 45 of the Highway Code (Cap 276, R11, 1990 Rev Ed).[^4] In fact, this was what happened. The defendant failed to notice the plaintiff and collided into him after the plaintiff entered the rightmost lane (see \[17(a)\] below).

8       This brings us to the next question: did the plaintiff fail to take reasonable measures to guard against the risk of an inattentive driver who may not have noticed a motorist who just changed lanes?

9       While I accepted that the plaintiff took some care before changing from the middle lane into the rightmost lane (see \[17(b)\] below), I did not think that he took sufficient care. As the plaintiff was riding at night, he should be “specially careful … as it is more difficult to judge speed and distance”: rule 60 of the Highway Code.[^5] Rule 55 of the Highway Code further provides that a driver “must not change lanes so suddenly as to inconvenience or endanger other traffic”. In this regard, paragraph 130 of the Basic Theory of Driving Handbook The Official Handbook (9th Ed) further advises drivers to “give clear signals well in advance of \[his\] intentions (at least 3 seconds) before \[his\] manoeuvre so that other road users can interact safely.” Finally, Rule 64(b) of the Highway Code makes clear that the plaintiff should not be changing lanes “if it would force another vehicle to … reduce speed”.

10     This, however, was not how the plaintiff changed lanes. All in, it took him seven seconds to change two lanes.[^6] These events were caught on video. About 1min 16sec into the video, the plaintiff is seen signalling right on the leftmost lane. He entered the middle lane four seconds later,[^7] continued signalling right for the two seconds that he took to cross from the left to the right of the middle lane,[^8] and was in the rightmost lane one second later.[^9] The video also showed the plaintiff’s motorcycle to be slower than the traffic (or to be more specific, the defendant’s car) in the rightmost lane. Indeed, the defendant’s car collided into the plaintiff’s motorcycle three to four seconds after the plaintiff’s motorcycle entered the rightmost lane.[^10]

11     That the plaintiff changed from the middle lane to the rightmost lane quickly is clear from his own case. In his written submissions, the plaintiff stated that “he entered the \[middle\] lane at 1:20, he then signalled his intent to switch from the \[middle\] lane to the \[rightmost\] lane at 1:21 … \[and\] had successfully changed lanes into the \[rightmost\] lane at 1:23”.[^11]

12     The plaintiff’s manoeuvre left other road users with little time to react. It also left him with little time to determine whether it was safe to change lanes[^12] (e.g. that other road users knew of his intentions and were prepared to do so), and how to do so. Had the plaintiff remained in the middle lane for a reasonable period of time after signalling, he might have seen the defendant’s car, reconsidered his actions, and prevented the accident. For instance, he could have delayed changing lanes.[^13] He could also have increased his speed to match those of the road users in the rightmost lane.[^14] Either would have prevented the accident.

13     For completeness, I pause to comment on the speed of the parties and the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant was speeding. In my judgment, the evidence was insufficient to make such a finding. While the video footage showed the defendant’s car to be faster than the plaintiff’s motorcycle, there was no objective evidence on either party’s respective speeds. As such, I proceeded on the basis that both parties were travelling at a legally permissible speed.

## How liability should be apportioned

14     For the reasons above, I found the plaintiff contributorily negligent. I turn to the issue of apportionment of liability.

15     Here, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant should be 100% liable because this was a front-to-rear collision.[^15] However, the defendant submitted that he should only be held 40% liable. In support, the defendant referred me to three cases where road users who had changed lanes suddenly were found substantially liable for the accident: see _Chong Chye Kong v Chin Chee Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 197</span> at \[5\] and \[27\]; _Mohamed Rafin Bin Kadim v Chia Sze Kim Justin Mark_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 14</span> at \[4\] and \[23\]-\[24\]; and _Lam Wei Yin v Lim Boon Leong_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGMC 11</span> at \[2\] and \[34\].

16     Both parties’ submissions were not fully on point:

> (a)     While the present accident had features of a front-to-rear collision in that the both parties were travelling in the same lane at the time of the accident, it was not a straightforward front-to-rear collision. The plaintiff’s motorcycle was not in the defendant’s lane throughout. It had entered the defendant’s lane shortly before the collision.

> (b)     The defendant’s cases were distinguishable as well. Unlike the defendant’s cases where the lane change resulted in the other party being unable to react, the present accident occurred three to four seconds after the lane change. This should have been enough time for the defendant to notice the plaintiff’s motorcycle and prevent the collision.

17     In my judgment, the defendant should bear greater liability for the accident. Even though the plaintiff could have avoided the accident himself by riding in a safer fashion (see \[12\] above), the circumstances made clear that the defendant was more culpable.

> (a)     The accident occurred three to four seconds after the plaintiff changed lanes (see \[10\]-\[11\] above). This should have been enough time for the defendant to notice the plaintiff’s motorcycle and to prevent the accident. However, the defendant did not. He admitted in his affidavit of evidence in chief that he only saw the plaintiff’s motorcycle after he felt the impact of the collision.[^16] This indicated to me that the defendant was not paying attention whilst driving.

> (b)     In contrast, the plaintiff had taken some steps to change lanes safely. First, the video showed the plaintiff signalling before changing into the rightmost lane. Second, I accepted that the plaintiff had checked his rear-view mirror before changing lanes. Even though it was not for the “_two, three or one to three seconds_” that the plaintiff claimed,[^17] I did not think that the plaintiff was so foolhardy as to change lanes without checking for oncoming traffic at all. Indeed, unlike his second lane change into the rightmost lane, the plaintiff took four seconds after signalling to make his first lane change into the middle lane (see \[10\]-\[11\] above). This indicated to me that the plaintiff was ensuring that there was no immediate oncoming traffic before changing lanes.

18     I turn to the exact apportionment of liability. As mentioned, I agreed that the current accident had features of a front-to-rear collision. In such cases, _The Motor Accident Guide: A Guide on the Assessment of Liability in Motor Accident Cases_ (2nd Edition, 2017 State Courts, Singapore) (“_MAG_”) suggests at p 91 that the driver of the vehicle behind (“Driver X”) should be 100% liable. The MAG continues at p 95 to 96 to identify circumstances where liability should be imposed on the driver of the vehicle in front (“Driver Y”). Thus, if Driver Y stopped / slowed down suddenly (presumably for good reason), his liability would be increased by 10%. But if he does so for reasons other than in response to exigencies of traffic or in compliance with road signs or traffic lights or to give way to pedestrians at pedestrian crossings, his liability would be increased by 50% to 80%.

19     In the present case, the plaintiff did not identify any good reason for changing lanes the way he did. That said, the slower speed that he was riding at could not be characterized as stopping / slowing down _suddenly_ in front of another vehicle. I was proceeding on the basis that both parties’ speed was legally permissible (see \[13\] above). Thus, considering the circumstances in their entirety, I found the plaintiff 20% liable for the accident.

## Conclusion

20     Interlocutory judgment is given to the plaintiff to the extent of 80% of the damages to be accessed. Issues of interest and costs to be reserved to the hearing of the assessment of damages.
