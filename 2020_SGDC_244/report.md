\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9831/2020/01.\]

20 October 2020

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Chan Lue Min, a 23 year-old Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty to a charge of house-trespass under s 451 read with s 34 of the Penal Code namely:

Charge

> …are charged that you, on the 4th day of September 2019 at about 9pm, at Hall 406 of Suntec Convention Hall, located at 1 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039593, which is a building used for the custody of property, together with Tan Jian Hong, Nicholas, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did enter the    ‘Best Denki’ booth in Hall 406 to commit theft of the following:

>> 1.    80 pieces of MS Office home&student 2019, valued at $229 each;

>> 2.    40 pieces of MS Office home&business 2019, valued at $379 each; and

>> 3.    20 pieces of MS Office 365 personal, valued at $108 each.

> with a total value of $35,640 in the possession of one Quek Hong Guan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 451 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       As the accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) without any qualification and in view of his overall criminality, I had sentenced him to eighteen months’ imprisonment. I allowed his application for a deferment of his sentence to 30 October 2020 so that arrangements could be made for his mother. The accused was placed on court bail of $10,000 with one surety.

3       On 2 October 2020, the accused filed a notice of appeal against his sentence. The matter was fixed for a post-sentence mention on 8 October 2020 for bail pending appeal to be fixed. The accused is presently on bail of $10,000 with one surety pending the hearing of his appeal.

4       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

> **Statement of Facts**

> Persons Involved

> The complainant is Quek Hong Guan, a 42-year-old Singaporean male. He is a retail assistant manager at “Best Denki”.

> 2    The accused is Chan Lue Min, a 23-year-old Singaporean male. At the material time, he was an employee of “Best Denki”.

> 3    The co-accused is Tan Jian Hong, Nicholas, a 31-year-old Singaporean male. The co-accused’s case is at the mentions stage.

> 4    The accused and co-accused met while they were both employees of “Best Denki” sometime in 2018 or 2019.

> First Information Report

> 5    On 5 September 2019 at about 12.35 p.m., complainant called Police Emergency hotline ‘999’ indicating “Last night someone broke into our booth at COMEX. We left the place at 745pm and now we noticed the door chipped off and 90 pieces of Microsoft Office missing”. The incident location provided was Suntec City at 1 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039593.

> Facts relating to DAC-903449-2020

> 6    COMEX Singapore 2019, an IT fair, was scheduled to be held at Suntec City Convention Hall (“the convention hall”), from 5 till 9 September 2019 (“the IT fair”). The complainant’s employer, ‘Best Denki’, was one of the participants that had a booth inside Hall 406 of Suntec City Convention Hall. The booth was an area for the storage of IT products to be sold during the IT fair.

> 7    About a week prior to the IT fair, the accused contacted the co-accused through WhatsApp, asking if he was interested in stealing from Best Denki’s booth during the IT fair. The co-accused agreed to participate and after obtaining the floor plan for the IT Fair online, they discussed and made plans to steal from Best Denki.

> 8    On 3 September 2019, COMEX workers, including the accused, assisted in setting up the booth for Best Denki’s products by storing IT products inside the booth. Within the rectangular booth, a room was partitioned to store smaller items i.e. software discs, memory cards, mobile phones and tablets. The room was secured by a door and the booth was itself secured by two other doors. While setting up the booth, the accused took photos of the door and noted the possible entry points for the co-accused. After storing the products, the workers and the accused left the booth.

> 9    Later that day on 3 September 2019 at about 6.00 p.m., the accused met the co-accused for dinner. As the co-accused was not working at the IT fair and was not supposed to be inside the convention hall on 3 September 2019, the accused took a COMEX staff pass from Best Denki’s booth to the co-accused in case they bumped into security.

> 10    The accused informed the co-accused that there was a smaller room within the booth which stored Microsoft Office products. The duo then discussed and planned how to get into and exit the booth. As the accused was afraid of heights, he suggested that the co-accused climb the walls into the booth while he kept a lookout. The co-accused agreed.

> 11    On 4 September 2019, at about 9.00 p.m., the duo took a taxi to the convention hall with the intention to commit theft. They knew that they were not supposed to be in the convention hall at that time and chose to commit the offence at night so as to minimize the risk of detection. After arriving at the convention hall, the accused and co-accused entered the building and took the service lift located at the loading bay up to level 4 where Hall 406 was located. The duo then entered Hall 406, a building used for the custody of property, from the rear entrance and walked to the booth. The accused and co-accused were not lawfully authorized to enter the booth at this time.

> 12    At the booth, the co-accused stacked up boxes so that he could scale the wall of the booth. The co-accused climbed up the wall and pulled opened the advertisement board that was part of the booth wall. He then made an opening between the booth frame and the advertisement board and squeezed through the opening to enter the booth. After he entered the booth, he opened the locked door from inside to allow the accused to enter.

> 13    Inside the booth, the co-accused stacked up boxes to climb over the partition forming the room inside the booth. After he entered the room, he opened the locked door from the inside for the accused. The accused persons then dishonestly removed ‘Microsoft Office’ products from the shelves out of the complainant’s possession and placed them into the bags they brought along. On their way out of the room and booth, they locked the room’s door and the booth’s door. They then took the rear hall exit, took the service lift down and exited the building from the security counter. The accused and co-accused then split the stolen items equally and left the scene. The accused persons intended to sell the stolen items for profit.

> 14    On 5 September 2019 at about 10.00 a.m., the complainant arrived at the booth to receive water cartons. The complainant and his colleagues discovered the following items with a total value of $35,640 missing:

>> I.    80 pieces of Microsoft Office Home & Student 2019, valued at $229 each;

>> II.    40 pieces of Microsoft Office Home & Business 2019, valued at $379 each; and

>> III.   20 pieces of Microsoft Office 365 personal, valued at $108 each.

> 15    The theft was reported to the Police and the accused and co-accused were subsequently arrested on 5 September 2019 at around 8.00 p.m. The abovementioned items were recovered.

> 16    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 451 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

## Antecedents

5       The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

6       In their written address on sentence, the Prosecution had sought for a sentence of at least two years’ and six months’ (30 months’) imprisonment.

#### The relevant sentencing principles

7       It was submitted that the relevant sentencing principles for an offence under s 454 of the Penal Code was set out in _Public Prosecutor v Shamsul Bin Sa’at_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 132</span> (“_Shamsul_”) at \[26\] and \[33\]-\[38\]. It was the Prosecution’s case that even though the principles set out in _Shamsul_ were in the context of an offence of house-breaking by night to commit theft, the same principles applied to that of house-trespass to commit theft, given the similar elements of the offence, as well as the identical sentencing consideration of general deterrence.

8       It was submitted that in _Shamsul_, the court took into account the following factors which it regarded as aggravating:

> (a)     The offence was committed in a residential premise;

> (b)     The accused had taken advantage of his prior access to the flat by virtue of his continuing relationship with the victim’s daughter;

> (c)     The offence was premeditated as the accused had found out when the victim would be alone at home; and

> (d)     The accused had taken extra care to conceal his identity by using a T-shirt to cover his face and gloves to conceal fingerprints.

9       It was further submitted that apart from the factors laid out in _Shamsul_, the following factors adapted from Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (3rd ed, LexisNexis) from page 924 - 925 were also relevant:

10     It was submitted that a deterrent sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment was supported by relevant sentencing precedents. It was the Prosecution’s case that while there is a dearth of relevant case law involving similar values (~$30,000), it was clear, based on the s 451 of the Penal Code precedents, that a sentence of at least 15 months’ was called for based on _PP v Johanes Andy Tanbun Eugene_ (“_Johanes Andy_”) ($4,562.80, untraced, pleaded guilty).

11     It was the Prosecution’s case that the court should arrive at a sentence of at least 30 months’ imprisonment, taking into account the following aggravating factors in the present case:

> (a)     Motive: the accused intended to sell the stolen items for profit;

> (b)     High value of items stolen: $35,640;

> (c)     High degree of premeditation and sophistication: the accused had intended to commit the offence about a week ahead of the IT fair, masterminded the entire affair, roped in a co-accused and meticulously directed the co-accused in committing the offence;

> (d)     Abuse of trust: the accused committed the offence against his employer and had abused his role as one of the workers to not only identify entry points, but procure a COMEX pass to facilitate the co-accused;

> (e)     Offence committed at night: the accused committed the offence at night so as to avoid detection.

## Mitigation

12     In the accused’s written plea in mitigation, his Defence Counsel had urged the court to call for a pre-sentencing probation suitability report having regard to his young age, character and previously clean disciplinary record.

13     In the alternative, it was submitted that should the court be minded to impose a term of imprisonment, to impose a sentence of up to five months’ imprisonment having regard to his level of culpability and criminality as well as the circumstances of this case in line with sentencing precedents.

14     It was submitted that the accused was immensely remorseful and sincerely regretted his involvement in the events that led to the offence and he promised not to allow himself to get involved with any activities that are improper in future.

15     It was further submitted that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, thereby preventing the legal proceedings from being prevaricated and saving valuable resources and costs from being expended by the Prosecution and the court.

16     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had no previous convictions of any kind or any adverse disciplinary record and has an exemplary track-record throughout his personal and professional life. It was highlighted that he had never been reprimanded, warned, disciplined and/or sanctioned in respect of any conduct-related or integrity-related incident.

17     It was submitted that the accused was not one with a callous disregard for the law. He had no history of displaying any improper conduct and/or behaviour in any environment; on the contrary, he has consistently been a law-abiding person of good character, integrity and honour.

18     It was the Defence’s case that his involvement in the offence was completely out of character and it was borne out, committed and/or contributed as a result of a lapse and error of judgment / misjudgement and particularly when considered in light of, _inter alia_, the fact that he has no history of displaying any dishonest conduct and/or behaviour in any environment.

19     The Defence had further highlighted the following factors:

> (a)     The accused is a youthful offender and he was only 22 years old when he got involved in the series of events which led to the offence;

> (b)     The offence was not carried out in an overly sophisticated manner and it was an act that can reasonably be characterized as opportunistic and impulsive;

> (c)     The accused and the co-accused had acted in concert in carrying out the offence. The accused was certainly not the mastermind who had directed or led the co-accused to commit the offence;

> (d)     He had not personally profited from the incident in question;

> (e)     All the items stated in the charge have been recovered in full;

> (f)     The accused had only gotten involved in the events leading to the offence out of desperation as he was facing immense pressure at the material time due to his inability to pay off his credit card debts. He has since made the necessary arrangements to have his debts paid off on an instalment basis; and

> (g)     His employer at the material time had faith in him and had continually employed him throughout the proceedings, despite his transgression. This was testament to his upstanding character and evinces that the offence a one-off occurrence that had been committed impulsively.

20     It was submitted that the accused’s involvement in the offence stemmed from a foolish and impaired judgment that was contributed to in part by a lack of consideration / insight into his actions; in a display of bad judgment, he had imprudently became involved in the offence without much forethought.

21     It was submitted that he was certainly not of a criminal type and there is an extremely low and remote likelihood of his re-offending; he has no history of dishonest or anti-social conduct or behaviour. Importantly, he had no history of having any characteristics, traits and/or predilection of and/or for the commission of any similar offending acts.

22     It was further submitted that given his renewed focus and progress in being a useful member of society and to contribute meaningfully to the lives of others, he has promised to not commit any offences in the future and, rather, has a very clear and good prospect of being substantially reformed and rehabilitated by virtue of his revitalised determination, renewed work ethic and supportive family.

23     It was the Defence’s case that he had suffered guilt for both letting himself down as well as severely disappointing his family whom have stood by him through these proceedings, and he had certainly learnt his lesson from the present offence and was resolved not to commit any offences in the future;

24     It was submitted that against this backdrop, he had suffered additional personal stress, hardship and guilt as a result of these proceedings against him. He was remorsefully aware that any custodial sentence and/or criminal record would be a blemish on his otherwise clean disciplinary record. Nevertheless, these proceedings had been a ‘wake-up call’ to him and he was now resolved to get his life back on track – he has dedicated himself to doing his best to fulfil his true potential and become a useful member of the community upon the completion of these proceedings. It was highlighted that most recently, he even worked as an executive helping out with the COVID-19 efforts.

25     In spite of the difficult personal and family circumstances which the accused had lived through in this case, he was nevertheless determined to do everything possible within his ability and means to ensure that he is able to restore his loved ones’ pride and faith in him. Importantly, he resorts to live a simple life after the proceedings have ended and he endeavours to find stable employment and work hard to look after his family.

26     It was highlighted that he was gravely saddened by the prospect of an inevitable stain on his record which would create a substantial obstacle to overcome in his climb towards having a peaceful and rewarding personal and professional life. It was further highlighted that he had co-operated with the authorities’ investigations at all times; and offered without reservation the full details of his involvement and culpability.

27     It was the Defence’s case that given the facts of this particular case, the ends of justice can and would be adequately served by calling for a pre-sentencing probation suitability report or in the alternative for a sentence of up to five months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that this would produce an outcome and sentence that would be commensurate with the seriousness of his actions in this case and which would appropriately and effectively punish him and deter him from re-offending.

28     His Counsel then proceeded to set out his personal family background, his educational background, National Service as well as his employment background at \[5\] – \[13\] of his plea in mitigation. It was submitted that it was entirely to the accused’s credit that he was able to persevere and complete National Service and has even been consistently able to secure stable, full-time employment in spite of the challenging circumstances he had to overcome.

29     It was highlighted that after completing National Service, he had immediately found work as a sales specialist selling products for Lenovo (Singapore) Pte Ltd. He was first engaged by TekMedia Venture Pte Ltd in 2017, then wei!Creative (SG) Pte Ltd in 2019. In the three years as a sales specialist, he had met all sales targets and proved himself to be an adept and capable salesperson.

30     It was submitted that crucially his employer continued to have faith in his upstanding character and fully trusts that he would turn over a new leaf upon conclusion of these proceedings. His supervisor, Mr Ong Wei Ming, had provided a written testimony attesting to his good character and propensity for reform. He had continually employed him throughout the proceedings despite his transgression. It was further submitted that this was strong indication that his involvement in the offence was a one-off occurrence that is unlikely to be repeated under any circumstances and that he is an individual who is entirely deserving of a second chance.

#### Facts relating to the offence

31     According to the Defence, based on the accused’s instructions the series of events at the material time were as follows: -

> (a)     In or around July 2017, the accused got to know the co-accused Tan Jian Hong, Nicholas whilst working at a roadshow event as a sales specialist under TekMedia Venture Pte Ltd;

> (b)     The co-accused was a salesperson who was charged with promoting the sale of products for Dell Asia Holdings Pte Ltd at the same roadshow event. As they were working in close proximity at the time, they gradually became acquainted and kept in contact with each other, even after the roadshow event ended;

> (c)     They got to know each other on a more personal level when they were both assigned to work at the Best Denki outlet at Waterway Point Shopping Mall in December 2017;

> (d)     The accused was stationed at the Best Denki outlet at Waterway Point Shopping Mall for more than a year while his co-accused alternated between outlets at Waterway Point Shopping Mall, City Square Shopping Mall and Parkway Parade Shopping Mall;

> (e)     They kept in touch with each other whilst his co-accused took on several transient jobs which included, amongst others, the promotion of healthcare products and part-time administrative work. His co-accused was unable to hold down a stable, long-term job and found himself in a dire situation financially. At the material time, the accused had accumulated a significant amount of credit card debt and faced an immense amount of pressure to repay the debt;

> (f)     During a casual meeting with the co-accused, they had discussed the idea of taking products from an IT Fair that the accused was scheduled to be working at, then selling the products in order to alleviate the financial strain felt by both of them;

> (g)     The IT Fair was scheduled to take place between 5 September 2019 to 8 September 2019 at Suntec Convention Hall and they had the idea of entering the premises and taking the products on 4 September 2019, which was the scheduled day for exhibitors at the IT Fair to set up their booths;

> (h)     The co-accused had also asked the accused to take an additional exhibitor’s pass for the former just in case he was questioned on the reasons for his presence at Suntec Convention Hall on set-up day as he was no longer working for any of the exhibitors / distributors at the IT Fair;

> (i)     In the evening, both of them had entered through the carpark and up to the exhibition hall, where the Best Denki booth was located. When they arrived at the booth, the co-accused had climbed over the partition wall and into the Best Denki booth;

> (j)     He then proceeded to climb over another partition wall and into Best Denki’s makeshift storeroom which held the products intended for sale. The co-accused proceeded to open the storeroom door and let Francis enter;

> (k)     Unbeknownst to the both of them, their actions were caught on film by the CCTV camera located in the exhibition hall; and the accused was then taken into custody the following day, whilst he was working at the IT Fair.

#### Submissions on sentence

32     It was highlighted that the four classical principles of sentencing – retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation – are well established in our criminal jurisprudence. The principle of rehabilitation in sentencing “generally assumes centre stage when the offender is young, specifically, when he is below 21 years of age” (see: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ \[2008\] 1 SLR (R) 449, VK Rajah JA at \[31\]). This is so, given that young offenders’ capacity for reform is “greater during the formative years of their lives” and that it is “generally accepted that the young would tend to be more impulsive and did not know better” (_PP v Jonas Andersen_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 27</span>, at \[31\]); _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span>, at \[21\]). In this regard, it further highlighted that it is trite that a probation order accords primacy to the principle of rehabilitation.

33     In respect of the Defence’s request for the calling of a pre-sentence probation report, it was submitted that the principles expounded in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1294</span> were relevant and instructive. In _Jordan Lim_ at \[31\] to \[32\], the High Court stated that although there is a presumptive view that the primary sentencing consideration for young offenders is that of rehabilitation and that a probation order might therefore be deemed a more viable option in such cases, it is also clear that it does not mean that adult offenders who have attained the age of 21 years old at the time of conviction can never be sentenced to probation. The age of 21 does not operate as “some sort of a bright line beyond which probation can never be granted”.

34     Accordingly, in appropriate cases, adult offenders who are 21 years old or above at the time he or she is convicted can be sentenced to probation (at \[33\]). It was submitted that this was an appropriate case wherein a probation order was a viable sentencing option for the following reasons:

> (a)     The accused is a youthful offender and the offence was committed when he was 22 years old;

> (b)     He was a first-time offender and has a clean disciplinary record;

> (c)     All the items stated in the charge have been recovered in full;

> (d)     He had assisted with police investigations unreservedly and had dutifully attended all court hearings in respect of the present proceedings; and

> (e)     He was genuinely and immensely remorseful for his involvement in the offences and he had shown significant improvement in terms of his attitude, behaviour and outlook in life.

35     In the circumstances, it was submitted that there was cause for optimism as to the accused’s prospects for rehabilitation and/or propensity for reform and he should be given a chance at probation. Accordingly, the court should take the above considerations into account in determining the suitability of probation and to call for a pre-sentence probation report.

#### Sentencing trends

36     In support of its submission for the calling of a pre-sentence probation report, it was highlighted that a search on the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIR) showed that for an offence under s 451 of the Penal Code during the period 22 October 2001 and 20 July 2020, an order for probation had been made on no less than twelve occasions.

37     It was further highlighted that in respect of sentences for which terms of imprisonment were ordered, the sentencing trend during the period from 22 October 2001 to 20 July 2020 showed that imprisonment terms in majority of the cases involving offences range from two to 12 months, with the most common trend being four to six months. It was conceded that there was no explanation and/or description of the context in which the sentences were ordered. It was submitted that such illustrations depicting the sentencing trends were nevertheless instructive.

#### Sentencing precedents

38     In addition to the submissions on the sentencing trends, the Defence had also set out various sentencing precedents for offences under s 451 of the Penal Code at \[39\]. It was submitted that the case _PP v Francis Ng Wee Keng_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 333</span> was most relevant as the amount involved was also fairly large _ie_ $52,401.68. He had faced a total of 22 charges, six of which were under s 451 of the Penal Code and the remaining offences involved a host of other offences including cheating, causing hurt, as well as road traffic offences. He had pleaded guilty to two s 451 offences while the other four were taken into consideration. For each of the s 451 charges, he was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment.

39     It was submitted that the sentence meted out in the present case should be significantly lower than 15 months’ imprisonment and much less so for the 30 months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution for various reasons:

> (a)     The harm was obviously lower. The value of items taken in that case was in excess of $50,000, almost $17,000 higher than the value of the items in the present case;

> (b)     The accused’s culpability was also significantly lower than the offender in _Francis Ng_. The offender in _Francis Ng_ has a string of antecedents dating way back to 1986. He has no less than six prior convictions for theft-related offences. The offender was clearly recalcitrant deserving of a particularly deterrent sentence;

> (c)     In _Francis Ng_, he had also committed the s 451 offences whilst on the run in respect of the other offences that he was charged for; and

> (d)     The offender had trespassed into six residential units to steal the items which was a particularly aggravating factor.

In contrast, the accused was a first-time offender who had committed a one-off offence out of foolishness.

40     It was submitted that based on the range of sentences imposed, in the present case a sentencing discount should be accorded to the accused to reflect his lower culpability as well as overall criminality. For this reason, a sentence of five months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

#### Sentencing principles and benchmarks

41     It was submitted that the views of the V K Rajah J (as he then was) which were stated in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ \[2005\] 3 SLR at \[24\] and \[39\] were instructive in respect of the importance of determining the appropriate sentence based on the actual facts of the case at hand. Essentially, it was highlighted that:

> (a)     the circumstances of each case are of paramount importance in determining the appropriate sentence;

> (b)     No two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical; and

> (c)     Every sentence reflects a complex amalgam of numerous and various factors and imponderables and requires the very careful evaluation of matters such as public interest, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the identity of the offender. Most crucially, it calls for the embodiment of individualised justice.

42     It was also submitted that it has been categorically established in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span>, _inter alia_, at \[53\] which was subsequently cited with approval by the High Court in _Thong Sing Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 47</span> that genuine remorse and contrition is a valid mitigating factor. In the circumstances, his Counsel had urged the court to find that the accused was indeed extremely remorseful for his actions. The court was also urged to accord significant and due weight to his clear expression and evidence of his genuine remorse and that his decision to plead guilty and accept responsibility for his actions had thereby saved valuable resources from being further expended by the authorities at a trial.

43     On the general sentencing principle of reliance on sentencing precedents or benchmarks sentences, the Defence had referred to _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 194</span> at \[22\] – \[23\] where the High Court had expressly cautioned against an ill-informed, unfeeling or overly perfunctory application of such (or similar) sentencing precedents. He had further referred to _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> at \[20\] – \[36\], where the High Court had emphasised the importance of ensuring proportionality of a sentence with regard to the severity of the offence committed as well as by the moral and legal culpability of the offender.

44     It was the Defence’s case that the sentencing precedents relied upon by the Prosecution were of limited guidance (as compared to those relied upon by the Defence) as they were unreported decisions (See: _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathlee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 250</span> at \[21\] to \[22\]. It was submitted that in most of the cases cited by the Prosecution, most of the offenders were either traced with several similar offences or had theft-related antecedents or that no restitution was made nor were items recovered in most of the cases. Further, the offenders in the cases cited by the Prosecution had committed several other offences apart from the offence under s 451 of the Penal Code, while in this case, the accused only faced one charge.

45     In the present case, the Defence had urged the court to have full regard of the fact that the full extent of the accused’ criminality would be adequately and appropriately reflected by the sentence as requested above. It was submitted that the quantum of the imprisonment sought would be an appropriate sentence in this case which would not be manifestly inadequate. Rather, it would adequately affirm the seriousness of the offence, but which would not punish the accused excessively in comparison with what the courts have imposed in more egregious cases.

46     It was further submitted that whilst he would inescapably receive a sufficiently serious sentence for the present offence, the court was urged to consider that he nevertheless deserved a second chance on account of the fact that he had foolishly and misguidedly committed the offence, and that a severe or disproportionately exacting sentence that has a crushing effect was therefore unjustified.

47     In conclusion, the court was urged to show leniency to the accused in the circumstances and to accede to the Defence’s humble and reasonable requests on the basis that there were deserving mitigating factors in his case.

## Prosecution’s Reply

48     In response to the Defence’s submissions on sentence, it was stated that at the outset that probation was not the appropriate sentence in this case. The accused is an adult offender. He had committed the offence about a month shy of him turning 23.

49     In the premises, it was submitted that it was fairly clear that the dominant sentencing consideration was that of deterrence and this sentencing consideration was not displaced by the need for rehabilitation because there was no exceptional circumstances and neither had he demonstrated any extreme propensity for reform (See: _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span>).

50     It was further submitted that in any case, the offence committed was premeditated and fairly grievous. A sentence of five months proposed by the Defence was manifestly inadequate and was not supported by law. It was the Prosecution’s case that while they had relied on unreported cases, the facts were very similar and they served as a useful guide for which the court could adjust the sentence upwards fairly.

51     It was noted that the Defence has cited a sentencing trend from the sentencing repository. It was highlighted that this sentencing trend does not state anything about the sort of sentence that should be imposed for a case involving the present facts and this was simply because the sentencing trend also included cases where an accused person could have merely trespassed into a place, without committing any other offence. It was submitted that this was not the case here because theft was committed and a high value of items was involved.

52     It was the Prosecution’s case that there was no reason to rely on _Francis Ng_. It was a case involving multiple transactions of offending and numerous antecedents. The offender was also suffering from low intellectual functioning and had a brain injury which affected his cognitive functions. In the premises, there was no meaningful comparison that could be drawn between _Francis Ng_ and the present case. The main consideration in that case was the totality of the sentence meted out in light of the assortment of offences committed in the antecedents as well as his brain injury. It was noteworthy that in respect of the proceeded charges faced in that case, for the three proceeded charges, he had stolen $5,800, $6,400, and $14,900 worth of items. It was submitted that he was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for each of the charges despite the clear differences in value.

53     It was the Prosecution’s case that _Francis Ng_ should not be relied on particularly where the Prosecution had sentencing precedents which showed a much clearer trend. In the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents, the offenders were all generally untraced or if they are traced, they are traced for unrelated offences. They also faced generally one proceeded charges.

54     In _Public Prosecutor v Johanes Andy Tanbun Eugene_, the accused was charged with one count under s 451 in DAC 910060/2017 with one s 379 charge for theft taken into consideration. He had entered into the office of a church to commit theft and stole laptops with a total value of $4,500. It was submitted that for a meagre sum of $4,500, the accused was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. It was noteworthy that in this case while the items were not recovered, it was further submitted that recovery is not a mitigating factor.

55     It was submitted in _Shaikh Farid v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1081</span>, the Defence had argued that the fact that misappropriated cash was fully recovered was akin to restitution, but the High Court had rejected that argument stating that it was wholly misconceived because recovery was due to the investigating efforts of the police and no credit should be given to the accused.

56     The fact that the accused in this case did not receive any personal gain was also not mitigative because he had chosen to commit the offence in the first place. It was submitted that just based on a cursory glance of the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, an uplift needs to be applied in the present case because of the high value of items that were stolen, the premeditation involved, and the abuse of position. So, in light of all these factors, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment would not be manifestly excessive.

#### Prescribed Penalty

57     The accused had committed the present offence on 4 September 2019 at about 9pm. The prescribed punishment for an offence of house-trespass in order to commit the offence of theft under the second limb of s 451 of the Penal Code prior to 1 January 2020 is a term of imprisonment which may be extend to seven years. The provision has since been enhanced and re-classified as an offence of house-breaking in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment with a term of imprisonment which may extend to ten years and the offender shall also be liable to a fine.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

58     In the present case, I was mindful of the stark disparity between the Prosecution’s sentencing position and that of the Defence. The Prosecution had urged the court to impose an imprisonment term of at least two years’ and six months’ (30 months’) while the Defence had sought a probation order or in the alternative, a much shorter custodial sentence.

59     It was the Prosecution position that probation was not the appropriate sentence in this case as the accused is an adult offender who had committed the offence about a month shy of him turning 23. It was clear that deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration and this sentencing consideration was not displaced by the need for rehabilitation because there was no exceptional circumstances and neither had he demonstrated any extreme propensity for reform (See: _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span>).

60     In contrast, the Defence urged the court to call for a pre-sentencing probation suitability report in view of his young age, character and previously clean disciplinary record. In the alternative, should the court be minded to impose a term of imprisonment, the Defence had urged the court to impose a sentence of up to five months’ imprisonment.

#### Whether a probation order is appropriate

61     In considering whether to call for a probation report, I was mindful that as a general rule, a probation order is inappropriate for a serious offence or where the harm caused was severe. In the present case, the offence committed by the accused was a serious offence as reflected in the mandatory term of imprisonment and the lengthy maximum sentence of seven years. In particular, the present charge was an offence of house-trespass in order to commit theft of items with a total value of $35,640 under the second limb of s 451 of the Penal Code which is an aggravated form of house-trespass and that serious harm was caused.

62     In addition, the imposition of probation on adult offenders is the exception rather than the norm. Rehabilitation could be an operative concern of an offender above the age of 21, only if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform or there are exceptional circumstances (See: _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[44\]; see also _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> at \[35\]).

63     It was undisputed that at the time of the offence, the accused was not a young offender below the age of 21 years but was an adult offender. He was already a month shy of turning 23 years of age and at the time of the offence was an employee of the victim. I noted that after completing his National Service, he had worked as a sales specialist for three years and had proved himself to be an adept and capable salesperson. From a careful scrutiny of his detailed written plea in mitigation presented before me, I was unable to discern any evidence that showed that the accused had extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there were any exceptional circumstances. Hence, the sentencing framework for young offenders was not applicable in the present case.

64     Further, this was not the case where the accused person was labouring under any serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder that had a causal link to the commission of the offences. Under these circumstances, I was unable to accept the Defence Counsel’s contention that a probation report should be called and that probation be imposed in view of his young age, character and previously clean disciplinary record. Furthermore, there were aggravating factors as reflected in the unchallenged Statement of Facts for the present case that weighed clearly in favour of deterrence. Hence, I did not call for a pre-sentence suitability report for probation.

65     In determining the appropriate sentence for the present case, the factors to be considered include:

> (a)     Circumstances of offence;

> (b)     Planning and Premeditation;

> (c)     Intention to commit an offence;

> (d)     Mode of entry _eg_ forcible and whether there was ransacking;

> (e)     Any damage to property;

> (f)     If occupants are in, whether any threat/fear caused to occupant;

> (g)     Abuse of position;

> (h)     Stolen properties recovered;

> (i)     Owner left unit opened/ unoccupied;

> (j)     Whether the offences were at night to evade detection.

#### Aggravating factors

66     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a high degree of premeditation and sophistication in the commission of the offence. The accused had intended to commit the offence about a week ahead of the IT fair, masterminded the entire affair, roped in a co-accused and meticulously directed the co-accused in committing the offence.

67     This was evident from the fact that the accused had taken photos of the door within the Best Denki booth and noted the possible entry points for the co-accused. In addition, he had also taken a COMEX staff pass from the Best Denki’s booth for the co-accused in case they bumped into security. Both of them had discussed and planned how to get into and exit the booth after obtaining the floorplan of the IT Fair online. The accused had also acted as a lookout when the co-accused broke into the said booth.

68     I was mindful that they had committed the offence at night so as to minimize the risk of detection. In addition, they were also well-prepared to respond to the possibility of the detection of the co-accused by obtaining a COMEX staff pass in the event they bumped into security.

69     Based on the above, I was unable to accept the Defence’s submission that the offence was not carried out in an overly sophisticated manner and it was an act that could reasonably be characterized as opportunistic and impulsive. Contrary to the Defence's assertion, it was clear that the accused was the mastermind who had directed or led the co-accused to commit the offence.

70     It was also an aggravating factor that they had committed theft of Microsoft Office products of a significant value _ie_ $35,640 which they had intended to sell the stolen items for profit. It was only fortunate that all the stolen items were recovered after the police conducted their investigation. Furthermore, the accused had abused his position of trust when he committed the offence against his employer and had abused his role as one of the workers to not only identify entry points, but procured a COMEX pass to facilitate the co-accused unauthorised entry into the Best Denki booth located at Hall 406 of Suntec Convention Hall on 4 September 2019.

#### Mitigating factors

71     I was also mindful that in the present case the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 451 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Although he was not a youthful offender, he was a young adult offender. He had assisted with police investigations, dutifully attended all court hearings in respect of the present proceedings and had expressed genuine remorse for his actions.

72     Based on the nature and the circumstances of the case, in my view his level of culpability as well as the degree of harm caused could not be considered as being in the low range. In terms of the harm caused, I was of the view that serious harm was caused as a substantial amount was involved _ie_ $35,640 although all the stolen items were recovered by the police. As the amounts involved in the present case was clearly substantial, I was of the view that this should point towards a significant custodial sentence being imposed.

73     In terms of the accused’s culpability, as the present case involved a high degree of planning and premeditation, an abuse of position of trust as well the commission of the offence at night to evade detection, it fell within the higher band of the moderate range.

74     In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the present charge, I had considered the sentencing precedents tendered by both the Prosecution and the Defence. As the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents involved unreported cases, I was mindful that it carried little weight in its precedential value but served as a useful guide to the sentencing trends. Although the sentencing precedents tendered by the Defence involved reported cases, they did not involve similar factual background as the present case and was of little assistance.

75     In my view, the starting point for an offence under s 451 of Penal Code involving aggravating factors such as a high degree of planning and premeditation, an abuse of position of trust as well the commission of the offence at night to evade detection is 15 months’ imprisonment. An uplift of the sentence would be necessary to reflect the substantial amount involved as compared to the cases cited by the Prosecution.

76     In my view the proposed sentence of up to five months’ imprisonment proposed by the Defence would not adequately reflect severity of the offence and the need to impose a deterrent sentence. Nevertheless, I was of the view that a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment would be excessive based on the facts and circumstances of the present case. In my view an uplift of three months’ from the starting point of 15 months’ imprisonment would adequately reflect the accused’s culpability, the harm caused as well as both the mitigating and aggravating factors in the present case.

77     Accordingly, after a careful consideration the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct, I imposed a sentence of eighteen months’ imprisonment for DAC 903449 - 2020. In my view such a sentence could not be considered as manifestly excessive in light of the circumstances of the present case and the need to reflect that the dominant sentencing consideration for such an offence was that of deterrence.

78     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused has filed a notice of appeal against his sentence and is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
