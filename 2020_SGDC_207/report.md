Tort - Defamation – Defamatory statements

Tort - Defamation – Justification

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 19/2020.\]

11 September 2020

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiffs’ claim is based on defamatory statements made by the defendants, arising from renovation works carried out by the plaintiffs, at the defendants’ home. The defendants also had a counterclaim arising from the plaintiffs’ renovation works.

2       I dismissed both the plaintiffs’ claim and the defendants’ counterclaim. The plaintiffs have appealed against my decision.

## Facts

3       The defendants are husband and wife. The defendants had in August 2017, engaged the first plaintiff to carry out renovation works at their new condominium unit at Canberra Drive. The first plaintiff is part of the Fineline Group of Companies (“the Fineline Group”), which include the second to fifth plaintiffs.

4       The plaintiffs were recommended by Qanvast, an online home renovation platform connecting homeowners with interior designers. In June 2017, the defendants met the plaintiffs’ Aloysius Pek (“Aloysius”). The defendants dealt with Aloysius until February 2018, when they expressed their unhappiness with Aloysius to the plaintiffs. Samuel Chong (“Samuel”) then took over from Aloysius, who subsequently left the plaintiffs’ employment.

5       According to the plaintiffs’ senior project designer, Sim Hock Chong, otherwise known as “Roger”, the defendants wanted the following works to be done:

> (a)     Fabricate and install one toy display cabinet.

> (b)     Fabricate and install one television console and feature wall.

> (c)     Fabricate and install one half height shoe cabinet.

> (d)     Fabricate and install one L-shape wardrobe in the guest room.

> (e)     Installation of various electrical works throughout the unit.[^1]

6       Roger’s evidence was that the total eventual contract value was for the sum of $11,852.50.[^2]

7       According to the defendants, there were delays and defects in the renovation works. They also complained about the plaintiffs’ unfulfilled promises and lack of oversight. The defendants repeatedly approached the plaintiffs to resolve their concerns, but little was done to address the defendants’ complaints.

8       In May 2018, the defendants published online articles on the plaintiffs, in Google Review and Hometrust.sg. The statements relied upon by the plaintiffs against the defendants are as follows:

> (a)     In Google Review, the following statements made by the first defendant:

>> (i)       “1st impression when meeting the so-called self-proclaimed ID (more of a salesperson caliber)”,

>> (ii)       “Now, after almost 7 months of dealing with them, finally realised a lot of things they also cannot make it”,

>> (iii)       “Worst ID experience. Do not be fooled by their honeyed sweet worded sales tactics”,

>> (iv)       “…beware, u will need to do their job … while they continue to source for new customers.”[^3]

> (b)     In Google Review and Hometrust.sg, the following statements made by the second defendant:

>> (i)       “It has been an amazing journey with Fineline”,

>> (ii)       “Where’s my overtime pay and where’s my keys? A whole new definition to “Handover Day” in the Interior Designing world dictionary”,

>> (iii)       “You get to also work closely with their Sub-cons because they themselves are always ‘in (other) appointments’!”,

>> (iv)       “My journey started since Jul 2017 and has just ended voyage few days ago!”, and

>> (v)       “You must be wondering, why a 1 star rating for such an amazing journey… Coz this adventure is not meant for the faint hearted and please be prepared to have lotsa time off your work to enjoy the journey. Sadly, none applies to me. That said, my zen-ness level did level up – All the chasing and waiting for their calls (which may not even happen) this few months helps!”[^4]

## The parties’ positions

9       The plaintiffs’ case is that the statements made by the defendants as set out above are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning, in that they meant that:

> (a)     The Fineline Group had misrepresented and/or defrauded the defendants into executing the Renovation Contract.

> (b)     The Fineline Group have been dishonest in their dealings with the defendants after the Renovation Contract had been executed.

> (c)     The Fineline Group are unreliable, negligent, unprofessional and wholly incompetent in the performance of their work, profession, business or trade.

> (d)     The Fineline Group have caused loss to the defendants and that the Fineline Group will further cause loss to future customers who engage the Fineline Group’s services.[^5]

10     The defendants’ position is that the statements meant that:

> (a)     The first plaintiff did not carry out their works in a timely manner, caused the defendants lots of wasted time and their works were not of merchantable quality.

> (b)     The first plaintiff did not attend at the premises to supervise the subcontractors and left it to the defendants to do so.

> (c)     The defendants found their experience dealing with the first plaintiff to be their worst.

> (d)     The defendant had to take time off work and their weekends to supervise the first plaintiff’s subcontractor and workers.[^6]

11     The defendants further rely on the defence of justification.

## Issues

12     The key issues at the trial, were:

> (a)     the meaning of the statements made against the plaintiffs, and

> (b)     whether the defendants have established their defence of justification.

## Meaning of the statements

13     In _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ (“_Chan Cheng Wah_”) <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 506</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[18\]:

> The general principles applicable to the construction of words based on their natural and ordinary meanings are as follows:

>> (a)    the natural and ordinary meaning of a word is that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable person;

>> (b)    as the test is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended to convey is irrelevant;

>> (c)    the ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can read between the lines and draw inferences;

>> (d)    where there are a number of possible interpretations, some of which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only the defamatory one;

>> (e)    the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus “the bane and the antidote must be taken together”; and

>> (f)    the ordinary reasonable reader will take note of the circumstances and manner of the publication.

14     In relation to the plaintiffs’ case that the statements made by the defendants are defamatory in that they meant that the plaintiffs had misrepresented, defrauded or had been dishonest with the defendants, I find that the statements made by the defendant do not make out this meaning claimed by the plaintiffs.

15     In particular, the statements relied upon by the plaintiffs against the defendants, do not mean that the plaintiffs had misrepresented, defrauded or had been dishonest with the defendants. The statement “Now, after almost 7 months of dealing with them, finally realised a lot of things they also cannot make it” puts into context the subsequent statement “Worst ID experience. Do not be fooled by their honeyed sweet worded sales tactics”.[^7]

16     Read together, the statements merely mean that the plaintiffs’ promises made in pitching for sales to their customers should not be trusted, as the work done and service provided fell short of what was promised. In essence, the defendants’ statements mean that the plaintiffs had over promised and under delivered. Although the defendants’ evidence was that they “felt cheated”[^8], it is the objective meaning of the words that were used by the defendants that is crucial, rather than how the defendants felt, in deciding the meaning of the defendants’ statements.

17     As for the plaintiffs’ case that the defendants’ statements mean that the Fineline Group are unreliable, negligent, unprofessional and _wholly_ incompetent in the performance of their work, profession, business or trade and have caused loss to the defendants and _will_ further cause loss to future customers, I find that the statements mean that the Fineline Group are unreliable, negligent, unprofessional and incompetent and have caused loss to the defendants and _may_ cause loss to future customers, a slightly narrower meaning than that put forward by the plaintiffs.

## Justification

18     The issue then is whether the defendants have established their defence of justification.

19     In _Kay Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club_ (“_Kay Swee Pin_”) <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 288</span>, the High Court held at \[55\]:

> To succeed in a plea of justification, the defendant need only prove that the substance or gist of the offending words (as opposed to those parts of the offending words which do not add to the sting of the alleged defamation) is true …

20     In the Court of Appeal decision of _Chan Cheng Wah_, which I have referred to earlier, it was held at \[44\]:

> The defendant has only to prove the “sting” of the charge, and some leeway for exaggeration and error is given. As stated by Burrough J in _Edwards v Bell_ (1824) 1 Bing 403 at 409:

>> … it is sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be justified; it is unnecessary to repeat every word which might have been the subject of the original comment. As much must be justified as meets the sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not add to the sting of it, that need not be justified.

21     In the present case, the sting of the libel was that the Fineline Group are unreliable, negligent, unprofessional and incompetent.

22     In _Kay Swee Pin_, the court further held at \[57\]:

> When deciding the issue of justification, I have to decide whether a sufficient proportion of the allegations made … were factually correct. … So the question which I have to decide is whether the defendants made good on a balance of probabilities the sting of the libel is substantially true. The defendants do not need to prove each and every word is true.

23     In support of their defence of justification, the defendants raised the following key points:

> (a)     the plaintiffs’ failure to live up to their promises,

> (b)     the plaintiffs’ inconsistent documentation,

> (c)     the plaintiffs’ delays and defects in relation to the display cabinet,

> (d)     the defects in relation to the wardrobe, and

> (e)     the plaintiffs’ failure to oversee the works.

### The plaintiffs’ failure to live up to their promises

24     The defendants complained that Aloysius, the first interior designer assigned by the plaintiffs to work with them, failed to live up to his promises, after the plaintiffs had paid their deposit. The first defendant in a WhatsApp message of 13 February 2018 at 15:40, informed Roger, the plaintiffs’ senior project designer, that “It is evident that on several occasions, things were not delivered as per promised”, referring to the 3D drawings provided by the plaintiffs, not being in accordance with what was previously discussed, in particular, the design of the wardrobe, the position of the air conditioner and the dimensions of the display cabinet.[^9]

25     In Roger’s reply of 14 February 2018 at 9:25, he did not dispute these complaints raised by the first defendant, but merely stated that “we will be arranging my team member Samuel to follow thru on your project … he will be very much detailed”.[^10]

26     It is not disputed that it was the plaintiffs’ Aloysius who worked with the defendants initially, until he was subsequently replaced by Samuel, as stated in Roger Sim’s aforesaid reply of 14 February 2018 at 9:25.

27     Aloysius was not called by the plaintiffs to give evidence. He had left the plaintiffs’ employment. Roger’s evidence was that “Aloysius left on a bad term”[^11] and that he “left the company … due to … some issues with his clients”[^12]. As such, there was no evidence from the plaintiffs to dispute the defendants’ evidence of the promises made by Aloysius, which the defendants complained were not fulfilled.[^13]

28     Oddly, considering the defendants’ dissatisfaction with Aloysius, the plaintiffs replaced Aloysius with Samuel, who had even less experience. Aloysius had two years’ experience, whereas Samuel only had one year’s experience, as acknowledged by Roger in cross-examination.[^14]

29     The explanation for this, can be found in Roger’s evidence in re-examination that Samuel was “really good … in PR … he have good PR skills … he’s a very polite person”.[^15] It is clear from Roger’s evidence that he thought the issues that the defendants had with Aloysius merely related to communication, rather than failing to provide what was promised to the defendants.

### The plaintiffs’ inconsistent documentation

30     The inconsistent documentation from the plaintiffs, point to the incompetence and negligence of the plaintiffs’ team members. Although the contract was with Fineline Unique Pte Ltd (the first plaintiff), the renovation permit was with Fineline Design Pte Ltd (“Fineline Design”, the second plaintiff) and the handover form was from Fineline Spacious Pte Ltd (the fourth plaintiff).[^16] When cross-examined on this, Roger’s evidence was “Samuel is a person who is not very good in paperwork”[^17] and it was “the paperwork that was done wrong”.[^18] The CD drawing was provided from yet another company, Fineline Inspiration Pte Ltd (the third plaintiff).[^19]

31     Roger claimed that Samuel was “trying to improve” on his paperwork.[^20] However, when Samuel was cross-examined on the renovation permit being under Fineline Design, he was utterly confused. First he insisted twice that he did not apply for the renovation permit, then he accepted that he did make the application.[^21] When questioned on whether it was a mistake to use Fineline Design, he responded “I’m sorry, I’m unable to answer this question. For issues related to the company names … please let my … management answer.”[^22]

32     The haphazard documentation would have made it unclear to the defendants, which of the Fineline companies was actually working on the project. Roger’s evidence was that:

> … assigned companies would often tap into the larger support network/resources provided by the Fineline Group as a whole to make available to its clients the full suite of Fineline Group’s expertise in the renovation/interior design industry.[^23]

33     Although it is open to the first plaintiff to tap on the support that may be provided by other companies in the Fineline Group, it cannot assign work to these companies and yet shield them from complaints on shortcomings, when they themselves fail to provide clarity on which company is doing the work. The plaintiffs cannot now complain that the defendants’ statements against the plaintiffs were not specific to the first plaintiff, the company contracting with the defendants, when the plaintiffs themselves utilised various companies in their work for the defendants and were inconsistent in their documentation on the company carrying out the work for the defendants.

### The plaintiffs’ delays and defects in relation to the display cabinet

34     The haphazard manner in which the renovation works were carried out by the plaintiffs is further evidenced by the change in the glass for the display cabinet. The plaintiffs had furnished drawings showing 8 mm glass in a single pane as specified by the defendants.

35     However, the plaintiffs had to change the glass from a single pane of 8 mm to two panes of 6 mm, after they discovered that a single pane of 8 mm was unsafe and unworkable, because it was too heavy and the hinges were unable to bear the weight.[^24] The plaintiffs only discovered this at a very late stage, when they sought professional advice from their carpenters.[^25] This change was contrary to the plaintiffs’ drawings, where with a single pane, there would be no line when seeing through the glass.[^26] The plaintiffs’ Samuel acknowledged in cross-examination, that “this is my mistake” and the delay was caused by him.[^27] He accepted that “It was me who did not do it well for them.”[^28]

36     There was a further issue with the display cabinet in that there was an “Error in the display cabinet depth resulting in protruding glass”.[^29] Essentially, the plaintiffs were required to build a display cabinet that would have sufficient depth to accommodate the defendants’ Lego display piece.

37     Unfortunately, the plaintiffs’ error caused the display cabinet to be too narrow, such that the display piece could only be placed in the cabinet, by having the glass panel in front of the display piece protruding out, instead of being flush with the cabinet. As a result, this glass panel stuck out obtrusively, whereas the other glass panels were flush with the cabinet. In cross-examination, the plaintiffs’ Roger acknowledged that “I cannot … deny it’s our error”[^30] and that the only solution was to re-do the display cabinet.[^31]

### The wardrobe defects

38     Further evidence of the plaintiffs’ incompetence and negligence can be seen in Roger’s ignorance in the course of the trial that the 4 inch gap behind the wardrobe had not been rectified. Roger’s repeatedly changed his evidence in cross-examination, as follows:

> (a)     Initially, Roger claimed that “the cabinet was rectified”[^32] (in cross-examination, counsel and Roger inadvertently referred to the wardrobe as “cabinet”).

> (b)     He then claimed that “I was told was done”[^33], before qualifying his evidence to say “I never really see”.[^34]

> (c)     Finally, Roger acknowledged that “this is my mistake. I really thought that it was done already”.[^35]

39     The plaintiffs’ Samuel, alleged in cross-examination that the gap was “for future blinds or curtains.”[^36] However, this was never dealt with in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, even though the defendants had expressly pleaded that there was an “Error in the wardrobe dimensions resulting in a large gap between the wall and the wardrobe”[^37].

40     Furthermore, Samuel’s allegation that the gap was for future blinds or curtains was also inconsistent with Roger’s evidence that he thought the gap was rectified and that he was told that it was done. If there was any basis for Samuel’s allegation, there would be no reason for Roger to initially claim that the gap was rectified. In the premises, I am not inclined to believe Samuel’s allegation on this.

### The plaintiffs’ failure to oversee the works

41     The defendants sent a complaint to Qanvast on 14 May 2018,[^38] documenting the plaintiffs’ failure to oversee the works. The issues raised included:

> (a)     That the plaintiffs “did not even turn up on several occasions and just leave us to deal with their sub-cons and carpenters for the past 2 months”.

> (b)     That the plaintiffs’ Samuel failed to take responsibility to resolve issues when complaints were raised on the flooring and simply pushed the blame on his workers as follows:

>> When we asked why there are so much chips and scratches on the flooring when we’ve already told him weeks before about the lax (holes) on the protection works but these were still not being replaced when the carpentry was installed, Samuel said “**I told the men to replace already but they never, what can I do?**”

>> \[emphasis in original\]

> (c)     That the plaintiffs had failed to oversee the work on the display cabinets as follows:

>> Now, we are still on the glass installation of our display cabinets which have been going on for months. There’s multiple redos because after drilling holes and re-filled the holes, the workers realised it’s all failure, but not a single time did Roger or Samuel come to oversee the glass workers. We have been left to communicate and trouble shoot with the workers, and following which having to update them.

42     Essentially, the complaints raised the incompetence, unreliability, negligence and unprofessionalism of the plaintiffs.

43     Roger’s response to this email, in his WhatsApp message of 16 May 2018 at 18:19 to the defendants was “Thanks for the awesome feedback to Qanvast. Well appreciated.” A further message at 18:23 stated, “Btw \[I\] remove Samuel from this group. He wanna big time by my boss”.[^39] Roger’s evidence in cross-examination was that this was “meant to be sarcastic”.[^40]

44     I found Roger’s evidence in this respect troubling for the following reasons:

> (a)     If the response of “Thanks for the awesome feedback to Qanvast. Well appreciated” was taken on its face, this clearly showed that the plaintiffs accepted the complaints raised by the defendants.

> (b)     On the other hand, if the reply was “meant to be sarcastic” as alleged by Roger Sim in cross-examination, it further shows his lack of professionalism in handling feedback from his customer, particularly when seen in the context of his repeated changes in evidence and ignorance as to whether the 4 inch gap behind the wardrobe complained of by the defendants was rectified.

## Conclusion on the plaintiffs’ claim

45     In light of the aforesaid reasons, the defendants have succeeded in their defence of justification. Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ claim was dismissed. The interim injunction that was previously obtained by the plaintiffs was discharged.

## Defendants’ counterclaim

46     As for the defendants’ counterclaim, I am not satisfied from the evidence that the second defendant’s injuries[^41] were caused by dust or other pollutants while overseeing the plaintiffs’ workers. The second defendant claimed that she suffered flu symptoms since the handover day on 4 April 2018.[^42] Yet there is no evidence that she went to see a doctor prior to consulting an eye specialist at the end of May.

47     Furthermore, the report from Dr Lim Ing Ruen dated 2 August 2018 makes no mention that the second defendant’s symptoms may have been caused by dust from renovation. It was only after repeated cross-examination that Dr Lim gave evidence that it was related.[^43] In the premises, I am unable to find that the second defendant’s injuries were caused by dust and pollutants while overseeing the plaintiffs’ workers.

48     As for the cut suffered by the second defendant to her thumb, as there is no medical evidence adduced in relation to this cut, I am not prepared to award any damages for this item.

49     As for the defendants’ claim for leave to attend to the plaintiffs’ subcontractors, there is no evidence that the defendants incurred any financial loss in having to take leave. In the premises, this claim was also dismissed.
