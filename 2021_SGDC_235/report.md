22 October 2021

### District Judge Melissa Tan:

1       The Accused is a 32-year-old male Singaporean. He pleaded guilty to four counts of cheating by personation under s 419 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and one count of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code. He admitted to and consented for the remaining ten charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charges”). The TIC charges comprise:

> (a)     six similar charges under s 419 of the Penal Code;

> (b)     three charges under s 403 of the Penal Code for misappropriating a wallet and credit cards; and

> (c)     one charge under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“Computer Misuse Act”) for using a misappropriated credit card to top up his EZ-link card.

2       The Accused was sentenced to a total of 12 months’ and one week’s imprisonment. The individual sentences imposed are as follows:

3       The Accused has filed an appeal against the sentence imposed. A stay of execution of the sentence was granted. The Accused is currently on bail pending the appeal.

## The charges

4       The cheating by personation charges were similarly framed, save for details relating to the time and place of the offence, credit cards involved, and the amount cheated. For reference, I have reproduced DAC-931281-2019 in full:

>     You … are charged that you, on the 3rd day of October 2019 at about 2.29am, at The Beacon, a bar located at 6 Raffles Boulevard, #01-01/02/03, Marina Square, Singapore 039594, did cheat a staff of the said establishment, to wit, by presenting one WestPac Bank Credit Card bearing the number \[xxx\] under the name of Romeril David Robert to the said staff, intending to deceive the said staff into believing that you were the rightful holder of the said credit card when you knew that you were not, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said staff to accept the said credit card as payment for three bottles of Belvedere 3-litre vodka alcohol valued a \[_sic_\] SGD 2,950, which the said staff would not have done had he not been so deceived, and which act caused damage to the said establishment in property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 419 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

5       For ease of reference, the following table summarises the key details of all the proceeded cheating by personation charges:

6       The theft in dwelling charge states as follows:

>     You … are charged that you, on the 23rd day of March 2019, at about 10.58pm, at the convenience store of Singapore Petroleum Company Jurong East petrol station (“SPC Jurong East”) located at No.91 Jurong East Avenue 1, Singapore, a building used for the custody of property, did commit theft of one bottle of 750ml sterling sparkling white wine valued at SGD 40.00, in the possession of SPC Jurong East, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## The facts

7       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. The salient facts are summarised below.

### Facts relating to the cheating by personation offences

8       Between May 2019 and October 2019, the Accused misappropriated credit cards and used them on various occasions to purchase alcohol at three establishments.

#### Facts relating to DAC-933435-2019, DAC-933436-2019 and DAC-933438-2019

9       On 17 May 2019, the Accused was working at Bushido Tapas Bar SG. At around 10pm, the Accused exited the restaurant to smoke at an area at 8 Marina Boulevard when he found TSH’s Credit Card on the pavement beside him. He picked up TSH’s Credit Card and kept it in his pocket.

10     Sometime in the same evening, the Accused proceeded to Clarke Quay to consume alcohol with some friends. The Accused used TSH’s Credit Card to carry out the following transactions:

> (a)     At about 11.22pm, he presented TSH’s Credit Card to the staff of Highlander Bar as payment for two bottles of Macallan Fine Oak Whisky costing $527.30 (DAC-933435-2019).

> (b)     At about 11.37pm, he presented TSH’s Credit Card to the staff of PONG as payment for a bottle of Macallan Whisky costing $498 (DAC-933436-2019).

> (c)     At about 2.14am the next day, he presented TSH’s Credit Card to the staff of PONG as payment for a bottle of Martell VSOP 2 costing $468 (DAC-933438-2019).

11     On each occasion, the Accused intended to deceive the respective staff into believing that he was the rightful owner of TSH’s Credit Card when he knew that he was not. The Accused then signed on the charge slip that the staff presented to him. As a result, damage in property was caused to Highlander Bar and PONG, namely, the bottles of alcohol.

#### Facts relating to DAC-931281-2019

12     On 2 October 2019, one Romeril David Robert (“Romeril”) and his friend visited Chimichanga Little India (“Chimichanga”) where the Accused was working. The Accused joined Romeril and his friend for drinks. Subsequently, Romeril and his friend left Chimichanga to visit bars at Orchard Towers. When the Accused’s shift at Chimichanga ended, he went to Orchard Towers and once again met Romeril and his friend.

13     Sometime between 12.00am and 1.30am on 3 October 2019, Romeril discovered that his wallet was missing. His wallet contained, _inter alia_, RDR’s Credit Card. The Accused had picked up the wallet and kept, _inter alia_, RDR’s Credit Card in his pocket.

14     Subsequently, the Accused proceeded to The Beacon, which is an entity under the larger group, Baliza Singapore. At about 2.29am, the Accused presented RDR’s Credit Card to the staff of The Beacon as payment for three bottles of Belvedere three-litre vodka alcohol costing $2,950. He presented RDR’s Credit Card, intending to deceive the staff of The Beacon into believing that he was the rightful owner of RDR’s Credit Card when he knew that he was not. The Accused then signed on the charge slip that the staff presented to him. As a result, damage in property was caused to The Beacon, namely, the three bottles of alcohol costing $2,950.

15     By the said manner of deception, the Accused dishonestly induced the staff of Highlander Bar, PONG and The Beacon to accept the credit cards as payment for the alcohol. The said staff would not have done so had they not been so deceived.

16     During his visit at The Beacon on 3 October 2019, the Accused consumed one bottle of alcohol costing approximately $938.33. The remaining two bottles were unopened and kept by the staff of The Beacon under the Accused’s name for his future use.

17     Following the discovery of the offences, the Accused made restitution of $400, which was meant to serve as restitution for the following:

> (a)     the offence under DAC-931281-2019; and

> (b)     two TIC cheating by personation charges (DAC-933442-2019 and DAC-933443-2019) where the Accused presented another misappropriated credit card to the staff of Fleek Singapore (an establishment under Baliza Singapore) as payment for alcohol totalling $1,100.

### Facts relating to the theft in dwelling offence

18     On 23 March 2019, the Accused met with a friend, one Kumaran s/o Rajaretnam (“Kumar”), at the Singapore Petroleum Company petrol station located at 91 Jurong East Avenue 1, Singapore (“SPC Jurong East”). They had arranged to drink alcohol together.

19     While Kumar went to the toilet, the Accused entered the convenience store at SPC Jurong East, which is a building used for custody of property. The Accused took one bottle of 750ml sterling sparkling white wine valued at $40.00 (“wine bottle”) to another section of the convenience store and placed it inside the tote bag that he was carrying, intending to dishonestly take the wine bottle out of the convenience store without paying for it. Thereafter, the Accused roamed around the convenience store and picked up two bottles of mineral water from a refrigerator.

20     When Kumar entered the convenience store, the Accused passed the two bottles of mineral water to him to make payment. The Accused did not inform Kumar that he had taken the wine bottle. They left the store after Kumar paid for the two bottles of mineral water.

21     The Accused intended to take dishonestly the wine bottle out of possession of SPC Jurong East by placing it inside his tote bag and exiting the convenience store without paying for it. He did not have any consent to do so.

22     The wine bottle was later recovered by the police when they arrested the Accused. The police returned the wine bottle to SPC Jurong East.

## Sentencing

### Antecedents

23     The Accused was traced for similar antecedents. On 19 July 2011, he was convicted of one count of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code and one count of dishonestly receiving or retaining stolen property under s 411 of the Penal Code. He also consented to have one count of theft under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was sentenced to a total of one day’s imprisonment and a fine of $1,500.

24     The Accused had no other antecedents.

### Post-conviction restitution

25     As stated at paragraph 17 above, the Accused made restitution of $400 following the discovery of the offences. After the Accused was convicted on 30 August 2021, the Accused eventually made further restitution. It would be useful to provide the background to this development.

26     The case was originally fixed for a plead guilty mention (“PG mention”) on 5 July 2021. On 2 July 2021, the Defence filed a request via ICMS for an adjournment of six weeks to raise restitution and make maintenance payments to his ex-wife. The Prosecution did not object to the request. I adjourned the PG mention to 18 August 2021.

27     On 17 August 2021, the Defence filed another request to reschedule the PG mention via ICMS. The Defence stated that the parties agreed to one week’s adjournment for the Defence to take instructions on amendments to the Statement of Facts and prepare the mitigation plea. The Defence also indicated the Accused’s intention to request that sentencing be adjourned because the Accused needed additional time to raise funds for his maintenance payments and restitution. The PG mention was rescheduled to 30 August 2021 and parties were directed to address the Court at the hearing on the Defence’s request to adjourn sentencing.

28     On 30 August 2021, the Accused pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges. Thereafter, the Defence sought one week’s adjournment for sentencing on the basis that the Accused was receiving his salary on 7 September 2021 and wished to make restitution of $1,100 to one Ooi Jian Guo Terence (“Mr Ooi”) who was one of the victims named in the TIC charges. The Defence acknowledged that the Accused was already given time to raise restitution but urged the Court to take special cognizance of the fact that the Accused was working in the Food and Beverage (“F&B”) industry that was hard hit by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

29     At that juncture, I sought clarification from the Prosecution on how the earlier restitution of $400 was apportioned in respect of DAC-931281-2019 and two TIC charges (DAC-933442-2019 and DAC-933443-2019). I had noted that Mr Ooi was the named holder of the misappropriated credit card in the two TIC charges. The Prosecution explained that the restitution was not apportioned to a particular charge and that the restitution had been made to Baliza Singapore, which was the larger group that operated the establishments named in the three charges.

30     I also clarified with the Defence as to whether the Accused intended to make full restitution to Mr Ooi of the total amount stated in the two TIC charges (_ie_, $1,100). The Defence confirmed the same.

31     In view of the Defence’s indication that the Accused was serious about making restitution, the Prosecution did not object to a short adjournment. I therefore directed that the Accused make restitution of $1,100 by 10 September 2021 and adjourned mitigation and sentencing to 24 September 2021.

32     At the adjourned hearing, the Prosecution informed the Court that the Accused made further restitution of $600 on 22 September 2021. The Defence explained that the Accused had intended to make full restitution of $1,100 but he also had to make maintenance payments to the Syariah Court for his ex-wife and children.

33     In view of the earlier restitution of $400 and further restitution of $600, the Accused made restitution totalling $1,000.

34     I now summarise the parties’ submissions in turn. Their submissions will be examined in more detail in the course of my analysis below.

### Prosecution’s address on sentence

35     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 14 months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment. The breakdown of individual sentences is as follows:

#### The cheating by personation offences

36     The Prosecution submitted that the primary sentencing principle was general deterrence.

37     Relying on the sentencing factors laid down in _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“_Fernando Payagala_”) for credit card cheating offences, the Prosecution submitted that the following factors were present:

> (a)     There was premeditation. The Accused had a _modus operandi_ of misappropriating credit cards and quickly using them on the same day or night at bars or clubs across Singapore, which are environments that tend to be less well-lit, more chaotic, and even more difficult to detect credit card fraud.

> (b)     The Accused committed a total of ten cheating by personation offences (four proceeded and six TIC). The quantum involved in the four proceeded offences was $4,443.40. The total quantum involved in all ten offences was $6,252.30, which was a very significant sum, considering that there were three misappropriated credit cards and ten transactions.

> (c)     There was actual loss. With respect to DAC-931281-2019, the actual loss was $938.33 because two of the three purchased bottles were unopened and retained by the Beacon. With respect to DAC-933439-2019 and DAC-933440-2019, which are TIC charges, the establishment voided the transaction upon detection that the Accused was engaged in credit card fraud.

> (d)     There was also damage and intangible adverse consequences suffered by the establishments involved and the owners of the misappropriated credit cards.

38     The Prosecution’s proposed sentences were calibrated after considering the following:

> (a)     the sentencing tariff of 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment in _Fernando Payagala_ are for credit card offences framed under s 420 of the Penal Code whereas that the present offences are framed under s 419;

> (b)     the presence of the sentencing factors set out in the preceding paragraph;

> (c)     the significant period of offending, multiple credit cards used, and minimal restitution made;

> (d)     the large number of TIC offences of a similar nature;

> (e)     the Accused’s plea of guilt; and

> (f)     the proposed sentences are in line with three s 420 sentencing precedents: _Public Prosecutor v Ang Han Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 168</span> (“_Ang Han Siong_”), _Fernando Payagala_ and _Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Ibrahim Castillo bin Ghani_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 41</span> (“_Mohamad Ibrahim_”).

39     In _Ang Han Siong_, the offender pleaded guilty to five counts under s 420 of the Penal Code, one count under s 403 of the Penal Code and one count under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. Twelve other charges were taken into consideration. He faced two sets of cheating offences under s 420. The first set related to credit card fraud while the second set related to online game credit scams. With respect to the proceeded cheating charge involving credit card fraud, the offender found a wallet in the taxi and used one of the credit cards inside the wallet to purchase a handphone cover and a Samsung mobile phone. These items were valued at $1,299. He sold the handphone for $1,050 and did not make any restitution. The offender was traced for property-related cheating antecedents. He was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment for that charge.

40     In _Fernando Payagala_, the offender found a credit card belonging to the passenger who was seated next to him during his flight to Singapore. He retained the credit card for his own use. Upon his arrival at Changi Airport, he immediately used the credit card to purchase a laptop valued at $1,522, a watch valued at $469.81 and a handphone valued at $1,288. His attempt to purchase a bracelet was blocked and led to his arrest and the seizure of the fraudulently purchased items. He pleaded guilty to one count of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code for the fraudulent purchase of the laptop, as well as one count under s 403 of the Penal Code read with s 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed) for misappropriation of the credit card. Two similar cheating charges and one attempted cheating charge were taken into consideration. He was initially sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for the cheating offence and two weeks’ imprisonment for the misappropriation offence. On appeal, the High Court laid down the starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment for non-syndicated misappropriated credit card offences. A sentence of six months’ imprisonment was ultimately imposed for the cheating offence. In coming to its decision, the High Court took the following factors into account:

> (a)     the total value of fraudulent purchases made was “not an insubstantial amount” of $6,007.82 (at \[77\] of _Fernando Payagala_);

> (b)     the offender made at least four attempts at fraudulent use of the misappropriated credit card and only stopped after the credit card was rejected;

> (c)     while the offences were premeditated in nature, they were committed without proper planning and lacked sophistication;

> (d)     the offender’s relative youthfulness (which was assessed to be of limited mitigating value);

> (e)     the offender’s lack of antecedents;

> (f)     his higher amenability to rehabilitation and correspondingly lower need for specific deterrence;

> (g)     no loss was occasioned; and

> (h)     an allowance for the fact that he was released from prison custody before the sentence was enhanced.

41     In _Mohamad Ibrahim_, the offender found a UOB card that was left unattended at an ATM. He took the card and retained it for his own use. Among other things, he used it to top up his EZ-link card for $100, as well as purchase items from Wingstop valued at $57.95 and two pairs of eyewear valued at $356. The Court took into account that full restitution was made, the sums involved were not large, the offender’s property-related antecedents, the fact that the offences were committed using one card over four hours, as well as the lack of sophistication and steps taken to avoid detection. The Court imposed sentences of 16 weeks’ imprisonment, ten weeks’ imprisonment and eight weeks’ imprisonment for the charges involving the two pairs of eyewear, the EZ-link card top-up and the Wingstop items respectively.

#### The theft in dwelling offence

42     The Prosecution acknowledged that the Accused’s theft in dwelling and theft antecedents took place in 2011. However, it was emphasised that the Accused concealed the wine bottle inside his tote bag and that the theft was only discovered after the convenience store staff noticed the discrepancy in balance stock and reviewed the CCTV footage. No sentencing precedents were cited.

### Mitigation

43     The Defence provided a detailed background on the Accused and the circumstances leading to the offending period. In summary:

> (a)     The Accused has three children with his ex-wife. He currently lives with his mother and cares for his youngest child.

> (b)     The Accused is the sole breadwinner of his family. His erratic work schedule in the F&B industry led to marital troubles. In 2016, his ex-wife commenced divorce proceedings in Syariah Court and applied for maintenance. Following mediation, the Accused agreed to pay $300 in monthly maintenance.

> (c)     The Accused paid rent and utilities bills for the Built To Order flat (“BTO flat”) that he and his ex-wife purchased, as well as hire-purchase instalments for appliances in their rental flat. They subsequently defaulted the BTO flat entirely.

> (d)     The Accused and his ex-wife rekindled their relationship, and his ex-wife gave birth to their youngest child in December 2017. However, she resumed the divorce proceedings in 2018. Owing to his failure to attend the court hearing, a warrant of arrest was issued. The Accused was arrested and he failed to open the outlet the next morning. This caused him to lose his job.

> (e)     The offender was unemployed for several months. Faced with outstanding bills and hire-purchase instalments, the Accused went into a downward spiral, particularly towards the mid to late 2019 (_ie_, the offending period). The Accused reported that he was feeling depressed and unable to function properly in his F&B jobs and started to drink a lot more alcohol as a form of escapism from his troubles.

### Defence’s submission on sentence

44     The Defence urged the Court to impose a global sentence of seven months’ and one week’s imprisonment. The breakdown of individual sentences is as follows:

#### The cheating by personation offences

45     The Defence submitted that given the paucity of relevant sentencing precedents under s 419 of the Penal Code, the Court may refer to sentencing precedents under ss 417 and 420 of the Penal Code.

46     The Defence relied primarily on _Public Prosecutor v Song Hauming Oskar and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 169</span> (“_Song Hauming_”). In _Song Hauming_, the offender found a credit card on the floor of the meeting room. He dishonestly misappropriated the credit card despite knowing that it belonged to his company’s chief executive officer. He used the credit card on 103 occasions over a period of less than three months to purchase various items totalling $20,642.28 for himself and his family members. The offender pleaded guilty to a cheating charge under s 417 of the Penal Code that was amalgamated under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and a charge under s 403 of the Penal Code for dishonest misappropriation of the credit card. Another amalgamated cheating charge and an amalgamated attempted cheating charge, which involved the use of the same credit card, were taken into consideration. The High Court was of the view that a sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate. However, considering the mitigating weight of the offender’s mental disorders, a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was ultimately imposed. Apart from the offender’s mental disorders, the High Court considered the following sentencing factors:

> (a)     There was a moderate degree of premeditation. The acts were not committed on the spur of the moment. The accused had time to consider his actions before he started using the credit card and over the weeks in which he continued to use it.

> (b)     The offender offended for personal gain.

> (c)     There was an extended period of deception and repeated engagement in criminal activity which evidenced a disregard for the law.

> (d)     Although he made voluntary restitution, the offender’s email to the credit card issuer post-dating the making of restitution undermined any suggestion that he made restitution out of genuine remorse. As such, the High Court did not ascribe significant mitigating weight.

> (e)     The offender pleaded guilty.

> (f)     The High Court did not accord significant mitigating weight to the offender’s claim that he did not conceal his involvement in the offences.

47     The Defence contended that _Song Hauming_ was much more relevant than the Prosecution’s s 420 sentencing precedents. In support of this, the Defence referred to the factual similarities between both cases, the same “base” cheating offence (_ie_, s 415 of the Penal Code), and the Court’s sentencing powers under the amalgamated charge being enhanced to twice the punishment which the offender would have been liable to (_ie_, maximum six years’ imprisonment).

48     The Defence also acknowledged the relevance of the principles laid down in _Fernando Payagala_. However, the Defence submitted that the sentencing range that was laid down in _Fernando Payagala_ for s 420 offences was on a much different scale.

49     Having regard to _Song Hauming_ and _Fernando Payagala_, the Defence submitted that the following factors were relevant in the present case:

> (a)     The Accused’s actions were not premeditated. He chanced upon the credit cards and acted alone.

> (b)     The Accused used the credit cards to fund his alcohol binging as a form of escapism from his troubles and stresses.

> (c)     The level of deception was minimal. He simply presented the credit cards to pay for the alcohol he purchased. Given that the victims’ names that were emblazoned on the credit cards were Chinese or Caucasian, the staff of the establishments would have noticed that the Accused was neither Chinese nor Caucasian.

> (d)     The Accused made restitution. Following the discovery of the offences, the Accused voluntarily made restitution of $400 in respect of one proceeded and two TIC charges. Given the lack of losses to other victims who received chargebacks, as well as the shutting down of all the establishments due to the pandemic, if he made restitution of $1,100 to Mr Ooi, the Accused would have effectively made full restitution. The Defence submitted that his restitution towards victims of the TIC charges reflected his sincerity and genuine remorse.

> (e)     The Accused pleaded guilty and saved the time and resources of both the Prosecution and the Court.

> (f)     The Accused committed ten s 419 offences (including six TIC charges) and the total quantum involved is $6,332.30.

> (g)     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that the actual loss suffered for DAC-931281-2019 would be $983.33. All the credit cardholders named in the charges obtained chargebacks, save for Mr Ooi. The establishments have also gone out of business owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of such outlets.

> (h)     There were adverse consequences. The misuse of the credit cards undermined the reliability of credit cards as a mode of payment, as well as Singapore’s international reputation but this was not dissimilar to the other relevant sentencing precedents.

50     The Defence argued that the Prosecution’s sentencing submission for the s 419 offences was manifestly excessive. In this regard, the Defence relied on _Public Prosecutor v Cheng Liqin_ (unreported, DAC 923879/2015 & Ors) (“_Cheng Liqin_”), the brief facts of which were set out in a table of precedents in _Public Prosecutor v Pavalamali d/o Thurairajoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 341</span> (“_Pavalamali_”). In _Cheng Liqin_, the offender found a credit card at his father’s laundry shop. He used the credit card to make 19 purchases which amounted to $16,164.34 over a period of ten days. His attempt to use the same credit card to purchase a watch costing $29,500 was declined. Full restitution was made. The offender pleaded guilty to six counts of cheating by personation under s 419 of the Penal Code, one count of attempted cheating under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code and one count of dishonest appropriation under s 403 of the Penal Code. Thirteen counts of cheating by personation were taken into consideration. The offender was untraced. The table stated that the court imposed a sentence of two to five months’ imprisonment for each charge.

51     The Defence compared the sentences imposed in _Cheng Liqin_ to the sentences sought in the present case. Referencing the higher number of charges and amount involved in _Cheng Liqin_, the Defence argued that the scale of offending was greater in _Cheng Liqin_, notwithstanding that full restitution was made.

#### The theft in dwelling offence

52     The Defence relied on _Public Prosecutor v Jaidul Late Jomshid Mia_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 256</span> (“_Jaidul_”). In _Jaidul_, the offender committed theft in dwelling of items amounting to $230 from Mustafa Shopping Centre. The sentencing judge took into account that the offender’s last conviction took place ten months before, even though it was a dissimilar offence. The offender’s sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment was upheld on appeal.

53     The Defence also cited _Leong Mun Kwai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 719</span> (“_Leong Mun Kwai_”) and _Public Prosecutor v M Andrew_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 179</span> for the proposition that dated antecedents should be accorded little to no weight.

54     The Defence submitted that a sentence of one week’s imprisonment was fair and appropriate in comparison with _Jaidul_.

### Reply submissions

55     The Prosecution responded to the Defence’s submissions on the cheating by personation offences as follows:

> (a)     The Defence’s submission that the Accused would have effectively made full restitution if he made restitution of $1,100 to Mr Ooi was unsustainable. The Accused chose to delay any attempt to make restitution until his PG mention. The fact that the establishments have closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic should not be to the benefit of the Accused. Further, the Accused only made further restitution of $600.

> (b)     The Defence’s characterisation of the Accused’s acts as not being premeditated was plainly convenient. There was a pattern of recurrence over three distinct periods of offending.

> (c)     The case of _Song Hauming_ was not particularly useful because it involved an amalgamated charge and an accused person with a psychiatric condition. The main issue on appeal was whether a community order could be imposed because the maximum punishment by virtue of the charge being amalgamated exceeded the sentencing limit for community orders to be imposed. Further, the High Court considered that the psychiatric condition had an important bearing on the overall sentence.

> (d)     The Prosecution urged the Court to not rely on _Cheng Liqin_. The case was unreported and therefore unreliable. Moreover, the case involved a different factual scenario.

56     The Defence was allowed to make further submissions in rebuttal, which are summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Statement of Facts and the Accused’s statements did not suggest that the Accused premeditated the offences in the sense of planning to misappropriate the credit cards.

> (b)     The High Court in _Song Hauming_ was clear in its grounds of decision that if the offender did not have a psychiatric condition, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment would have been imposed. The Defence was citing _Song Hauming_ on that basis.

> (c)     With respect to _Cheng Liqin_, the Defence submitted that unreported cases that were cited in reported decisions provide a valuable guide on the range of imprisonment terms that have been imposed.

57     The Prosecution was given the final right of reply. The Prosecution stated that _Cheng Liqin_ being cited in the reported grounds of decision for _Pavalamali_ did not assist this Court to understand the factors that were considered by the sentencing court. Based on the brief set of facts stated in _Pavalamali_, the case was distinguishable as it involved only one misappropriated credit card and the accused person had made full restitution.

### Decision on sentence

#### The cheating by personation offences

58     The prescribed punishment for the offence of cheating by personation under s 419 of the Penal Code is imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine or both.

59     The dominant sentencing consideration for cheating cases involving credit cards is general and specific deterrence (_Fernando Payagala_ at \[49\] and \[88\]; _Song Hauming_ at \[119\]).

60     Although there is a dearth of reported cases on cheating by personation involving credit cards, there are reported decisions of such cases prosecuted under the cheating _simpliciter_ provision (_ie_, s 417 of the Penal Code) and the aggravated cheating provision (_ie_, s 420 of the Penal Code). In my view, given that these three offences are different kinds of cheating, the principles and sentencing factors for the s 417 and s 420 offences are similarly applicable to s 419 offences. In addition, subject to considerations that will be elaborated below, the Court may have regard to s 417 and s 420 sentencing precedents.

61     I looked first at the offence-specific factors which went towards culpability and harm. I was guided by the factors set out in _Song Hauming_ and _Fernando Payagala_.

##### (1)   Offence-specific factors

(A)   Degree of premeditation

62     The offences were calculated and premeditated in nature, albeit committed without planning and lacking in sophistication. The calculated and premeditated nature of the offences may be inferred from the manner in which the Accused carried out the offences over three distinct offending periods. Within hours after misappropriating each credit card, the Accused made a series of quick, successive purchases totalling more than $1,000 (see timelines set out in the Annex). In the first and third offending periods, the Accused even went to several establishments in different locations to make his purchases. The nature of his purchases, which included additional bottles of alcohol on a pre-order basis (DAC-931281-2019) and 22 packets of Marlboro cigarettes (TIC charge, DAC-933444-2019), further evinced his calculated conduct.

63     Nonetheless, I was of the view that the offences were committed without planning and lacked sophistication. I accepted the Defence’s submission that the Accused’s actions would have been easily detected if the staff of the establishments checked the credit cards and noticed that the Accused was neither Chinese nor Caucasian as the names on the credit cards would have indicated. I further noted that the Prosecution stated in its written submissions that the Accused’s credit card fraud was in fact detected at one of the establishments, Peyton Place (TIC charges, DAC-933439-2019 and DAC-933440-2019).

(B)   Amount cheated and collateral consequences

64     The primary yardstick for determining the appropriate sentence for a cheating offence is often the value of the property involved (_Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya Nurhazlyn_”) at \[48\]).

65     The items purchased included several bottles of alcohol, as well as cigarettes and snacks (TIC charge, DAC-933444-2019). The total value of fraudulent purchases is $6,252.30. Considering that there were three misappropriated credit cards and ten transactions, the total sum involved is significant.

66     There was actual loss suffered by the establishments and one of the credit cardholders:

> (a)     With respect to the establishments, it was not disputed that The Beacon suffered loss amounting to $983.33, being the value of the opened bottle of alcohol (DAC-931281-2021). No loss was suffered by Peyton Place in respect of DAC-933439-2019 and DAC-933440-2019 because they voided the transactions upon detection of credit card fraud. The losses suffered by the establishments named in the other charges could not be ascertained because these establishments have closed amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that the actual losses have been minimised because of external intervention is purely fortuitous (_Fernando Payagala_ at \[49\]). I agreed with the Prosecution that the focus must remain on the gain that the Accused had intended.

> (b)     With respect to the credit cardholders, two of them received chargebacks from their credit card issuer. Only Mr Ooi did not receive a chargeback for the sum of $1,100. In view of the restitution of $600 made to him, he still suffered an actual loss of $500.

67     There was damage and adverse consequences caused to both the establishments and holders of the misappropriated credit cards. There was inconvenience caused to the credit cardholders. I also agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that time and costs would have been expended in investigations, including statement giving and the retrieval of CCTV footage. Further, The Beacon was also required to retain the unopened bottles of alcohol until the conclusion of the case.

(C)   Repeated offending

68     There were ten cheating by personation offences (including six TIC charges) committed over three periods of offending. His repeated engagement in criminal activity for personal gain demonstrated a disregard for the law that warranted a significantly higher sentence as compared to a single offender (_Song Hauming_ at \[122(c)\]).

##### (2)   Offender-specific factors

69     Turning to the offender-specific sentencing factors, I was of the view that there was one aggravating factor, namely, his TIC charges of the same nature but this has already been accounted for in the earlier analysis on offence-specific factors.

70     There were also two personal mitigating factors.

(A)   Guilty plea

71     The Accused pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

(B)   Restitution

72     The Accused made partial restitution of $1,000. Restitution of $400 was made earlier. Further restitution of $600 was made only two days before the sentencing hearing that had been adjourned at the Accused’s request so that he could make further restitution of $1,100 to Mr Ooi (see paragraphs 25 to 33 above). Given the Accused’s maintenance obligations, as well as the difficulties faced by F&B service personnel amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I accepted that he needed time to accumulate enough savings to make restitution and gave some mitigating weight for his restitutionary efforts (_Idya Nurhazlyn_ at \[45\]).

73     I next considered the individual sentences imposed (_ie_, nine months’ imprisonment in respect of DAC-931281-2019 and three months’ imprisonment each for the remaining charges) against the sentencing precedents that have been cited by the parties.

##### (3)   Sentencing precedents

74     At the outset, I was mindful that ss 417, 419 and 420 carried different prescribed punishments. For reference, the table below summarises the respective prescribed punishments:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="39.9%"> <col width="60.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence section</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Prescribed punishment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 417 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment of up to three years or a fine or both</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 419 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment of up to five years or a fine or both</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 420 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mandatory imprisonment of up to ten years and liability to a fine</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

75     In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the Court should refer to the penal provision under which the accused is charged, as well as the gravity of the offence committed (_Public Prosecutor v Fabian Michael Chiu Toh Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 468</span> (“_Fabian Toh_”) at \[37\]). Where offences are of a similar gravity, I agree with the court’s observations in _Fabian Toh_ that the difference in severity of the offences should ordinarily be reflected in the length of the sentences imposed (at \[37\]):

>     … offences of a similar nature would, in the ordinary course of events, attract a shorter sentence under s. 417 of the Penal Code Cap 224 as opposed to s.420 of the Penal Code Cap 224, given the fact that Parliament had deemed an offence under s.417 of the Penal Code Cap 224 to be less severe as can be seen by the punishment prescribed under it as compared to that under s. 420 of the Penal Code Cap 224.

76     Accordingly, an offence of a similar gravity that is prosecuted under s 419 of the Penal Code would ordinarily attract a longer sentence than that prosecuted under s 417 of the Penal Code but a shorter sentence than that prosecuted under s 420 of the Penal Code. This did not appear to be disputed by the parties. The Prosecution submitted that its sentencing position had calibrated the sentencing tariff laid down by the High Court in _Fernando Payagala_, though how the sentencing tariff was calibrated was not expressly set out. The Defence also referred to the differences in maximum imprisonment term that the Court could impose under these provisions.

77     Turning to the sentencing precedents, I started by considering _Song Hauming_. As the Defence noted, by virtue of s 124(8)(_a_)(ii) of the CPC, the maximum imprisonment term that could have been imposed was six years. The amount cheated (_ie_, $20,642.48) was significantly higher than the amounts in the proceeded charges (ranging from $468 to $2,950). There were similarities in terms of the level of premeditation involved, the offender’s motivation, voluntary restitution, repeat offending and the offender’s plea of guilt. However, the case involved only one misappropriated credit card and one victim. Putting aside the amount cheated, I was of the view that the present case is more egregious because there were three misappropriated credit cards, several victims (namely, Mr Ooi and the establishments), as well as actual loss, damage and adverse consequences caused. Bearing in mind that High Court would have imposed a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment in _Song Hauming_ (prior to considering the offender’s mental disorders) and taking into account the difference in the amounts and additional aggravating factors in this case, I did not regard the individual sentences that I imposed to be manifestly excessive.

78     I further noted that the High Court in _Song Hauming_ referred to Sundaresh Menon CJ’s observation in _Idya Nurhazlyn_ that custodial sentences of between four and eight months have been imposed for s 417 offences that resulted in losses ranging between $1,000 and $15,000 (at \[120\]). This sentencing range would be adjusted upwards to reflect the higher range of punishments for equivalent offences under s 419. In my view, the individual sentences imposed for the present s 419 offences would fall in the region of the adjusted sentencing range.

79     The sole sentencing precedent under s 419 that was placed before me was the unreported case of _Cheng Liqin_. The case had been referenced in the reported decision of _Pavalamali_. I noted that unreported decisions are generally of little, if any precedential value because they are unreasoned (_Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\], citing _Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[13(b)\]). The brief facts of _Cheng Liqin_ that were provided in _Pavalamali_ were of limited assistance as the amounts cheated for each charge were not specified. In any event, I agreed with the Prosecution that the case was also distinguishable because it involved only one misappropriated credit card and the offender had made full restitution.

80     Finally, I considered the s 420 sentencing precedents:

> (a)     The amount cheated in _Ang Han Siong_ of $1,299 was higher than the amount in three of the proceeded charges (ranging from $468 to $527.30) but significantly lower than the amount in the remaining proceeded charge ($2,950). Similarly, no restitution was made, there were TIC charges, and the offender was traced for property-related antecedents. The offender was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. Having regard to the fact that only one misappropriated credit card was involved and this would be adjusted downwards for s 419 offence of a similar gravity, I was of the view that the individual sentences I imposed were in line with this precedent.

> (b)     The amounts cheated in _Mohamad Ibrahim_ (ranging from $57.95 to $356) was lower than the amounts involved in all of the proceeded charges. While that case involved only one misappropriated credit card, it was similar to the present case because the offences were committed in a span of several hours and there was a lack of sophistication and steps taken to avoid detection. A sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed in respect of the charge involving the amount of $356. Having regard to the fact that full restitution was made, only one misappropriated credit card was involved and that there should be downward adjustment for an equivalent offence prosecuted under s 419, I was similarly of the view that the individual sentences imposed were in line with this precedent.

> (c)     The amount cheated in _Fernando Payagala_ ($1,522). The offence was also premeditated in nature and committed without planning or sophistication. The High Court had laid down a sentencing tariff of 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment for non-syndicated offences, though the offender was ultimately sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Having regard to the punishment ranges for ss 419 and 420 offences, I was of the view that the equivalent sentencing tariff for s 419 offences would be in the region of six to nine months’ imprisonment. Taking into account that the mitigating factors in _Fernando Payagala_ were absent in this case (_ie_, no loss occasioned, the relative youthfulness of the offender and the lack of antecedents), my view was that the individual sentences I imposed would not be manifestly excessive.

#### The theft in dwelling offence

81     The prescribed punishment for the offence of theft in dwelling is mandatory imprisonment not exceeding seven years and a discretionary fine.

82     For this offence, I took the following factors into account:

> (a)     There was only one bottle of wine stolen and it was of a relatively low value of $40.

> (b)     No loss was occasioned because the stolen wine bottle was subsequently recovered upon the Accused’s arrest and returned to SPC Jurong East.

> (c)     It was aggravating that the Accused concealed the stolen wine bottle in a tote bag. The theft would have gone undetected if not for the convenience store staff who noticed the discrepancy in balance stocks.

> (d)     The Accused was previously convicted of an offence of theft in dwelling in 2011. A charge of theft was also taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. In my view, these antecedents were relatively dated, therefore I accorded less weight to them (_Leong Mun Kwai_).

> (e)     The Accused pleaded guilty.

> (f)     Although the Accused cooperated during the investigations, I did not consider this to be a strong mitigating factor in view of the overwhelming evidence against him, which would have meant that the Prosecution would have no difficulty in proving this offence (_Chia Kah Boon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 1163</span> at \[12\]).

83     I also considered the case of _Jaidul_ where a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment was imposed_._ I agreed with the Defence that compared with _Jaidul_, which involved a stolen item of higher value and a far more recent antecedent, the present offence is less egregious. In my view, a sentence of one week’s imprisonment is fair and appropriate.

## Conclusion

84     The Accused was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for the five proceeded charges. Pursuant to s 307(1) of the CPC, at least two of the sentences are to run consecutively. I agreed with parties that it was appropriate for the sentences for the theft in dwelling offence, the offence involving RDR’s Credit Card and one of the offences involving TSH’s Credit Card to run consecutively. I therefore ordered that the sentences in DAC-931281-2019, DAC-933435-2019 and DAC-933445-2019 run consecutively and the remaining sentences to run concurrently. The aggregate sentence is 12 months’ and one week’s imprisonment.

85     Taking a last look at the aggregate sentence, I was of the view that the sentence is appropriate given the overall criminality.
