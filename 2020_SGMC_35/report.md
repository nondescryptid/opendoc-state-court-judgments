### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       This was a private prosecution instituted by the complainant, Madam Tan Muay Lan, against the defendant, Mr Jeffrey Wong Chen Hwee, on a charge of uttering insulting and abusive words that were likely to cause distress to the complainant, which is an offence under s 4(1)(a) and punishable under s 4(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A, Rev Ed 2015) (“POHA”). Both parties were tenants of an industrial complex and the complainant was also a member of the Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) Committee (the “committee”) that manages the shared facilities of the said complex.

2       The defendant (in person) denied and contested the charge. At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $1,000 in default to serve five days’ imprisonment. He is appealing against the conviction and sentence.

## Charge

3       For ease of reference, I set out the charge framed by the complainant against the defendant as follows:

> You… are charged that you, on or about 13 February 2018 at or at about 3:30PM in the Aljunied Industrial Complex Management Corporation Strata Title (‘MCST’) Office at 625 Aljunied Road #08-04 Aljunied Industrial Complex Singapore 389836, did utter and use abusive and insulting words, to wit, in the English language words to the effect that “she had seduced men to do her bidding”, and in the Hokkien dialect “他们两个人的关系好到穿同一条裤子。AIC 每个人都知道。” which in the English language means “So close with another man until they were sharing the same pants. Everyone at AIC knows”, implying that the said Tan Muay Lan is a loose woman, which utterances were said in the presence and within hearing of Tan Muay Lan (NRIC No. XXX) which is likely to cause distress to the said Tan Muay Lan and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 4(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Chapter 256A)

## Complainant’s case

4       The complainant is a 57 year-old female Singaporean. She was represented by counsel who led evidence from the complainant and a fellow committee member in prosecution of the defendant.

5       The complainant’s case is that the defendant uttered and used abusive and insulting words (i.e. that she seduced men to do her bidding and was “sharing the same pants” with another man) suggesting that the complainant was a woman of loose sexual morals. These words were heard by the complainant and which caused her distress.[^1]

6       The complainant’s evidence is summarised as follows.[^2] She was a committee member of the Aljunied Industrial Complex (“AIC” or the “complex”) for a year between May 2017 to May 2018.

7       On the day in question i.e. 13 February 2018, the committee was having a meeting in the meeting room of the MCST office. The following photograph tendered in evidence shows the general layout of the MCST office[^3]:

![]([2020] SGMC 0035_Image/[2020] SGMC 0035_image1.png)

8       There are three areas that are material to the case:

> (a)     management office **(A)** (“small office”);

> (b)     conference or meeting room **(B)** ; and

> (c)     waiting area outside the small office and the meeting room **(C)** (also referred in these grounds as the “anteroom”)

9       As the committee meeting was in progress, the defendant and his father came to the MCST office wanting to confront the complainant regarding the return of certain goods (voucher books) that had been ordered by the committee. These voucher books were printed by the printing company which was owned by the defendant and his father and which was located within AIC and across from the MSCT office. The nature of the dispute regarding the return of the voucher books are not material to the charge.

10     The defendant banged on the main door leading to the anteroom. The banging could be heard by the committee members who were inside the conference room. The complainant and the committee’s chairperson, PW2 Lim Siong Beng (“Vincent”), stepped out of the conference room and opened the front door to see what the defendant wanted. A heated dispute arose between the complainant and the defendant. There was also some allegation that the defendant injured his elbow due to the opening of the door but that is not material to the charge. Eventually, Vincent ushered the defendant and his father into the small office (A) to separate them from the complainant so as to calm the situation. The complainant remained in the anteroom. She was able to see, through the glass panels, that the defendant was talking to Vincent inside the small office. She went back into the conference room but came out again to see whether they were still talking inside the small office.

11     The complainant testified that when she went back into the conference room, she was unable to hear the conversation inside the small room clearly. At times, the defendant was talking loudly and was also gesticulating. At other times, the voices became soft. She had to step out of the conference room into the anteroom to hear what was being said in the small office. She testified that she was able to hear the defendant bad-mouthing her loudly through the door and glass panels of the small office. The complainant heard the defendant say that the complainant would seduce men to do things for her. In particular, he said in English and Hokkien that the complainant was “so close with another man until they were sharing the same pants” or words to that effect and that everyone in the building knew about it.

12     The complainant testified that she felt both angry and humiliated when she heard what the defendant had insinuated about her. She wanted to storm into the small office to confront the defendant but Vincent preventing her from opening the door.

13     The complainant called Vincent as a prosecution witness. Vincent was present at the committee meeting when the defendant and his father interrupted the meeting. Vincent gave an account of the events that transpired that day.[^4] Vincent testified that after the defendant and his father stormed into the MCST premises, he ushered them into the small office so as to separate them from the complainant. He testified that the defendant was shouting and “showing his fist.”[^5] He testified that the defendant told him that the complainant had seduced men to do her bidding.[^6] The defendant repeated this allegation in English, Mandarin, and Hokkien.[^7] Vincent further testified that the defendant told him in Hokkien that the complainant was “_so close to the extent that wearing the same pants_” or words to that effect. Vincent understood that the defendant was insinuating that the complainant was promiscuous.[^8]

14     Vincent also testified that the complainant, who was standing on the other side of the door and glass panel, reacted immediately to the defendant’s insinuation.[^9] The complainant was visibly agitated and wanted to rush into the small office. Vincent believed that the complainant heard what the defendant had said and that she was hurt by those words. Vincent immediately prevented the complainant from opening the door to enter the room.

15     Vincent’s account of events is supported by the closed-circuit television (“cctv”) footage at the various timestamps stated above.[^10]

16     In light of the testimonies given above which supported a _prima facie_ case against the defendant, I called on him to give his defence to the charge.

## Defence case

17     The defendant is a 43 year-old male Singaporean. He elected to give evidence on the stand. He also called another witness, Chew Lin Kiat (DW2) (“Chew”), to testify in his defence. It is not in dispute that the defendant worked at a printing company, Instia Printing Pte Ltd, which was located on the same floor and across from the MCST office.

18     In summary, the defendant’s defence is that he did not utter the alleged words regarding the complainant at all. The defendant also denied talking loudly to Vincent.[^11]

19     He further suggested that the complainant is being vindictive and had fabricated these false allegations against him because she was upset with the defendant for voting her out of the committee. The tables have been turned following the alleged offence because the defendant is now a member of the committee as its treasurer.

20     The defence also tendered the contents of the a WhatsApp message[^12] to show that Vincent had instigated the complainant to commence these proceedings against the defendant.[^13]

21     The defendant’s sole defence witness, Chew, was the managing agent for the complex. Chew testified that he could not hear what was being said inside the small office when he was standing outside the door to the small office.[^14]

22     Chew also testified that he did not see the defendant doing anything which would have cause the complainant to be agitated.[^15]

23     For completeness, it is noted that the defendant is not relying (at least not in its complete sense) on s 4(3)(a) of the POHA which provides that it is a defence for an accused person to prove that he had no reason to believe the victim would hear, see or otherwise perceive the word or behaviour used, or the communication made. Likewise, he is also not relying on s 4(3)(b) of the POHA which states that it is a defence for an accused person to prove that his conduct was reasonable. His primary defence is that he did not utter the alleged words as stated in the charge. His secondary defence is that, in any event, the complainant could not have heard what was being said in the small office. This secondary defence is somewhat different from the defence in s 4(3)(a) of the POHA which would be that he did utter the words but he did not think that the complainant would be able to hear them.

## Court’s findings and decision

### The offence

24     The present offence is provided in s 4(1)(a) of the POHA as follows:

> 4\. – (1)    No person shall by any means –

>> (a)    use any threatening, _abusive or insulting words_ or behaviour; or

>> (b) ….

> Which is _heard_, seen, or otherwise perceived by any person (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) _likely to be caused_ harassment, alarm or _distress_.

> (Emphasis in italics added)

### Elements of the charge proved

25     The three essential elements of the charge which the complainant has to prove beyond reasonable doubt are (i) that abusive and insulting words were uttered, (ii) the words were heard by the complainant; and (iii) the words were likely to cause distress to the complainant.

#### (i)   Abusive and insulting words were uttered

26     The key question is whether the defendant had uttered those words.

27     The defendant denied uttering the words. On this point, I will state for the record that when I gave my brief oral grounds before delivering the verdict, I had said that the defendant did not deny uttering the words. This was erroneous in that even though the defendant did not expressly deny uttering the words in his entire examination-in-chief or in his written closing submission[^16], he did disagree with the complainant counsel when counsel put it to the defendant during cross-examination that he had uttered the words.[^17] In short, the defendant denied using or uttering the material words in the charge. Notwithstanding the mistaken impression on my part, I reiterate that I had no doubt as to the defendant’s guilt and that I find as a fact, on the totality and strength of all the evidence (regardless of his denial or otherwise), that he did use and utter the words as alleged in the charge.

28     I start with the fact that the material words were heard and confirmed by the prosecution witness, Vincent, who was inside the small office with the defendant. Vincent was the chairman of the MCST committee at the material time, having been appointed to that position from July 2016 for a period of one year. I accept that he had no ‘bad blood’ with the defendant and therefore, he had no reason or motive to give false evidence against the defendant.[^18] I accept Vincent’s testimony that the defendant and his father unceremoniously interrupted the committee meeting by shouting and banging loudly on the door to the anteroom demanding to enter. In short, they acted like hooligans.[^19] Vincent left the conference room and led them into the small office to prevent them from confronting the complainant. Vincent tried to calm the defendant down as he was bad-mouthing the complainant. I accept Vincent’s testimony that the defendant insinuated, in English and in dialect, that the complainant was a woman of loose morals and that she shared the ‘same pants’ with men.[^20] I found no reason why Vincent would make this up. Granted that he might have been annoyed with the defendant (and his father) for their unruly behaviour that day but I found that that was not reason enough for Vincent to make false allegations against the defendant. I am satisfied that Vincent’s testimony is consistent with and corroborated the complainant’s case against the defendant.

#### (ii)   Words were heard by the complainant

29     It has been held that the court can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on the witness’s demeanour, the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence and the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of the witness’s evidence and extrinsic evidence: _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>; _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span>.

30     Applying the principles as outlined, I found the complainant’s evidence to be largely and materially consistent both internally and externally with Vincent’s evidence and the objective and undisputed evidence of the cctv footage that was tendered.

31     I therefore believe the complainant’s testimony that she could and did hear the words uttered by the defendant.[^21] After all, she was standing right outside the door and glass panel to the small office. I agree with the complainant counsel’s submission that the complainant was clearly upset and agitated by what the defendant had insinuated about her promiscuity. Her adverse reaction, which is consistent with her testimony, is shown on the cctv footage which was adduced by the defendant no less.[^22] Thus, the footage showed that during the period (of about 10 minutes) when the defendant (together with his father) was talking to Vincent inside the small office, the defendant is seen at various times to be gesticulating, pointing and looking at the complainant who was standing just outside the door.[^23] The defendant and the complainant could clearly see each other through the glass panel of the said door and the defendant was obviously talking about the complainant. At times, Vincent is seen patting the defendant on the shoulder to calm him down.[^24] The defendant acknowledged that he was indeed angry with the complainant and that Vincent had to soften his tone of voice.[^25]

32     As seen on the footage, the complainant tried a number of times to enter the small office but was stopped by Vincent. It was correctly pointed out by the complainant counsel that at one juncture when she was talking to Chew (the defence witness), she turned her head suddenly to stare at the defendant.[^26] She then immediately tried a third time to enter the small office. It was evident that the complainant heard and reacted rather violently to what the defendant had said inside the small office. The defendant testified that the complainant tried a third time to enter the small office. This time however, she was “_very furious. She turned mad, she banged the doors, she even kicked, she spit on the floor._”[^27] It was plain that the words uttered by the defendant had greatly embarrassed and upset the complainant and had caused her much distress. I accept the complainant’s case that the words were likely and did cause her distress.[^28]

33     The alleged words would have deeply insulted and embarrassed the complainant or to any self-respecting woman for that matter. Given the nature and meaning of the alleged words, I also found that it highly unlikely and unthinkable that the complainant would make up such an allegation against the defendant, and embarrass herself in the process. It would not have been in her interest to do so regardless of whether the words were the truth or otherwise.

34     I also found that the fact that the complainant heard the defendant’s demeaning words, was corroborated by Vincent’s testimony. I accept his testimony that the complainant must have heard the words because she was standing right outside the door and she reacted immediately by wanting to enter the small office but he prevented her from doing so. I accept Vincent’s observation that the defendant had hurt the complainant’s feelings.[^29] Once again, I found that he had no reason or motive to make up this evidence.

35     I further agree with the complainant counsel’s submission that the complainant’s evidence was internally and externally consistent and that she remained stoic and unshaken under cross-examination by the defendant.[^30] Thus, I accept that she was candid in saying that she if she was within the conference room, she was unable to hear what was going on in the small office. Therefore, she had to step out into the anteroom and stand outside the door to the small office in order to hear what the defendant was telling Vincent. She also correctly refuted the defendant’s suggestion that he was calm during the incident because he clearly was not, as may be seen from the cctv footage.

36     I also accept her dismissal of the defendant’s insinuation that she timed and brought the complaint against him in tandem with the election of the defendant as a member of the committee.[^31] I found that it was nothing more than a coincidence and I did not ascribe any ulterior motive on the part of the complainant in lodging and pursuing the complaint against the defendant.

37     Contrary to the defendant’s submission, I found that her recollection of the events and the words allegedly uttered to be broadly consistent and credible. I am reminded that when assessing the credibility of a witness “\[d\]ue allowance must be given to human fallibility in retention and recollection” especially if the events took place some time ago: _Viswanathan Ramachandran v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 435</span> at \[35\]. In a similar vein, it was observed that “\[i\]n weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court: _Chean Siong Guat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span>. Further, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) highlighted the danger of over-reliance on the recollection of witnesses in the witness stand and that a witness should not be found to be less credible merely because of gaps in his or her memory, particularly where some period of time has passed since the occurrence of the events in question: _Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 27</span> at \[56\]. The CA stated that ultimately, the trial judge has to consider the totality of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.

38     With these operating principles, I am of the view that although the complainant may not have been able to recall the offending words _verbatim_, nevertheless, her overall recollection of the material phrase (i.e. sharing of the same pants with a man) and the general meaning and context of the totality of all the words as she remembered them to be, was unquestionable and unassailable.

#### (iii)   Words likely to cause distress

39     On a plain reading and interpretation of the words as stated in the charge that the defendant is alleged to have said, the words implied that the complainant was a promiscuous woman and had slept with other men in exchange for their favours. There is no question or denying that the words were abusive and insulting to the complainant. In any event, it was not the defendant’s case or defence that the words were not abusive or insulting. It is probably because he objectively knows that the words are abusive and insulting that he denies uttering the said words. I therefore found that the words are abusive and insulting to the complainant.

40     Given the nature and import of the words and the fact that the words were used to denigrate the complainant, I am also satisfied that the words were likely to cause distress to the complainant. As I have already found above, the words did in fact cause distress to the complainant.

#### Mens rea unnecessary

41     Despite his denial, I found that he had uttered the words as alleged in the charge. As a general principle, the question whether an accused person possessed the requisite _mens rea_ for any offence would invariably be a matter of inference to be drawn by the court from the surrounding circumstances: _Tan Joo Cheng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 219</span> at \[12\]. However, the present offence under s 4 of the POHA does not require the narrower _mens rea_ of intention to cause distress to the victim, although the wider and general _mens rea_ of intention to utter the words themselves would still be applicable. Thus, the High Court in _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 92</span> at \[23\] held:

> The difference between the offences in ss 3 and 4 of the POHA is the requirement of intention, which is found in s 3 but absent from s 4 (see Goh Yihan and Yip Man, “The Protection From Harassment Act 2014: Legislative Comment” <span class="citation">(2014) 26 SAcLJ 700</span> at p 710):

>> The distinction between ss 3 and 4 of \[the POHA\] can seem rather thin. _Chee Siok Chin_ \[_v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582</span>\] highlights two important differences between ss 13A and 13B of the \[Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”)\], which will be relevant to understanding ss 3 and 4. First, s 13A (and s 3 \[of the POHA\]), unlike s 13B (and s 4 \[of the POHA\]) _does not require the offence to take place within the hearing or sight of any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress._ Secondly, a plain reading of s 13B of the MOA reveals that an intention for the conduct to be “threatening, abusive or insulting” is not even a necessary criterion. It has been said that objectivity is the touch stone for assessing the conduct in question and that threats, abuses and insults embraced by s 13B may constitute an offence whether or not they were so intended. _This is likely applicable to s 4 of the \[POHA\]._

>> \[original emphasis\]

42     I would further point out that a comparison of the the respective titles prefacing both sections of the POHA would also indicate that a s 3 offence requires intention (in the narrow sense) but a s 4 offence would not. Thus s 3 is titled “Intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress” whereas s 4 is simply titled “Harassment, alarm or distress”. Notwithstanding that the present offence does not require the _mens rea_ of intention (in the narrow sense), however, given the nature and meaning of the words and circumstances of the dispute between the two parties, I was prepared and did readily infer that the defendant had intended for the words to be abusive and insulting to the complainant. In short, he intended to utter the words and also intended to hurt her feelings and reputation with those words.

### Complainant’s witness credible

43     I have summarised Vincent’s evidence above. I heard his testimony in court and applying the principles highlighted above regarding the assessment of the credibility of a witness, I found Vincent’s testimony to be internally consistent and also externally consistent with the police report and the magistrate’s complaint.[^32] As pointed out by the complainant counsel in his submission, the witness did not have sight of these documents but was able to recount the events in a consistent manner.[^33]

44     I found Vincent’s evidence to be also externally consistent with and fully corroborated the complainant’s allegations in respect of the charge against the defendant.

45     I reiterate that I believe his evidence that he did not instigate the complainant to commence these proceedings against the defendant. The text message that was shown to him by the defendant does not prove that he had any reason or motive to do so. I did not find that he bore any grudge against the defendant. The allegations had nothing to do with him. In fact, he was the one who had prevented the parties from physically confronting one another. Specifically, he prevented the complainant from entering the small office. If not for him, the altercation would have been more aggravated and bitter. If anything at all, Vincent had protected the defendant against the full wrath of the complainant.

46     In summary, I believe the testimonies of the complainant and Vincent which I found to be internally and externally consistent and they corroborated one another in the material aspects of the charge. I turn now to consider the evidence of the defendant and his defence witness.

### Defence rejected

47     I did not believe the defendant’s evidence and had no difficulty rejecting his defence which was all too self-serving. I found that the defendant was not a credible or truthful witness. I found that his claims were inherently incredible and inconsistent with the all the evidence. He denied uttering the words alleged in the charge. I understand that to be his defence. As already noted above, he is therefore not availing himself to the defences provided in s 4(3) of the POHA which states that it is a defence for the defendant person to prove either (a) that he had no reason to believe that the words “_would be heard, seen or otherwise perceived by the victim_” or (b) that his conduct was reasonable.

#### Defence witness unreliable

48     I also found that the defendant’s testimony is neither supported by the other witnesses, including his own, nor by any other objective evidence. As rightly pointed out by the prosecuting counsel, Chew’s evidence is not externally consistent.[^34] In fact, I found him to be entirely cavalier as to the truth or accuracy of his evidence on the material facts. For example, he testified that the small office was soundproof.[^35] This is patently untrue even to the casual observer who has never been the said office. As may be seen from the photographs which are not in dispute, the ‘wall’ which separated the defendant and the complainant was nothing more than the typical office gypsum partition and a thin wooden door. Even then, the partition was only waist high with glass panels forming the upper half of the partition. Such partitions are clearly not soundproof. Further, it is also clearly seen from the cctv footage that the complainant had reacted quite animatedly to something she heard through that partition.[^36] I also noted that even the defendant had to concede during cross-examination that the said room was not entirely soundproof.[^37] Therefore, I had no difficulty finding Chew’s testimony that the small office was soundproof to be unreliable at best and completely false at worst.

49     I also do not accept Chew’s evidence that he did not observe any action on the part of the defendant which would have upset the complainant or his testimony that the defendant was merely having a ‘casual’ conversation with Vincent inside the small office.[^38] Chew was obviously downplaying the fact that both the complainant and the defendant were very angry with each other. In truth, there was nothing casual about the conversation in the small office or, for that matter, any conversation that afternoon. As correctly pointed out by the prosecuting counsel, that fact can be seen from the cctv footage.[^39] This image stands in stark contrast to Chew’s rather blasé testimony that the defendant remained calm throughout his conversation with Vincent.

50     More importantly, I rejected Chew’s testimony that he did not hear the defendant uttering the alleged words. I rejected Chew’s evidence simply because he had returned to the conference room a few times and therefore was not in a position to testify whether he was able to hear what the defendant had said inside the small room. As noted above, the complainant said that she could not hear the defendant if she was inside the conference room. That part of her evidence is not disputed. Therefore, if Chew had stepped back into the conference room, he would similarly not be able to hear the defendant clearly.

51     Most critically, when the complainant was seen on the cctv reacting to the defendant’s words, Chew had already retreated back into the conference room. His evidence that he did not hear the defendant uttering the offending words at that crucial point in time is therefore meaningless and ought not to be given any evidential weight whatsoever.

#### Adverse inference drawn

52     In _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ \[2020\] SCGA 25 (“_Muhammad Nabill_”) at \[67\] and \[72\]-\[75\], the CA was troubled that the prosecution had not called certain material witnesses (or furnished their statements to the defence) and restated the principle that the court may in certain circumstances be entitled to draw an adverse inference that the evidence of a material witness who could have been but was not called by the prosecution would have been unfavourable to the prosecution, if the prosecution was unable to satisfy the court that it had good reason not to call that witness. This legal principle would likewise apply to the defence if the defence similarly fails to call a material witness without good reason. On the facts in _Muhammad Nabill_, the CA noted that the witnesses who were not called were material witnesses because they could be expected to confirm or, conversely, contradict the accused’s defence in that case.

53     In the present case, I too found it troubling and in fact, most telling, that the defendant chose not to call his father as a witness. The defendant’s father (Francis Wong) would have been a material witness for the defendant (just as Vincent was a material witness for the complainant) because Francis Wong was in the small office with the defendant and Vincent at the material time. Therefore, Francis Wong, if called as a witness, would have been able to categorically refute, or conversely, confirm the allegations in the charge. However the defendant failed to call his father to give evidence on the basis that his father was old and could not stand the sight of the complainant.[^40]

54     The defendant made a deliberate choice not to call his father as a defence witness. The twin excuses given by the defendant not to call his father were weak, untenable and not credible. No medical evidence was tendered to show that his father was physically unable, due to age or otherwise, to come to court testify as a defence witness. Given that the defendant did not provide good reasons for not calling his father who would have been a very material witness, I agree with the prosecuting counsel’s submission that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the defendant, both as a principle enunciated in _Muhammed Nabill_ and also under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act i.e. that the evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the defendant. I therefore drew an advance inference against the defendant for failing, without good reason, to call Francis Wong as a witness.[^41] Presumably, if Francis Wong was called to give evidence, he would not be able to support the defendant’s defence, without resorting to lying.

#### Miscellaneous defences rejected

55     The defendant canvassed other miscellaneous defences in the course of his testimony and in his written submission.

56     I rejected the defendant’s suggestion that the complainant’s case cannot be made out because the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”), acting as the Public Prosecutor, did not prosecute the defendant. In the first place, there is no evidence or information shown to the court that the AGC did in fact make a considered decision not to prosecute this case. Even if there was, I informed the defendant, in my brief oral grounds, that the fact that the AGC had not taken up the prosecution does not mean that there are no merits to the complainant’s case. This is because the AGC has limited resources and usually would not pursue such magistrate complaint cases unless there is strong public interest to do so. It is for this reason that the criminal procedure code and court processes have provided for prosecutions to be mounted by private individuals as was done in this case.

57     In fact, one of the main aims when the POHA was enacted in 2014 was to provide a range of _self-help_ measures, including civil remedies and criminal sanctions, to better protect victims from harassment. Therefore, the contention that the AGC did not take it upon itself to prosecute the defendant because this was an unmeritorious case, is completely unfounded and misses the point of the legislation.

58     Next, regarding the defendant’s allegation that the complainant had an ulterior motive to get back at him, I am of the view that this was not a critical issue and was also neither here nor there. Regardless of any motive on the part of the complainant, the court is ultimately duty bound to sieve through and consider the evidence of the events on that day in order to come to a decision whether or not all the elements of the charge are made out. While it may be said, and this would have been obvious to anyone, that there was no love lost between the parties, I would stop well short of finding that the complainant bore such a grudge against the defendant that she had lied in court or had fabricated false allegations against the defendant.

59     There were also arguments canvassed on both sides as to who was or was more agitated and aggressive. That argument is beside the point. In any event, I found that both parties were angry with one another and were therefore agitated. As I have noted above, there was little or no love lost between the two parties starting from the time the defendant and his father interrupted and barged into the meeting that the complainant was having with her committee members. Notwithstanding that both parties were unhappy with each other, the question to be decided at the end of the day remained immutable i.e. whether the defendant had uttered the offending words. On this crucial issue, I found against the defendant. Such a finding was entirely consistent with the circumstances and the totality of the evidence and circumstances.

60     In summary, I found that all the elements of the charge were made out. In other words, I found that the abusive and insulting words were uttered in the hearing of the complainant. I did not find it material whether the words were also spoken in both Hokkien and mandarin. I found as a fact that the words were spoken in English and at the very least, also in Hokkien or Mandarin, and that the complainant heard and understood the words, which by nature of their highly offensive meaning, were likely to cause distress to the complainant. Even though it was not material to the charge, I further found that the complainant was in fact distressed when she heard the words.

## Conclusion

61     The key issues in this case are whether the defendant uttered the offending words and if so, whether the complainant heard the words. There is no question that the words were abusive and insulting to the complainant and therefore likely to causes her distress. I accept the complainant’s evidence that she heard the words spoken by the defendant which is consistent with the cctv’s footage of her reaction when she heard those words. I also found that her testimony was amply corroborated by Vincent’s evidence.

62     I had no difficulty rejecting the defendant’s testimony and defence which was not supported by the objective evidence. I did not accept Chew’s testimony because he had stepped back into the conference room on a number of occasions and therefore was not in a position to testify as to what he heard or did not hear. He was also not a credible witness because he tried to downplay the events.

63     In summary, I found the evidence of the complainant and her witness to be both credible and compelling. I accept the testimony of the complainant which was corroborated by Vincent and the cctv footage. On the contrary, I disbelieved the defence of the defendant and also rejected the evidence of his defence witness.

64     I also found it most telling that the defendant chose not to call his father as a witness who would have been a material witness because the father was in the room with the defendant and Vincent. The defendant did not offer any credible reason for failing to call his father as a witness in support of his defence. I drew an advance inference against him for such failure.

65     In conclusion, I found that the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the defendant is convicted of the said charge.

## Sentence

66     Having convicted the defendant of the charge, I then considered the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the defendant.

### Prescribed punishment

67     The punishment for the present offence as spelt out in s 4(2) of the POHA is a fine up to $5,000. In other words, the defendant is liable only to a fine and not to imprisonment.

### No sentencing submission or mitigation

68     The prosecuting counsel did not make any submission as to the appropriate quantum of fine to be imposed. He was content to leave the quantum entirely to the court. Counsel also did not inform that the defendant has any relevant criminal antecedents. I therefore considered that the defendant is a first offender and sentenced him on that basis

69     The defendant also had nothing to say in mitigation.

### Sentencing considerations

70     The POHA was enacted in March 2014. Part II of the Protection from Harassment Bill (“Bill”) which concerned criminal offences was introduced with three main objectives: (i) to bring together, by re-enacting and updating, the existing but disparate offences relating to harassment and related anti-social criminal conduct; (ii) to enact new offences e.g. stalking; and (iii) to modernise and widen the scope of these offences to include criminal behaviour on the internet.

71     Thus, during the Second Reading of the Bill, Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, stated that clauses 3 to 6 of the Bill (which would eventually be enacted as ss 3 to 6 of the POHA) were adapted from the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”) with minor changes and modifications so as to extend the provisions to encompass online offences:[^42]

> Clauses 3 to 6 re-enact and update sections 13A to 13D of the MOA respectively, and therefore, sections 13A to 13D of the MOA will be repealed once this Bill goes through. Thus, clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6, which deal with harassment, in fact are taken from the MOA, with some minor changes. The penalties are increased quite substantively.

72     The Minister for Law emphasised that there was a real need to better protect victims of harassment. He further said that the Bill provided the court with a wider range of sentencing options to ensure that the sentence meted out in each case better takes into account the culpability of the offender and the harm caused to the victim.

73     Given the above parliamentary intention and in deciding on the appropriate fine to be imposed in the present case, I took into account the culpability of the defendant and the harm caused to the complainant in the present case and also weighed the sentencing factors in favour of and against imposing a more a lenient fine. The sentencing factors which operated in favour of a more lenient fine would include the nature of the words uttered i.e. that the words were more insulting than abusive and were not threatening. I also considered that the words were uttered to only one person (excluding the defendant’s father who was not called as a witness) in the confines of a room, albeit within the earshot of the complainant and causing her much distress. As already mentioned, I further considered that the defendant was a first offender.

74     On the other hand, there were certainly sentencing factors which would justify a more severe fine. Thus, I considered that the defendant is unremorseful and has made no apology to the complainant. He contested the charge and would forfeit any sentencing discount which he might have been entitled. He has also appealed against his conviction, further demonstrating his lack of remorse by continuing to deny his guilt and not taking responsibility for the vile words that he had used to hurt and demean the complainant. Those are words that a gentleman would never use on a woman.

### Decision on Sentence

75     The defendant was sentenced to a fine of $1000 in default to serve five days’ imprisonment. Considering that he has shown no remorse and has claimed trial to the charge thereby forfeiting any sentencing discount that may have been given to him, the quantum of fine imposed can hardly be considered to be manifestly excessive.

76     The fine has not been paid.
