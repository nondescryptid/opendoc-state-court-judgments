## SENTENCE

#### Prescribed punishment

6       Section 33A(2) of the MDA provides for an _imprisonment term of not less than 7 years_ and not more than 13 years and _caning not less than 6 strokes_ and not more than 12 strokes.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

7       The prosecution asked for the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

#### Mitigation

8       The Accused pleaded for leniency. He informed the Court that he had remained drug-free for 2 years and it was his longest period without drugs. He admitted that he fell into temptation and regretted what he had done. He sought the lightest minimum sentence for the charge.

#### Sentence imposed

9       Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence on the Accused, which was 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

#### Deferment of Sentence

10     The Accused applied to defer his sentence by 3 weeks as he needed time to make certain work arrangements. The prosecution had no objection and did not ask for an increase in bail.

11     I therefore granted the Accused’s application, extended his bail, and allowed him to commence serving his sentence with effect from 5 September 2019.

* * *

[^1]: The Accused’s application in Criminal Motion No. 51 of 2019 was allowed by consent on 31 December 2019. He was granted leave to file his Notice of Appeal within 14 days of the Court’s Order.
