Damages – Measure of damages – Tort

9 July 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction[^1]

1       It would have been just another classic case of assessment of damages of a vehicle which followed from a traffic accident between the plaintiff and defendant’s vehicles, except that the plaintiff’s car only had 19 clear days before it was due to be deregistered. It was against this backdrop that the case came before the Court.

## Background to the dispute

2       On 20 May 2018, the plaintiff’s Toyota Rush, SJF 7397J, had a collision with the defendant’s car, SBK 868G. Interlocutory judgment was entered in the plaintiff’ favour on 24 February 2020 at 75% of the damages to be assessed. The matter then came before me to assess the damages to the plaintiff’s car.

3       It was not disputed that at the time of the accident on 20 May 2018, the plaintiff’s car only had 19 clear days before its Certificate of Entitlement (“**COE**”) expired on 9 June 2018. This meant that unless the COE was renewed or revalidated, Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (“**LTA**”) would deregister and scrap the plaintiff’s car. The plaintiff would also be unable to use her car on the road.

4       On 30 May 2018, the plaintiff renewed her car’s COE by paying the prevailing quota premium (“**PQP**”). The PQP is calculated by taking the moving average of COE prices in the last three months. The plaintiff paid a PQP amount of S$19,107.

5       Before the plaintiff renewed the COE for her car, she sent her car to be repaired at the quoted lump sum repair cost of S$8,346 (inclusive of GST). She now seeks to claim, _inter alia_, this S$8,346 from the defendant.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s case

6       It is the plaintiff’s case that besides the rental expense of S$720 that she incurred whilst her car was being repaired, she should be awarded her cost of the repairs at S$8,346.

7       The plaintiff argued that she had all along wanted to renew the COE, and had no intention to scrap her car.[^2] So, when she was informed of the repair cost, she gave instructions to proceed with the repairs. This was despite knowing that she had the option to scrap her car and get a replacement car from the market with the money from scrapping her car;[^3] or that she would be able to get some LTA rebates (COE rebates and the rebates from the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (“PARF”)). It is not disputed that the LTA rebates the plaintiff would be able to receive was S$7,309.

### The defendant’s case

8       The defendant’s appointed surveyor recommended a lump sum repair cost of S$4,250. However, where repair cost is concerned, the defendant is prepared to abide by the opinion of the single joint expert (“**SJE**”) who had recommended a lump sum repair cost of S$5,300.

9       In the reports of the defendant’s surveyor[^4] as well as the SJE[^5], it is provided that the economical repair value or limit of the plaintiff’s car (or its economical limit to repair) (“**ERL**”) was S$500.[^6] The SJE explained[^7] that this was obtained by taking the pre-accident market value of the plaintiff’s Toyota Rush at S$7,809 and subtracting the LTA rebates of S$7,309 (that is, S$7,809 – S$7,309 = S$500). The pre-accident market value of the car was obtained by taking a new Toyota Rush price of S$85,000, allowing for straight line depreciation of the car for the 10 years that the car could be on the road, then working out the per day value of the car before finding its value when there are 19 days left (that is, (S$85,000/3650 days) x 19 days). This was rounded up to S$500. Adding S$500 to the PARF of S$7,309 gave the pre-accident market value of the plaintiff’s car.

10     Clearly, the SJE’s recommended lump sum repair cost at S$5,300 is above the ERL of S$500. The defendant therefore argued that it was “\[neither\] economical nor reasonable”[^8] of the plaintiff to have chosen to repair her car – even if at S$5,300 – when she could have had her car scrapped and used the S$7,309 rebates to get a replacement car at about S$7,800. In which case, her net loss would have been a mere S$500. This would have represented the diminution in value of her car. By her choosing to repair her car, the defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate her loss.

## Issue

11     The broad issue before me was the quantum of award that should be awarded to the plaintiff as a result of the damage to her car. Underlying this is the question of what the measure of damages should be: the repair cost (at S$8,346) or the net loss to the plaintiff as a result of the traffic accident (at S$500)?

12     The parties did not dispute the rental cost of S$720 which was occasioned by the accident. The defendant accepted that the plaintiff incurred reasonable rental cost of S$120 per day for 6 days.

13     In their Joint Opening Statement, the plaintiff and defendant tabulated their respective positions:

## The Court’s determination

14     Before this Court delves into the substantive issue on hand, it wishes to address the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate her losses.

### Mitigation of damages

15     In his closing submissions, the plaintiff’s counsel highlighted to the Court that mitigation was not specifically pleaded by the defendant. In _Yip Holdings Pte Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 131</span> (“**_Yip Holdings_**”), the High Court made it very clear that “mitigation of damages as a defence must be properly pleaded and proved”.[^9] In the earlier case of _The Asia Star_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 1154</span> at \[31\], the Court of Appeal observed that the issue of mitigation draws up questions of fact and these too must be particularly pleaded.

16     Looking through the present defendant’s defence, the words of Belinda Ang J in _Yip Holdings_ would equally apply when she said –

>     The state of the defendant’s pleadings contravened the established procedural rule that an assertion that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate \[her\] loss must be pleaded and proved by the defendant relying on it (see _Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 288</span> at \[71\] following _Geest plc v Lansiquot_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 WLR 3111</span> at \[16\] and recently _The “Rainbow Star”_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1</span> at \[56\].

So, if the defendant is insisting on the position that the plaintiff did not mitigate her losses, the defendant would be defeating his own case for his lack of specifically pleading the same.

17     Flowing from the above, the Court is prepared to accept the defendant as simply arguing that the compensation to the plaintiff should not be the quantum of the repair cost at S$8,356 “because \[this\] uneconomical repair cost does not represent the diminution in value of the plaintiff’s car”.[^10]

### The measure of damages – Repair cost or net loss?

18     While it may be trite that the measure of damages would be the diminution of the value of the property – or the plaintiff’s car in this case – but is this diminution of the plaintiff’s car the cost of repairs or the net loss of S$500? In arguing the latter, the defendant took into consideration the market value of the plaintiff’s car before the accident at about S$7,800 – as opined by the SJE – and subtracting therefrom the LTA rebates of S$7,309 that the plaintiff would receive upon her car being scrapped (that is, S$7,800 – S$7,309 ≈ S$500). The defendant’s position is that by compensating the plaintiff S$500, the defendant would have placed the plaintiff at the position she would have been at, but for the accident.

19     To support his position, the defendant’s counsel cited the case authorities of _Masterfox Connections Pte Ltd v N & I Transportation and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGMC 5</span> (“**Masterfox**”) and _Koh Tiam Ting v Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 172</span> (“**Koh’s case**”).

#### Masterfox Connections Pte Ltd v N & I Transportation and Another <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGMC 5</span>

20     In _Masterfox_, the plaintiff sought to recover repair cost of S$24,000 to its damaged van which had a market value of S$11,000. As its scrap value was worth S$7,300, its net market value was reduced to S$3,700 (that is, S$11,000 minus S$7,300).

21     The Court in _Masterfox_ recognised at \[15\] that “the normal measure of damages \[for goods or property\] is the amount by which the value of the goods damaged has been diminished” and that repair cost was the “correct measure of the claimant’s loss”. However, there is a qualification to the above, that is (at \[16\]) –

>     the cost of repair is appropriate as a measure of loss only if in the circumstances, it is _reasonable_ for the claimant to repair. It would be different if it was cheaper to buy a replacement on the market and sell the damaged property for what it will fetch – see MrGregor, supra at paragraph 32-004.

(Emphasis added.)

22     In stating the issue, the Court there had confined it to the case before it. It stated the issue as follows:

>      _In the circumstances of this case_, was it reasonable for the Plaintiffs to repair the vehicle at the cost of $24,000/- and then claim that amount from the Defendants as the loss the Plaintiffs suffered?” (At \[17\].)

(Emphasis added.)

23     From the finding of the facts of _Masterfox_, the Court held that it was not reasonable of the plaintiffs to repair their vehicle and then claim the repair cost from the defendant “where the cost of repair far exceeds the replacement cost of the Plaintiffs’ vehicle”. In the same paragraph at \[20\], the Court then went on to discuss the principle of mitigation. As mentioned, the principle of mitigation would be irrelevant for our purposes since it was not specifically pleaded in our case.

24     Quite obviously though, underlying the Court’s finding in _Masterfox_ is very much the principle of mitigation. The Court also made it clear that whether repairing the vehicle was reasonable under the circumstances was dependent on the facts of its particular case. In _Masterfox_ and its particular circumstances, the court found that it was not reasonable.

#### Koh Tiam Ting v Soon Li Heng Civil Engineering Pte Ltd <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 172</span>

25     In _Koh_’s case, the plaintiff’s 18-year old lorry was damaged from a motor accident. At the hearing for the assessment of damages, the plaintiff sought to recover the cost of repairs at S$55,105. The defendant resisted and argued that at the time of the accident, the value of the plaintiff’s lorry, as assessed by the defendant’s automative appraiser and loss adjuster, was only S$8,246. It also only had two more years before its COE expired and the plaintiff able to get back his COE rebate of S$2,066. The plaintiff’s replacement cost of vehicle would therefore only be S$6,181 (that is, S$8,246 minus S$2,066).

26     The damages awarded in _Koh_’s case was the amount of its replacement cost at S$6,181, and not its repair cost of S$55,105. It was the learned Deputy Registrar’s finding that “the cost of repairing the lorry ($55,105) \[ \] far exceeded its replacement cost ($6,181)” (at \[30\]). There was also “no good reason for \[the plaintiff\] unreasonably repairing the lorry for such an exorbitant sum”[^11] when the Court found the lorry to be a constructive total loss.

27     Before I go on to analyse the two case authorities cited by the defendant’s counsel, I would like to also draw reference to the case of _Yip Holdings_ that the plaintiff’s counsel referred to but for a different point. It is relevant also for our deliberations on the issue of the measure of damages.

#### Yip Holdings Pte Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd \[2012\] 1SLR 131

28     Although the case of _Yip Holdings_ does not concern a motor vehicle but involved a crane, the principles enunciated in _Yip Holdings_ are relevant for present purposes.

29     Briefly, the facts are that, in breach of a contract, the plaintiff was disallowed from removing a crane that was at the defendant’s premises. The defendant, instead, unilaterally moved the crane to a non-party’s yard whereat it was demobilised and dismantled. Left in its dismantled state and in the open, the crane was damaged and in a deplorable state. The repair cost would have amounted to at least US$500,000 whereas its scrap metal value would have fetched US$100,000. The matter therefore came before the High Court on an appeal on the issue of the measure of damages.

30     The High Court in that case made a distinction between whether the chattel was damaged or destroyed (at \[13\]). It recognised that the measure of damages would be the amount by which the value of the chattel is diminished. So, in a case where the chattel is damaged, the diminution in value of the chattel would usually be equated with the repair cost. However, where the chattel was destroyed “or is a constructive total loss in the sense that it would be uneconomic to repair”, the Court had held at \[13\] that the “_prima facie_ measure of damages is the value of the chattel at the time and place of destruction, plus any other consequential losses…”.

31     Applying the above principle to the case, the Court in _Yip Holdings_ ruled that the 1967 crane was a constructive total loss and would be uneconomical to repair. It therefore went on to examine the value of the crane at the time and place of destruction, plus its consequential losses, that is, its pre-breach value. It ultimately accepted the plaintiff’s expert’s evidence that the crane, in its pre-breach condition, could have been sold for US$400,000, which amount took into consideration that the crane was refurbished in 1997. The final award, however, was US$395,000 because the Court further took into account that the crane’s engine needed to be repaired, which repair would have cost the plaintiff US$5,000.

### Application of the case authorities

32     The case authorities affirm that the measure of damages is the diminution in value of the chattel. As to how this diminution in value is to be determined, the case authorities are instructive that the question to ask is whether the chattel was damaged or destroyed – to use the words of the learned judge in _Yip Holdings_. From thence, the measure of damages would either be the repair cost if the chattel was damaged or the value of the chattel at the ‘time and place of destruction’ if the chattel was destroyed. If the chattel was to be repaired, then it would be relevant to consider whether the act of repairing was a reasonable one under the circumstance of the case. If it was not reasonable to repair, then it calls into examination the value of the chattel at the time and place of the wrong.

33     It was noteworthy that in _Koh_’s case and _Yip Holdings_, the learned Deputy Registrar and Judge respectively in those cases considered that the vehicles were a constructive total loss. In _Koh_’s case, the lorry was an 18-yr old vehicle. Set in the Singapore context, this meant that its COE had been renewed once after its 10th year for another 10 years. It was no longer eligible for a further extension or renewal, and must be scrapped in its 20th year. The Deputy Registrar therefore rightly considered the lorry’s repair cost against its replacement cost. It was the same for the crane in _Yip Holdings_, which was in a state so deplorable that it was to be considered a constructive total loss. Under those circumstances, it was only reasonable to consider their replacement costs.

34     In the present case, while it would be correct to say that the COE of the plaintiff’s car would have reached its COE expiry less than three weeks after the accident, would it also be accurate to find that it was a constructive total loss?

#### Was the plaintiff’s car a constructive total loss?

35     To state the obvious first: in the defendant’s surveyor’s report[^12] five days after the accident, despite the accident and damage to the car as a result thereof, the surveyor opined and reported that the general condition of the plaintiff’s car was “good”.[^13] According to the plaintiff who was the owner of the car, she also testified and said under oath that her car was maintained very well.[^14] There was also no evidence from the SJE or from any of the parties’ surveyors’ reports that the car could not undergo repairs and be restored to a roadworthy condition.

36     The defendant has urged this Court to find the plaintiff’s car to be a constructive total loss only because the car’s COE only has 19 clear days to go before it expires, and the car ‘taken off the roads’. However, under the COE scheme, the COE can be renewed at least once at its 10th year. This cannot be ignored. The Court therefore sees no necessity to limit the life of the car to a mere 10 years.

37     All factors considered, it is clear that the plaintiff’s car was merely damaged and not ‘destroyed’. So, at this point, it is not to be considered a constructive total loss. The measure of damages must therefore be the repair cost.

38     However, earlier, it was established that the lowest repair cost at S$4,250 as recommended by the defendant’s surveyor was still higher than the SJE and defendant’s surveyor’s ERL of S$500. Notably, the plaintiff or her Counsel did not suggest an alternative figure to the ERL. The plaintiff or her Counsel also did not dispute the way the ERL was derived. The Court accepts that the way the ERL was calculated appears to be the car industry norm. Given that there were no alternative methods or ERL figure before the Court, the Court accepts that the ERL for this case is S$500. According to the cases, on the face of it, it did not appear reasonable that the plaintiff should choose to repair her car at the price quoted to her – at S$8,346 – when she only needed to pay S$500 to replace her car. It was even put to her by the defendant’s counsel that it was because she knew that she would be able to claim the repair costs from the defendant’s insurers.[^15] The plaintiff disagreed with that assertion.

39     The question now is, whether the plaintiff was reasonable, under the circumstances, to choose to repair her car.

#### Was the plaintiff reasonable to repair her car when the cost is above the ERL?

40     In _Masterfox_, the District Judge was careful to scope his finding of the reasonableness of the plaintiff’s choice of repairing his vehicle to the circumstances of the case before him. While it may appear that the plaintiff’s choosing to repair her car was unreasonable, the question of whether it was reasonable must be examined in the context of the case.

41     There is no doubt in my mind that the plaintiff was very clear in what she wanted: to continue to retain and use her car. (See \[7\] above and the footnote for the many instances when the plaintiff made clear her position.) The plaintiff was in fact so clear about this that it was not a conundrum for her when her own repairers quoted her a lump sum repair cost higher than what she could get back in terms of the LTA rebates,[^16] or scrap value for her car,[^17] or that she could get a replacement car with the rebates or scrap moneys.[^18] This was even when she was well aware that although there were the insurers that she could tap on, she might have to ‘fork out’ the cost of repairs.[^19] In fact, the plaintiff was unequivocal in her position when she testified[^20] –

>     I had no intention to scrap the car at all, and so, I never thought of that question. My idea was to renew the COE, whether got accident or not. So, it was never my intention of scrapping the car.

The plaintiff’s actions bore out her intention when she expended S$19,107 on the PQP to renew her COE for another five years 10 days after the accident.

42     When she was re-examined, the plaintiff explained, “this car has sentimental value for me and my husband. Also, it has maintained very well. So, there is no need to get a new car or what.”[^21]

43     Even if this Court were to place little weight on the plaintiff’s seemingly ‘irrational’ decision to repair her car for sentimental reasons, which should not be at the defendant’s expense, the other factor that this Court was keenly conscious of, was that the lifespan of the plaintiff’s car was extendable when its COE was extended. In this case, it was more than the 19 days that the defendant revolved his case around. In his cross-examination of the SJE, the plaintiff’s counsel had specifically asked the SJE whether the ‘economic lifespan’ of a car was the same as the COE’s validity, the SJE had explained that –

>     Even if the car can be on the road for 20 years, but is subject to COE renewal, and if the car has 19 days of COE left, if the owner decides not to renew, then the lifespan would only be 19 days.

44     It therefore follows that the defendant’s counsel’s argument that the plaintiff’s car only has 19 clear days left was an erroneous basis to begin with. With the Court’s finding that the plaintiff had every intention to renew the COE of her car whether or not she met with the accident, and she did renew the COE for five years, the car would have more than that 19 clear days. Under such circumstances, it would be wrong to treat this car as a constructive total loss.

45     Given that there is still much usefulness of the car, especially since no evidence was raised that it was not in a good condition, the Court was unable to find that the plaintiff had acted unreasonably when she chose to repair her car. The SJE had also opined that whilst the plaintiff would not be able to find another Toyota Rush in the open market for second hand cars, a fair substitution would be the Daihatsu Terios.[^22] I did not appreciate the argument which the defendant raised, that the plaintiff should scrap her car, obtain the LTA rebates, and use the money to obtain a replacement car which she could also renew the COE of.[^23] It would be unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to do that when she and her husband had had her Toyota Rush for 10 years, being its first owners, knowing its performance and level of maintenance, and then to give it up and risk getting another second-hand car which they would be suspicious of its performance, amongst other issues.

### Conclusion on the issue of the measure of damages

46     Given the above circumstances, it is the Court’s finding that the plaintiff was not acting unreasonably when she repaired her car. Besides, as mentioned the ERL is called into question with the renewal of the COE. The measure of damages in this case must therefore be the cost of the repairs.

### The quantum of repair costs

47     On the repair cost, as the defendant was willing to abide by the SJE’s recommended cost, the two amounts in contention are S$8,346 being the lump sum repair cost quoted to the plaintiff by her repairers, and S$5,300, being the lump sum repair cost recommended by the SJE.

48     In arriving at this lower amount, the SJE had explained that this was because he had disallowed some items. He was unable to see the damage in some items, or he considered that they could be replaced and re-used, or the damage could just be re-fixed instead of the parts changed.

49     In his closing submissions, the plaintiff’s counsel took issue with some items of repair that the SJE had not allowed or had discounted. These are:

>   
| 

(a)

 | 

Item 3 – front bumper reinforcement

 | 

S$484.30;

 |
| 

(b)

 | 

Item 12 – front RH ABS sensor

 | 

S$357.00;

 |
| 

(c)

 | 

Item 13 – front RH fender

 | 

S$792.00;

 |
| 

(d)

 | 

Special nett items:

 | 

 |
| 

 | 

(i) front RH 215/60R16 tyre

 | 

S$360.00;

 |
| 

 | 

(ii) front RH fender inner shield clips set

 | 

S$ 50.00; and

 |
| 

(e)

 | 

Labour and miscellaneous charges.

 | 

 |

  
  

50     The plaintiff’s counsel’s general argument was that the SJE only managed to do a paper survey based on photographs, whereas the plaintiff’s surveyor did a physical inspection. Further, on the cost of the items, as the plaintiff’s repairers would be the ones to indent for the items, they would be more familiar with the costings. They would also have a better idea of the extent of the workmanship involved. Plaintiff’s counsel therefore urged the Court to prefer the plaintiff’s surveyor’s recommendation.

51     The Court is mindful that the onus of proof remains with the plaintiff to discharge. The SJE is independent and non-partisan, whose duty is to assist the Court. The SJE in this case understood that. The plaintiff must therefore persuade the Court against any doubts that the SJE might raise on the plaintiff’s claims.

52     The Court is accepting the SJE’s assessment of the cost of the items and the repairs for the SJE’s explanations of why he has disallowed the items or discounted them. On items 3, 12, and 13 and the Special Nett Items, the SJE’s reason for not allowing them was because he was unable to see their damage from the photos, or that they were repairable. He was of the view that any damage to item 3 would be evident even from the photo.[^24] As for item 12, it should light up on the dashboard when the sensor is triggered, but there was no such photo evidencing that.[^25] On item 13, the SJE acknowledged that it was damaged, but not to the extent that it was not repairable. These items were therefore disallowed by the SJE. For the special nett items of the tyre which the plaintiff’s repairers claimed to have been cut, the SJE considered that if it was cut and not a scratch, it would have been deeper than what was seen in the photo.[^26] As for the clip sets, the SJE considered that they could be reused. If they were damaged, the photo was lacking.[^27]

53     On the labour and miscellaneous charges, the Court also prefers the SJE’s more conservative pricings when there is a range of such services and charges. The plaintiff and the SJE did not dispute that there was a range of pricings on these.

54     The Court accepts the SJE’s assessment in whole on the quantum of the repairs. Given that the Court had earlier held the measure of damages to be the repair cost, the quantum to be awarded to the plaintiff on the car repairs at 100% would therefore be S$5,300.

## Conclusion

55     Interlocutory judgment at 75% was entered on 24 February 2020 in favour of the plaintiff. Flowing from the above, this Court awards damages to the plaintiff as follows:

56     There shall be no pre-judgment interest awarded. On this, the Court is grateful to both counsel as officers of the court, honourably agreeing on the case authority of _Ng Siok Poh (administratrix of the estate of Lim Lian Chiat, deceased) and another v Sim Lian-Koru Bena JV Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 731</span> where the learned Kannan Ramesh J held that the question to ask was “whether a party has been kept out of money in practical terms” (at \[91\]). In the present case, it is not disputed that the plaintiff had not paid her repairers a single cent of the repair costs.[^28] She was therefore not out of pocket for any period of time that she ought to be compensated any pre-judgment interest.

57     The same reasoning was applied in _Koh_’s case when the learned Deputy Registrar rationalised at \[34\] that it was the repairers who lost the opportunity to use their money, but since they were not parties to the action, no pre-judgment interest should be ordered against the defendant in that case.

58     I shall hear parties on costs.
