Civil Procedure – Discovery of documents – Pre-action discovery – Jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s Court

1 December 2021

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       MC/OSS 393 of 2021 (“**Application**”) was an originating summons filed in the Magistrate’s Court by AXA Insurance Pte Ltd (“**Applicant**”) for pre-action discovery against Shimizu Corporation (“**Respondent**”) pursuant to Order 24 Rule 6 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“**ROC**”). The central issue turned on the Magistrate’s Court’s jurisdiction to hear the Application. After hearing parties, I made no order on the Application because I was of the view that the Magistrate’s Court has no jurisdiction to hear the Application.

2       As applications for pre-action discovery are commonly-made and, as this case demonstrates, parties may be inclined to think that the application should be made in the court where the putative action is to be commenced, I thought it helpful to set out the grounds of my decision and explain why I considered that a Magistrate’s Court has no jurisdiction over such an application.

## Brief Background

3       The Applicant is an insurance company in Singapore and issued a work injury compensation insurance policy (“**Policy**”) to one CS Construction & Geotechnic Pte Ltd (“**Company**”).[^1] Pursuant to the Policy, the Applicant agreed to indemnify the Company against certain liabilities arising out of personal injury claims of Company’s employees.[^2]

4       The Respondent was a building contractor.[^3]

5       The Company was engaged by one Hirose (Singapore) Pte Ltd as a sub-contractor for a building project for the National Cancer Centre (“**Project**”). Hirose (Singapore) Pte Ltd was, in turn, a sub-contractor of the Respondent for the Project.[^4]

6       On 9 May 2018, one of the Company’s employees (“**Injured Worker**”) was injured while working at the Project worksite. In accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and pursuant to its obligations under the Policy, the Applicant paid the Injured Worker certain compensation sums.[^5]

7       The Applicant’s position was that the Respondent, as the main contractor for the Project, would have procured its own work injury compensation insurance policy which would have covered the Respondent as its sub-contractor for the Project.[^6] The Applicant would therefore have a claim for either contribution or indemnity against the Respondent’s insurer. The extent of such contribution or indemnity would depend on (amongst others) the terms of the insurance policy between the Respondent and its insurer.[^7]

8       However, and despite prior written requests made to the Respondent, the Applicant has been unable to discover the identity of the Respondent’s insurer (or the terms of that insurance policy).[^8] The Applicant therefore filed the Application for pre-action discovery against the Respondent on 15 October 2021 for a copy of the Respondent’s work injury compensation insurance policy for the Project.

## Parties’ Positions

9       By the time the Application came up for hearing before me on 22 November 2021, the document requested by the Applicant had already been provided by the Respondent. The only issue remaining in the Application was one of costs. The Applicant sought costs from the Respondent in the sum of $900 on the basis that the Application was necessitated by the Respondent’s failure to respond in time to the Applicant’s earlier written requests for the document. The Respondent argued that no order as to costs should be made.

## The Magistrate’s Court Had No Jurisdiction to Hear the Application

10     Although the substantive issue which was the subject of the Application had already been resolved between the parties, I was not prepared to issue any order (including any order as to costs) in the Application as I was concerned with my jurisdiction to do so.

11     The reason for my concern was that under Section 52(1A) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“**SCA**”), the Magistrates’ Courts have _no civil jurisdiction_ to hear and try any action where _there is no claim for any sum of money_. Sections 52(1) and (1A) of the SCA state as follows:

> Civil jurisdiction of Magistrates’ Courts

> 52.—(1)     **Subject to subsection (1A)**, a Magistrate’s Court shall have all the jurisdiction of the General Division of the High Court to hear and try any action in personam where —

>> (a)    the defendant is served with a writ of summons or any other originating process —

>>> (i)    in Singapore in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court; or

>>> (ii)   outside Singapore in the circumstances authorised by and in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court; or

>> (b)    the defendant submits to the jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court.

> (1A)  The **jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court** under subsection (1) **shall not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where** —

>> (a)     **there is no claim for any sum of money**;…

(emphasis added)

12     An “_action_” is defined under Section 2 of the SCA as “_a_ **_civil proceeding commenced by summons_** _or in such other manner as may be prescribed by Rules of Court_” (emphasis added).

13     As mentioned, the Application was a pre-action discovery application. Understandably and as is usually the case for such applications, the Application was made by way of an originating summons and contained no claim for any sum of money. The relief sought in the Application was for the Respondent to produce a copy of its work injury compensation insurance policy that it had procured for the Project. On its face, the Application fell squarely within the ambit of the express exclusion under Section 52(1A)(a) of the SCA, being a civil proceeding commenced by summons where there is no claim for any sum of money.

14     Given my concern, I invited counsel for both the Applicant and the Respondent to address the issue of the Magistrate’s Court’s jurisdiction over the Application.

15     Counsel for the Respondent agreed that the Magistrate’s Court did not have jurisdiction over the Application, and therefore did not have the power to make any cost order in the Application.

16     Counsel for the Applicant argued that the Application was properly filed in the Magistrate’s Court, on two main grounds:

> (a)     First, the putative action to be commenced against the insurer of the Respondent would include a claim for a sum of money, and the Magistrate’s Court would have jurisdiction over that putative action.

> (b)     Second, the Applicant’s counsel was aware of an order on costs having been made in another pre-action discovery application made by way of an originating summons filed in the Magistrate’s Court. Although the grounds of that decision has not been not published, coincidentally, the Respondent’s counsel was also counsel in that matter and was able to confirm that such an order was in fact made.

17     Having considered parties’ submissions, I was not persuaded that the Magistrate’s Court had jurisdiction to hear the Application.

18     On the Applicant’s first submission that the Magistrate’s Court would have jurisdiction over the putative action, that was speculative. The entire purposes of pre-action disclosure is to discover documents and information in order for the applicant to determine whether there is a viable cause of action or to identify the appropriate party to sue: see _ED&F Man Capital Markets Ltd v Straits (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 695</span> at \[31\]. It therefore puts the cart before the horse to say that the Magistrate’s Court has jurisdiction over a pre-action discovery application because of its jurisdiction over a putative action which _may or may not_ ever be commenced.

19     Of course, the Magistrate’s Court, once seized of jurisdiction over an action, can issue _interlocutory or ancillary_ orders in the proceedings which may not always include (and in fact usually does not include) any pecuniary relief. But a pre-action discovery application is _unique_ in that it seeks a _final order_ for the disclosure of the document and upon such order being made, the _entire_ originating process is disposed of. It is therefore _not_ interlocutory or ancillary in nature. In _Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 525</span>, the Court of Appeal explained this in the context of discussing the meaning of “_interlocutory order_” under Section 34(1)(c) of the old Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (at \[16\]):

> We recognise that on this approach, it is possible that an order granted in one proceeding may be interlocutory and yet the same nature of order granted in another proceeding may well be final. The point may again best be illustrated by an example. Taking the case of an action for breach of contract, where an application is made for the discovery of documents, the order on discovery will be an interlocutory order. But **it does not follow that every discovery order will necessarily be an interlocutory order**. It will depend on the nature of the originating process and the relief(s) prayed for. **A proceeding may be instituted purely to obtain pre-action discovery**. In that situation, **upon the granting of the order prayed for, that order will be a final order because that disposes of everything in the proceeding**.

(emphasis added)

20     In any event, I did not see how the Magistrate’s Court _potentially_ having jurisdiction over the putative action would confer upon it jurisdiction over the _present_ Application given the express exclusion under Section 52(1A)(a) of the SCA. As the Court of Appeal explained in _Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 354</span>, it would in fact be incorrect to treat a pre-action discovery application as an application which is _preliminary and incidental_ to the putative proceeding (at \[66\] to \[68\] and \[72\]):

> 66    We recognise that against this view, **it might be argued that an application for pre-action interrogatories is in substance one that is preliminary and incidental to proceedings which may subsequently be commenced** by the party seeking to administer those interrogatories. Moreover, it might be said that the application is made by originating summons, rather than by way of a summons in the proceedings, out of sheer necessity, as substantive proceedings are not yet afoot. On that view, it might be said that an application for pre-action interrogatories is in fact and in substance interlocutory in nature.

> 67     **While such an argument might be superficially attractive, we find it untenable upon closer scrutiny. First, it is not always the case that substantive proceedings will be commenced** by the party seeking to administer pre-action interrogatories. This could be so for a number of reasons. It may be that the answers given in the interrogatories are insufficient for him to determine whether he has a viable cause of action against the potential defendant(s) to that cause of action; or that after administering interrogatories, he remains unaware who the defendant(s) ought to be; or it might even be that for whatever reason, he elects not to commence proceedings at all.

> 68    Second, under O 26A r 1(5) of the Rules of Court, **the court may, before the commencement of proceedings, order that interrogatories be administered on a person who is not a party to those proceedings for the purpose of identifying the likely parties to those proceedings**.

> …

> 72    In such cases, the only obligation imposed by the court on the defendant to the originating summons, vis-à-vis the plaintiff, is to make discovery of information. **The action brought against such a defendant is one purely for the discovery of information. This is separate and distinct from proceedings which may subsequently be commenced** by the party having obtained the information. **In these circumstances, it would be incorrect to treat an application to administer pre-action interrogatories as an interlocutory step in proceedings which the party seeking to administer those interrogatories may subsequently commence**.

(emphasis added)

21     In this regard, I note that in the somewhat similar context where leave to commence derivative action is sought under Section 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“**Companies Act**”), Section 216A(6) of the Companies Act expressly provides that:

> “Where the action has been commenced or **is to be brought in the State Courts**, an application for leave under subsection (2) shall be made **in a District Court**.”

(emphasis added)

22     This is notable because a derivative action (i.e. the putative action) maybe brought in either a Magistrate’s Court or in a District Court, depending on the value of the claim in issue. Yet, and tellingly, Section 216A(6) of the Companies Act _expressly specifies_ that an application for leave to commence that derivative action, being an application where there is usually no claim for any sum of money, should be made _only_ to a District Court. This is consistent with my conclusion that the Magistrate’s Court has no jurisdiction over a pre-action originating application _even if_ it _may_ have jurisdiction over the potential putative action.

23     As to the Applicant’s second submission that a similar order had previously been made in a different matter, suffice to say that that decision is not binding on me. Further, counsel for the Respondent (who was also counsel in the other matter) was able to confirm that the issue of jurisdiction was neither raised nor discussed in that case. Accordingly, the fact of such a decision alone was of no persuasive value to the issue under consideration here.

24     In my view, the Application is an originating action commenced in the Magistrate’s Court which contained no claim for any sum of money. Pursuant to Section 52(1A)(a) of the SCA, the Magistrate’s Court lacked civil jurisdiction over the Application. Accordingly, I made no order on the Application.

25     I recognise that the decision I had reached in this matter might, on one view, be considered pedantic. Afterall, there is little dispute over the substantive merits of the Applicant’s pre-action discovery application, and parties only needed the court to determine the outstanding issue of costs between them.

26     Jurisdictional issues however cannot yield to the desirability or convenience of a practical outcome. It may be desirable and convenient for the parties for this court to make a determination on the issue of costs in the Application, but such desire cannot cloth this court with jurisdiction which it did not have. If this court had no jurisdiction over the Application, it had no business making any order in the Application, even if it was only an order on costs. Doing so would ultimately be a disservice to all the parties involved.

27     Accordingly, no order was made on the Application.

28     In my view, applicants who wish to make a pre-action discovery application in the State Courts would be well-advised to file the application in a District Court in view of the jurisdictional limits of a Magistrate’s Court.
