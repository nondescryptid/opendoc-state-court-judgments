\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9128/2021/01.\]

1 March 2022

### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Introduction

1       The Majur (hereinafter “the accused”) was arrested by police officers as he was believed to be dangerous to himself or other persons.[^1] While he was being escorted to the police station in a police car, the accused allegedly bit one of the police officers on the right waist area. After a lengthy trial, during which the accused elected to remain silent, I convicted the accused of one charge of voluntarily causing harm to a police officer in the discharge of his duty and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment.

2       The accused has appealed, and I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## Brief facts

3       On the morning of 16 December 2018, a senior station manager of SMRT Corporation Ltd who was stationed at Pasir Ris MRT approached the accused, who was covered up, to conduct a security inspection, but the accused refused to comply.[^2]

4       The accused alighted at Tampines MRT, where he walked towards the gantry before jumping over. The accused was then stopped by staff members. Subsequently, Sgt Jonathan Lim Xiong Hai (“Sgt Lim”) and his partner, Sgt Zhang Linhan (“Sgt Zhang”), arrived at the scene to conduct further interviews on the accused person.[^3]

5       Sgt Lim and Sgt Zhang brought the accused to a restricted staff area, where Special Constable Lin Xiang (“SC Lin”) and Sgt Nurfaiz bin Noordin (“Sgt Nurfaiz”) were present to render assistance.[^4] The accused was then escorted to a police car so that he could be brought to the lock-up in the Bedok Police Division Headquarters.[^5] After some resistance, the accused was eventually placed inside the police car.

6       During the journey to the police headquarters, the accused started making several threats at the police officers,[^6] and at one point, he gnashed his teeth at SGT Lim, who was seated to his left.[^7] Shortly thereafter, the accused allegedly bit Sgt Lim on his right waist area, and this caused Sgt Lim to feel a sharp pain and to utter a part-expletive, “eh, chee”.[^8]

7       On the same day, Sgt Lim was examined by Dr Goh Keng Meng Jeremy (“Dr Goh”) at the Changi General Hospital (“CGH”). Upon examination, Sgt Lim was diagnosed with a “mild erythema was noted over the right flank” consistent with a “bite injury”.[^9]

8       As a result, the accused was charged as follows:

>     you on 16 December 2018, at about 11.38am, in the police car bearing license plate 'QX281C', along Tampines Central 4, in the vicinity of Tampines MRT station, Singapore, _did voluntarily cause hurt to one Sergeant Jonathan Lim Xiong Hai of the Singapore Police Force, being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, to wit, by biting him on his right waist area and causing a bite injury in the form of mild erythema over his right flank_, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. \[emphasis added\]

9       The accused claimed trial to the charge.

## Summary of Proceedings

10     The prosecution adduced evidence from seven witnesses, namely: (a) the victim, Sgt Lim; (b) Dr Goh, the examining doctor for the victim; (c) SC Lin; (d) Dr Looi Chong Heng Peter (“Dr Looi”), the author of the medical report on the victim; (e) Sgt Zhang; (f) Sgt Nurfaiz and (g) Investigation Officer Khairulizan bin Ishak (“IO Khairul”). The accused, who conducted his defence in person, cross-examined each of the seven witnesses over the span of 17 days.

### No Case to Answer

11     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the accused submitted that there was no case to answer as the evidence adduced by the prosecution was inherently incredible. This was for the following reasons:[^10]

> (a)     There were inconsistencies between Sgt Lim’s and SC Lin’s evidence in so far as the former had testified that he was bitten on his right waist area whereas the latter had testified that the accused’s head was at the tummy area when the alleged incident had occurred.

> (b)     There were inconsistencies between the charge which the accused was served under section 23(1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) where it was alleged that he had bitten Sgt Lim on his right hand[^11] and the charge that was tendered at trial where it was alleged that he had bitten Sgt Lim on the right waist area (reproduced at \[8\] above).[^12]

> (c)     The accused’s arrest did not fully satisfy the requirements under section 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (Cap 178A, 2012 Rev Ed) (“Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act”) which required that the individual be perceived by law enforcement officers to be clearly demonstrating harm to himself or other people or that he clearly exhibited signs of a mental disorder[^13].

> (d)     Both doctors, Dr Goh and Dr Looi (the author of the medical report) had testified that the mild erythema, _ie_, redness of the skin sustained by Sgt Lim, could arise from other sources, other than a bite.[^14]

> (e)     Sgt Lim did not make any report or complain of pain and suffering as a result of the bite injury sustained during the discussion that he and the other police officers had as to the appropriate charge to be preferred against the accused. Neither did Sgt Lim record his injury or check on his wounds as alleged.[^15]

### Prosecution’s reply to Defence’s submission of No Case to Answer

12     The prosecution’s reply[^16] was essentially that the evidence adduced was not inherently incredible for the following reasons:

> (a)     The video footage tendered had shown the accused’s head at Sgt Lim’s waist, which was not disputed, thereby suggesting that there would be an opportunity for the accused to bite Sgt Lim at the material time.

> (b)     Sgt Lim had further exclaimed a partial vulgarity at the exact moment when the accused’s head was at Sgt Lim’s waist.

> (c)     The medical report was consistent with Sgt Lim’s account of how he had sustained the injury to his right flank, namely, that he had been bitten on his right flank.

13     Given the objective evidence of the video footage (taken from the body-worn cameras of Sgt Lim and SC Lin) adduced by the prosecution and coupled with the explanations given by these prosecution witnesses, it was submitted that the defence ought to be called for the accused to give his version of events as to the reasons for disbelieving Sgt Lim.

14     I was satisfied that there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible and accordingly, I called for the accused to give his defence.[^17]

### Election to remain silent

15     The standard allocution under section 230(1)(_m_) of the CPC, informing the accused of the consequences of his remaining silent was duly administered. Despite “understand\[ing\] the negative inference that the Court would draw”, the accused chose to remain silent and did not call any witnesses in his defence.[^18] Accordingly, parties were directed to file closing submissions.

## Closing Submissions

### The Prosecution’s submissions

16     In closing, the prosecution submitted that Sgt Lim’s evidence was internally consistent and externally corroborated, and ought to be believed over the accused’s bare denial.[^19] Sgt Lim’s evidence that he had sustained a bite from the accused at around 11:38am, was supported by his body-worn camera footage, and was consistent with the accused’s agitated stance towards the officers throughout.[^20]

17     Sgt Lim’s account was also corroborated by his colleagues, namely Sgt Nurfaiz and SC Lin, and also by Dr Goh’s medical findings. Further, Sgt Zhang had taken two photographs of Sgt Lim’s right waist to document the “bite mark and the redness at this waist area” shortly after the incident had happened.[^21] There was no motive for any of the police officers or the prosecution’s witnesses to lie.[^22] Contrary to allegations made by the accused, there was also no credible evidence showing that Sgt Lim had given inconsistent accounts about where and when he was bitten.[^23] An adverse inference of guilt ought also to be drawn against the accused for his election to remain silent.[^24]

### The accused’s submissions

18     Against this, the accused submitted that the mild erythema “is a symptom of great many sources”, and the photographs of the alleged injury show “no signs of puncture, open wounds, or skin bruising that would have been consistent with the trauma of a ‘sharp pain’ \[as\] described by \[Sgt Lim\]”. This suggested “further inconsistencies with the existence of a bite injury, thereby a bite event having taken place.”[^25]

19     Allegations were also made about the inconsistencies in the documentation of the investigation officers,[^26] and all of the police officers, including Sgt Lim, stated on record that they did not directly see the bite occurring at the material time.[^27] Sgt Lim’s conduct after the alleged episode was also inconsistent with him having been bitten – for example, it was submitted that if Sgt Lim had indeed been bitten, “\[i\]ncreased violent force would have been reasonable to be used on the \[accused\] who’s (_sic_) legs were bounded tight together, and hands cuffed behind his back. Instead, \[Sgt Lim\] sought to de-escalate the increasing violence, anger, fear, worry of \[SC Lin\]”.[^28] Sgt Lim’s act of brushing off the harm caused by the alleged bite also showed that the harm caused was “so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm”: s 95 of Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).[^29]

20     Additionally, the accused submitted that he was “rightly” angry for having been arrested under s 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act even though the police officers had “answered consistently” that he “was neither a danger to himself, and that he did not exhibit clear sign of a mental disorder”.[^30] Further allegations were also made about him having been abused by Sgt Lim and SC Lin, and seen collectively, it was submitted that it was “unsafe to convict \[the accused\] as guilty”.[^31]

21     In oral reply, the accused also alluded to an apparent conspiracy by the prosecution’s witnesses to provide a consistent lie that the accused had bitten Sgt Lim.[^32]

## My decision on conviction

22     What was at issue before me was whether the accused had indeed bitten Sgt Lim at the waist in the police car. To this, I first considered the internal consistency of Sgt Lim’s evidence.

### Sgt Lim’s account

23     In Sgt Lim’s account, the accused was first spotted by security staff who wished to conduct a security check on him. However, the accused refused to comply, and when he alighted at Tampines MRT, he then jumped over the gantry.[^33] Given the accused’s conduct and as he was fully covered in clothing, Sgt Lim and his partner, Sgt Zhang, were called to the scene to conduct a further interview and to find out what had actually happened.[^34] Upon arrival, Sgt Lim observed that the accused was wearing a cap, sunglasses, and that he was masked over his nose and mouth with a scarf. The accused was also wearing a long-sleeved shirt with gloves, and none of his facial features could be seen.

24     Sgt Lim and Sgt Zhang escorted the accused to a restricted staff area, where SC Lin and Sgt Nurfaiz were present to render assistance.[^35] The accused was then escorted to a police car so that he could be brought to the lock-up in the Bedok Police Division Headquarters.[^36] While the accused was being escorted from the Tampines MRT staff area to the police car, he claimed that he was unable to walk.[^37] The police officers thus requested for a wheelchair, but the accused refused to sit on the wheelchair.[^38] Amidst the struggle, the accused, who had his hands cuffed behind him, began using his legs to kick about.[^39] To further restrain the use of his legs, the police officers used flex cuffs to secure his legs before carrying the accused into the police car.[^40] After both his hands and legs were restrained, the accused continued struggling by using his hips to move up and down.[^41] The accused also began issuing threats to the police officers, including: “\[i\]t will get really ugly inside the car”.[^42]

25     In the police car, the accused was seated in the middle of the rear passenger seat while Sgt Lim was seated on his left and SC Lin was seated on his right. Sgt Zhang was the driver of the said police car while Sgt Nurfaiz drove a different police car. During the journey to the police headquarters, the accused continued making several threats, such as “\[g\]et more guys, you’re not enough to stop me”, “\[y\]ou want to lose your fingers”, “I will leave your face intact if you don’t touch my head”, and “\[y\]ou need a van, body parts and blood will spill”.[^43] At around 11:37:45am, the accused then turned to Sgt Lim, and started gnashing his teeth at Sgt Lim.[^44] Shortly thereafter, at 11:38:17am, Sgt Lim could be heard saying “eh, chee”. According to Sgt Lim, the accused’s head was at his right waist area when he uttered the words “eh, chee”,[^45] and he had intended to say the Hokkien expletive “chee bye” as he felt a bite and a sharp pain at his right waist area at the time.[^46]

### Corroboration of Sgt Lim’s account

26     While the words uttered were captured by Sgt Lim’s body-worn camera, the alleged bite on his waist area was out of frame and could not be seen in the video footage. Nonetheless, it was externally corroborated in various other ways.

27     First, when cross-examined by the accused, SC Lin, who was also seated next to the accused, testified that he had heard Sgt Lim’s sudden exclamation, and from this, he assumed that Sgt Lim had been bitten by the accused:[^47]

> A    Okay, I know that he had been hurt and I assumed that at that point of time, he had been bitten by you.

> Q    So, how did you know that he had been hurt, Mister Witness?

> A    Because he suddenly exclaimed a profan---uh---a vulgarity.

> Q    That’s the best you got? Anything else? I’m waiting for a credible answer.

> A    Together with the reaction, yes, that’s the best I have.

> Q    What’s your---what’s his reaction? Describe it.

> A    In his---in the video---

> Q    Describe it.

> A     **_when your head was suddenly---and was---when your head was near his---Sergeant Jonathan’s waist, he suddenly exclaimed a vulgarity_**. And---yah, that’s all.

>     \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

28     As seen in the emphasised portions of SC Lin’s testimony, the accused’s head was also near Sgt Lim’s waist at the material time. In fact, about one to two seconds after Sgt Lim uttered the words “eh, chee”, the accused could be heard saying (at time stamp 11:38:19am): “I can’t help it but your gun is in my mouth now and I don’t want to lift it off your revolver holster”.[^48] Given the proximity of Sgt Lim’s revolver holster to his waist, the natural inference was that the accused’s mouth was close to Sgt Lim’s waist at the material time. Also, as evinced by his clear speech,[^49] the accused was able to exert some force with his mouth.

29     About half an hour after the incident (at time stamp 12:08:11pm), Sgt Nurfaiz could be heard saying “then 323 against you”. This comment was directed at Sgt Lim,[^50] and was intended by Sgt Nurfaiz to mean that the accused could be charged for “voluntar\[il\]y causing hurt to a public servant… \[b\]ecause … \[the accused\] actually bit \[Sgt Lim\] on his tummy area”.[^51]

30     Less than a minute later (at time stamp 12:09:55pm), Sgt Nurfaiz then asked Sgt Lim “You kenna bite where”, to which Sgt Lim responded “Somewhere, I don’t know, never mind”.[^52] At this point, Sgt Lim’s intention was to brush off the incident as he saw it as “a job hazard” and he “didn’t want to go through the hassle”.[^53] However, Sgt Nurfaiz continued persuading Sgt Lim to take action, and at 12:10:07pm, Sgt Nurfaiz said: “If you don’t do anything now, later --- months later, you cannot do anything”.[^54] This was understood by Sgt Lim to mean that if he did not report the incident promptly, there would be no documentation of the incident.[^55]

31     At 12:10:39pm, Sgt Lim’s team leader said: “I’m inclined to go for a VCH \[_ie_, voluntarily causing hurt\] towards public servant”; in Sgt Lim’s understanding, this meant that she wanted him “to bring up the incident where the accused \[had\] bit\[ten him\]”.[^56] After some persuasion by his colleagues, Sgt Lim was brought back to the police station to disarm and change out.[^57]

32     At about 2pm of the same day, Sgt Lim met his partner, Sgt Zhang, at Changi General Hospital for his medical assessment.[^58] At the hospital, Sgt Zhang took two photographs of Sgt Lim’s right waist area[^59] which showed that there were red marks with no open wounds showing.[^60]

33     These photographs were consistent with Dr Goh’s medical assessment, which were reflected in Dr Looi’s report as follows:[^61]

>     \[Sgt Lim\] was seen by Dr Goh … on the 16/12/2018 \[_ie_, the day of the incident\]. He gave a history of being assaulted that day. He was bitten on the right flank.

>     On examination, he was well, alert and rational. Vital parameters stable. _Mild erythema noted over the right flank. No open wound seen._

>     He was discharged with some oral medication.

>      _Diagnosis was that of a bite injury_.

>     \[emphasis added\]

34     As Dr Goh explained on the stand, a mild erythema over the right flank “just means redness of the skin” on “the right side of \[Sgt Lim’s\] body”,[^62] and the lack of an open wound meant that there was no puncture or cut wounds observed.[^63]

35     The evidence presented revealed a coherent sequence of events, which may be summarised as follows. After some difficulty, the accused, who had been uncooperative for the most part, was placed in the police car with Sgt Lim seated on his left. This meant that Sgt Lim’s right-hand side was the side that was closer to the accused. Inside the police car, the accused continued making several threats at the police officers. The accused could then be seen gnashing his teeth at Sgt Lim, and shortly thereafter, Sgt Lim exclaimed a part-expletive because, in his evidence, he had been bitten by the accused at his right waist area, and this caused him to feel a sharp pain. This was consistent with the fact that the accused’s mouth was near Sgt Lim’s revolver holster just _one to two_ seconds after the exclamation. After the incident, Sgt Lim’s colleagues, whose comments were recorded by the body-worn camera footage, were in unison about the fact that Sgt Lim had suffered a bite. Although Sgt Lim was initially intent on brushing off the incident, he was subsequently persuaded to obtain a medical opinion with a view of pursuing the matter. At the Changi General Hospital, Sgt Zhang took two photographs[^64] which showed red marks about the size of a bite mark over Sgt Lim’s right waist area, and the bite injury to Sgt Lim’s waist area was subsequently confirmed by Dr Goh’s medical examination.

### The accused’s arguments

#### Whether the mild erythema was caused by something other than a bite

36     Against this, the accused levied several arguments. First, it was suggested that the bite injury could have been caused by something else, as “mild erythema is a symptom of a great many sources”.[^65] This was in particular as the photographs of the injury taken by Sgt Zhang were belatedly submitted.[^66] While the wound could indeed have been caused by some other source, there was nothing in the body of evidence which suggested any alternate cause other than a bite injury that was inflicted by the accused.

37     As summarised above, Sgt Lim attended at the doctor shortly after his colleagues had persuaded him to do so, upon their discovery of the fact that he had been bitten by the accused in the police car. After examining Sgt Lim, who had reported to Dr Goh that he had been “bitten by a person”,[^67] Dr Goh’s diagnosis was that of a bite injury. No evidence was presented by the accused or any other witness that would suggest any alternate source of the bite injury, nor of any alternate diagnosis other than a bite injury at Sgt Lim’s right waist area.

#### Whether the inconsistencies in documentation affected the finding of guilt

38     The accused also pointed to several inconsistencies in documentation by the Investigation Officers.[^68] First, on 16 December 2018 (_ie_, the date of the incident), Investigation Officer Soh Yi Jing (“IO Soh”) prepared a charge against the accused, as follows:[^69]

>     … are charged that you on the 16th day of December 2018, _at or about 1.00pm_, _at the Tampines MRT station, Singapore_, did voluntarily cause hurt to one \[Sgt Lim\] of the Singapore Police Force, a public servant, with intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such a public servant, to wit, did _bite him on his right hand_, causing redness, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. \[emphasis added\]

39     To recap, the prosecution’s case at trial was that the accused had bitten Sgt Lim in the _right waist area at around 11:38am in the police car.[^70]_ This differed from the above charge in three areas, namely, the time of the bite, the location of the bite, and the place where the bite occurred.

40     Two days later, on 18 December 2018, IO Soh prepared another charge, which was read when the accused was charged in Court. This later charge stated that:

>     … are charged that you on the 16th day of December 2018, _at or about 1.00pm_, at _the roadside of ‘Community Plaza’ beside ‘Tampines 1’ shopping mall_, in the police car bearing license plate ‘QX281C’, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one \[Sgt Lim\] of the Singapore Police Force, a public servant, with intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such a public servant, to wit, did bite him on his right waist area, causing redness, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. \[emphasis added\]

41     While this later charge identified the site of the bite as Sgt Lim’s right waist area (as opposed to his right hand), it remained inconsistent with the prosecution’s case in two respects, namely, the time of the bite and the place where the bite occurred.

42     The accused submitted that the inconsistencies impugned the credibility of Sgt Lim,[^71] and also went towards showing that the “\[p\]rosecution witness\[es\] and people were fabricating evidence” to provide a consistent lie that the accused had bitten Sgt Lim.[^72] I did not accept this argument for the following reasons.

43     First, Sgt Lim’s evidence on cross-examination was that he did not speak to IO Soh or IO Khairul on 16 December 2018, prior to IO Soh’s preparation of the initial charge.[^73] According to IO Khairul, who was IO Soh’s partner, as at 16 December 2018, the Investigation Officers only knew that Sgt Lim had been bitten.[^74] The area of the bite was subsequently corrected (from the right hand to the right waist area) when the photographs of Sgt Lim’s right waist area were uploaded onto the system sometime after 17 December 2018.[^75] Nonetheless, errors persisted in the later charge of 18 December 2018 as the accused refused to talk or provide any statement on 17 December 2018,[^76] and as Sgt Lim’s statement of the incident was also only recorded _after_ the accused had been charged in Court on 18 December 2018 (_ie_, after the later charge (at \[40\] above) was prepared).[^77] In other words, the discrepancy in the charges appeared to have been caused by the imperfect information available to IO Soh (and IO Khairul) on 16 and 18 December 2018. Furthermore, SC Lin’s body-worn camera footage also showed that the accused was already on a bed at Changi General Hospital at 1pm,[^78] and so the time of the bite as stated in the charge sheets were plainly wrong. The natural inference, which Deputy Public Prosecutor Ms Selene Yap (“Ms Yap”) invited me to draw, was that IO Soh had made several mistakes in preparing the charge sheets.

44     In my view, this was the most reasonable inference to draw given the surrounding evidence. For one, at no point in the body-worn camera footage did Sgt Lim complain about a bite to his hand. Consistent with this, Sgt Zhang did not take photographs of any part of Sgt Lim’s body other than his right waist, and the medical report of the same day also confirmed that the bite injury was at Sgt Lim’s right waist area.

45     Notwithstanding the allegations of a wide-spread conspiracy, there was also no concrete evidence presented to show that any of the police officers or prosecution witnesses had a reason or a motive to pin a crime against the accused. Indeed, any such conspiracy was inconsistent with Sgt Lim’s actions immediately after the incident because, as mentioned, Sgt Lim was initially intent on downplaying the incident as he did not wish to pursue it.[^79]

46     Even if the police officers were, as the accused submitted, motivated to fabricate evidence of a bite injury “to right the wrongs that ha\[d\] been done” as the grounds for arresting the accused pursuant to s 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act was not a strong one,[^80] there was nothing to explain why Dr Goh would have joined in on this conspiracy. Dr Goh had never interacted with the accused prior to diagnosing Sgt Lim. During cross-examination, Dr Goh also demonstrated his impartiality by answering the accused’s questions fairly, without any fidelity to the prosecution or its witnesses.[^81] Dr Goh’s participation in the alleged conspiracy would have been crucial, as any conspiracy to frame the accused would likely be futile unless Dr Goh, the examining doctor, gave a diagnosis that was consistent with Sgt Lim’s complaint of a bite injury to his right waist area. Despite this, no evidence was adduced to show that Dr Goh was informed of this supposed conspiracy, nor was any plausible reason proffered for why Dr Goh would have joined in on the conspiracy.

47     It was also noteworthy that while Dr Goh was the examining doctor, the medical report was eventually prepared by Dr Looi, based on the findings documented by Dr Goh.[^82] Dr Looi did not examine Sgt Lim,[^83] nor was he personally familiar with Dr Goh.[^84] In other words, there would be even less opportunity for Dr Looi to have been briefed on the supposed conspiracy, and even less reason for Dr Looi to join in on the conspiracy to frame the accused. Despite this, Dr Looi, who was also impartial and fair in answering the accused’s questions on cross-examination,[^85] produced the report which essentially corroborated Sgt Lim’s account, namely that Sgt Lim had suffered a bite injury to his waist area on the day of the accused’s arrest, which bite injury was diagnosed and recorded by Dr Goh. The evidence of the doctors, seen collectively, added to the implausibility of a conspiracy.

48     Moreover, the accused had gnashed his teeth at Sgt Lim about a minute before the bite occurred and about one to two seconds after the bite, the accused’s mouth was also at Sgt Lim’s waist area (see \[28\] above).

49     Seen collectively, the most reasonable inference to draw from the inconsistencies in the earlier charge sheets was that they were erroneously prepared by IO Soh. Regardless of the reason for the errors, such errors could not be attributed to Sgt Lim, and were surely insufficient to impugn Sgt Lim’s credibility, let alone raise a reasonable doubt as regards the charge because of a supposed conspiracy or otherwise.

#### Whether the accused could rely on s 95 of the Penal Code

50     Finally, the accused submitted that he ought to be absolved of the offence by reason of s 95 of the Penal Code, which provides:

>     Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.

51     In _Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 957</span>, a wife slapped her husband once because she was annoyed with him for taking photographs of her removing her belongings from the matrimonial home. Yong Pung How CJ observed that s 95 of the Penal Code “provides relief to an offender where the act is negligible or the offence is of a trivial character. … The section would apply if the act causes harm or is intended to cause harm or is known to be likely to cause harm, provided the harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.” Noting that a single slap had been administered, and that the husband had not bothered to seek medical attention, the court remarked that the injury must have been minor, and seen in the light of the ongoing matrimonial dispute, Yong CJ held at \[57\] that

>     … it would not be in the interest of justice to penalise \[the wife\] for what, in my opinion, was a negligible wrong. Although \[the wife\] was clearly guilty of the offence \[of voluntarily causing hurt\], I would apply the _de minimis_ principle under s 95 of the Penal Code.

52     In _Balbir Singh s/o Amar Singh v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 784</span>, the offender boarded a bus without paying the bus fare. During the journey, the bus captain stopped the bus and asked him to pay the fare. The offender did nothing. At the next bus stop, the bus captain again asked the offender to pay the bus fare. This time, the offender scolded and kicked the bus captain once on his left leg. The offender was charged with voluntarily causing hurt and sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. On appeal, the offender attempted to rely on s 95 of the Penal Code, but this was rejected by Lee Seiu Kin J, who made the following salient observations at \[22\]–\[23\]:

> 22    … \[The offender\] was in the wrong in not paying the fare, yet he behaved in a thuggish manner towards the driver who was only carrying out the job he was paid to do. \[The offender\] took advantage of the vulnerability of \[the bus captain\] for whom the most important task was to operate the bus and ensure the safety of his passengers and other road users. In addition to this important and onerous task, \[the bus captain\] had to see to it that persons boarding the bus pay the fare. This was a difficult enough task to perform; yet \[the offender\] had not only acted dishonestly but had the temerity to carry out an act of physical violence. His offence has to be seen in this context.

> 23    People who provide public transport services perform tasks that are onerous and dangerous, particularly where they are in charge of large vehicles because the safety of a large number of persons, both in and out of the vehicle, are at stake. The law cannot and will not condone the reprehensible acts of passengers who exploit the vulnerability of public transport workers and threaten their safety and that of other passengers/commuters. The court will not hesitate to impose severe punishment to serve as a greater deterrence… This appeal is one such case in which a deterrent sentence is warranted.

53     Similarly, in _Public Prosecutor v Loh Chee Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 221</span>, the offender was charged with using criminal force against a public servant by throwing torn pieces of summons at a National Environment Agency officer. In rejecting the offender’s attempt to rely on s 95 of the Penal Code, Jasvender Kaur DJ observed at \[118\]:

>     As stated in _Veeda Menezes \[v Yusuf Khan_ AIR 1966 SC 1773\], the question \[of whether the harm caused was so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm\] cannot be ‘judged solely by the measure of physical or other injury the act causes.’ The circumstances which led to the commission of the offence and the position of the parties must be considered. In the present case, the context of the offending was against an enforcement officer who was acting in the course of his duty. He had issued a ticket against the accused for having committed an offence. The accused was aggrieved at the accusation. He showed his disdain by tearing and throwing the ticket at the face. Such an act cannot be considered trivial and go unpunished. Enforcement officers perform a difficult public duty in enforcing the law and deserve protection from the courts. The accused cannot be allowed to act with impunity for using criminal force on an enforcement officer who was acting in the discharge of his public duty. Accordingly, I found that s 95 \[of the Penal Code\] was inapplicable.

54     In the present case, the accused acted in a belligerent manner towards the police officers shortly after his arrest, and he remained largely uncooperative throughout. After he entered the police car, he made several threats to the police officers, including Sgt Lim. Such disdain towards the work of the police officers culminated in a bite to Sgt Lim’s right waist area. This bite was sufficiently forceful that it left a red mark that remained visible about two to three hours later, when Sgt Zhang took photographs of Sgt Lim’s waist, and when Sgt Lim was examined by Dr Goh. While Sgt Lim was initially intent on downplaying the incident, and although he remarked that the injury would not even show up in a medical report,[^86] such a view was not shared by his colleagues, who urged him to make a report. As it turned out, Dr Goh diagnosed Sgt Lim with a bite injury. Given the context in which the bite injury was inflicted, and judging from the reactions of Sgt Lim’s peers as well as the medical diagnosis of an injury, I was amply satisfied that this was not a case to which s 95 ought to apply. As highlighted in the above cases, public officers such as Sgt Lim perform an important public task which carry with it risks and dangers, and the law cannot condone the acts of offenders who threaten the safety of these officers. This is in particular where the offender, like the accused in this case, demonstrates conduct which show a general disregard for the authority and wellbeing of such officers.

#### Adverse inference

55     For all the foregoing reasons, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I duly convicted the accused. This was fortified by the accused’s election to remain silent, which entitled me to draw an adverse inference against him. As Ms Yap submitted in closing, the evidence adduced by the prosecution clearly demonstrated that the accused had bitten Sgt Lim at the right waist area, and the accused was the only person in the position to give evidence to explain what he was doing at the material time.[^87] Instead of doing so, the accused elected to remain silent. In my view, this failure to give any alternate explanation despite having been given the opportunity to do so meant that there was no such alternate explanation, and that the accused was guilty of the charge (see _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[82\]).

56     For completeness, while the accused alleged that he had been wrongfully arrested pursuant to s 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act, I did not find such allegations to be strictly relevant to the trial before me, which was focused on the issue of whether the accused had bitten Sgt Lim on the right waist area.

## My decision on sentence

57     The accused was convicted on 2 December 2020.[^88] Time was then given for parties to tender submissions on sentencing as, amongst other things, the accused wished to appoint counsel and to obtain a private psychiatrist report for the purposes of mitigation.[^89] Despite multiple adjournments, no private psychiatrist was eventually appointed,[^90] and the accused’s counsel was also discharged.[^91]

58     On 25 May 2021, after considering parties’ submissions, I sentenced the accused to six months’ imprisonment.

59     In imposing the sentence, I noted at the very outset that this was another case whereby hurt was caused to a police officer discharging his duty. As articulated in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) at \[48\]:

>     Police officers are often exposed to violence and aggression in their frontline duties daily. They frequently endanger their lives and risk their personal safety in the discharge of their duties to protect society by maintaining law and order. While one could argue that danger is inherent in the work of the police on the ground, surely those who preserve law and order and protect society dutifully deserve to feel assured that they will be protected adequately by the law that they uphold.

60     Thus, the sentence to be meted out had to necessarily reflect the objectives of general deterrence and retribution. I was also mindful of the sentencing framework for offences under s 332 of the Penal Code, as set out at \[59\] of _Jeffrey Yeo_:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.82%"> <col width="35.84%"> <col width="45.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing band</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to one year’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to seven years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

61     I did not think that the circumstances of the present case warranted a fine, which would only be meted out in very exceptional cases, such as where a case involving a very young offender shoving a police officer lightly in a one-off incident away from the public’s eyes or where the offender was inflicted with some form of mental disorder at the time of the incident (see \[59\] and \[67\] of _Jeffrey Yeo_). This was not the case here.

62     As stated in _Jeffrey Yeo_ at \[63\], Category 1 of the framework encompasses cases where minor injuries are caused, and the bodily harm is momentary and where the culpability is low. The range for this category would fall between two to nine months’ imprisonment. In the present case, as a result of the bite inflicted by the accused, the harm caused was mild erythema over Sgt Lim’s right flank. However, as seen from the footage from the various police officers’ body-worn cameras, the accused was engaged in a prolonged struggle with the police officers from the MRT station and persisted even after he was brought into the police car. From the objective evidence produced by the prosecution, the accused was seen making all sorts of insulting, offensive and threatening remarks to the police officers in the course of his interactions with them after he was arrested. This could be seen from his conduct at the point of arrest right to the point of the incident where the accused was seen struggling in the back seat of the police car (see \[23\]–\[25\] above). The accused clearly demonstrated contempt for the police officers and their authority which would necessarily increase his culpability.

63     Given the above circumstances, I was of the view that the indicative starting point would be slightly above the mid-point of Category 1, which would be around five to six months’ imprisonment.

64     However, I noted that the _Jeffrey Yeo_ framework was premised on offenders pleading guilty and not having any relevant criminal antecedents (_Jeffrey Yeo_ at \[61\]). While the accused was entitled to defend himself at trial, his conduct at trial evinced a lack of remorse where he has made unfounded allegations on the police officers and the Singapore Police Force (see \[19\] above). This would necessarily warrant an uplift from the starting indicative sentence as stated above.

65     That said, I was mindful of the accused’s lack of similar antecedents. I also noted the accused’s condition of Autism Spectrum Disorder, although this condition bore no contributory link to the commission of the offence before me.[^92]

66     Regard was also had to sentences meted out for similar offences after _Jeffrey Yeo_ was decided.[^93] For example, in the unreported case of _Public Prosecutor v Shaun Joshua Koh Shun Heng_ (HC/MA 9159/2019) (“_Shaun Joshua_”), the first-time offender pleaded guilty to one count under s 332 of the Penal Code for biting the forearm of the police officer while the officer tried to handcuff the offender, as well as one count under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act for repeatedly shouting in the vicinity. In that case, there was similarly no evidence that the police officer’s skin was punctured, but on appeal, the sentence was raised from four months’ to five months’ imprisonment.

67     For the present case, the accused claimed trial, which would not have afforded him the sentencing discount had he pleaded guilty. It was also similar to the case of _Shaun Joshua_, in that the injury sustained was minor. The accused in _Shaun Joshua_ had bitten the victim in the course of being arrested whereas the accused in the present case was already arrested and placed in the patrol car but nonetheless, continued to struggle, resulting in the incident in question. An uplift from the sentence of five months would thus be necessary. That said, I also noted that the bite took place in the police car, which did not occur in the public view.

68     I did not find the case of _Public Prosecutor v Wan Li_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 1</span> (“_Wan Li_”), which was tendered by the accused, to be analogous to the present case. In my view, _Wan Li_ could be distinguished as the offender in that case was still in a confused state of mind over his failed mission of touring Singapore. He was also a foreigner who was new to Singapore, and was in an unfamiliar setting while he was being restrained at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for further medical assessment (see \[25\] of _Wan Li_). These unique factors were clearly not present here.

69     The accused was also remanded at the IMH from 18 December 2018 to 2 January 2019. Having regard to all of the above, I determined that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment to be fair and just in the circumstances.

## Conclusion

70     For the reasons above, I convicted the accused of one charge after trial, and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment. The sentence has been stayed and he remains on bail pending the outcome of his appeal against my decision.
