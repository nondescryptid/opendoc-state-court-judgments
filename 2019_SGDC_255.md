They agreed to use a traffic light along Lim Chu Kang Road towards the direction of Jalan Bahar, at the junction of Old Lim Chu Kang Road, as the starting point of the race. They then moved off from a stationary position.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 At about 12.26 am on 9 July 2017, both motor cars, SKB203R and SKS775S, made an illegal U-turn near lamp post 154F after the junction of Old Lim Chu Kang Road into the direction of Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 Following that, both vehicles drove abreast with each other on their respective lanes, towards the junction of Old Lim Chu Kang Road. Moments later, a single horn sounded as they passed the traffic junction marked by a traffic light that they had agreed earlier to be the starting point. Both vehicles then started to accelerate vigorously within their respective lanes and sped off at high speed. The vehicles were accelerating vigorously as the accused persons attempted to overtake each other to gain a lead in the race.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 While both cars were accelerating at fast speed, the speed of the accused’s motor car SKB203R was registered at 177 kmph and the speed of Wan’s motor car SKS775S was registered at 179 kmph.

## Affidavit of Appellant

7       The Appellant filed an affidavit to oppose the forfeiture application. I was of the view that the affidavit did not make out a case for the non-forfeiture of the vehicle at all. The Appellant claimed that he was confused and ill advised by his lawyer to plead guilty. He also alleged that when he pleaded guilty he was under duress because of his personal and family circumstances.

8       With due respect, these were bare allegations and not relevant to the application made by the Prosecution. Accordingly, I did not find the affidavit of any value.

## The Applicable Law

9       The applicable law is set out in section 117 RTA. The relevant provision is set out below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Court to order forfeiture of vehicle</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>117.</b>—(1) Where it is proved to the satisfaction of a court that a vehicle has been used in the commission of an offence under section&nbsp;116(7), and that the vehicle has been seized by the police, the court shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(2) An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under this section may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under section&nbsp;116(7) has been or will be held.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## My Findings

10     I was of the view that the provision of section 117 (1) RTA has been satisfied.

11     The Accused had admitted that on 9 July 2017, he and the co-accused, one Wan Tat Mun, had participated in a race with their respective cars, bearing registration number SKB203R and SKS775S, along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar. Consequently, the Police seized both their respective vehicles. In the circumstances, I held that the Appellant had used his vehicle bearing registration number SKB203R in the commission of the offence under section 116(7) RTA.

## Conclusion

12     Accordingly, upon the application of the Public Prosecutor, I ordered the forfeiture of the motor car bearing registration number SKB203R to the State.
