### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

## GROUNDS OF DECISION

This case concerns the prosecution of the sole proprietor of Double Ace Associates (“DAA”), who, not being a qualified person under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161)(“LPA”), ran a debt collection agency which had held itself out to be “legal consultants” and had threatened legal proceedings in letters sent to 387 alleged debtors on behalf of its clients. DAA had also held itself out as an “LLP” in these letters, despite not being registered as a Limited Liability Partnership.

2       The prosecution proceeded against the accused on 1,143 charges for breaches under the LPA and the Limited Liability Partnership Act (Cap 163A) (“LLPA”). The accused pleaded guilty to 20 charges each for falsely implying that DAA was duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate or solicitor, for threatening legal proceedings without stating that the matter would be handed to a solicitor for legal proceedings, and for incorrectly holding out that DAA was registered as a limited liability partnership. The remaining 1,083 charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was sentenced to a global term of 30 weeks’ imprisonment, and a fine of $80,000 (in default of which he would serve an additional 20 weeks and 60 days of imprisonment). He filed his appeal immediately upon sentencing and has been released on bail pending appeal.

### The Charges

3       The 1,143 charges which the prosecution proceeded with were fairly evenly split between two offences under the LPA, and one offence LLPA. For ease of reference, the offence-creating provisions are reproduced as follows:

> **Section 33(1)(b) of the LPA**

> Any unauthorised person who … (b) wilfully or falsely pretends to be, or takes or uses any name, title, addition or description implying that he is duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate or a solicitor, or that he is recognised by law as so qualified or authorised, shall be guilty of an offence ...

> **Section 33(2)(d) of the LPA**

> (2)    Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), any unauthorised person who, directly or indirectly … (d) on behalf of a claimant or a person alleging himself to have a claim to a legal right writes, publishes or sends a letter or notice threatening legal proceedings other than a letter or notice that the matter will be handed to a solicitor for legal proceedings … shall, unless he proves that the act was not done for or in expectation of any fee, gain or reward, be guilty of an offence.

> **Section 39 of the LLPA**

> If any person in any way holds out that a business is registered as a limited liability partnership under this Act, that person shall, unless at that time the business was duly registered as a limited liability partnership under this Act, be guilty of an offence …

4       The proceeded charges, as well as the sentences awarded by the court for each charge, are detailed as follows:

### Statement of Facts

5       The accused is a 52 year-old male Singaporean. At the time of all the offences, he was the sole proprietor of Double Ace Associates (“DAA”). DAA’s business profile lists its main business activity as “debt collection services”.

6       The accused did not, at any point in time, have in force a practicing certificate or have his name listed on the Roll of the Supreme Court of Singapore. He was therefore an “unauthorized person” within the meaning of Section 32(2) of the LPA at all material times.

7       The matter came to light when the Law Society of Singapore made two complaints to the Attorney-General’s Chambers. The first complaint related to a letter of demand (“LOD”) received by one Woon Yeok Ying (“Woon”) dated 22 July 2014. After seeking legal advice, Woon’s lawyer lodged a complaint with the Law Society, and on 21 October 2014, the Law Society referred the matter to the Attorney General’s Chambers. The second complaint related to an LOD from DAA received by one Sagayammal d/o Lorosamy (“Mdm Sagayammal”) on or about 28 June 2015. Mdm Sagayammal wrote a letter of complaint to the Law Society, and on 19 August 2015, the Law Society wrote a second letter referring the matter to the Attorney-General’s Chambers. Following the two complaints, the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force carried out investigations into DAA.

#### Background Facts

8       As the sole proprietor of DAA, the accused was in charge of running the business and making all major decisions for and on behalf of DAA. The accused had around 12 employees working for him at the material time. All employees acted on instructions from the accused in carrying out their duties.

9       The accused had been a debt-collector for about 20 years. As part of his business model, he had taken on “clients” who sought to have their debtors repay their debts. The accused would first ascertain the details of his clients’ cases. Once both parties agreed that DAA’s services were to be utilised, the accused would have his clients sign a “letter of authorisation”. This letter authorised DAA to collect debts on behalf of the said client. The said letter would be acknowledged by a DAA representative/employee. In addition, the client would also sign a “subscription agreement”.

10     One such client was Lion Credit Pte Ltd (“**Lion Credit**”), which is referred to in 19 out of the 20 LODs which form the subject matter of the proceeded charges. In the subscription agreement, it was specified that a “collection commission” of 30% of the value of the recovered debt was payable to DAA if it was able to recover the debt, whether in whole or in part, from Lion Credit’s alleged debtors. No service fee was payable by Lion Credit because it had referred a lot of clients to DAA.

11     The remaining client referred to in one of the LODs which form the subject matter of the proceeded charges is one Ong Bee Leng (“**Ong**”). In the subscription agreement, it was specified that Ong would pay a “service fee” of $500, which was meant to cover DAA’s transport and other expenses incurred in carrying out its debt-collection activities. In addition, should DAA successfully recover the debt (whether in whole or in part) from the alleged debtor, a 30% commission was payable to DAA by Ong.

#### Facts Pertaining to the Sixty Proceeded Charges

12     The accused sent LODs to all alleged debtors of his clients as part of his debt collection business. He had obtained the template for these LODs from the internet, and had made some modifications to it to suit his purposes. The accused also managed to obtain copies of actual LODs sent out by various law firms, and had made further amendments to the format and contents of DAA’s LOD template by reference to those law firms’ letters of demand. The accused then instructed all his employees to use this standard format to send all of DAA’s LODs to the alleged debtors of their clients.

13     The 20 LODs which form the subject matter of the 60 proceeded charges were dated from 14 October 2013 to 7 September 2015 (“the offending period”). The accused sent or gave instructions to send these 20 LODs, and all 20 LODs were either posted or despatched by hand to their respective recipients. Copies of the 20 LODs were provided as Annexes 1 to 20 to the Statement of Facts.

#### Offences under s 33(2)(d) of the LPA – Threatening Legal Proceedings Without Stating that the Matter would be Handed to a Solicitor for Legal Proceedings

14     In each of the 20 LODs, the template which the accused used stated that DAA:

> (a)     “acted for \[name of client\]”;

> (b)     was “instructed” that there was “due and owing” from the recipient to the client a sum of money \[the relevant amount would be stated\];

> (c)     asked the recipient to make “FULL payment” of the amount stated in the LOD “within SEVEN DAYS”; and

> (d)     stated that the recipient “must pay” the full outstanding amount to “_avoid legal action from being taken by our client_” \[emphasis added\].

15     None of the LODs contained any statement that stated, either explicitly or implicitly, that the matter would be referred to a solicitor for legal proceedings.

16     The accused had sent or instructed the sending of these LODs in expectation of a 30% commission of the value of the recovered debt from either Lion Credit or Ong. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had thereby committed 20 offences under s. 33(2)(d) LPA, punishable under s. 33(5) LPA.

#### Offences under s. 33(1)(b) of the LPA – Falsely Implying that DAA was duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate or solicitor

17     In each of the 20 LODs referred to at \[23\] above, the letterhead featured the words “_Legal Consultants_” immediately under the words “_Double Ace Associates LLP_”. The term “consultant” is a protected title under s 75D of the LPA. This section prohibits any solicitor from using the title “consultant” unless he fulfils one of the requirements under s 75D(1)(a) to s 75D(1)(d) of the LPA for an aggregate period of not less than 10 years. The accused fulfilled none of the requirements in s. 75D LPA. DAA also did not employ any lawyers nor any in-house counsel during the period of the offences.

18     By using the term “_Legal Consultants_” in the letterhead of DAA’s LODs, the accused used a title that clearly implied that he, or DAA, was a lawyer (i.e., duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate and solicitor). In particular, Mdm Sagayammal had been misled by the term “_Legal Consultants_” in the letterhead of the LOD that she had received into thinking that DAA was a law firm and that Lion Credit had engaged a lawyer to make a claim for the monies she owed to Lion Credit. She had mistakenly thought that DAA, as Lion Credit’s lawyer, would sue her in Court.

19     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had thereby committed 20 offences punishable under s. 33(1)(b) of the LPA.

#### Offences under s 39 of the LLPA - Holding out that DAA was Registered as a Limited Liability Partnership

20     The 20 LODs in the proceeded charges bore the acronym “LLP” in their letterheads. By instructing his staff to prepare LODs using a letterhead with the term “LLP” next to DAA’s corporate name, the accused had thereby held out to the recipients of the LODs that DAA was duly registered as a Limited Liability Partnership under the LLPA.

21     However, DAA was not registered as an LLP at any point in time during the offence period, and the accused was fully aware of this fact at all times. In fact, the accused knew that DAA had applied to be registered as an LLP with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, but that the registration process had not been completed. Despite this, the accused deliberately used or instructed his employees to use LODs with “LLP” in their letterheads.

22     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had thereby committed 20 offences punishable under s. 39 LLPA.

### Antecedents

23     The accused is traced, albeit for unrelated offences of criminal trespass, cheating, criminal breach of trust and drunk driving, for which he had been sentenced to fines, as well as having been disqualified from driving in the case of the latter offence. He had also been sent to a drug rehabilitation centre and placed under drug supervision for two instances of drug consumption.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

24     The prosecution highlighted that the integrity of the legal profession and the registration of LLPs was at stake, and sought a global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment and a fine of $80,000 to reflect the gravity of the offence and to serve as a suitable deterrent to other other like-minded offenders.

25     In support of its proposed sentence, the prosecution raised the following arguments:

> (a)      **The accused exploited the public’s perception that lawyers belong to an honourable profession**, and that its members would not make improper or frivolous demands for repayment or threaten legal action without any basis. The accused exploited this public perception to lend weight and credibility to his letters of demand, which misled the recipients into thinking that these were legitimate demands for payment brought by lawyers acting for their clients, and that the consequence of non-payment would be that a lawsuit was pending. Should such illicit threats become rampant, they would affect confidence in the legal profession and the rule of law. Further, the accused misused the term “Legal Consultants”, which was reserved for solicitors of more than ten years’ standing. The implications on the reputation and integrity of the legal profession would be even graver than if DAA had simply represented itself to be “advocates and solicitors”.

> (b)      **The accused was motivated by self-interest in carrying out the offences.** The accused stood to receive a hefty commission of 30% of the recovered debt from each alleged debtor, against the negligible cost of sending out the LODs. His was a calculated business model of sending out as many as possible of these illicit LODs that masqueraded as lawyers’ letters, to increase his success at recovery from debtors who were none the wiser. The prosecution submitted that where the accused was motivated by self-interest and greed, he should receive little sympathy from the Court in sentencing (per _Zhao Zhipeng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 879</span>, at \[37\]).

> (c)      **Specific deterrence**. As the accused offended over a long period, he manifests as a habitual offender (see _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[43\]) who was purposeful and calculated. Accordingly, the sentence must be sufficient to deter future offending on his part. This was especially since he had had a long string of criminal antecedents, which, while not antecedents under the LPA or LLPA, were relevant to demonstrate his perpetual and flagrant disregard for the law.

> (d)      **The duration and extent of the authorised acts.** The offences were carried out over a prolonged period of almost two years from 14 October 2013 to 7 September 2015. The extent of the unauthorised acts was also vast – the accused was responsible for 398 letters being sent to 387 members of public in total.

#### Offences under Section 33(1)(b) of the LPA - Falsely Implying that DAA was duly qualified or authorised to act as an advocate or solicitor

26     With regard to the calibration of the sentence under s 33(1)(b) of the LPA, the prosecution submitted that as a starting point, a custodial sentence should be the default punishment. Notably, in _PP v Mahadevan_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 129</span>, the district court held at \[21\] that:

> \[S\]ave for exceptional cases, unauthorised persons who deliberately and repeatedly act as an advocate and solicitor in contravention of the Act to obtain a pecuniary gain should be visited with an immediate custodial sentence.

27     While there were no precedents that were on all fours with the present case, the prosecution highlighted four cases for consideration by the court.

28     The first two cases involved lawyers who continued to act and hold themselves out to be authorised persons even though they did not possess valid practising certificates at the relevant time. In _PP v Mahadevan_, the accused was a member of the bar who did not renew his practising certificate, but continued to represent clients in proceedings before the then Subordinate Courts, filing documents in the Courts and visiting his “clients” in remand. In particular, he had also sent letters using letterheads which bore the description “Advocates & Solicitors”, for which he faced charges under Section 33(1)(b). He did this over a period of 18 months. He pleaded guilty to 49 offences, comprising 33 offences under Section 33(1)(a) and 16 offences under Section 33(1)(b)). These included 32 new cases that he had taken, for which he had collected a total of $119,485 in fees. He was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for each of the Section 33(1)(b) offences, and a global term of eight months’ imprisonment.

29     Similarly, in _PP v Bhaskaran Shamkumar_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 147</span> (“_Bhaskaran_”) the accused was a member of the bar who did not renew his practicing certificate. He continued to act as an advocate and solicitor in relation to two cases for a period of around five months, preparing documents and attending court hearings. Notably, the accused paid back the fees that he had collected from his clients. He pleaded guilty to two charges under s 33(1)(a) of the LPA (with a further charge under s 33(1)(a) and two charges under s 33(1)(b) taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing), for which he was sentenced to one months’ imprisonment per charge (to run concurrently).

30     Two other cases involving non-lawyers were cited by the prosecution. In _PP v Leong Tuck Hin_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 169</span>, the accused had a law degree but was not a qualified person. When two of his business associates were requested by the police to assist in investigations, they approached him to ask for his help to write a letter of representation to the police on their behalf. The accused agreed, and described himself as “Solicitor of England and Wales” and “Legal Consultant” in the letter of representation that he wrote to police on behalf of his two business associates. He did not receive any monetary gain as he was doing his business associates a favour. He pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 33(1)(b) of the LPA, and was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment.

31     In _PP v Keith Thaddeus Kamal Tsukada_ (MSC 900622/2017 and others, unreported), the accused employed descriptions on the website of his consultancy firm which implied that it was qualified to act as a solicitor when in fact it was not. There was no evidence before the Court as to the reach of the website and indeed whether any members of the public had read the descriptions on the website or engaged the services of the accused’s firm as a result. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine of $6,000 for a single charge under Section 33(1)(b) of the LPA.

32     Having cited these precedents, the prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence for each s 33(1)(b) LPA charge in this case should be a higher sentence of two months’ imprisonment, with four sentences running consecutively for a total custodial term of eight months. Their reasons were as follows:

> (a)     For the cases involving qualified lawyers, the sole culpability of the lawyers was their failure to renew their practising certificates. In both _Mahadevan_ and _Bhaskaran_, it was undisputed that the offenders had the necessary legal qualification and skills to provide the legal services to their clients. There was no suggestion that they had rendered wrong or inaccurate advice, or had caused any loss or damage to their clients as a result of the unauthorised acts. Even then, significant custodial sentences were imposed on them. It follows, _a fortiori_, that an offender who was never legally trained or qualified at all, and had exploited the reputation of the legal profession as part of a business model over a sustained period for personal gain, deserved a heightened deterrent sentence.

> (b)     In _PP v Leong Tuck Hin_ , where the accused was not a qualified lawyer, a custodial sentence was given even though the accused was untraced, faced only one charge under s 33(1)(b) for a single instance of offending, and derived no monetary benefit from his act. The prosecution submitted that this reinforced the severity of sentences under s 33(1), and the Court’s appreciation of the strong public interest considerations behind the provision.

> (c)     The case of _PP v Keith Thaddeus_, where the non-lawyer accused was sentenced to a fine of $6,000 for a single charge under s 33(1)(b) of the LPA, could be distinguished as there was no evidence of the reach of the website where the representation was made, and no indication whether any members of public had read the descriptions on the website or engaged the services of the accused’s firm as a result.

33     By comparison, the prosecution submitted that the present case was of a totally different scale, involving a large number of letters, received by close to 400 members, all of whom were targeted to pressure them to pay up on their alleged debts. The offending behaviour also went on for close to two years, as compared to isolated instances of offending in _Leong Tuck Hin_ and _Keith Thaddeus_, which demonstrated the accused’s recalcitrance and utter disregard of the law. The accused was also clearly motivated by monetary gain given the commission arrangement in this case. Given these aggravating factors, the prosecution accordingly submitted for an uplift to two months’ imprisonment for each charge under s 33(1)(b) of the LPA.

#### Offences under Section 33(2)(d) of the LPA - Threatening Legal Proceedings Without Stating that the Matter would be Handed to a Solicitor for Legal Proceedings

34     In the case of _Keith Thaddeus_, the offender had also sent letters on behalf of his clients demanding payment from the clients’ debtors and threatening legal proceedings. He had pleaded guilty to two s 33(2)(d) LPA charges, amongst other offences, and was sentenced to a $5,000 fine for each charge. The prosecution pointed out that the scale of offending in the present case was much greater than that in _Keith Thaddeus_’s case, where only two letters of demand were sent. However, given the large number of proceeded charges in the present case, and bearing in mind the totality principle and the need to avoid a crushing sentence, the prosecution submitted for a **$3,000 fine** for each charge under s 33(2)(d).

#### Offences under Section 39 of the LLPA - Holding out that DAA was Registered as a Limited Liability Partnership

35     While there were no precedents for offences under s 39 of the LLPA, the closest analogy drawn by the prosecution was to s 35 of the Business Names Registration Act 2014 for carrying on a business without registration or under a business name that is different from the registered business name. This offence carries the same maximum penalty as Section 39 LLPA, i.e. a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding two years. It was submitted that previous offences under this section had seen fines between $800 to $2,000 or a custodial term of one month being imposed:

> (a)     In _PP v Ng Chee Yeow_ (SC 020633-06), the accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 27(a) of the Business Registration Act (“BRA”) (the pre-cursor to s 35 of the BNRA). He was untraced. He received a $800 fine (in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment).

> (b)     In _PP v Gary Lee Yak Kwang_ (SC 019787-06), the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of s 27(a) BRA. He was traced for theft. He received a fine of $2,000 (in default four weeks’ imprisonment).

> (c)     In _PP v Lim Tian Pong_ (DAC 037677-2010 & Ors), the accused pleaded guilty to 1 charge of s 27(a) BRA among other offences. He was untraced. He received one months’ imprisonment for the s 27(a) BRA charge.

36     In the circumstances, and bearing in mind the number of proceeded charges, it was submitted that a fine of $1,000 per charge would suffice to protect the integrity of the LLP registration regime.

37     Accordingly, the final position proposed by the prosecution was for a global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment, and a fine of $80,000.

### Mitigation Plea

38     The defence sought to persuade the court to impose a global fine of no more than $120,000 for all the offences, namely:

> (a)     $3,500 for each charge under s 33(1)(b) of the LPA (amounting to a total of $70,000);

> (b)     $1,500 for each charge under s 33(2)(d) of the LPA (amounting to a total of $30,000); and

> (c)     $1,000 for each charge under s 39 of the LLPA (amounting to a total of $20,000).

39     Both sides were therefore _ad idem_ on the penalty under s 39 of the LLPA.

40     The defence highlighted that the accused was 52 years old, and was married with three children. He had little formal education, having left school after failing his “N”-level examinations.

41     The defence maintained that these were strict liability offences, and that the accused was only aware that he had contravened the law when investigations were commenced in 2015, and had removed the offending words thereafter, and had also registered DAA as a private limited company (DAA Pte Ltd). It was explained that the intention had been that if legal action was to be taken, DAA would hand cases over to their lawyers, S K Kumar Law Practice LLP, which would then follow up by contacting debtors directly on DAA’s behalf. It was also submitted that in other respects, the LODs were compliant with the requirements under the Credit Collection Association of Singapore (CCAS) Code of Conduct and Practice (the CCAS Code), even though DAA was not a a CCAS member. In particular, it was noted that doorstep debt collection visits were permitted by the CCAS under clause 4(c) of the Code.

42     With regard to the offence under s 33(1)(b), the defence submitted that it is necessary to consider where this case lies along the sentencing continuum for LPA s 33(1) offences (per _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span>, at \[33\]). It was highlighted that the primary mischief being targeted by s 33(1) was the peddling of legal services by unauthorised persons, and that offences such as s 33(1)(a) involving a person acting as an advocate or solicitor or an agent for any party to proceedings, or who performs certain proscribed legal services, would involve a far greater degree of harm and culpability. It was then submitted that a fine would be sufficient in this case to have a deterrent effect.

43     The defence proposed that as far as offence-specific factors were concerned, the offences in this case involved low harm and low to medium culpability. The primary submission for this position was that the accused did not actually provide legal services or done legal work, and that no misrepresentation had been made to public institutions or the general public. It was further submitted that the victims suffered no consequential risk, harm or loss, as they were already indebted to DAA’s clients and remained so regardless of the accused’s representation. Further, as far as offence-specific factors were concerned, the defence advanced the position that the offences were committed negligently and not deliberately insofar as they were adaptations of templates without thought of the permissibility of doing so, and that there was no malicious intent to harm or injure the victims.

44     The defence also highlighted two further precedents under s 33(1) where only fines had been awarded:

> (a)      _PP v Selena Choong Chin May_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 268</span>_._ The offender had handed to the victim a name card purporting to be an “Advocate & Solicitor”, and rendered advice about a divorce matter. She was fined $6,000, in default six weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)      _PP v Jasvendar Kaur d/o Avtar Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 216</span>. The offender had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 33(1)(a) for acting as an advocate or solicitor by attending a pre-trial conference, and three s 33(1)(b) charges for using the title “Advocates & Solicitors” in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Manpower. She was fined $1,000 for each of the four charges.

45     For these reasons, the defence proposed that the starting point should be $10,000 for each charge under s 33(1)(b).

46     As regards the s 33(2)(d) offence of threatening legal proceedings, the defence claimed that the accused did not know that threatening legal proceedings without stating that they would be handed to a solicitor constituted an offence. It was suggested by the defence that fines of between $5,000 to $10,000 should be reserved for cases involving either moderate harm or medium culpability, and that in this case, for the reasons they had cited earlier, the appropriate starting point for a fine would be $3,000.

47     Finally, it was highlighted that the accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty timeously, and had cooperated fully with the authorities and removed the offending words once he was investigated against. It was also suggested that the totality of fines would be crushing. Accordingly, the defence proposed an adjustment downward to fines of $3,500 per charge under s 33(1)(b) and $1,500 per charge under s 33(2)(d). As they were in agreement with the prosecution on a fine of $1,000 for the LLPA charge, the total fine would then amount to $120,000.

### The Sentence

48     This is a case where the protection of the public and the integrity and reputation of the legal profession are at stake. The primary sentencing consideration should be that of general deterrence, to ensure that public confidence in the legal profession is not undermined by those who would sully its good name.

49     By holding himself out as a legal consultant in nearly 400 LODs sent out to debtors, the accused had misused the title to apply improper pressure on the debtor in two ways. First, he would have led the debtor to believe that the matter had undergone legal assessment by a qualified practitioner, who had duly applied the requisite knowledge and skill to the merits of the case, and that there was indeed sufficient legal merit to the matter to warrant legal action. Second, the representation suggested that the creditor had secured legal representation and was fully prepared to pursue the debt via legal means. The use of a legal letterhead was clearly intended as a scare tactic, to create a misapprehension in the mind of the debtor that the demand carried with it the weight of professional advice, as well as the preparatory intent for legal action.

50     I pause at this juncture to note that DAA appears to be no stranger to the application of such improper pressure in its debt recovery efforts. A quick reference to previously decided cases involving the employees and agents of DAA reveal convictions for illegal assemblies which employed tactics designed to harass debtors into paying up on their debts (see _PP v Chew Keng Leng, Andra_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 30</span>, _PP v Tan David_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 32</span>, _PP v Tang Wei Leong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 33</span>, _PP v Yong Chee Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 36</span> and _PP v Nigel Teo Chun Min & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 53</span>). While I am cautious to note that the accused was not convicted in these cases, and that they therefore carry no value as antecedents to the present matter, they provide important context to the arsenal of tactics employed by DAA and the effect that their LODs would have on members of the public. To my mind, the LODs in this case cannot just be viewed in isolation, but in the context of a firm whose reputation and practices often struck fear in the hearts of would-be debtors.

51     The harm occasioned by the LODs does not end there. At a broader level, the actions of the accused have impugned the integrity and efficacy of the legal profession. A member of public should be entitled to assume that the holder of the title of an advocate and solicitor possesses the requisite qualifications to practice, and would act in accordance with the ethical and legal duties that apply to the profession. It would be entirely undesirable if it came to a point where a lay person would have to peruse the rolls or to check with the Law Society to verify a lawyer’s right to practice whenever a legal letter is received. If not sternly addressed, such audacious pretenders would undermine the good name and efficacy of the profession as a whole. The fact that the accused employed the term “Legal Consultants”, which conveyed the impression that he was a senior solicitor of more than ten years’ standing, only served to exacerbate the impact of his wrongdoing.

52     As acknowledged by the prosecution, there is a lack of direct authority on the appropriate sentence to be given to a non-practitioner who falsely holds out that he has a right to practice. In seeking to dissuade the court from imposing a custodial sentence, the defence sought to adduce a sentencing framework and persuade the court that the accused should be considered to have caused low harm and to have a low to moderate level of culpability, which merited a fine only within that framework. Having considered arguments from both sides about this framework, I would decline to comment upon or rely on it in this case, as I was concerned that there were insufficient precedents necessary to support such an analysis.

53     I have however distilled from the defence’s submissions two essential arguments that they had advanced in support of a non-custodial sentence. The first is that cases involving lawyers who no longer hold practising certificates are more serious, as such offenders had flagrantly breached the ethical and legal requirements of their own profession, and that custodial sentences should be reserved only for such instances. While I take the point that these cases are serious in their own right, I do not agree that the cases involving non-practitioners are any less serious by comparison. If at all, the potential harm is far greater when persons who are completely unqualified to practice hold themselves out as being able to do so. The dent to public confidence would be greater if the abuse of the title was committed by a complete charlatan, as opposed to a lawyer who had simply failed to renew his practicing certificate. Further, as pointed out by the prosecution, custodial sentences had been imposed both in cases involving ex-practitioners (one month per charge in both _PP v Mahadevan_ and _PP v Bhaskaran Shamkumar_), as well as in the case of a non-practitioner (three weeks’ imprisonment for a single charge in _PP v Leong Tuck Hin_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 169</span>). The sentence of imprisonment is therefore not restricted to offences by ex-practitioners alone.

54     I turn next to the second argument advanced by the defence. This argument seeks to downplay the accused’s culpability within the continuum of offending activity envisaged under s 33(1), on the basis that the accused’s actions did not go so far as to render advice or perform professional work, and that custodial sentences should be reserved only for offenders who go to such an extent. Put another way, the defence sought to persuade the court that the offence under s 33(1)(a) (acting as an advocate or solicitor generally, and also specifically by taking steps in any court proceedings) should attract custodial sentences, and that the offence of holding out under s 33(1)(b) should not.

55     I considered but declined to follow this argument. Had Parliament intended to limit sentencing options in such manner, it would have specifically limited the custodial term to the first limb of s 33(1). To my mind, the level of harm caused is not indicated by the extent or nature of the activity alone. The culpability involved in an act of holding oneself out as a lawyer depends on the contextual facts and the degree of misapprehension caused in the mind of the beholder. A braggadocio who seeks to impress in casual conversation by falsely assuming the mantle of a lawyer would be treated quite differently from one who sought to use it as leverage to compel the recipient to settle a debt. The scale and systemic nature of offending would also operate to magnify the degree of culpability. In the present case, the accused misled 387 debtors in 398 letters. This clearly involves a far greater degree of wrongdoing than if the accused had rendered advice to a single client. Indeed, the scale and magnitude of the deception far outweighs that in any reported case thus far under s 33(1)(b). I would further add that the significant profit involved would be another clear aggravating factor. From the sums that are claimed in the LODs, the potential profit of 30 percent of the recovered debt would clearly exceed any fine can be imposed for the offences. This is perhaps the strongest argument in favour of imposing a custodial sentence, as fines would be a poor deterrent in the face of such huge potential profit.

56     Turning to offender-specific factors, I did take note of the fact that the accused had entered a plea of guilt. However, I did not find this particularly significant to sentencing, given the fairly indisputable nature of the offences, and the fact that the plea of guilt was not particularly timeous (it occurred after trial dates had been fixed). Apart from this factor, I did not agree with the defence that there were other factors with mitigating value. While there was no admission of a deliberate intent to mislead, I did not agree with the defence’s characterisation of the act as a negligent one. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and insofar as the act of copying the template and applying it to the letterhead, as well as drafting the language of the letters was concerned, these acts were clearly deliberate and admitted to in the Statement of Facts. There is also no doubt that the acts were expressly intended to pressurise debtors into paying up. Accordingly, I would disagree with the defence’s characterisation of the accused as a law abiding businessman who unwittingly committed the offences out of negligence.

57     The fact that the offending activity had continued over the course of nearly two years also demonstrates a continued and flagrant disregard for the law on the part of the accused. The accused’s criminal history, while not directly relevant as it involves dissimilar offences, corroborates the impression that the accused is prepared to break the law for personal gain. It was noted by the High Court in _Tan Kay Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 117</span> that dissimilar antecedents could be relevant in certain circumstances, per VK Rajah J (as he then was) at \[16\]:

> It is important to note that this is not to say that dissimilar antecedents can never be a relevant sentencing consideration. For instance, dissimilar antecedents that clearly manifest a marked and progressive proclivity towards criminal activity or a cavalier disregard for the law could be relevant.

58     To my mind, the sheer scale and duration of offending, coupled with the accused’s own chequered history of criminal trespass, cheating and criminal breach of trust, reveals a person who has no qualms about breaking the law for personal gain. I would agree with the prosecution that from the point of view of specific deterrence, the sentence must sufficiently impress in the mind of the accused that he cannot simply flout the law for profit.

59     Given the presence of these aggravating factors, I considered an uplift from one month’s imprisonment (imposed in the cases of _PP v Mahadevan_ and _PP v Bhaskaran Shamkumar_) to a term of six weeks to be appropriate. I would add that as the maximum term of imprisonment is six months, the imposition of six weeks is fairly reflective of the culpability of the accused in the continuum of offending activity envisaged under s 33(1)(a) and (b), and provides more than sufficient headroom for more serious offenders. As 20 charges were proceeded with, and given the sheer number of charges involved in the case, I considered it appropriate to run five such charges consecutively. This would yield a global sentence of 30 weeks’ imprisonment, equivalent to slightly over seven months’ duration, which is slightly less than the eight month term requested for by the prosecution. It is also slightly less than the global sentence of eight months that was imposed in the case of _PP v Mahadevan_.

60     Turning to the offence of threatening legal proceedings under s 33(2)(d), the maximum penalty for which is a fine of $10,000, I found the prosecution’s position of a fine of $3,000 to be reasonable in view of the totality principle. The reduction from the $5,000 fine imposed in the case of _Keith Thaddeus_ is fair given that there are twenty charges proceeded with in this case.

61     I accordingly sentenced the accused to six weeks’ imprisonment on each s 33(1)(b) charge, with five sentences to run consecutively, for a total term of imprisonment of 30 weeks. He was fined $3,000 for each s 33(2)(d) charge, in default of which he would serve one week’s imprisonment per charge, as well as a fine of $1,000 on each of the LLPA charges, in default of which he would serve three days’ imprisonment per charge. The accused is on bail pending appeal.
