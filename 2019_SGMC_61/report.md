### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       Mr Ng Choon Peng, currently 62 years of age, was a Grab driver. On the morning of 7 August 2018 at about 6.40 am, he was on the way to pick up a passenger. At Telok Blangah Crescent, he executed a right turn into the entrance of the carpark at Block 14. He failed to keep a proper lookout, and his car hit an 87-year-old woman (the “**victim**”) who was crossing the lane. The accident was recorded on the in-car camera of the defendant’s vehicle. After the accident the defendant alighted from the vehicle to render assistance to the victim. He called the police hotline to inform that his car had “hit an old lady” and to request for an ambulance. The victim was subsequently conveyed to a hospital. She was found to have sustained a fracture on her right shinbone (right tibia plateau fracture) and on her spine (an L2 compression fracture).

2       The defendant was charged with causing grievous hurt by doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life, an offence under s 338(_b_) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”). He was unrepresented, and he claimed trial to the charge. In his defence, he maintained that his car had not hit the victim, and that he had managed to brake in time to avoid colliding into her. At the conclusion of the trial he was found guilty and convicted on the charge.

3       On 17 July 2019, he was sentenced to 10 days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 24 months with effect from the date of his release. The start of his sentence was deferred to 1 August 2019 to enable him to attend to some personal matters. On 24 July 2019, he filed the present appeal against his conviction, sentence and order of disqualification. He is on bail pending the appeal.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charge

5       The charge against the defendant read as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 7 August 2018 at or around 6.40am, being the driver of motor car SLS2016A, at Block 14 Telok Blangah Crescent Carpark Entrance, Singapore, did cause grievous hurt to one Tan Chwee Gim (female / 87 years old), who was a pedestrian, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout when making a right turn into the said carpark entrance, thereby colliding into the said Tan Chwee Gim, who was walking across the said carpark entrance from your left to right side, thereby causing her to sustain right tibia plateau fracture and L2 compression fracture, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

6       Section 338(b) of the Penal Code provides:

> Whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act _so_ rashly or _negligently as to endanger human life_ or the personal safety of others, shall be punished – \[...\] (b) in the case of a negligent act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

#### Prosecution’s case

#### (a)   Recording from in-car camera showed car hitting victim

7       A recording from the defendant’s in-car camera was tendered in evidence by the prosecution (Exh P2). It showed that as the car made the right turn towards the entrance of the carpark, the victim came into view in front of the car. She was walking across the lane from the left to the right. She was _more than halfway across_ the lane. As the front of the car approached the victim, her right side was facing the car. Suddenly, her upper body was thrust towards the bonnet, and she quickly fell backwards onto the ground. A loud thud could be heard.

8       The footage went on to show that the defendant alighted from the car and moved towards the victim to assist her. The victim reached her hands out for assistance. The defendant lifted her up and carried her towards the sidewalk on the left side of the lane. As they approached the sidewalk, he stumbled and fell while carrying the victim, and the victim landed on her _back_.

#### (b)   Defendant reported that his car had “hit” the victim

9       Subsequently, the defendant called the police hotline to report the incident. This first information report (Exh P1 the “**FIR**”) was made at about 7.03 am. The text of the message of the FIR read, “My car hit an old lady. Required ambulance.”

10     The investigation officer, Sergeant Ivan Ho Jiekang (PW1, the “**IO**”), testified[^1] that, based on his investigations, including what the defendant had informed him, the accident had happened about 15 to 20 minutes before the time of the FIR. He placed the time of the accident at about 6.40 am.[^2] (This timing, as stated in the charge, was not disputed by the defendant.)

#### (c)   Medical evidence consistent with traffic accident

11     The victim was conveyed to the Accident & Emergency Department of the Singapore General Hospital. She was examined by Dr Tan Tze Sheng Edwin (PW2, “**Dr Tan**”), a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Dr Tan prepared a medical report dated 28 August 2018 in response to some questions asked by the IO (Exh P3). The medical report stated that the injuries suffered by the victim included a _right tibia plateau fracture_ and an _L2 compression fracture_,[^3] which were consistent with the history of a road traffic accident.

12     Dr Tan gave testimony in court concerning the injuries.[^4] Having viewed the footage from the in-car camera, Dr Tan opined with “a high level of confidence” that the victim’s injuries were consistent with the manner in which the incident had occurred:[^5]

> (a)     Dr Tan explained that the right tibia plateau fracture was an intra-articular fracture involving the joint of the bone. Such injury was generally caused by _high impact_ incidents. He opined that this injury sustained by the victim was consistent with the direct impact of the bumper of the car with the victim’s right knee, causing the knee to go into a bent position, which can result in a tibia plateau fracture.[^6]

> (b)     He further explained that the L2 compression fracture was a fracture of the second vertebra of the lumbar spine caused by _compressive forces_ arising from, for instance, landing on one’s buttocks after a fall. In his opinion, the victim’s L2 compression fracture was consistent with her falling backwards and landing on her buttocks after the impact. The compressive forces of her weight on her buttock would result in an L2 compression fracture.[^7]

13     It was also Dr Tan’s opinion that the victim’s injuries were unlikely to have been caused by the fall as the defendant was carrying her to the sidewalk. The impact of that fall was unlikely to have resulted in a right tibia plateau fracture because she landed on the back, and her limbs did not take the direct impact of the fall. It would also not have caused a compression type fracture, but perhaps a transverse type fracture where the fracture line cut across. Dr Tan added that the fall might have worsened the victim’s original injuries from the accident, by causing a further displacement and worsening of the fractures.[^8]

#### (d)   Victim sustained grievous hurt

14     Under s 320(_g_) of the Penal Code, a _fracture_ of a bone constitutes “grievous hurt”. Accordingly, the right tibia plateau fracture and L2 compression fracture sustained by the victim was “grievous hurt”.

#### Defence – no collision

15     The defendant was called upon to enter his defence, and he elected to testify. The thrust of his defence was that his car did not hit the victim: he managed to apply the brakes in time to avoid hitting her.

16     The defendant testified[^9] that he was a Grab driver. That morning, he was on his way to pick up a passenger. He was driving at a very slow speed and waiting for the barrier to rise. All of a sudden the victim appeared in front of him. He managed to brake in time to avoid a collision. The victim fell, possibly from shock. He came out from his car and checked on her. She assured him that she was alright, and declined his suggestion to call for an ambulance. At this time his car was holding up traffic and causing congestion. He decided to carry her and move her to the side. However he forgot that he had a spinal injury. Both he and the victim fell down, and the back of her head hit the kerb. He noticed she was bleeding, and he called for an ambulance and the traffic police.

17     A traffic police officer arrived 14 minutes later. He inspected the car and confirmed that there was no damage. The officer looked around the scene of the accident and did not take any photograph. 20 minutes later an ambulance arrived at the scene. The medics attended to the victim for about 15-20 minutes. After treating her they only put two small plasters on her – one on the head and one on the lower right hand. They put her on a wheelchair (instead of a stretcher). An ambulance officer assured the defendant that the victim was alright and not to worry.

#### Issues before the court

18     The key issue before the court was whether the defendant’s car had hit the victim, causing her to sustain the injuries stated in the charge.

#### Decision

#### (a)   Defendant’s car had hit the victim, causing grievous hurt

19     On the evidence, it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s car had hit the victim.

20     The recording from the in-car camera clearly showed the victim, while crossing the lane, being hit on her right side by the defendant’s car, causing her to fall backwards onto the ground. The defendant’s immediate perception of what had occurred was summed up in what he told the police in the FIR, that his car “hit” an old lady. The injuries found on the victim after the medical examination by Dr Tan were entirely consistent with her being hit by the car.

21     Despite the clear objective evidence, the defendant in his testimony denied that his car had hit the victim. He claimed that he had braked in time, and the victim had simply collapsed on her own. I found the defendant’s claim to be at odds with the objective evidence:

> (a)     The footage from the in-car camera showed the victim falling in a sudden, involuntary manner. This could only be explained by the force of the defendant’s car colliding into the right, lower part of her body.

> (b)     If the defendant had narrowly avoided a collision and the victim had fallen on her own without the car hitting her, he would not have told the police in the FIR that his car had _hit_ her.

> (c)     The medical evidence was consistent with the victim’s injuries being caused by a collision. There was no other reasonable explanation as to how the victim could have suffered the fractures. As Dr Tan had explained, it was unlikely that the injuries were sustained when the victim fell on her back while being carried by the defendant to the sidewalk.

22     Various other points raised by the defendant in the course of his defence also did not cast any reasonable doubt that his car had hit the victim. I deal with the salient points below:

> (a)     The defendant highlighted that no damage was found on his car after the incident. I found that this did not disprove that the collision had occurred. From the in-car camera footage, the car was not moving at a very fast speed when it hit the victim; and the body of the victim, who was 87 years old, was not a hard object that would cause corresponding damage to the car.

> (b)     The defendant said that when he spoke to the victim immediately after the incident, she was not screaming and did not appear to be in great pain. I found that this did not cast reasonable doubt that the victim had sustained the serious injuries from the collision. Dr Tan explained that in the “acute period”, a patient’s experience of pain may be decreased by the initial shock and the adrenaline rushing through the body, and the patient may not be screaming in pain; just because the victim was not screaming in pain did not mean that she did not suffer from any injury from the accident.[^10] Hence, even if the defendant’s evidence was accepted and the victim did not manifest visible signs of distress, such as screaming in pain, it was not indicative that she had not suffered the fractures in the course of the accident.

> (c)     The defendant said that when the paramedics from the ambulance treated the victim, they did not put her on a stretcher but on a wheelchair, and she did not appear to be seriously injured. Again, I found this to be inconclusive. As Dr Tan explained, neither a right tibia plateau fracture nor an L2 compression fracture would usually be immediately visible upon a superficial examination; without “X-ray eyes”, it would not be possible to tell if there was a broken bone or how badly broken it was.[^11] Hence, even if the paramedics were not able to tell that the victim had sustained fractures, it did not mean that she had not suffered those injuries. The victim was conveyed by ambulance to the hospital, where the full extent of her injuries from the accident was diagnosed.

23     Accordingly, given the objective evidence, I found that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s car had collided into the victim and caused her to sustain grievous hurt in the form of the right tibia plateau fracture and the L2 compression fracture.

#### (b)   Defendant had failed to keep a proper lookout

24     I also found that the accident occurred as the defendant had negligently failed to keep a proper lookout. From the footage of the in-car camera, even _before_ the defendant started to turn right into the carpark entrance, the victim could clearly be seen crossing the lane. The lighting conditions were bright enough for him to see her. By the time the defendant’s car started turning right and drawing near to the victim, she was more than halfway across the lane into which the defendant was turning. She was not walking at a fast speed. She did not suddenly dash across and appear in front of the car. In the circumstances, the defendant ought to have seen the victim crossing the lane. He would have had sufficient reaction time to avoid colliding into her. Under cross-examination, the defendant conceded that he did not see the victim crossing the lane before he executed the right turn, that he negligently failed to keep a proper lookout, and that this was a dangerous act and endangered human life.[^12] The occurrence of the accident was plainly due to the defendant’s negligence and failing to keep a proper lookout.

#### (c)   Verdict

25     Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s car had hit the victim, causing her grievous hurt, and this was due to his negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout. The defendant was found guilty and convicted on the charge.

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions

27     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 10 days’ imprisonment and an order to disqualify the defendant from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of at least 24 months. Relying on the sentencing framework set out in _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> (“**_Tang Ling Lee_**”), it was submitted that the present case fell within Category 2 (see below, at \[33\]).

28     It was submitted that the harm caused was great because the victim suffered two serious fractures – to her right knee and lower lumbar spine. She was hospitalized from 7 to 10 August 2018. If she had not been a retiree, she would have required at least 3 months’ hospitalisation leave. Her mobility was permanently affected – she was now mostly wheelchair bound and her right knee suffered from a limited range of motion. (She had no history of orthopaedic issues prior to the incident.)

29     It was also submitted that the defendant’s culpability was moderate. He had completely failed to look out for pedestrians before turning into the lane. He was wholly oblivious to the victim, who was already in the midst of crossing the carpark entrance, until it was too late for him to react.

30     A further aggravating factor was the defendant’s poor driving record. Over the past 20 years, he had chalked up three speeding offences, two incidents of careless driving (warnings) and three other risky traffic violations (failing to conform to red light signal). While the defendant did stop to render assistance to the victim, he had expressed no remorse.

#### Mitigation plea

31     In his mitigation plea, the defendant said he was a driver making an honest living. He depended on the job for his survival. He said that he recently had a heart attack and spinal injury, and was pending an operation. He hoped that the sentence would not affect his driving. He added that the victim had claimed $60,000 from his car insurance. He sought a deferment of the sentence in order to return his car, prepare his medicine and look for an alternative job.

#### Sentencing considerations and sentence imposed

32     I accepted the prosecution’s submissions on sentencing.

33     In _Tang Ling Lee_, See Kee Oon J set out a sentencing framework for the offence of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act for road traffic cases under s 338(b) of the Penal Code. The categories of cases and the presumptive sentencing range for each category, were set out at \[31\]:

34     I agreed with the submission of the prosecution that the present case fell within Category 2, which carries a presumptive sentencing range of 7 to 14 days’ imprisonment. The harm caused in the present case was high and the defendant’s culpability was moderate. I also considered the defendant’s past traffic violations as an aggravating factor. Further, he expressed no remorse and simply refused to acknowledge that he had caused the grievous injuries to the victim despite the overwhelming objective evidence against him. In the circumstances, the sentence sought by the prosecution was entirely fair and reasonable. The sentence of 10 days’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution was in the middle of the presumptive sentencing range of 7 to 14 days under Category 2, and was proportionate to the defendant’s _moderate_ culpability. A 24-month disqualification from driving was also appropriate given the gravity of the harm caused by the defendant to the victim, the level of his culpability, and his poor driving record.

35     Accordingly, the following sentence was imposed:

36     The sentence has been stayed pending the appeal. The defendant is on bail pending the appeal.
