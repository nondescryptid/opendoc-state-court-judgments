\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9139/2022/01.\]

5 August 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Cheng Chang Tong, a 60-year-old male Singapore citizen had pleaded to the following two charges namely:

> (a)     **DAC 910426-2022**

**1st Charge**

> are charged that you, 5 February 2022, at about 10.16 p.m, along Blk 220 Petir Road Open space carpark, Lot 286, Singapore, when driving motorcar, SDG 8466C, did have so much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your breath, to wit, not less than 85 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 67(1)(b) and punishable under Section 67(1) read with Section 67(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1961.

> (b)     **DAC 910427-2022**

**2nd Charge**

> are charged that you, 5 February 2022, at about 10.16 p.m, along Blk 220 Petir Road Open space carpark, Lot 286, Singapore, did drive motorcar, SDG 8466C, on the road without due care and attention to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout when reversing into a parallel parking lot and collided onto the right side of one motorcar, SLV 9002C which was parked ahead of your vehicle, at parking lot number 286 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 65(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1961. And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, have been convicted on the following earlier occasion(s):

>> (i)    On 02 September 1998 in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Speeding (41-50KMPH) under Section 63(4) Road Traffic Act Chapter 276 vide R98079246LD; and

>> (ii)   On 25 August 2004 in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Speeding (41-50KMPH road) under Section 63(4) Road Traffic Act Chapter 276 vide R04028048ND

> which conviction have not been set aside, and you shall thereby be liable for punishable under Section 65(5)(c) read with Section 65(5)(b) and Section 65(6)(i) and Section 67A(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1961.

2       On 21 July 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to both charges and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. A remaining charge in **DAC 910428-2022** for failing to stop after an accident and to take reasonable steps to provide his particulars under s 84(1)(_b_) read with s 84(7) of the RTA was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After carefully considering the accused’s plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s address on sentence, I sentenced the accused as follows:

> (a)      **DAC 910426-2022** – Fine of $7,000 in default 30 days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for three years from 21 July 2022;

> (b)      **DAC 910427-2022** – Fine of $4,000 in default 15 days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for 30 months from 21 July 2022.

The total fine payable was $11,000 in default 45 days’ imprisonment and total disqualification for a period of 3 years. The accused had paid the fine in full on 21 July 2022.

4       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with my sentence in respect of the charge in **DAC 910427-2022** had filed a Notice of Appeal on 22 July 2022.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

6       The complainant is Investigation Officer Muhd Zickie from Traffic Police attached to General Investigation Team. The victim is Neo Wei Siang, Gerald, Male, Chinese, Singaporean, 30 years old. He is the owner of motorcar bearing registration number SLV9002C at the time of accident. The accused was the driver of motorcar bearing registration number SDG8466C at the time of accident.

7       On 5 February 2022 at about 7.00pm, the accused consumed four small glasses of ‘Chivas’ at his shop located at Upper Bukit Timah Road. He finished drinking at about 9.00pm and left the shop together with his wife at around 10.00pm. The accused drove his motorcar, SDG8466C with his wife being the front passenger, back home at Petir Road.

8       On 5 February 2022, at about 10.16pm, whilst at the Block 220 Petir Road open space carpark, Lot 286 Singapore, the accused drove his motorcar on a road without due care and attention, by failing to keep a proper lookout when reversing into a parallel parking lot and collided onto the right side of the victim’s motorcar SLV9002C which was parked ahead of the accused’s motorcar at parking Lot 286. The accused’s wife was seated in the front passenger’s seat at the time of the incident. After parking the motorcar, the accused and his wife left for home.

9       When the victim came to the carpark on 6 February 2022 at about 12.11am, he discovered there were fresh scratch marks at the rear right portion of his motorcar. He also discovered that there were damages to the front left portion of the accused’s motorcar, thus the victim called for the Police.

10     Based on screening result, the complainant managed to trace the accused at his residence. The complainant communicated and observed that the accused reeked of alcohol. A breathalyser test was conducted on the accused and the result shown “Fail”. The accused was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and was escorted to Traffic Police for Breath Analysing Device (BAD) Test. The BAD test was conducted by Staff Sergeant Poh Seng Pew on 6 February 2022 at about 3.27am at Traffic Police. The breath test revealed that the proportion of alcohol in accused’s breath was 85 µg of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of breath. The prescribed limit is 35 µg of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

11     Footage from the accused’s in-car camera revealed that the accused was trying to parallel park his motorcar into a car park lot behind the victim’s motorcar, which was parked at Lot 286. As the accused was manoeuvering his motorcar into the car park lot, the front left portion of the accused’s motorcar swiped the rear right portion of the victim’s motorcar.

12     The damages to the victim’s motorcar, SLV9002C include scratches and dents on the rear right side of the motorcar. The accused’s motorcar, SDG8466C had cracks, dents and scratches on the front left side of the vehicle. The cost of damage for the victim’s motorcar was $2,400 and the accused has made full restitution to the victim.

13     At the time of accident, the weather was clear, road surface was dry and the traffic volume was light.

14     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused has been convicted on the following earlier occasion(s):

> (a)     On 02 September 1998 in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Speeding (41-50KMPH) under s 63(4) of the RTA vide R98079246LD and

> (b)     On 25 August 2004 in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Speeding (41-50KMPH road) under s 63(4) of the RTA vide R04028048ND. which conviction have not been set aside.

15     Pursuant to s 64(8) of the RTA, the accused is considered a serious offender when he is convicted of an offence under s 67(1) in relation to the accused’s driving. In addition, pursuant to s 65(8) of the RTA, the accused is considered a repeat offender when he is convicted of an offence under Section 63(4) in relation to the accused’s driving.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

#### s 67(1)(b) RTA

16     The prescribed penalty for an offence of drink driving under s 67(1)(_b_) of the RTA is a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

17     In addition, pursuant to s 67(2)(_a_) of the RTA unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, the court must order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for at least two years for a first offender.

#### s 65(1)(a) RTA

18     The prescribed penalty for an offence of driving without due care and attention under s 65(1)(_a_) of the RTA by a repeat offender under s 65(5)(_b_) is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. Pursuant to s 64(8) of the RTA, as the accused has also been convicted for an offence under s 67 of the RTA, the accused is liable as a serious offender to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, _in addition_ to any punishment under s 65(5)(_a_) or 65(5)(_b_) of the RTA.

19     In addition, s 65(6)(_i_) of the RTA provides that unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, the court must order that a serious offender be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for at least two years.

## Antecedents

20     On 2 September 1998 in Court 21, the accused was fined $600 for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA. On 25 August 2004 in Court 21 he was fined $1,000 for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA.

21     In addition, the accused had paid composition for the speeding offences under s 63(4) of the RTA on 29 May 1990, 16 February 1995, 5 June 1998 and 23 May 2007. On 24 July 2012, he had also paid composition for the offence of inconsiderate driving under s 65(a) of the RTA.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

22     It was the Prosecution’s position that in respect of the drink driving charge, the accused’s alcohol level fell within high Band 3 of the sentencing framework in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] 3 SLR 993</span> (“_Rafael_”). It was submitted that a slight uplift to a fine $7,000 and disqualification for 3 years was required as he was involved in an accident.

23     In respect of the accident charge, it was further submitted that it was irresponsible of the accused not to notify the victim of the damage. Fortunately, the victim came down early and discovered the damage. Otherwise, the accused would have gotten off scot-free for the drink driving charge had it been detected late. In view that he is a repeat offender, the Prosecution sought three weeks imprisonment and 3 years DQ. It was submitted that it fell within Band 2 of the _Wu Zhi Yong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 261</span> (“_Wu Zhi Yong_”) framework.

## Mitigation

24     In his oral mitigation, the accused stated that he is rather advanced in age. He has since sold his car and has stopped driving. He understands that drink driving is wrong and asked the Court for forgiveness. He still has many things to attend to outside. He had just been diagnosed with nerve issues in his right hand recently and he has difficulty lifting his hand. He pleaded for leniency in imposing a lighter sentence.

## My decision on sentence

### Sentencing framework for drink driving

25     In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed in respect of the drink driving charge, I had considered the sentencing framework established by Sundaresh Menon CJ (“Menon CJ”) for first offenders in _Rafael_ as a neutral starting point.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="35.5271054210842%"><col width="34.9269853970794%"><col width="29.5459091818364%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of alcohol (µg per 100ml of breath)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of fines</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of disqualification</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36-54</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000-$4,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24-30 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">55-69</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$4,000-$6,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30-36 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70-89</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000-$8,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36-48 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">≥90</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$8,000-$10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">48-60 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

In the present case as the accused’s alcohol level was 85 µg, it fell within the higher end of Band 3 of the framework.

26     In the application of the above sentencing framework, Menon CJ made two additional points at \[32\] and \[33\]:

> (a)     The sentencing framework is only applicable where no harm to person or property has eventuated; and

> (b)     The framework provides only neutral starting points based on the relative seriousness of the offence and considering only the level of alcohol in the offender’s body. Regard should still be had to any aggravating or mitigating circumstances (see _Edwin Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin Suse_”) at \[22\]) and if the former, if they exist, could result in the custodial threshold being crossed.

27     Accordingly, I was mindful that this framework is applicable where no harm to person or property has eventuated. This framework only provides starting points based on the relative seriousness of the offence and considering only the level of alcohol in the offender’s body. When sentencing, I would still have to consider whether there was any aggravating or mitigating circumstances and to make the necessary calibrations to the relevant starting points. In determining the appropriate sentence, I would also consider other relevant factors such as the manner of driving, the type of vehicle, the distance travelled, the road and traffic conditions, any impairment of the ability to drive or whether there was accident resulting in harm to person or property.

28     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a slight uplift from the usual sentence to a fine $7,000 and a disqualification for 3 years or 36 months which was at the starting point for disqualification under Band 3. In cases where a first offender whose level of alcohol is 85µg pleads guilty at the mentions stage and where no harm to person or property is caused, the usual sentence sought and imposed is a fine of $6,500 and disqualification of 36 months or 3 years.

#### Level of alcohol

29     In the present case, I considered the fact that the accused’s alcohol level was 85µg which was at the higher end of Band 3 of the _Rafael_ framework. For the alcohol range of 70 µg to 89 µg, the range of fines is between $6,000 to $8,000 and the range of disqualification is between 36 to 48 months,

#### Consequences of the act

30     As a result of the accused driving while under the influence of alcohol, property damage was caused to the victim’s car while the accused was trying to parallel park his motorcar into a car park lot behind the victim’s motorcar. The offence occurred at about 10.16pm at the Block 220 Petir Road open space carpark and the traffic within the vicinity of the carpark was light. The victim’s motorcar suffered scratches and dents on the rear right side of the motorcar.

31     It was undisputed that as a sign of his remorse, the accused had pleaded guilty and paid for the cost of repairs of $2,400 before the first court mention on 21 July 2022. Based on the above, I was of the view that his culpability was at the mid-level of low and the harm was at higher end of low.

32     Hence, in respect of the drink driving charge, after giving the necessary weight to fact that the accused had pleaded guilty, his cooperation with the complainant at his residence and the remorse shown by making full restitution prior to the first mention, I agreed with the Prosecution that a slight uplift to a fine of $7,000 was just and appropriate. Such a sentence would fulfil the objectives of punishment, the protection of the public as well as deterrence.

33     As for the appropriate length of the disqualification order, I was guided by both the sentencing framework in _Rafael_ as well as the recent case of _Kwan Weiguang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 121</span> (“_Kwan_”). Based on the _Rafael_ framework, the range of disqualification period for Band 3 was 36 to 48 months where no harm to person or property has eventuated. In _Kwan_ at \[65\] to \[71\], Aedit Abdullah J held that the relevant and material factors when determining the period of disqualification are:

> (a)     Circumstances of the commission of the offence;

> (b)     Continued ability to drive and attitude towards other road users;

34     In the present case, the accused’s judgment was impaired due to his high level of alcohol and property damage was caused to the victim’s motorcar. The extent of any property damage caused and the potential harm that could have resulted from the act of dangerous or reckless driving would also be relevant consideration: _Wu Zhi Yong_ at \[36(a)\] and \[36(b)\].

35     Nevertheless, the level of potential harm must be assessed against the actual facts which include, _inter alia_, the condition of the road, the volume of traffic, the number of pedestrians actually on or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road at the relevant time, the speed and manner of driving, visibility at the relevant time, the type of vehicle, and any particular vulnerabilities (_Neo Chuan Sheng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> at \[22\]).

36     In the present case, the level of potential harm was not significant in view of the time of the offence, the light volume of traffic, his manner of driving and his low speed as he parallel parked his vehicle while under influence of alcohol. At the material time from his in-vehicle footage, there were no other vehicles travelling in the vicinity of the carpark and there were two persons walking some distance away from the accused’s motorcar. In my view, taking all the above circumstances into account, a disqualification period of three years for all classes of vehicles was just and appropriate to fulfil the objectives of punishment, the protection of the public and deterrence.

37     I now turn to the second charge under s 65(1)(_a_) of the RTA.

### Sentencing framework for irresponsible driving

38     The primary offence of driving without due care and attention or reasonable consideration for other persons using the road is encapsulated under s 65(1) of the RTA. The subsequent subsections from ss 65(2) to 65(4) are the penalty prescribing provisions, each tiered according to the degree of hurt caused and for s 65(5), for any other case of non-personal injury or potential harm.

39     The present offence under s 65(1)(_a_) of the RTA was enacted on 1 November 2019, following the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 19 of 2019). The Amendment Act arose out of a review of the RTA and it aimed to provide stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving.

40     Presently there is no existing sentencing framework enunciated by the High Court for an offence punishable under s 65(5)(_b_) read with s 65(5)(_c_) of the RTA. Although the present case concerns the second category of irresponsible driving, as both ss 64(2C) and 65(5) of the RTA concern offences in the residual category of cases not involving death, grievous hurt or other hurt, due to the similarity in the structure of the statutory provisions for both forms of irresponsible driving, I was of the view the observations as well as the sentencing approach set out by Menon CJ in _Wu Zhi Yong_ provides some useful guidance on how such offences should be dealt with. I was mindful that Menon CJ had emphasized at \[20\] that his approach to developing a sentencing framework is confined to the punishment prescribed under s 64(2C), which is a residual category of cases not involving death, grievous or other hurt.

41     In determining the appropriate sentencing framework for offences under offences under s 64(2C)(a) read with s 64(2C)(c), Menon CJ in _Wu Zhi Yong_ at \[19\] had considered the following:

> The primary aim should be to arrive at an approach to sentencing that is faithful to the legislation and that appropriately accounts for the seriousness of the offence, and accords the necessary weight to (a) the fact that the driving occurred while the offender was under the influence of drink; and (b) the harm caused by the offender; while (c) also having due regard to other relevant factors. At the same time, however, such an approach must be workable by first instance sentencing judges.

42     In my view the offence-specific factors set out by Menon CJ in _Wu Zhi Yong_ at \[36\], for offences by a serious offender under s 64(2C)(_a_) read with s 64(2C)(_c_) of the RTA where there is non-personal injury or potential harm could also apply to offences under s 65(5) of the RTA where there is non-personal injury and one similarly involving a serious offender _ie_ an offender who is convicted of an offence under s 67 or 70(4) in relation to the offender’s driving.

43     In _Wu Zhi Yong_, after a careful consideration of the different sentencing approaches at \[22\] to \[29\] Menon CJ had prescribed the sentencing band approach when dealing with offences punishable under s 64(2C)(_a_) read with ss 64(2C)(_c_) of the RTA. At \[30\] and \[48\] of the judgment, Menon CJ had set out the following sentencing approach:

> _The sentencing approach_

> 30    At the first step, as set out in _Terence Ng_ at \[39\], the court should identify the band applicable to the offence and the indicative starting point with reference to that band, having regard to the _offence_\-specific factors present. These would encompass factors relating to the manner and mode by which the offence was committed, as well as the harm caused by the offender. At the second step, the court would have regard to the _offender_\-specific factors, being the aggravating and mitigating factors that are personal to the offender...

> 48    At the second step of the analysis, the court will have regard to the offender-specific factors. Examples of these factors have been set out at \[62\] – \[71\] of _Terence Ng_ and apply equally in the present framework. Offender-specific aggravating factors include offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the presence of relevant antecedents (apart from where the offender’s antecedents have been taken into account under the “repeat offender” or “serious repeat offender” provisions), and evidence showing a lack of remorse. Offender-specific mitigating factors include evidence of genuine remorse and an offender’s youth.

### Offence-specific factors

44     Hence in my view, this sentencing approach would be appropriate when dealing with the second category of irresponsible driving where there was no personal injury and one involving a serious offender with the necessary calibration made based on the prescribed penalties. Accordingly, guided by the sentencing approach as set out in _Wu Zhi Yong_, I first considered the offence-specific factors to determine the appropriate sentencing band where the present offence should be situated. In my view, the offence-specific factors considered by the High Court in _Wu Zhi Yong_ at \[36\] as set out below under the sentencing bands would also be relevant in the present case, namely:

> (_a_)     _Serious potential harm_: Apart from actual harm, it has long been accepted that regard should also be had to the potential harm that can result from the act of dangerous or reckless driving:(see _Stansilas_ at \[47\]; _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> (“Koh Thiam Huat” at \[41\]). The level of potential harm would be “assessed against facts which would include … the condition of the road, the volume of traffic or number of pedestrians actually on or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road at the relevant time, the speed and manner of driving, visibility at the relevant time, the type of vehicle, and any particular vulnerabilities (_eg_ a truck or car colliding into a motorcycle or pedestrian: _Neo Chuan Sheng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 97</span> at \[22\]. As is evident, these relate to the circumstances of driving that could increase the danger posed to road users (see Edwin Suse at \[28\]). Where an assessment of these facts reveal that the potential harm occasioned to road users would have been serious, this would be an aggravating factor;

> (_b_)     _Serious property damage_: The extent of property damage caused is a relevant sentencing factor. As a general rule, the amount of any loss or damage may serve as a proxy indicator of harm;

> (_c_)     _High alcohol level found in the accused person’s blood or breath_: A high level of alcohol that substantially exceeds the prescribed limit would be an aggravating factor. As noted by the court in _Stansilas_ at \[37\], an offender’s alcohol level is an indicator of his inability or unfitness to drive due to his alcohol intake, and heavier punishment should therefore be imposed on drivers with higher alcohol levels. This determination of whether an offender’s alcohol level is high can be made with reference to the sentencing framework for an offence under s 67, set out in _Rafael Voltaire_ at \[31\], which is calibrated in accordance with the alcohol levels found in an offender’s blood or breath. In the context of sentencing under s 64(2C)(c), this will be a factor of particular importance;

> (_d_)     _An offender’s reason or motivation for driving_: The court in _Edwin s/o Suse_ held that an offender’s reason or motivation for driving could be an aggravating (or conceivably, in some circumstances, even a mitigating) factor in respect of an offence of drink driving. The court further considered that the gravity of an offender’s conduct would be increased if he had, at that time, been driving a passenger for hire or reward (at \[33\]);

> (_e_)     _Increased culpability_: In _Koh Thiam Huat_ at \[41\], the court considered that factors _increasing_ an accused person’s culpability for an offence of dangerous driving would include a _particularly dangerous manner_ of driving. Examples of such aggravating factors include excessive speeding or deliberate dangerous driving, such as in “hell riding” cases (see _Koh Thiam Huat_ at \[41\]).;

> (_f_)     _The offender’s conduct following the offence or attempt to evade arrest_: Conduct that is “belligerent or violent” upon arrest would constitute an aggravating factor: _Edwin Suse_ at \[32\]. Likewise, the failure to stop in an attempt to evade arrest or to avoid apprehension should also weigh against an offender: _Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 240</span> at \[33\].

45     Apart from the factors listed above, another relevant factor to be considered would be the number of victims involved. Where there are multiple victims impacted by the accused’s irresponsible driving under the influence of alcohol, this would be regarded as an aggravating factor.

46     In the present case, as the accused is regarded as a serious offender, he is liable to the prescribed punishment under s 65(5)(_c_) of the RTA which is _in addition_ to any punishment for a repeat offender under s 65(5)(_b_) of the RTA. This is in view of Parliament’s intention to punish repeat offenders for the aggravated conduct of driving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for others using the road while under the influence of alcohol. Hence, for the present charge the accused was liable to a fine of more than $2,000 and not exceeding $13,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 24 months or to both. It is noteworthy that maximum fine for the present offence is $2,000 less than that for offences under s 64(2C)(_a_) read with ss 64(2C)(_c_) although the maximum imprisonment term is similar.

47     Bearing in mind the applicable maximum statutory provisions and the application of both the serious offender as well as the repeat offender provisions, I turned to the facts of the present case.

#### Manner and mode of the offence and the harm caused

48     In the present case, the offence occurred at about 10.16pm at the Block 220 Petir Road open space carpark while the accused was trying to parallel park his motorcar into a carpark lot behind the victim’s motorcar. The victim’s motorcar suffered scratches and dents on the rear right side of the motorcar. It was evident from the footage at that time of the night, the traffic within the vicinity of the carpark was light.

49     The victim discovered the damage to his motorcar on 6 February 2022 at about 12.11am. As he also discovered damages to the front left portion of the accused’s motorcar, the victim called for the police. The accused was arrested after the complainant went to the accused’s residence and the accused failed a breathalyser test that was conducted on him. It was the Prosecution’s position that it was fortunate that the victim came down early and discovered the damage. Otherwise, the accused would have gotten off scot-free for the drink driving charge had it been detected late.

50     After having regard to the _offence_\-specific factors, I was of the view that the present case involves a lower level of seriousness _ie_ within Band 1 of _Wu Zhi Yong_ where the court could impose of a fine or a short custodial sentence or both. I disagreed with the Prosecution’s position that the custodial threshold had been crossed on the basis that the accused is a repeat offender and that the present case fell within Band 2 of _Wu Zhi Yong_.

51     Although the accused is considered a repeat offender by virtue of his 1998 and 2004 speeding convictions and his level of alcohol was at the second highest band of _Rafael_, I was of the view that these factors affect the seriousness of his offence to a limited extent. The accused had swiped the rear right portion of the victim’s motorcar as he was trying to parallel park his car into a carpark lot behind the victim’s car. This was the extent of his irresponsible driving within the carpark. In addition, although his previous convictions were relevant, they could be considered as dated as the most recent one was almost 18 years ago.

52     In addition, I noted that at the time of the offence the accused was not travelling on an expressway or highway where the vehicular speed would be higher or on a road where there the presence of other road users was significant. Furthermore, the present case is unlike _PP v Shin Seung Ho_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 33</span> where while under the influence of alcohol, the offender had driven through the carpark from Block 146 to 150 Silat Avenue against the flow of traffic twice, hit two interlinked water barricades and had collided into two parked vehicles at different parts of the carpark where slight property damage of $30 was occasioned to one vehicle. There was also potential harm to other road users who were travelling within the carpark when he was driving against the flow of traffic as he was seen driving very closely past a cyclist who was cycling in the correct direction.

53     In the present case I was of the view that the starting point of the sentence should be slightly below the mid-range of the maximum fine of $13,000 _ie_ a fine of $6,000. I was mindful that the minimum fine to be imposed for an aggravated conduct of driving without due care and attention while under the influence of alcohol by a repeat offender should be a fine of more than $2,000 as the minimum fine prescribed by s 65(5)(_c_) of the RTA is $2,000.

54     The next step would be for the court to calibrate the sentence after having regard to the offender-specific factors. The relevant factors would include offences that are taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the presence of relevant antecedents and evidence showing a lack of remorse. Offender-specific mitigating factors include a clean record, an early plea of guilt, evidence of genuine remorse and an offender’s youth.

### Offender-specific factors

#### Potential harm

55     In terms of potential harm, I was of the view that it was not significant in view of the time of the offence, the light volume of traffic, his manner of driving and his low speed as he parallel parked his vehicle. At the material time, there were no other vehicles travelling in the vicinity of the carpark and there were two persons walking some distance away from the accused’s motorcar.

56     Apart from the collision onto the right rear side of the victim’s motorcar, there was no other evidence of persistent careless driving over some distance, driving against the flow of traffic on multiple instances and/or causing damage to other vehicles or structures due to his inability to control his vehicle before the accused stopped driving.

#### Extent of property damage

57     In terms of the seriousness of the property damage, I noted that there were scratches and dents on the rear right side of the motorcar and the total cost of repairs was $2,400. In terms of the harm caused, I was of the view that it fell within the higher level of low harm.

#### Aggravating factors

58     I regarded his high alcohol level to be an aggravating factor as it was 85µg (2.4 times over the prescribed limit) and was at the higher end of Band 3 of the _Rafael_ framework. In addition, it was also an aggravating factor that he had driven home with his wife as a passenger in his motorcar after consuming alcohol from Upper Bukit Timah Road to Petir Road.

59     I had also considered that a charge of failing to provide particulars after an accident was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. As submitted by the Prosecution, if the victim had not discovered the damage to his vehicle early, the accused would have escaped responsibility for these charges. In addition, in view of his previous convictions for speeding in 1998 and 2004, the accused is considered a repeat offender.

60     Nevertheless, I was mindful that there were no culpability increasing factors such as driving in a highly carelessness manner _ie_ by travelling against the flow of traffic, travelling at an excessive speed or in blatant disregard of multiple road traffic laws based on the facts before me.

#### Mitigating factors

61     I regarded it as a mitigating factor that as a sign of his genuine remorse, the accused had pleaded guilty at the first court mention. It was also a mitigating factor that he had paid for the cost of repairs of $2,400 to the victim before the first court mention on 21 July 2022. Based on the above, I was of the view that his culpability was at the mid-level of low and the harm caused was at the higher end of low.

62     After considering both the aggravating factors as well as the mitigating factors, I had calibrated the sentence downwards to a fine of $4,000 in view of the totality principle. I was mindful that the enhanced penalty provision under s 65(5)(_c_) is contingent on the accused being convicted for an offence under ss 67 or 70(4) of the RTA. Thus, I had to ensure that the accused was not punished twice act based on the same set of facts. In my view, the Prosecution’s proposed sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment was excessive based on the accused’s overall criminality and on the circumstances of the present case.

63     As for the appropriate length of the disqualification order, I was guided by both the sentencing framework in _Wu Zhi Yong_ as well as the recent case of _Kwan_ as cited above_._ Based on the _Wu Zhi Yong_ framework, the range of disqualification period for Band 1 was two to three years. Furthermore, pursuant to s 65(6)(_i_) of the RTA unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, the court must order that a serious offender be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for at least two years. It was also clear that it was within the public’s interest to remove such a driver from the roads for a substantial period of time.

64     In my view, taking all the above circumstances into account, a disqualification period of 30 months for all classes of vehicles was appropriate to fulfil the objectives of punishment, the protection of the public and deterrence. Although the Prosecution had sought a disqualification for a period of three years, I was of the view that 30 months disqualification was more appropriate in the circumstances.

### Global Sentence

65     As the facts underlying the first charge under s 67 are in relation to the same act of driving which gave rise to second charge under s 65(1)(_a_), the offences engage an identical or largely overlapping set of facts. The operation of the enhanced penalty provision in s 65(5)(_c_) is contingent on the offender also being convicted of either an offence under ss 67 or 70(4) of the RTA. In my view, the cumulative fine of $11,000 and the total disqualification of three years was sufficient and proportionate to the accused’s overall criminality and the particular facts and circumstances of the present case.
