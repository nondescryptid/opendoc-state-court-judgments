Statutory Interpretation – Construction of statute – Children and Young Persons Act – Person in respect of whom proceedings are taken

13 May 2020

### Deputy Registrar Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       The defendant (the “School”) is an international school in Singapore. It offers classes from Kindergarten to Grade 12. The 1st plaintiff, \[GCP\], was at the material time a Grade 1 student with the School. The 2nd plaintiff and the 3rd plaintiff (collectively, the “Parents”) are the parents of \[GCP\].

2       On 12 March 2018, while in the School and during school hours, \[GCP\] was allegedly assaulted at her groin area by a male classmate, \[X\]. At that time, both of them were 7 years of age. \[GCP\] now claims against the School in negligence for failing to provide her with a safe schooling environment. The Parents also claim against the School for breach of the enrolment contract in respect of their enrolment of \[GCP\] in the School.

3       The School applied for three types of relief to limit the publication of information about the substantive proceedings (District Court Suit No. 3430 of 2019):

> (a)     enjoining the publication of any information relating to the proceedings (the “Gag Order”)

> (b)     having the entirety of the proceedings heard _In Camera_ (the “_In-Camera_ Order”); and

> (c)     sealing all the records of the proceedings (the “Sealing Order”).

4       The School based this application on the public interest in protecting the identity of \[X\], a minor child, given the severity of the allegations made against him in these proceedings. Although \[X\] is not a party to these proceedings, the School submitted that it was not only entitled but was in fact obliged to bring this application because of its responsibility, as an educational institution who had charge of \[X\] at the material time, for his welfare.

5       The plaintiffs resisted the application and contended that a redaction of the names of \[X\] and \[GCP\] from the record of the proceedings would suffice. The plaintiffs also offered to assist with any such redaction.

6       On 20 March 2020, I granted the Gag Order to the extent of the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\] and in the terms of s 35(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”). I also ordered the redaction of all references to \[X\] and \[GCP\] in the substantive proceedings. But I did not grant the Sealing Order or the _In-Camera_ Order.

7       No appeal was filed against this decision within the time limited for doing so. But this summons raised novel issues about the application of the statutory gag order in s 35(1) of the CYPA to a child who is neither a party to nor a witness in the proceedings. I thus provide the grounds of my decision.

## Open justice

8       The principle of “open justice” is central to the rule of law. It ensures that “justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” (_R v Sussex Justices, ex p McCarthy_ <span class="citation">\[1924\] 1 KB 256</span> at 259). This promotes public confidence in the administration of justice (_Attorney-General v Leveller Magazine Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1979\] AC 440</span> (“_Leveller_”) at 449–450, _per_ Lord Diplock):

> … the English system of administering justice does require that it be done in public: _Scott v. Scott_ <span class="citation">\[1913\] AC 417</span>. If the way that the courts behave cannot be hidden from the public ear and eye this provides a safeguard against judicial arbitrariness or idiosyncrasy and maintains the public conﬁdence in the administration of justice. The application of this principle of open justice has two aspects: as respects proceedings in the court itself it requires that they should be held in open court to which the press and public are admitted and that, in criminal cases at any rate, all evidence communicated to the court is communicated publicly. As respects the publication to a wider public of fair and accurate reports of proceedings that have taken place in court the principle requires that nothing should be done to discourage this.

9       The principle of open justice is given statutory recognition in Singapore through s 8(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) and s 7(1) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed):

> **Sittings** **_in camera_**

> **8.—(1**)    The place in which any court is held for the purpose of trying any cause or matter, civil or criminal, shall be deemed an open and public court to which the public generally may have access.

> **Sittings** **_in camera_** **, etc.**

> **7.—(1**)    The place in which any State Court is held shall be deemed an open and public court to which the public generally may have access.

10     But as Lord Diplock continued in _Leveller_ at 450, “since the purpose of the general rule \[of open justice\] is to serve the ends of justice it may be necessary to depart from it \[based on\] the nature or circumstances of the particular proceeding”. A departure would be justified where “the application of the general rule in its entirety would frustrate or render impracticable the administration of justice or would damage some other public interest for whose protection Parliament had made some statutory derogation from the rule.”

11     In Singapore, there is a clear public policy of safeguarding the welfare of children involved in court proceedings by protecting them from identification through the court proceedings. So strong is the public policy underpinning this safeguard that it outweighs the principle of open justice on which the legal system otherwise operates. The safeguard extends even to criminal proceedings, where the public interest in open justice is the strongest and the law permits the publication of the identity of accused persons, despite the damage that such publication can do to an accused person who is subsequently acquitted (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (14 May 2012) vol 89 at pp 188–189 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law):

> Our legal system operates on the principle of public justice. Accused persons are publicly tried. The verdict of the court is publicly announced. Reporting of ongoing proceedings is allowed so long as it does not prejudice the proper administration of justice. The _exceptions_ to the principle are limited – they mainly apply to protect sensitive information relating to national security, as well as the _identities of young persons_. …

> Lawyers from the Bar would know that the publicity from a criminal trial is often very damaging to the accused, even if he is ultimately acquitted. … The solution to adverse publicity during ongoing proceedings must be to increase public awareness that a charge is not the same as a conviction, and that an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty by a court of law. But I accept and recognise that this is a significantly uphill task.

> \[Emphasis added\]

12     This public policy of protecting children and young persons involved in court proceedings from identification applies even if the child has been convicted of a serious offence. In _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 709</span>, a minor was found to have raped his victim after threatening to pull a knife on her. Woo Bih Li J held, by reference to s 35(1)(a) of the CYPA, that it was in the interests of justice to restrain the publication of the name and other identifying particulars of the minor (at \[49\]).

> Separately, the Defence applied under s 35(1)(a) of the CYPA for an order prohibiting the publication of the Accused’s name and other identifying particulars. Sections 35(1)(a) and 35(2) of the CYPA provide, broadly speaking, that no person shall publish the identifying particulars of a “child or young person” concerned in any court proceedings, unless the court or the Minister is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to order otherwise. Section 2(1) of the CYPA defined a “young person” to mean “a person who is 14 years of age or above and below the age of 16 years”. In this case, the Defence argued that the protective policy of the CYPA applied as the Accused had committed the present offences when he was 14 years of age. The Prosecution quite fairly pointed out that the Accused was 14 years of age when he was first produced in the Youth Court. Thus, their position was that unless this court lifted it, the gag order would “still exist”. In any event, the Prosecution made no submissions on whether the gag order should be lifted or not. In the circumstances, I was of the view that s 35(1)(a) of the CYPA still applied.

This decision was eventually affirmed on appeal in _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 941</span>, and the prohibition on publication of the name and other identifying details of the minor continued to apply even during the hearing of the appeal.

13     Protecting the identity of a child involved in court proceedings insulates him from media coverage of his offences and facilitates his rehabilitation and re-integration into society. Media coverage of juvenile offences that identifies the offender often produces negative consequences, as elucidated by Nominated Member of Parliament Prof Lim Sun Sun at the Second Reading of the Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill 2019 (No 22 of 2019). First, the public shaming of the offender can heighten tensions within his family and fracture the very unit of society that is pivotal to his rehabilitation. Second, the public shaming can also cause the offender to be ostracised by his peers and teachers, and thus cripple community-based rehabilitation measures. Third, the public record of the offence, particularly in this digital age where electronic records are durable and replicable, compromises the education and employment prospects of the offender. Perversely, too, the publicity can give the offender celebrity status, encourage him to re-offend, and inspire other young persons to commit similar offences (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (4 September 2019) vol 94).

14     Recognising that “labelling \[a child\] as an ex-offender makes reintegration more difficult for him or her”, Parliament has moved to enhance the protection of the identity and privacy of young offenders (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (5 September 2019) vol 94 (Desmond Lee, Minster for Social and Family Development)). On 4 September 2019, Parliament passed the Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill 2019 (No 30 of 2019) to further protect children involved in court proceedings from identification. Thereunder, s 35(1) of the CYPA will be replaced with two provisions that extend the _scope_ and _duration_ of the protections that it confers: the new ss 84A and 84B of the CYPA. The latter will substantially reproduce s 35(1) of the CYPA and maintain the protections therein even after the child has attained 18 years of age. The former will further restrict the publication of information that leads to the identification of any child who is the subject of investigations under the CYPA or who has been arrested for offences under any written law, and maintain such protection even after the child has attained 18 years of age. But these amendments have yet to take effect.

15     Still, the public interest in protecting children and young persons involved in court proceedings from adverse publicity does not _ipso facto_ justify a blanket fetter on the publication of all information on those proceedings. Where the identity of the child or young person can be protected through a less restrictive fetter, a more restrictive fetter will not be imposed. Any fetter on the publication of information relating to court proceedings intrudes into the public interest of open justice. That public interest, as far as is practicable to do so, should be upheld (_Leveller_ at 450):

> Apart from statutory exceptions, however, where a court in the exercise of its inherent powers to control the conduct of proceedings before it departs in any way from the general rule \[of open justice\], the departure is justiﬁed to the extent and to no more than the extent that the court reasonably believes it to be necessary in order to serve the ends of justice.

## Decision

16     Before me, the plaintiffs accept that the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\] deserve protection and submit that adequate protection would be achieved through a redaction of all references to \[X\] and \[GCP\] in the substantive proceedings.[^1] The School however insists that a blanket prohibition on the access to all information relating to the proceedings is necessary to protect the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\]. Even as the Gag Order, _In-Camera_ Order, and Sealing Order sought by the School all limit the disclosure and publication of information relating to court proceedings, each operates in different ways and implicates different considerations. I will thus consider each separately.

### Gag Order

17     The School submits that the plaintiffs are inclined to publicise their allegations without regard to the adverse publicity that their doing so would bring \[X\].[^2] It points to the hosting by the Parents of a meeting of the other parents of female classmates of \[X\], even as police investigations were underway (after the Parents complained to the police about the alleged assault), at which they warned those other parents “to be careful for their girls’ safety”,[^3] and their description of the alleged assault as a “sexual assault” with “repeated and sustained penetration”.[^4] It adds that s 35(1) of the CYPA does not apply to \[X\], who is neither a party to nor a witness in the substantive proceedings, and that even a gag order on the name of \[X\] would not suffice because the other details that will be revealed in the proceedings will, if published, allow the public to piece together the identity of \[X\] like a “jigsaw”.[^5]

18     The plaintiffs do not deny characterising \[X\] as a “sexual assailant” and publicising their allegations to the parents of his female classmates. But they insist that the safeguards in s 35 of the CYPA are sufficient,[^6] and add that there is “a genuine and legitimate public interest for parents, students, teachers, school staff, other academic institutions, school accrediting bodies and sponsors \[of the School\] to know what is going on”.[^7]

19     At the time the substantive proceedings were commenced, and even today, both \[X\] and \[GCP\] are under 14 years of age. Each is thus a “child”, as defined in s 2(1) of the CYPA. That said, s 35(1) of the CYPA restricts the classes of children whom it protects. The provision applies only to a child who is “the person against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken” or who is “a witness therein”.

> **Restriction on publication of information relating to proceedings involving children and young persons**

> **35.—(1**)    Subject to subsection (2), no person shall —

>> (a)    publish or broadcast any information relating to any proceedings in any court or on appeal from any court that reveals the name, address or school or that includes any particulars that are calculated to lead to the identification of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings, either as being the person against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken or as being a witness therein; or

>> (b)    publish or broadcast any picture as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in any such proceedings.

> (2)    The court or the Minister may, if satisfied that it is in the interests of justice so to do, by order dispense with the requirements of subsection (1) to such extent as may be specified in the order.

20     \[X\] is not a party to these proceedings. Also, all the parties agree that it is unlikely that \[X\] would be called as a witness in the substantive proceedings. Hence, s 35(1) of the CYPA will apply to \[X\] only if \[X\] is a “person in respect of whom the proceedings are taken”.

#### Whether a child is a person “in respect of whom” proceedings are taken

21     The genesis of s 35(1) of the CYPA is s 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (23 & 24 Geo 5 c 12) (UK) (the “1933 Act”), as amended by the Children and Young Persons Act I963 (c 37) (UK). It empowers the court to restrain the publication of information that may identify children involved in court proceedings. But the power applies only when the child is the person “by” or “against” or “in respect of whom” the proceedings are taken, or is a “witness therein’.

> **Power to prohibit publication of certain matters in newspapers**

> **39.—(1**)    In relation to any proceedings in any court the court may direct that—

>> (a)    no newspaper report of the proceedings shall reveal the name, address, or school, or include any particulars calculated to lead to the identiﬁcation, of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings, either as being the person by or against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken, or as being a witness therein;

>> (b)    no picture shall be published in any newspaper as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in the proceedings as aforesaid;

> except in so far (if at all) as may be permitted by the direction of the court.

22     In _In re R (Wardship: Restrictions on Publication)_ \[1994\] Fam 254 (“_In re R_”), the child in question had been placed in the care and control of her mother with access granted to her father. The father removed the child from the mother and was charged with abducting the child. The guardian _ad litem_ applied in the criminal proceedings for an order to restrain the publication of any material that could lead to the identiﬁcation of the child. The English Court of Appeal held that s 39 of the 1933 Act applied to the child, who, as the "victim” of the alleged crime, was “a person in respect of whom the proceedings are taken” (at 267, _per_ Bingham MR).

> … it seems to me quite plain that the ward in the present case is ‘the person in respect of whom the proceedings are taken’, even though she is not the person ‘by or against whom’ proceedings are taken. She is the victim of the alleged crime, and is a person in respect of whom the proceedings are taken in just the same way as a child who is the victim of an alleged sexual offence or of ill-treatment.

23     In _In re Trinity Mirror plc and others (A and another intervening)_ \[2008\] EWCA Crim 50 (“_In re Trinity Mirror_”), following the defendant’s conviction on child pornography charges, the trial court made an order to restrain the media from identifying the defendant. The trial court intended to protect the children of the defendant although they had not been witnesses in the proceedings against him nor were they victims of his offences. The English Court of Appeal set the order aside and held that s 39(1) of the 1933 Act did not apply to the children because they were “neither complainants ‘by … whom’, nor defendants ‘against … whom’, nor victims ‘in respect of whom’, the proceedings were taken, nor witnesses in them”. It rejected an argument that the children were, even if not “concerned in the proceedings” as specified in s 39 of the 1933 Act, were “just as likely to suffer significant harm if they are identified” and thus deserving of the protection of the statute. Explaining that for “children not concerned in a criminal trial, there has been a legislative choice not to extend the right to restrain publicity to them” (at \[25\]), the appellate court observed that the suffering of the defendant’s children was simply an unfortunate consequence of his crime (at \[33\]).

> It is sad, but true, that the criminal activities of a parent can bring misery, shame, and disadvantage to their innocent children. Innocent parents suffer from the criminal activities of their sons and daughters. Husbands and wives and partners all suffer in the same way. All this represents the further consequences of crime, adding to the list of its victims. Everyone appreciates the risk that innocent children may suffer prejudice and damage when a parent is convicted of a serious offence. Among the consequences, the parent will disappear from home when he or she is sentenced to imprisonment, and indeed, depending on the crime but as happened in this case, there is always a possibility of the breakdown of the relationship between their parents. … there is nothing in this case to distinguish the plight of the defendant’s children from that of a massive group of children of persons convicted of offences relating to child pornography.

24     In Singapore, the only reported decisions where s 35(1) of the CYPA has been applied to a child who are not a party to or a witness in the proceedings have involved divorce proceedings before the Family Justice Courts (see _AZB v AZC_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 1</span> and _UPY v UPZ_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 101</span> (“_UPY_”)). In each case, the parents, who were the only parties to the proceedings, contested the issue the care and custody of the children of the marriage. Each child was thus the “subject of” the proceedings and accordingly “a person in respect of whom the proceedings are taken” (_UPY_ at \[63\]).

25     In my view, a child who is neither a party to nor a witness in court proceedings can yet be a “person in respect of whom the proceedings are taken” within s 35(1) of the CYPA only if he is _directly concerned_ in the proceedings. Such is the case with a victim in criminal proceedings, whose injuries form at least part of the basis for the taking of the proceedings. Such is also the case with a child in care and custody proceedings, where “the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child” (s 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)). Only a child who is directly concerned in proceedings will be directly disgraced by adverse publicity on his _actions, injuries, or attributes that are the subject matter of the proceedings_, which disgrace is the mischief of s 35(1) of the CYPA. As much as a child who is only indirectly concerned in the proceedings may suffer from adverse publicity on the proceedings, his suffering will be due not to the publicity on his actions, injuries, or attributes but to the publicity on his _association_ with the persons who are directly involved in the proceedings. Such an association may engender a reaction on the part of the peers of the child that may in turn leave a negative psychiatric impact on the child. But this psychiatric impact is not the mischief of s 35(1) of the CYPA.

26     To illustrate this distinction, I refer to the observations of the English Court of Appeal in _In re S (A Child) (Identiﬁcation: Restrictions on Publication)_ \[2004\] Fam 43 (“_In re S_”), which was affirmed by the House of Lords in _In re S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication)_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 AC 593</span>. The child in question (“CS”) was the subject of care proceedings brought by his father following the death of his brother by salt poisoning. Separate criminal proceedings had been initiated against CS’ mother for the salt poisoning. The criminal court held that s 39 of the 1933 Act did not apply to CS, who was not the person by or against or in respect of whom the criminal proceedings were taken. In the family proceedings, the Court of Appeal agreed with the decision of the criminal court and observed that any adverse publicity on the actions of CS’ mother (in the criminal proceedings) would not be directed at CS but relate only peripherally to him (at \[105\]–\[106\], _per_ Latham LJ).

> The trial of the mother of CS will not directly involve him and, inasmuch as a full report of the trial, including his mother’s name, will affect him, this is likely to be indirectly, by reason of his association with her. The adverse impact on CS relied upon is not that the publication will affect the way in which he is being brought up and cared for. It is the psychiatric effect that the full publication may have on him as a consequence of the reaction of his peers to the publicity.

27     Still, in _In re S_, Hale LJ (who dissented, but not on this point) observed that CS was “in a very real sense, a victim of the alleged offence” and that if his deceased brother had remained alive, a gag order could lie to restrain identification of the mother (which restraint would also benefit CS). Hale LJ added that “ha\[ving\] lost his brother, his mother, and his family life \[CS\] is at much greater risk of suffering serious psychiatric ill-health in future”, and that “there is little logic in failing to afford such protection to a child in the unenviable position in which CS ﬁnds himself” ( at \[39\]). There is force in these observations, although the legislative choice thus far has been to limit the protection of s 35(1) of the CYPA to children who are directly concerned in the court proceedings. Nevertheless, the new s 84A of the CYPA extends the protection some way, including by restraining the publication of the information of children who are the subject of any investigation under the CYPA (see s 50 of the Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill 2019).

#### Whether \[X\] is directly connected in the substantive proceedings

28     In my judgment, \[X\] is directly concerned in the substantive proceedings and is thus a person “in respect of whom” the proceedings have been taken for the purpose of s 35(1) of the CYPA. Although the plaintiffs frame their claims against the School as one in negligence by \[GCP\] and one for breach of the enrolment contract by the Parents, the subject matter of their claims and the substance of the proceedings is the actions and attributes of \[X\].

29     The “particulars of negligence” in the statement of claim centre on a propensity or history of “bullying” by \[X\], and the inadequacy of remedial measures taken by the School with respect to \[X\] following the alleged assault:[^8]

> \[The School’s\] lack of or inadequate policy or system on student monitoring and feedback on students, appropriate for infant students aged 4 to 7 years, or the lack of or inadequate compliance with such policy or system (if any), which could have otherwise identiﬁed students of \[the School\] who potentially may have a propensity for or demonstrated history of bullying others, and thus, they be put on an internal ‘watchlist’ by \[the School\] for additional monitoring by its staff to reduce the risk of incidents involving such students from arising, and whereby \[\[X\]\] would have fallen under such ‘radar’ of \[the School\] given that \[\[GCP\]\] and other classmates have described \[\[X\]\] as being very rough and aggressive.

> …

> \[The School\] recommended for \[\[GCP\]\] and \[\[X\]\] to continue in the same class until the end of grade 1, which would be for another 3 months, thereby forcing \[\[GCP\]\] to see her attacker every day in class, and perhaps even interact with him, which would continue to traumatise \[\[GCP\]\], who has a demonstrated fear and aversion against \[\[X\]\] after the Attack.

30     The breaches of the enrolment contract pleaded in the statement of claim relate to a contractual duty of care that is co-extensive with the tortious duty of care the breach of which forms the basis of \[GCP\]’s claim in negligence:[^9]

> By reason of the aforesaid \[the School\] had also breached the contractual duty of care in the \[Enrolment\] Contract … All the particulars under \[\[GCP’s\] negligence claim\] are repeated herein as particulars of the contractual breaches.

> As a result of \[the School’s\] contractual breaches, \[the Parents\] did not receive or fully receive the contractual peace of mind … and suffered intangible loss, including mental distress, emotional distress, injury to personality and injury to feelings.

31     Indeed, the plaintiffs conclude their statement of claim by “reserve\[ing\] all their rights against \[\[X\]\] and his parents, to be exercised at the appropriate juncture if necessary” as to the matters pleaded therein.[^10]

32     Ultimately, the claims by the plaintiffs against the School are so intertwined with their allegations on the actions and attributes of \[X\] as to make \[X\] a person directly concerned in the substantive proceedings. Any publication of the proceedings and the unflattering portrayal of his actions and attributes therein would directly disgrace \[X\], which disgrace is the mischief of s 35(1) of the CYPA. Because \[X\] was a child at the material time, s 35(1) of the CYPA restrains the publication by any person of the “name”, “address”, or “school” of \[X\], or of “any particulars that are calculated to lead to the identification” of \[X\] (collectively, the “Identifiers”). The restraint on the publication of these Identifiers also assuages the risk that the public will be able to piece together the identity of \[X\] like a “jigsaw” from information published about the proceedings.

33     The School offers no argument or evidence to justify the Gag Order apart from the public interest in protecting \[X\] from identification. Given my finding that s 35(1) of the CYPA applies to \[X\], there is no need for me to consider making the Gag Order on other bases. I will not therefore do so.

34     For completeness, \[GCP\] is also a party to the substantive proceedings. Accordingly, s 35(1) of the CYPA applies to her as well.

## In-Camera _Order_

35     The School seeks the _In-Camera_ Order based on its general arguments about the public interest in protecting \[X\] from identification through court proceedings. It makes little specific argument on why the _In-Camera_ Order should be granted on the facts of this case.[^11]

36     The plaintiffs argue that an _in-camera_ order is unnecessary because only the audience at trial can learn of the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\], with s 35(1) of the CYPA restraining further publication of their identities, and that any concern about such a limited audience knowing their identities is outweighed by the interest of the public in witnessing the judicial process.[^12] They add that even if an _in-camera_ order is granted, it should be limited to the testimony of \[X\] and \[GCP\] and not extend to that of the School, because of the keen and legitimate interest of the stakeholders of the School in its processes.[^13]

37     The power of the District Court to hear proceedings _in camera_ is located in s 7(2) of the State Courts Act:

> **Sittings** **_in camera_** **, etc.**

> **7**.— …

>> (2)    A State Court shall have power to hear any matter or proceeding or any part thereof _In Camera_ if the court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or for other sufficient reason to do so.

38     An _in-camera_ order entails the hearing of a matter in “secret” (see _JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 484</span> (“_JD Ltd_”) at \[65\]–\[66\]). This is a departure from the general rule of procedure for civil trials that cases are heard in open court (see O 38 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC”). Although the court has a “broad discretion” to make an _in-camera_ order, it will be slow to do so and will exercise the power only after balancing all the relevant circumstances of the case (see _BBW v BBX and others_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 755</span> (“_BBW_”) at \[40\]–\[41\]). One key consideration in this regard is the nature of the interest protected. Where the subject matter of the proceedings is confidential, an _in-camera_ order may be made for the entire proceedings, as with international arbitration proceedings and taxation proceedings. Where a witness is vulnerable but the subject matter of the proceedings is not otherwise confidential, an _in-camera_ order may be restricted to the testimony of the witness, as s 7(6) of the State Courts Act contemplates.

> **Sittings** **_in camera_** **, etc.**

> **7**.— …

>> (6)    For the purposes of subsection (2), the matters that a State Court may consider, when deciding whether it is expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or for other sufficient reason, to hear the whole or any part of any matter or proceeding _In Camera_, include the following matters:

>>> (a)    whether the defence of any accused person in that matter or proceeding will be prejudiced by the presence of any member of the public in the courtroom;

>>> (b)    whether any accused person or witness in that matter or proceeding has any legitimate interest in privacy that needs to be protected;

>>> (c)    whether the object of that matter or proceeding will be defeated by publicity if that matter or proceeding is heard in open court;

>>> (d)    whether any accused person or witness in that matter or proceeding has any legitimate interest in protecting the confidentiality of any information that may be disclosed during the hearing of that matter or proceeding;

>>> (e)    whether any information that may be disclosed during the hearing of that matter or proceeding will be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore.

39     I agree with the plaintiffs that the segment of the public who may learn of the identities \[X\] and \[GCP\] through the substantive proceedings is small: only those who attend the trial, and then only if this matter proceeds to trial. Any further publication of the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\] by these attendees is prohibited by s 35(1) of the CYPA. Balancing this limited exposure of the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\] against the wider interest of the public in observing the judicial process, it is unclear that there is good reason for the blanket _In-Camera_ Order sought by the School. As much as the likely audience in the proceedings may comprise the stakeholders of the School, the stakeholders constitute only a miniscule segment of the public. I do not think that their learning of the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\] will give rise to adverse publicity to the general public that undermines their long-term welfare. Parliament has limited the operation of s 35(1) of the CYPA to prohibiting the publication of information that may identify a child concerned therein, without further stipulating that all court proceedings involving children shall by default be heard _in camera_. The School provides no explanation or evidence why the situation involving \[X\] is so exceptional to justify the blanket _In-Camera_ Order.

40     It is not even necessary that the testimonies of \[X\] and \[GCP\] should be provided _in camera_. I have found that there is no public interest in keeping these proceedings confidential, beyond that which can be addressed by s 35(1) of the CYPA and a redaction of references to \[X\] and \[GCP\] in the court documents. Moreover, there is no suggestion that \[X\] or \[GCP\] will be vulnerable witnesses in the substantive proceedings who will have difficultly giving their evidence in open court. \[X\] will probably not even be called as a witness. \[GCP\] declares through her litigation representative, the 2nd plaintiff, that “she is prepared to tell her side of the story in open court”. And the Parents are likewise of the view that such testimony in open court “is what she wants and in her best interest.”[^14]

41     I thus decline to grant the blanket _In-Camera_ Order sought by the School or any _in-camera_ order of a reduced scope.

### Sealing Order

42     As with the _In-Camera_ Order, the School seeks the Sealing Order based on its general arguments about the public interest in protecting \[X\] from identification through court proceedings. It makes little specific argument on why the Sealing Order should be granted on the facts of this case.[^15]

43     The plaintiffs resist the Sealing Order for three reasons. First, even without a Sealing Order, the public will still require the leave of the court to inspect the case file. Second, not every court document that may be filed will contain information that will lead to the identification of \[X\] and \[GCP\]. Third, there is a less restrictive alternative of redacting the relevant portions (_ie_, the references to \[X\] and \[GCP\]) in the court documents, which would adequately protect the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\].

44     A sealing order prevents public access to documents filed in court. It is made by a court in an exercise of its inherent power to ensure the achievement of justice and the efficacy of its administration. Where a sealing order has been granted, no leave will be granted for the public to inspect or copy the documents that have been filed. This is a departure from the general rule that inspection and copying of documents in a case file will be allowed once the matter has been heard and determined (_BBW_ at \[27\] at \[32\]).

45     In my view, the blanket Sealing Order sought by the School is excessive. As the plaintiffs submit, not every document filed in the substantive proceedings can reasonably be understood as identifying \[X\] or \[GCP\]. More importantly, there is a viable alternative for protecting the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\] that will make less intrusion into the public interest in open justice: redacting of references to \[X\] and \[GCP\] in the court documents. The requirement that any person obtain the leave of the Registrar before inspecting and copying any documents filed in these proceedings (see O 60 r 4 of the ROC) provides a further safeguard on the identities of \[X\] and \[GCP\].

46     I thus decline to grant the blanket Sealing Order sought by the School or any sealing order of a reduced scope. But I order the redaction of all references in the proceedings to \[X\] and \[GCP\]. The plaintiffs have offered to assist with the redaction, and I order them to do so.

## Conclusion

47     For the reasons above, I granted the Gag Order but only in the terms of s 35 (1) of the CYPA and only in respect of \[X\] and \[GCP\]. I also ordered the redaction in these proceedings of all references to \[X\] and \[GCP\]. The plaintiffs had offered to assist with the redaction, and I directed them to do so. But I did not grant the Sealing Order or the _In-Camera_ Order.

48     I granted the costs and disbursements of the application to the plaintiffs fixed at $1,000 and $500 respectively.
