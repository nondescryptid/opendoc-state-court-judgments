\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9196/2019/01.\]

10 September 2019

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The victim named in the charge was the boyfriend of the accused’s late daughter. The charge reads:

> are charged that you, on the 1 December 2018, at about 10.30 pm, along the pavement of Woodlands Centre Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Durvesh Kannan s/o Murugason, _to wit_, by throwing punches at him which were directed towards his facial region, hence causing him to sustain a left nasal bone fracture, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)

2       The accused was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. Against that sentence, the defence has brought this appeal.

## Summary of facts

3       The victim was aged 23 years at the time of the incident. The accused’s late daughter was 18 years old when she committed suicide on 4 December 2017.

4       On the evening of 1 December 2018, the accused had attended the first death anniversary memorial of his late daughter. Thereafter, he decided to have coffee with his friend. Whilst walking along the pavement of Woodlands Centre Road at about 10.30 pm, he saw the victim from a distance.

5       The accused became emotional and confronted the victim about his daughter’s death. The accused shouted some vulgarities at the victim and caught him by his shirt. He then started to rain punches on the victim’s facial area, while scolding the victim. The accused’s friend stepped in and tried to stop the accused. This enabled the victim to flee. The accused gave chase. While running, the accused knocked into a young girl who was with her father. The accused stopped chasing the victim thereafter to help the girl up.

6       On 2 December 2018 at about 1.38 am, the victim was attended to by a doctor at the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. He had blood stain from both nostrils. There was also tenderness on the left side of his head. A CT scan revealed a left nasal bone fracture. He was treated with anti-tetanus and analgesia. He was given an appointment to see the ENT team as an outpatient in the following week.

## Antecedents

7       In 1996, the accused was fined $6,000 for criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the Penal Code. A similar charge was taken into consideration. In 1997, he was fined $3,600 for an offence under the Films Act (Cap 107). In 2002, he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for being armed with an offensive instrument under s 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) and was fined a total of $2,400 and disqualified from driving for 15 months for an offence of taking a motor vehicle without consent, driving without a licence and without insurance coverage.

## Mitigation

8       The accused is aged 51 years. He is the sole breadwinner of the family.

9       It was submitted that the accused has no anger related issues and did not act without reason. It was said that he wanted closure on the death of his beloved daughter by uncovering the truth about her death from the victim who was her boyfriend. The accused had learnt from friends of his late daughter that the victim was the last person whom she met before she committed suicide. The accused was therefore convinced that the victim knew the reason behind his late daughter’s decision to end her life. In addition, the victim had through a Tweet posted that “no one will ever know the truth except me and you”.

10     In order to seek closure, the accused had on multiple occasions attempted to contact the victim to find out what had happened on the day of the suicide. However, the victim and his family repeatedly avoided the accused.

11     It was said that the accused was extremely emotional and unstable on the day of the incident, which was the one-year anniversary of his daughter’s passing. The accused happened to see the victim coincidentally. He was then feeling extremely aggrieved and walked towards the victim and demanded for an explanation for his daughter’s death. However, the victim refused to speak to him and the incident then happened.

## Sentence

12     Section 323 provides for an imprisonment term of up to two years or fine up to $5,000 or both.

13     Learned counsel submitted for the maximum fine. On the other hand, the prosecution sought an imprisonment term of five weeks’.

14     In assessing sentence, the first step is to determine the seriousness of the injury caused, having regard to considerations such as the nature and permanence of the injury. Here, the victim had blood stain from both nostrils and suffered a nasal bone fracture.

15     The second step is to assess the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. In this regard, the manner and duration of the attack are relevant.

16     In _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>, the High Court laid down the following indicative sentencing range based on the nature of the hurt.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.22%"> <col width="43.68%"> <col width="44.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Hurt caused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indicative Sentencing Range</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

17     There was no dispute that the hurt caused which involved a nasal fracture fell within the second band of moderate hurt. The next question was where the hurt fell within the indicative sentencing range of between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment. In _Low Song Chye_, it was said that this should be determined ‘with regard to the relative severity of the hurt sustained as compared to other forms of hurt that would fall within this band. Regard should also be had to relevant sentencing precedents.’

18     I noted that the victim was not warded. He was treated with an injection and painkillers and given a review in one week’s time. As such, I took the view the sentencing range ought not to exceed eight weeks’ imprisonment which was imposed in _Public Prosecutor v Holman, Benjamin John_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 824</span> for an assault which took place on an MRT platform where the most serious injury suffered by the victim was a nasal bone fracture. The offender pushed the victim on the chest and the offender and the victim soon came to blows. The offender punched the victim multiple times on the face and the victim crouched at some point during the exchange of blows. I therefore took the indicative sentencing range to be between four weeks’ to eight weeks’ imprisonment.

19     I next turned to the accused’s culpability and the aggravating and mitigating factors. With regard to the manner and duration of the attack, I noted that the accused did not give a single punch but had rained punches on the victim’s facial area. The attack ceased when the victim escaped after the accused’s friend intervened. However, the accused still tried to chase the victim but was unsuccessful.

20     I was unable to accept the assertion that the accused had “not acted without reason”. Whilst I sympathised with the accused over the loss of his teenage daughter and that the incident occurred on her first death anniversary which would have been a painful reminder of her death, this cannot excuse the use of violence against the victim. The victim did not do anything to provoke the accused. It was the accused who spotted him from a distance and sought to confront him. The victim also did not fight back during the assault and ran away when he had the opportunity to do so.

21     The fact that the victim had refused to give any explanation to the accused was not mitigating. As it was an unnatural death, the death was reported to the Coroner and the circumstances of the death were investigated by the police. It was accepted that the accused was aware of the investigations as he and his wife were interviewed. The accused was aware that the police found that there was no foul play. Accordingly, the accused must have been apprised of the findings of the police investigations into the death. In any case, as the next of kin, he could have ascertained the answers to any questions that he wanted pertaining to the death from the investigation officer or obtained the findings from the Coroner’s Court. As there were proper avenues available to obtain the answers that he was seeking, there was no reason for him to take matters into his own hands and confront the victim and to use violence against him.

22     Accordingly, other than the accused’s early plea of guilt, there were hardly any other mitigating circumstances. I accorded some leniency due to the fact that the incident occurred on the day of the first death anniversary. However, this fact alone did not warrant a sentence below the indicative sentence range. In my view, a sentence at the start of the sentencing range was just and proportionate and the accused was sentenced accordingly.
