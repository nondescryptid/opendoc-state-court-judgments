### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## The Introduction

1       The accused, a 53-year old male Singaporean, claimed trial to seven counts of committing criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) under s 406 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). He was convicted after a trial and was sentenced to a total of 34 weeks’ imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay compensation to the victims in the sum of SGD$47,600, in default of which he was to serve 76 days’ imprisonment.

2       The accused, being dissatisfied with the conviction and the sentence that I have imposed, has appealed against it.

## The Charges

3       The accused was charged with committing CBT by dishonestly misappropriating monies entrusted to him by three of his colleagues, namely Chye Mei Mei (“PW2”), Lee Fong Chin (“PW3”) and Chia Wei Ling (“PW4”), to change from monies Singapore dollars (“SGD”) into Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR”). The brief details relating to the seven charges are summarised as follows:

## The case for the Prosecution

### The introduction to a higher exchange rate

4       At the material time, the accused and the three victims were colleagues working at SATS Pte Ltd. The three victims are friends. They are Malaysians (Singapore Permanent Residents) working in Singapore and as such, they often convert their pay, which was in SGD, into MYR.

5       Sometime at the end of 2017, the three victims came to know that the accused was exchanging SGD to MYR on behalf of some of their colleagues. The exchange rate offered by the accused was quite attractive. The accused explained to the three victims that it was possible for him to obtain such attractive exchange rates because his mother-in-law was a licenced moneychanger, and that his wife was working for her.

6       In order to get a good exchange rate, the monies, in SGD, would have to be placed with the accused for an agreed number of days. On the agreed due date, the monies would then be returned to them at the agreed rate in MYR (an “arrangement”).

7       The three victims then began exchanging SGD to MYR through the accused. The initial amounts exchanged were smaller and the victims received their MYR in exchange for their SGD on the agreed dates.[^1]

8       On 4 January 2018, the accused forwarded an e-mail (timed: 0847 hrs) to the three victims purportedly sent by one “Julianma Abdul Malek” (from e-mail address _Juliama abdmalek@bnm.gov.my_ ), a “Senior exchange manager” at Bank Negara Malaysia (“BNM”), setting out the rates at which MYR would be sold by BNM for the period 10 January to 15 February 2018.

9       The rates would be higher the longer the money would be kept at the bank and the larger amount of MYR bought[^2]. The rates offered through this e-mail were not only significantly higher than those offered by moneychangers but also higher than the rates the accused had previously offered to them.

10     Later that morning, the accused forwarded two other e-mails to the three victims (timed: 0909 hrs and 1057 hrs respectively), both purportedly from his wife, “Su” (email address: _Su\_mdhibrahim@Maybank.Mbox3.com.my_). The first attached the same e-mail from “Julianma Abdul Malek” that the accused had earlier forwarded whilst the second was an e-mail from “Su” offering exchange rates that were higher than those offered in the earlier e-mail.[^3]

11     On 11 January 2018, the accused again forwarded to the victims another e-mail purportedly from his wife “Su” (timed: 0927 hrs), attaching yet another e-mail from “Julianma Abdul Malek”[^4]. The rates supposedly offered by BNM were this time even higher still. To suggest exclusivity, these rates were offered to _“the same 04 regulars only”._

12     As a result of the attractive exchange rates offered, the three victims made several arrangements with the accused. They would eventually place some SGD$52,000, in seven arrangements, with him. Unfortunately, the accused failed to return the monies entrusted to him on the agreed dates, either in MYR or in SGD. To date, except for a sum of SGD$4,000[^5] that was repaid to PW2, none of the other monies have been repaid.

### The arrangements

13     In his closing submission, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) had succinctly summarised the arrangements between the three victims and the accused[^6] that formed the particulars of the charges faced by the accused. For convenience, this is set out below.

14     In addition to the above, the following should be noted that:

> (a)     PW2 and PW3 entered Arrangements C1 and C4 together as they wanted to obtain the higher preferential exchange rate of 5.15 which was available to sums of at least SGD$10,000;[^7]

> (b)     PW2 and PW3 also entered Arrangements C2 and C5 together as they wanted to obtain the higher preferential exchange rate of 5.50[^8] which was available for amounts of at least SGD$20,000;

> (c)     PW4 had entered Arrangements C6 and C7 by herself, without the involvement of PW2 and PW3. Although the amounts put in by PW4 were lower, the accused had agreed to the higher exchange rate provide she kept the money with him for 30 days;[^9]

> (d)     For Arrangement C6, the actual arrangement was for a sum of $10,500 at an exchange rate of 5.15.[^10] It should be noted that the corresponding charged stated that the amount involved was SGD$10,100 but PW3 had explained that this was because the accused still owed her SGD$400 from a previous arrangement.

### The deception and excuses

15     Eventually, these arrangements became due. However, the accused failed to repay the monies to the three victims the agreed amounts in MYR. Not surprisingly, the three victims pressed the accused for the return of the said monies. The accused then told the three victims that he would speak to his wife regarding the return of the monies.

16     The documentary evidence showed that the first e-mail exchange between PW2 and “Su”, the accused’s wife, occurred on 21 January 2018[^11], after Arrangement C3 became due. In her reply to PW2, “Su” attributed the delay in returning the money to BNM who had apparently embargoed the exchange of MYR. Thereafter, the e-mail communication carried on between PW2 and “Su” until 31 January 2018 with ‘Su” giving numerous reasons for the delay. It should be noted that none of the victims have ever met “Su” and all communications between them were through e-mail.

17     The three victims were then told by the accused that his wife was going to Kuala Lumpur (“KL”) to get the monies, but on the way to KL, she had been hit on the head by falling luggage and she was unable to continue with her trip to KL. They were told that someone else would be contacting them instead. This person eventually turned out to be one “Agnes Lee”, supposedly one of “Su’s” staff.

18     Eventually, “Agnes Lee” contacted the victims on 31 January 2018 (timed: 2033 hrs) (from e-mail address _XXX@gmail.com_). Like ‘Su”, she also contacted the victims only _via_ e-mail. She informed them that she would help them to solve the problem. However, despite her many assurances, nothing came out of it. Throughout this time, “Agnes Lee” had given them numerous excuses why she was unable to repay them their monies, including the reason that there was a shortage of MYR stocks. The e-mail exchanges between the victims and “Agnes Lee” lasted until as late as early April 2018, long after the due dates of the various arrangements.

19     At the end of the day, all the victims received were excuses upon excuses that were given by either by the accused, his wife “Su” and / or “Agnes Lee” as to why they were unable to recover the monies.

20     Not surprisingly, the victims became frustrated and on 13 April 2018, the three of them met the accused at PW4’s office. During what was a heated exchange, the accused agreed to repay the monies but caveated that his lawyer told him that he could not hand over the monies to them and that the lawyer was in possession of the money. He claimed that his lawyer had advised him to go through the court process to effect the return the money. The accused waved what purported to be a letter from his lawyer but, according to the victims, they never saw the actual contents of the letter. In their minds, it was simply another attempt by the accused to delay the return their monies.[^12]

21     By 16 April 2018, except for SGD$4,000 from Arrangement C3 that had been returned to PW2 but after the due date, the three victims had yet to receive the remainder of their monies from the accused.

22     This issue eventually came to the attention of the victims’ senior manager, one Linda, who then reported the issue to the Senior Vice President in charge. The three victims were advised to file a police report. Accordingly, on the evening of 16 April 2018, PW2 and PW4 proceeded to file a police report at the Airport Police Division.[^13] PW2’s police report was filed on behalf of PW3.

## The case for the Defence

23     For a start, it was very difficult to determine what exactly was the accused’s defence. It was not easy to decipher his evidence. The accused's defence only became clearer during the course of the learned DPP’s cross-examination of the accused. It became obviously clear that he had failed to ask the Prosecution’s witnesses very important questions relating to his defence, in particular, the allegation of PW2’s complicity in the deception. Therefore, with the concurrence of the Prosecution, PW2 was recalled affording the accused an opportunity to cross-examine PW2 on her alleged complicity, in the interest of justice.

### The Indonesian scheme

24     According to the accused, he was involved in a scheme in Indonesia together with one “Dr Anatasia” and her brother (collectively, “the Indonesians”). This scheme involved him placing SGD$50,000 with the Indonesians for a period of four years (“the long-term deposit” or “LTD”). At the end of this period, the SGD$50,000 would be returned to him.

25     How the accused would benefit from this was that during the duration of the LTD, he would be allowed to exchange up to SGD$50,000, or whatever the amount that was held in the LTD, into foreign currencies of his choice at a preferential exchange rate. However, this was provided that the accused placed that additional amount that he wanted to exchange with the Indonesians for a determined number of days (“short-term deposit” or “STD”) and the actual preferential rate would be determined by the amount placed in the STD. For example, if he wanted to exchange SGD$10,000 at a rate of say SGD$1.00 = MYR$5.00, he would have to place SGD$10,000 with the Indonesians for a pre-determined period, say 30 days, to obtain that preferential rate. At the end of the 30 days, he would then receive the STD in MYR, in this example, MYR$50,000.

26     In the event the accused did not keep the agreed amount in the STD for the requisite period, he would not be entitled to the preferential exchange rate. Instead, he would be able to get back the STD in MYR at the prevailing exchange rate. However, whatever balance that was not withdrawn from the STD would move into the LTD. From the example at \[25\] above, if the accused had wanted to withdraw, say SGD$5,000 from the SGD$10,000 he had placed in the STD, he would receive this amount in MYR at the prevailing exchange rate. The remaining SGD$5,000 would then be moved in the LTD and would be added to the SGD$50,000 in the LTD for the remaining duration of the LTD.

27     Unfortunately, the accused did not have any documentary evidence regarding this scheme and how it was supposed to work. He was unable to explain many aspects of the scheme, for example, why would the money in the STD would move to the LTD or why a person would leave money in the STD instead of withdrawing it in full in order to prevent the money from moving into the LTD, hence effectively tying up the money until the LTD became due.

### The complicity involving PW2

28     The second plank of the accused’s defence is his allegation that PW2, Chye Mei Mei, was complicit in the deception of PW3 and PW4. When PW2 became aware that the accused was changing SGD to MYR at extremely good rates, she too wanted to exchange her SGD into MYR. However, PW2 warned the accused that his employment may be terminated if the company discovered what he was doing. She therefore suggested that his ability to secure such good exchange rates should be attributed to his wife and / or family members[^14].

29     According to the accused, although PW2 was unaware at this time as to the precise nature of the Indonesian scheme, she understood that the larger the amount that was placed with the accused, the better the exchange rate would be. She therefore sat down with the accused and devised all the fake names and e-mails found in exhibits P6 and P14. These were the e-mails from “Julianma Abdul Malek”, setting out the rates at which BNM would purportedly sell MYR as well as the e-mails from “Su”, his wife. The accused explained that these e-mails were sent to ensure that PW3 and PW4 would join in the arrangements so that she, PW2, would enjoy the benefit of the higher exchange rates.

30     It is the accused’s evidence that it was PW2 who had told him to make the withdrawals from Arrangements C1 to C3 before the due date, which in turn affected Arrangement C4 and C5.

> (a)      Arrangement C1 (SGD$5,000). Less than a week after entering into Arrangement C1, PW2 told the accused that she wanted her money back urgently. Being unable to get the money back from the Indonesians, the accused proceeded to change SGD$5,000 of his own money and return it to PW2 (or her husband) in MYR at the prevailing exchange rate;[^15]

> (b)      Arrangement C2 (SGD$12,000). Sometime before the due date on 23 January 2018, PW2 told the accused that she wished to withdraw from Arrangement C2 to pay for her renovation works. PW2 wanted SGD$10,000 to be returned, but the accused could only return SGD$7,000 to her as that was all the Indonesians could return at that time due to currency controls. He returned this money to PW2’s husband before 23 January 2018. The balance of SGD$5,000 remained outstanding, forming part of the LTD once the arrangement was due[^16];

> (c)      Arrangement C3 (SGD$4,000). Sometime before the due date on 19 January 2018, PW2 told the Accused that she wished to withdraw from Arrangement C3 as she needed the money to repay “Linda”. There was a problem getting the money from Indonesia and it was delayed for “quite a long time”. The accused’s evidence was not very clear whether this amount was repaid to PW2[^17] or that it was not[^18].

31     As mentioned, these withdrawals by PW2 from Arrangements C1 and C2 affected Arrangements C4 and C5 respectively,

> (a)      Arrangement C4 (SGD$5,000 – tied with Arrangement C1). As a result of PW2 withdrawing from Arrangement C1, the SGD$5,000 in Arrangement C3 belonging to PW3 was locked up in the Indonesia STD. However, the accused claims that he, nevertheless, returned the sum to PW3 subsequently. Unfortunately, he is unable to recall the date, nor does he have any records to substantiate this;[^19]

> (b)      Arrangement C5 (SGD$10,000 – tied with Arrangement C2). As a result of PW2 withdrawing from Arrangement C2, the SGD$5,000 in Arrangement C5 belonging to PW3 was locked up in the Indonesia STD.[^20]

32     Arrangements C6 and C7 were “stand alone” Arrangements, meaning that the monies in the two Arrangements belonged solely to PW4, Chia Wei Ling. The accused alleged that PW2 affected these two Arrangements in the following way:

> (a)      Arrangement C6 (SGD$10,500). PW2 had instructed him to withdraw SGD$2,500 from this arrangement. He did not obtain PW4’s consent to do so. He then passed the money to PW2. As a result, the remaining SGD$8,000 was locked up in the Indonesia LTD;[^21]

> (b)      Arrangement C7 (SGD$5,500). PW2 also instructed him to withdraw SGD$2,500 from this arrangement. Likewise, the accused did not obtain PW4’s consent to do so. He also passed the money to PW2. As a result, the remaining SGD$3,000 was locked up in the Indonesia LTD.[^22]

33     The accused asserts that PW2 became aware of true nature of the Indonesian scheme when she started asking him to make the withdrawals.[^23] She therefore knew that, by withdrawing from Arrangements C1 and C2, it would affect Arrangements C4 and C5 which concerned PW3, Lee Fong Chin. However, she had assured the accused that she, PW2, would repay PW3.

34     Likewise, when PW2 told the accused to make withdrawals from Arrangements C6 and C7, she knew that this would cause PW4’s money in Arrangement C6 and C7 to be locked up in the LTD. Likewise, the accused asserts that PW2 assured him the she would repay PW4.[^24]

35     The accused claimed that PW2 then approached the accused to make up a story to explain to PW3 and PW4 why they were unable to get their monies back on the due dates. This would allow her to buy some time so that she would be able to raise the money herself to repay them. Together they fabricated the e-mails from “Su” and “Agnes Lee” explaining why the repayments were delayed. PW2 would instruct the accused what to say in the e-mails and the accused would type them. These e-mails are those that can be found at Exhibit P17.

### The lack of any dishonest intention / repayment of the monies

36     The accused seemed to suggest that, as PW2 had broken the arrangements, he had in effect repaid her most of the money that she had put into the arrangements.

37     The accused further suggested that he had no dishonest intention whatsoever. He was simply providing a service of helping his colleagues to exchange SGD to MYR at preferential exchange rates. When PW2 broke the various arrangements, the monies from the STD that were not withdrawn had simply moved to the LTD. He would therefore be able to repay whatever outstanding amounts to the victims once the LTD reached its maturity date.

### The two other victims, PW3 and PW4

38     The accused’s evidence was that PW3 and PW4 were unaware of the true nature of the Indonesian scheme. As far as he knew, they were only aware of the basics. This was namely that they had to place a certain amount with the accused for a certain period of time in SGD in order to get a good return in MYR on the agreed due date. They thought that the accused was able to get such good returns because his mother-in-law was a licensed moneychanger.

39     They were not aware that they had entered any arrangement nor were they aware that their money would be locked up in the LTD in the event an arrangement was terminated. They were also unaware that PW2 had terminated the arrangements by withdrawing part of the amounts before the due date. He confirmed that, in the case of PW4, where her arrangements were “stand alone” arrangements, she had given no consent for any money to be withdrawn, let alone to have the unwithdrawn portion forwarded to and locked up in the Indonesian LTD.

## The analysis of the evidence

### The existence of the Indonesian scheme

40     At the heart of the accused’s defence lies the existence of the Indonesian scheme. This was the scheme that allowed the accused to offer such attractive exchange rates which, objectively speaking, appeared too good to be true. At the end of the say, I adjudged that this scheme was one that was created by the accused. No scheme existed.

41     First and foremost, there was not one iota of documentary evidence to show that such a scheme actually existed, other than, what in my view was a less than adequate attempt by the accused to describe this Indonesian scheme. There was no written agreement, no exchange of e-mails, letters and not even one WhatsApp message to show the court that there was a possibility, no matter how faint or improbable, that such a scheme existed. It was simply too convenient for the accused to claim that he kept no records, that he had since deleted whatever WhatsApp conversations and that the Indonesians had refused to forward him the records when he had requested.

42     It seemed incredulous that such a scheme would have been entered into without some form of agreement between the parties involved. The nature of the scheme as described by the accused seemed too complicated to have existed without one. In addition, based on the accused own evidence, the amount that he had himself placed in the LTD, SGD$50,000, was not an insignificant sum. It therefore seemed ludicrous that there was no written agreement of the scheme available in some form and kept somewhere safe for future reference.

43     For the number of arrangements that were entered, there was a dearth of communications between the Indonesians and the accused. The accused claimed that he had deleted them. I did not find this externally consistent. I am unable to understand why he would do such a thing when the amount involved in these seven arrangements amounted to more than SGD$50,000, again not an insignificant sum. He could not explain satisfactorily why he had deleted these e-mails. His eventual explanation that he deleted them because they were “no more relevant” seemed to fly in the face of logic as, by his own evidence, there was monies still due to the victims. As highlighted by the Prosecution, _“…. Even by his account, the Indonesians would still have owed him large sums of money, some of which belonged to the Three Victims. For him to have considered the emails “no more relevant” is simply ridiculous.”_[^25]

44     The accused’s claim that the Indonesians had refused to forward him records because there were police investigations ongoing in Singapore also seemed suspect. As suggested by the Prosecution, this was overly convenient. Furthermore, the accused was even unable to provide any evidence that he actually did request for the relevant documents and the Indonesians had refused to provide such information because of the said police investigations.

45     Even the actual workings of the Indonesian scheme as described by the accused made no sense. In fact, I had the sense that the accused was even unsure how the Indonesian scheme, assuming one did indeed exist, worked or should have worked.

46     For example, earlier in his evidence, he had described how the Indonesian scheme was supposed to work,[^26] however, when he was asked by the court to clarify certain aspects of the scheme later in his evidence, his explanation as to how the scheme worked was different.[^27]

47     Later in his evidence, he explained that if the arrangement was to put, for example, SGD$10,000 in the STD for two weeks to obtain the preferential exchange rate, and if there was there was a need to withdraw the money early, the SGD$10,000 would actually be withdrawn from the LTD with a 2.5% penalty imposed ie. SGD$250. Hence, the amount in the LTD would be reduced. In the accused’s case, the SGD$50,000 of his own money in the LTD would therefore be reduced to SGD$40,000. The SGD$10,000 that was still in the STD would continue to be traded in foreign currency until the due date when the SGD$10,000 would revert to the accused’s LTD should there be no instructions to trade.[^28]

48     There was, of course, no evidence that the Indonesian scheme, let alone how one worked except how it was described by the accused. There were many questions that could not be answered. For example, why would the SGD$10,000 be withdrawn from the LTD and not from the STD, with or without a penalty? It would appear simpler if the SGD$10,000 was returned from the STD with a penalty. There was no documentation and logical explanation. The Prosecution’s characterization of his various explanations aptly sumed it up, namely, that his explanation was incomprehensible.

49     Further, this explanation did not tally with his earlier explanation of how the Indonesian scheme worked. This “new” explanation seems to suggest that the accused did have a say as to what happened to the money in the STD compared to what he suggested earlier in his evidence, that once the arrangement was terminated, the remaining monies in the STD would move to the LTD at the end of the arrangement. Once again, why this was so was never adequately explained.

50     A closer examination at the accused’s second explanation as to how the Indonesian scheme worked suggests that it was possible for the accused to repay PW2, PW3 and PW4 the monies when they became due. This was because the amount in the accused’s LTD was SGD$50,000 whilst the total amounts in the seven arrangements entered was SGD$52,000, just SGD$2,000 more.

51     For example, Arrangements C1 and C4 were joint arrangements entered by PW2 and PW3 involved SGD$10,000 and this was due on 3 February 2018. According to the accused, PW2 wanted her money back about a week into the arrangement, therefore, both the arrangements was broken. Following the accused’s second explanation, he could simply have asked for the full amount in Arrangements C1 and C4 back, namely SGD$10,000. This would then have to come from his own LTD. Based on his explanation that there was a 2.5% penalty, he would have been out of pocket SGD$250. Later, on 3 February 2018, the due date, the SGD$10,000 in the STD would be reverted to his LTD, bringing the amount back to SGD$50,000. Hence, the accused would have suffered only an out of pocket loss of SGD$250.

52     This could also have been done for the other arrangements that were supposedly broken when PW2 withdrew monies from them. At the end of the day, at worst, he would have been out of pocket from the 2.5% penalty incurred on the SGD$52,000 plus the additional SGD$2,000. This would total SGD$3,300. The repayment of this amount was clearly achievable as the accused had claimed that he had withdrawn SGD$5,000 of his own money to give PW2 when she broke Arrangement C1.

53     Furthermore, if the penalty was indeed incurred due to the early termination of the arrangements by PW2, surely then he could have taken steps to insist that PW2 made good this loss. In fact, there is no evidence from the accused, documentary or otherwise, that showed any attempts by him to make PW2 responsible for any of the loss suffered by PW3 and PW4 even though, according to his explanation of what happened, PW2 was the cause of it.

### The supposed complicity of PW2 Chye Mei Mei

54     The next plank of the accused’s defence lay in the complicity of PW2. He had claimed that PW2, amongst other things:

> (a)     was aware of the existence of the Indonesian scheme;

> (b)     conspired with the accused to create the false e-mails purportedly sent by BN to the accused’s wife and then to PW2 through the accused so that PW3 and PW4 would join the scheme;

> (c)     persuaded the accused to make early withdrawals from the arrangements, causing them to be terminated, including the “stand alone” arrangements involving PW4;

> (d)     conspired with the accused to create the false e-mails that were purportedly from “Su”, the accused’s wife and later ‘Agnes Lee’, the supposed staff of “Su” to explain why the monies were delayed in order to buy time to repay the monies owed from the arrangements.

55     After examining the evidence, I was not convinced that PW2 had any part to play in this supposed complicity. These were bare allegations from the accused to deflect blame from himself. He had no evidence of this complicity, whatsoever.

56     First, I am not satisfied that PW2 was aware of the existence of the Indonesian scheme. Her evidence was that she only knew that the accused was able to obtain such good rates because his wife was working for his mother-in-law and she, the mother-in-law, was a moneychanger[^29]. Her belief was fortified by the e-mails the accused had forwarded that was appeared to come from BNM. This seemed logical assumption, especially when one notes the e-mail addresses of “Julianma bin Abdul Malek” and “Su”[^30]. I found PW2’s evidence to be clear and forthright.

57     On the other hand, the accused’s evidence in this respect was generally inconsistent. For example, regarding how much PW2 knew about the Indonesian scheme, the accused’s evidence was initially that PW2 only knew the basics of the scheme, namely that if she gave the accused a certain amount of money for a period of time, she would get a better exchange rate but later, he told the court, that she knew that her monies were riding on his deposit.[^31] Later, he charged his evidence again. The accused flip- flopped so often in his evidence it was difficult to believe him. Instead, I adjudged that PW2’s evidence to be clearer and more consistent and that her version of events indeed did set out what really happened.

58     There was not a shred of evidence that PW2 conspired with the accused to create all the false e-mails. Her evidence was consistent with PW3 and PW4 as to the material aspects of the case, namely, how the arrangements came about, how the monies were forwarded to the accused, and how they had not been repaid, and how the various excuses came about. PW2’s evidence was both externally and internally consistent and so were her actions when she was not returned her monies.

59     If, for example, when I perused the e-mail exchanges between the accused and PW2 at Exhibit P17, I was of the view that it showed a person who was angry because her monies had not been repaid and was sick and tired of being given the run around. Examining the audio recording of the meeting on 13 April 2018, the frustration and anger in PW2’s voice can be sensed. It was consistent with a person who had been cheated of his or her money.

60     Next, the reason given by the accused as to why PW2 had asked him to fabricate the earlier e-mails, ie. Exhibits P6 and P14, was ostensibly to ensure that she, PW2, could get the benefit of the higher exchange rates if she managed to get others to pool their monies together. However, on closer examination, the reality did bear this out.

> (a)     First, there were two e-mails forwarded by the accused attaching an e-mail purportedly from BNM setting out the higher than normal exchange rates. The first, date 4 January 2018 at Exhibit P6 was sent to all three victims. However, the second, dated 11 January 2018 at Exhibit P14 was only sent to PW2. It is curious why PW2 would require the accused to fabricate an e-mail in order to send it to herself;

> (b)     Second, only Arrangements C1 and C2 were combined with Arrangements C4 and C5. This seemed to put paid to the reason given by the accused as to why the above fictitious e-mails were created;

> (c)     Third, Arrangements C6 and C7 were stand-alone arrangements entered into by PW4. As described by PW4 herself, the higher rates that given despite her putting in a smaller amount of money was specifically agreed to with the accused[^32]. It had nothing to do with PW2.

61     I next considered the accused’s allegation that PW2 had caused the termination to the various arrangements by withdrawing money from the scheme. The accused’s allegations extremely peculiar and upon closer examination, I found them improbable.

62     Arrangement C1 was to have lasted from 4 January to 3 February 2018. The accused’s version of events was that “_less than a week”_[^33] after entering Arrangement C1, PW2 had asked him to withdraw from the arrangement as she needed the money. This does not sound out of place unless one realises that only about a week after entering Arrangement C1, namely on 9-10 January and on 11 January 2018, Arrangements C2 and C3 respectively were entered into by PW2. The question is why PW2 would withdraw from Arrangement C1, only to enter another two arrangements barely hours or perhaps just a few days later. Hence, I found the accused’s version of events implausible.

63     Arrangement C2 was to have lasted from 9-10 to 23 January 2018, a period of less than two weeks. The accused’s evidence was that PW2 wanted to withdraw the money to pay for renovation works in Malaysia, “_just before Chinese New Year, probably_”[^34]. This was once again highly improbable. It suggests that PW2 had decided to put SGD$12,000, no small sum for PW2, into an arrangement without considering the need to pay for an ongoing renovation. PW2 then decided to withdraw from this arrangement few days later, causing her to lose the preferential exchange rate in MYR when simply waiting about a week or so more would entitle her to this preferential exchange rate, in currency that she would be using to pay her contractor in Malaysia. This is all very strange. More so when one considers that Chinese New Year in 2018 was on 16–18 February in Malaysia.[^35] Why then would PW2 want to withdraw her money so early? She would have ample time to pay her contractor if she waited till the due date of the arrangement on 23 January 2018. Also, it should be noted that none of these allegations were never put to PW2.

64     Arrangement C3 was to have lasted from 11 to 19 January 2018, an even shorter period of slightly more than a week. The accused likewise claims that PW2 wanted to withdraw from this Arrangement. The reason was that PW2 wanted to repay “Linda”. He claimed that he had transferred to money to PW2. However, this is not borne out by the evidence. However, his bank statement listing out all his transactions from his bank account for the period October 2017 to May 2018[^36] showed that there was no transfer of SGD$4,000 before 19 January 2018 but it instead reflected an SGD$4,000 transfer on 16 March 2018. The accused eventually conceded that the money could have been repaid later than 19 January 2018 because he received the money late.[^37] In my view, it seemed incredulous that PW2 would want to terminate the arrangement early and deny herself the receipt of the preferential exchange rate, only to receive the money _after_ the due date. Furthermore, this fact of the late return of the money is consistent with PW2’s evidence that the SGD$4,000 in Arrangement C3 was returned to her but the date due. PW2 was candid about this and, in my mind, this gave more credence to her evidence.

65     If I accepted the accused’s allegation that PW2 was somehow complicit in this deception, then it goes to reason that the failure to return the money to PW3 and PW4 was entirely PW2’s fault. It therefore seems incredulous that despite this, the accused has never asked PW2 to make good this loss. In particular, by the time of the meeting between the accused and the three victims on 13 April 2018, the last arrangement would already be more than two months overdue. It would have been obvious that PW2 had not repaid any money to PW3 and PW4 and that none seemed forthcoming. It would also be clear to the accused that PW2 had also not revealed her part in the supposed complicity to PW3 and PW4 and seemed content to let the accused take the blame for the non-repayment of the monies. Surely this was the time for the accused to raise the issue of PW2’s involvement in front of PW3 and PW4 and seek an explanation from her why she had not repaid the monies. However, the accused did not raise a single word concerning this at the 13 April 2018 meeting. In fact, from the audio recording, he appeared to be content in trying to once again attempted to delay return the monies to the three victims.

66     It should be noted that PW2 had denied all these allegations when she was recalled to the stand to allow the accused to cross-examine her on these specific allegations. I had no reason to disbelieve her evidence. The accused had shown the court nothing to suggest that PW2 was complicit in anything. I therefore found that PW2 was not complicit in the scheme nor did she participate in the fabrication of the various e-mails.

### The repayments

67     I now briefly touch on the accused’s assertions that he had repaid the money to the three victims.

68     Only PW2 has confirmed that she had been repaid SGD$4,000 from Arrangement C3 but after the due dat. Despite the accused’s claims that he had repaid the monies, he had no documentary evidence whatsoever that any of the monies had been repaid at all. In fact, even his bank statement does not show any other withdrawal that matched the amounts in the arrangements.

69     In the Case for the Defence (“CFD”)[^38] and his police statement recorded on 19 April 2018[^39], the accused had claimed that he had returned the all the monies to the victims. However, in court, the accused claimed that he had return all the monies that _were due_. This appeared to suggest that, as the monies in the various arrangements had been moved from the STD to his LTD account, they were yet to be due. I found this extremely curious as to why he would suggest that he had repaid the victim’s their monies in his police statement when only a week earlier, on 13 April 2018, he seemed to be fighting a rear guard battle in an attempt to delay repayment of the very same monies. All he needed to do to assuage the victims was to explain what had happened. He did not.

70     I also noted that the accused has been totally inconsistent in deciding whether he had made any repayments to the three victims. As highlighted by the Prosecution in Exhibit P21, he claimed that he had passed money to PW3 on three occasions. However, there seemed to be no explanation why, if he had done so, would the victims still be hounding him for money at the meeting on 13 April 2018. Not once during that meeting did he say to any of the three victims that he had returned some of the monies that he owed. Something that I would expect someone in that position to do. It is therefore strange for the accused to now say in court that he has made repayments.

71     To be honest, I am not even sure whether these monies that the accused claimed that he repaid the three victims were even related to the subject matter of the charges at hand, such was the nature of the his evidence in court, namely confusing and incomprehensible. Furthermore, these were simply bare assertions with nothing to support his claims that he had repaid the monies.

72     I am, once again, incredulous that the accused had not provided once shred of evidence of these repayments to the police, if he had indeed done so. The first police statement was recorded on 19 April 2018. Surely at that point in time, he would have some evidence in the form of, for example, WhatsApp messages, e-mail etc to show the investigators, the same WhatsApp messages, e-mails that he now conveniently claims that have been deleted or that he now had no access to.

73     Accordingly, I rejected his evidence and I concluded that in relation to the amounts sent out in the seven charges, except for the SGD$4,000 to PW2, the accused had not repaid the monies to any of the victims.

### The elements of the charge

74     Having analysed the various planks of the accused’s defence, I next set out the elements that the Prosecution is required to prove for an offence of CBT. This is set out in at \[4\] of the Prosecution’s submissions. These are:

> (a)     That the accused was entrusted with the said property, in this case, the different amounts of monies;

> (b)     That the accused misappropriated the said property, namely that it was _“set aside for or assign\[ed\] to the wrong person or a wrong use”;_ and

> (c)     The misappropriation was done dishonestly, i.e. with the intention of causing wrongful loss to another person, _viz._ loss by unlawful means of property to which that person was legally entitled.

#### Whether the accused was entrusted with the monies

75     I am of the view that the accused was entrusted with the monies. The accused lied that his mother in law was a licenced moneychanger and that his wife was working for her. He created fake e-mail addresses to perpetuate this deception. These fake e-mails deceived the three victims and caused them to place the money with him. The monies were sent to the accused by PW2, PW3 and PW4 and he does not dispute that he had received them. The monies, given to him in SGD, were entrusted to him, so that it could be exchanged into MYR.

#### Whether the accused return the monies

76     Having reviewed the evidence, I found that the accused did not return any of the monies to the victims on the dates that they were due. The only amount that he had returned was a sum of SGD$4,000 to PW2 but that was after the date he was to have returned it.

#### Whether the misappropriation was done dishonestly

77     When the money was due to be repaid, he did not do so. Instead, he created further fake e-mail addresses purportedly from his wife and later, from his wife’s staff to explain the delay. In short, he contravened the terms of the entrustment.

78     Even if I had accepted his evidence at face value, by his own admission the offence of CBT with regard to the monies belonging to PW3 and PW4 would have been made out when the amounts in those arrangements were moved the accused’s LTD without their knowledge and / or consent.

## The conclusion at the end of the trial

79     At the end of the trial, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. It was clear that there was no Indonesian scheme. If there was one, it only existed when the accused began invented this scheme to explain why the monies were not or could not be returned to the three victims.

80     I was adjudged that there was no complicity on the part of PW2 and except for the SGD$4,000 that was repaid to PW2 after the due date, no other monies had been repaid.

81     As for the defence, I would be overly generous to say that that there was any semblance of one that was coherent. The accused’s defence was confused and incomprehensible. Whether it was the Indonesian scheme (in whatever form), the complicity of PW2 or the supposed repayments, his claims were not backed up by any evidence at all. They were simply bare allegations. As such, I did not believe his version of events.

82     Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of the seven charges of CBT.

## The antecedents, submission on sentence and plea in mitigation

83     The accused has no antecedents.

84     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. The breakdown can be found in their submission on sentence and is reproduced below for ease of reference.

85     In addition, the Prosecution sought a compensation order of SGD$48,000. This reflected the unpaid monies in all the charges except for the SGD$4,000 in respect of _DAC-910715-2019_, which had been returned to PW2.

86     The accused was given an opportunity to mitigate, however, he continued to claim that he had returned the monies. Further, he referred to a previous case in which he claimed that he had been cheated of $50,000. He had reported to the police, but nothing had come out of it. He asked the court to take this amount into consideration.[^40]

87     The learned DPP informed the court that the Prosecution was aware of this. It involved an incident in 2017 where the accused had claimed that another person had cheated him out of money. Both parties were investigated by the police. The Attorney-General’s Chambers had decided to take no further action against either party. This fact had been highlighted to the accused at the Pre-Trial Conference.

88     In this respect, I note that the accused was referring to a case in 2017 when the accused was charged for an offence of cheating under s 420 of the PC _vide DAC-907416-2017_. On 13 July 2017, the accused was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal.

## The Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law

89     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence of committing criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the PC is a term of imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.

### The appropriate sentence

90     In _PP v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 78</span>, the accused, a dental nurse, pleaded guilty to a s 406 charge of committing CBT of $14,089.95 from the clinic she was working at. Another charge of committing CBT of $12,534 was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. On appeal, the High Court set aside the fine of $4,000 imposed by the trial judge and increased the sentence to 15 weeks’ imprisonment. At \[11\], the High Court concluded that “_Both specific and general deterrence are key sentencing considerations where CBT offences are concerned”._

91     I agreed with this. In this case, although there was no mandatory imprisonment term prescribed for a s 406 offence, taking into account the need for a specific and general deterrence, I was of the view that the custody threshold had been crossed.

92     This was not a one-off offence that was committed at the spur of the moment. The amounts involved were, likewise, not insignificant. The accused’s culpability was high. He had deceived the victims by creating fake e-mails to cause them to place their monies with him.

93     Having determined that the custody threshold has been crossed, I next considered what would be the appropriate sentence to impose. In this respect. I have reviewed some cases involving s 406 CBT offences that have been determined by the State Courts. A sampling of the reviewed cases is highlighted below:

94     Having reviewed this, I adjudged that the sentences submitted by the Prosecution for the _individual_ charges as well as the _global_ sentence were reasonable, and within the sentencing range envisaged after considering all the factors of the case. It should be noted that the accused was convicted after a trial and hence was not entitled any sentencing discount.

## The sentence imposed

95     Having accepted the sentences submitted by the Prosecution, I therefore adopted them and sentenced the accused accordingly, albeit with some minor adjustments:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="52.1%"> <col width="47.9%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge Number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Imposed</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910713-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910714-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">14 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910715-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910716-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910717-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910718-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910719-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

96     In order to achieve the appropriate _global_ sentence, I ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in _DAC-910714-2019, DAC-910718-2019_ and _DAC-910719-2019_ to run consecutively. This made the total a sentence of 34 weeks’ imprisonment.

97     In addition to the sentences of imprisonment, the Prosecution submitted that the court should order, pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) , 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), that the accused be ordered to pay compensation to the three victims in the sum of SGD$48,000. This was based on the total amount of SGD$52,000 that were placed with the accused by the three victims in the seven arrangements, less the amount of SGD$4,000 that was repaid to PW2 in Arrangement C3 _vide DAC-910715-2019._

98     However, I noted that the amount stated in charge _DAC-910718-2019_ was SGD$10,100, notwithstanding that the amount in Arrangement C6 was SGD$10,500. As mentioned, this was because of a sum of SGD$400 that was owed to PW4 by the accused in a previous arrangement. I therefore ordered that the compensation for this charge to be SGD$10,1000 and not SGD$10,500 as submitted by the Prosecution.

99     In summary, the compensation ordered pursuant to s 359 of the CPC is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.5%"> <col width="67.5%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge Number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Compensation Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910713-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">SGD$5,000 in default 8 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910714-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">SGD$12,000 in default 20 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910715-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Nil</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910716-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">SGD$5,000 in default 8 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910717-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">SGD$10,000 in default 16 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910718-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">SGD$10,100 in default 16 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-910719-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">SGD$5,500 in default 8 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

100    The total sentence imposed on the accused was therefore 34 weeks’ imprisonment and compensation of SGD$47,600 in default 76 days’ imprisonment.

101    The accused, being dissatisfied with the conviction and the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against both the conviction and sentence. He is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.
