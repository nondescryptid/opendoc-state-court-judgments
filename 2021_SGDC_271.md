### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim is for the sum of $250,000, being outstanding charges for maintenance services and supplies provided to the defendant. I allowed the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant has appealed.

## Facts

2       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for outstanding charges for the provision of maintenance services and supplies by the plaintiff to the defendant.[^1]

3       In the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the plaintiff claims the sum of $265,676.14 under 29 invoices and work orders.[^2] However, in the plaintiff’s opening statement[^3] and closing submissions,[^4] the plaintiff has capped his claim in the sum of $250,000.

4       The defendant was the subcontractor of Goh & Foong Contractors Pte Ltd (“Goh & Foong”).[^5] Goh & Foong was in turn, the subcontractor of EM Services Pte Ltd (“EM Services”).

5       EM Services was the main contractor and managing agent for a contract for building tradesmen, built-in furniture, car park painting and estate signs for various Singapore Land Authority properties (“the SLA contract”).[^6] The works to be done by the plaintiff (“the Works”), were based on Approved Work Orders issued by EM Services between June 2016 and April 2017.[^7]

6       The plaintiff raised its invoices to the defendant for the Works that were completed. The defendant failed to make payment of 29 invoices that were issued between August 2016 and May 2017.[^8]

7       On 12 July 2017, the plaintiff’s solicitors sent a letter of demand to the defendant for payment of the maintenance services and supplies pursuant to the Approved Work Orders. [^9] On 10 August 2017, the defendant’s solicitors replied to reject the plaintiff’s claim on the basis that the claim was premature as the works had not been certified by EM Services.[^10]

8       In August 2017, the defendant commenced an action in the High Court against Goh & Foong, under four subcontracts between the defendant and Goh & Foong, including the subcontract under the SLA contract. The defendant’s claim against Goh & Foong was settled in October 2018.

9       In an email dated 29 June 2018, the plaintiff was informed by EM Services that EM Services had made payment for the Works to Goh & Foong.[^11] The email was sent by Katherine Kerk, a property manager of EM Services, who gave evidence confirming that EM Services had made payment to Goh & Foong.[^12]

10     The plaintiff commenced the action herein against the defendant in December 2018.

## The parties’ positions

11     The plaintiff’s evidence is that he believes the Works have been satisfactorily completed as:

> (a)     inspections of the work sites have been completed by EM Services,

> (b)     EM Services’ site representative orally confirmed that the Works have been satisfactorily completed,

> (c)     the plaintiff has not been informed of any outstanding rectification works, and

> (d)     the plaintiff has not received any notice from the defendant or EM Services that the Works have not been satisfactorily completed.[^13]

12     The defendant has not adduced any evidence to dispute the plaintiff’s position that the Works have been completed.

13     However, the defendant has pleaded that the defendant shall make payment of the plaintiff’s invoice provided that:

> (a)     EM Services certifies that the works were satisfactorily completed by the plaintiff (“the certification requirement”), and

> (b)     the defendant receives payment from Goh & Foong in relation to the works under the main contract (“the payment requirement”).[^14]

14     The defendant alleges that the certification requirement and the payment requirement was orally agreed between the parties.[^15] The defendant’s position is that they are not obliged to pay the plaintiff, as both the aforesaid requirements have not been satisfied.

15     The plaintiff disputes the alleged certification requirement and payment requirement. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s position is that EM Services had already made payments to Goh & Foong.[^16]

## Issues

16     The key issues are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the defendant has established the alleged certification requirement on the balance of probabilities.

> (b)     Whether the defendant has established the alleged payment requirement on the balance of probabilities.

## Alleged certification requirement

17     In relation to the certification requirement alleged by the defendant, the plaintiff has submitted that there is no such certification requirement, as the defendant had paid the plaintiff on previous occasions, even though there was no such certification produced from EM Services. The defendant has explained that payment on those occasions was made because the defendant had received payment from Goh & Foong and assumed that EM Services had carried out the certification.[^17]

18     I am unable to accept this explanation as the defendant’s defence provides that both the certification requirement and the payment requirement must be fulfilled before the defendant makes payment. Based on the defendant’s explanation, there would be no need for a certification requirement, if there is a payment requirement.

19     In the defendant’s statement of claim in its suit against Goh & Foong, the defendant has pleaded that a term of the contract between the defendant and Goh & Foong is that “\[EM Services\] shall certify that the works … have been completed by the \[defendant\]”.[^18] There is no suggestion in this statement of claim, that the certification is a condition precedent for payment to be made to the defendant. In the premises, I am of the view that there is similarly no requirement that the certification of EM Services is a condition precedent for payment to be made to the plaintiff. This is consistent with the defendant’s conduct in making the previous payments to the plaintiff without the certification from EM Services.

20     Furthermore, in _Bing Integrated Construction Pte Ltd v Eco Special Waste Management Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 183</span> at \[16\], in relation to a submission that the issuance of a Final Certificate was a condition precedent for payment under the contract, Chan Seng Onn J found that “the dealings between the defendants and the plaintiffs were highly informal and payments were never made on the basis of the Architect’s Certificates”, as a factor in deciding that the defendants in that case were not entitled to rely on the lack of a Final Certificate to deny payment to the plaintiff. Similarly, in the present case, the defendant should not be allowed to rely on the absence of a certificate to avoid making payment, when its previous payments to the plaintiff were made without such certificates.

21     In the premises, I am of the view that the defendant has failed to establish the alleged certification requirement on the balance of probabilities.

## Alleged payment requirement

22     In relation to the payment requirement alleged by the defendant, I find on the balance of probabilities that there is no such payment requirement, as:

> (a)     In his statement of claim in the High Court suit, the defendant pleads that Goh & Foong shall make payment to the defendant within reasonable time upon the defendant’s presentation of his invoices to Goh & Foong.[^19] In the defendant’s reply in the High Court suit, he further pleads that “it was not a term of the \[contract with Goh & Foong\] that \[the defendant\] would only be paid if \[Goh & Foong\] was paid”.[^20] This is contrary to the defendant’s submission that the defendant had a pay when paid arrangement between Goh & Foong and the defendant, that would apply equally to the subcontract between the defendant and the plaintiff.[^21]

> (b)     Furthermore, in the defendant’s solicitors’ letter dated 10 August 2017 to the plaintiff’s solicitors rejecting the plaintiff’s claim,[^22] the defendant’s solicitors only referred to the certification requirement and made no mention of the payment requirement. It is astonishing that such a fundamental pillar of the defendant’s defence, is not referred to in this letter. In the premises, I am of the view that the defendant’s allegation that parties had agreed on the payment requirement, is an afterthought.

23     The defendant has submitted that the plaintiff omitted four Approved Work Orders from his claim against the defendant, because it was not reasonable to claim them, when the defendant had not received payment.[^23] I am unable to agree with this submission. Although the plaintiff acknowledged that he was not claiming for the work under these four Approved Work Orders, he explained that this was because EM Services had yet to make payment for these four Approved Work Orders and that the defendant should pay the plaintiff for those that EM Services had paid.[^24]

24     The plaintiff’s explanation is not inconsistent with his position that there is no payment requirement, as the payment requirement alleged by the defendant is for Goh & Foong to pay the defendant before the defendant pays the plaintiff, whereas the plaintiff’s omission to claim for the work under these four Approved Work Orders is because EM Services has not paid Goh & Foong for these works. The distinguishing factor is the payment made by EM Services to Goh & Foong, rather than the payment received by the defendant. The payment made by EM Services for the Approved Work Orders which are the subject of the plaintiff’s claim herein, is simply evidence that the work under those Approved Work Orders has been completed, rather than pointing towards any payment requirement.

25     The defendant has further submitted that the prohibition against pay when paid clauses under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”), does not apply, as the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant is not in writing and SOPA only applies to “any contract that is made in writing”. In the light of my finding that there is no payment requirement, it is not necessary for me to decide on this issue.

26     Nevertheless, I would point out that the definition of “any contract that is made in writing” under section 4 of SOPA, is very wide. Section 4(4) provides that:

> Where a contract is not wholly made in writing, the contract shall be treated as being made in writing for the purpose of this section if, subject to the provisions of this Act, the _matter in dispute_ between the parties thereto is in writing.

> \[Emphasis added.\]

27     In the case of _Qingjian International (South Pacific) Group Development Co Pte Ltd v Capstone Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHCR 5</span> at \[45\], the Assistant Registrar found that the “matter in dispute” in section 4(4) of SOPA could “be found in an exchange of communications in writing … \[which\] included … the tax invoices issued”.

28     In the present case, not only were there invoices issued,[^25] there is an exchange of correspondence between the parties on the dispute, including the defendant’s solicitors’ letter dated 10 August 2017 which I had referred to earlier, which disputed the plaintiff’s claim but failed to make any mention of the purported payment requirement. In the premises, I am of the view that the contract shall be treated as being made in writing, pursuant to section 4(4) of SOPA. Accordingly, the prohibition under SOPA against pay when paid provisions would apply.

## Conclusion

29     In the premises, judgment was entered for the plaintiff’s claim in the sum of $250,000, together with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of writ to the date of judgment and costs for the plaintiff.
