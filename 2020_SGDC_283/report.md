Prisons Act – Beach of Remission Order - Enhanced Sentence under Prisons Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9881/2020/01.\]

7 December 2020

### District Judge Jasbendar Kaur:

## Introduction

1       The accused Sangeethana Natasha Sylvia d/o Sarvanan, a 23-year old female Singaporean pleaded guilty before me on 17 September 2020 to 16 charges under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with Section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) for cheating 16 different victims on the e-marketplace platform ‘Carousell’ during the period end April to mid-June 2020. She had done this by offering to sell concert tickets and one mobile phone which she did not have and by such deception, she had dishonestly induced the victims to transfer various amounts to her. In addition, 32 similar charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The total amount cheated for the proceeded charges was $4790 and the total amount involved for all the charges was $8767.

2       She was also liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for breaching the _basic condition_ of her Conditional Remission Order (“CRO”) that was imposed on her under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act when she was released on 22 February 2019 after serving two-thirds of her sentence.

3       After considering the submissions from both the Prosecution and Defence, I sentenced the accused to 23 months’ imprisonment for the charges that she had pleaded guilty to, with the sentences of three charges running consecutively. Further, as she had breached the _basic condition_ of her CRO, she was sentenced to an additional sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act, which sentence will have to run consecutively with the 23 months’ imprisonment sentence.

4       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentencing outcome have filed an appeal against the sentence that was passed.

## Background

### Brief Facts

5       On 2 February 2018, the accused pleaded guilty and was convicted on 16 charges, with 43 charges being taken into consideration. Of these 16 charges, 15 were cheating charges under section 420 of the Penal Code and one was a theft charge under section 379 of the same. With 3 charges being ordered to run consecutively, she was sentenced to a global sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment.

6       On 22 February 2020, she was released on a CRO issued by the Commissioner of Prisons under the Conditional Remission System (“CRS”) and her remaining sentence from 22 February to 1 September 2019 was suspended. The CRO stated that should she breach the _basic condition_ as provided under Section 50S of the Prisons Act during the period from 22 February 2019 to 1 September 2019, she may be liable to an enhanced sentence in addition to any punishment imposed by the Court for the offence/s committed in breach of the _basic condition_ of the her CRO. The CRO also stated that any enhanced sentence imposed by the Court will not exceed the remaining duration of the remission period at the date of the commission of the offence.

7       The Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which the accused admitted to without qualification stated that in April 2019 (about 2 months after her conditional release) she started posting advertisements on Carousell, offering to sell tickets for concerts by various artists - Lauv, Shawn Mendes, The 1975 and Jay Chou and to sell one iPhone X 256GB mobile phone at $750. She did not have any tickets or the iPhone to sell. Her purpose of posting the said advertisements was to deceive the victims to transfer monies to her bank accounts and she did not have any intention of returning the monies upon receipt. In total, 47 victims responded and transacted with her to buy the concert tickets by transferring full payment to six bank accounts in her name (amounts ranging from $224 to $684). The accused had also used six different mobile numbers linked to some of her bank accounts to facilitate payments via PayNow. One victim responded to the advertisement on the sale of the iPhone X 256GB and she transferred a deposit of $250 to the accused’s bank account with the view of buying the said phone that the accused did not have.

8       The SOF further stated that the first police report against the accused was lodged on 13 May 2019 and she was charged in Court for 38 charges on 4 June 2019. She was released on bail after being remanded for investigations on 7 June 2019 and whilst on bail, she proceeded to commit 10 further similar offences which caused her bail to be revoked on 25 July 2019.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentencing

9       The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 22 months’ imprisonment for the 16 offences that the accused had pleaded guilty to and in addition, 130 days enhanced imprisonment under section 50T of the Prisons Act. The table below provides the individual and global sentences that were sought by the Prosecution \[see “_Prosecution’s Skeletal Submissions on s 50T of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, Rev Ed 2000) (“PA”)_” – at paragraph 27\]:

### Plea in Mitigation

10     The Defence did not submit for a specific sentence but urged the Court “To afford her leniency to the maximum extent permitted under the rules will permit her to find her feet in life as soon as possible, i.e., by locating employment appropriate to her formal qualifications, participating in family life again and moving forwards as a productive member of society.”

11     The “Plea in Mitigation” highlighted the following mitigating factors and suggested that there were positive signs that the accused can change her ways and be rehabilitated:

> (i)     The accused is a young offender of 23 years of age with employment prospects as she graduated from Temasek Polytechnic with a diploma in Psychology;

> (ii)     She had spent her juvenility running afoul of the law due to “multiple and severe stressors in her personal and family life”. This included her parents’ divorce in 2014, her family’s financial problems, her unplanned pregnancy and her inability to find a job upon her graduation from the polytechnic;

> (iii)     She may have an underlying medical condition[^1] which has not been diagnosed as the accused “elected to forgo any psychiatric or psychological assessment and to accept full responsibility for her actions”; and

> (iv)     There are positive signs for her rehabilitation as her parents have reconciled and have “shown a high degree of concern and support” for the accused as demonstrated by their efforts to visit her weekly at the remand prison. This indicated that they are willing and able to supervise and support her to steer her away from a life of crime.

12     For the 16 charges that she pleaded guilty to before me, I sentenced her to a global sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment, with three sentences ordered to run consecutively and a global enhanced sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment under section 50T of the Prisons Act. The table below provides details of the sentences imposed:

13     As the global sentence imposed for the index offences is higher than the minimum global imprisonment sentence sought by the Prosecution, I am compelled to infer that their dissatisfaction is only in relation to the enhanced sentence that I have imposed. Therefore, these grounds will only explain my reasons for imposing the enhanced sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment for the multiple breaches of her CRO.

## Sentencing Approach under Section 50T of the Prisons Act

14     The imposition of an enhanced sentence for a breach of the _basic condition_ as provided under section 50S of the Prisons Act during the conditional release period is governed by the requirements of section 50T of the same which reads as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image1.png)

15     When determining the enhanced sentence, consideration must be given to the objectives of the CRS which is to facilitate the ex-prisoner’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society after his release and to deter re-offending – see 50E(1)(b) of the Prisons Act:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image2.png)

16     Under the CRS, all inmates who are released after serving two-thirds of their sentence will be issued with a CRO that will provide the duration of the remission period and delineate the _basic condition_ that the inmates must comply with pursuant to section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act which is that they must not commit an offence during the remission period:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image3.png)

17     Pursuant to section 50T(1) of the Prisons Act, should an inmate breach the _basic condition_ by committing an offence/s, he will be liable to an enhanced imprisonment sentence which will run consecutively to the imprisonment sentences that may be imposed for the predicate offences. Section 50T(1) also provides that the enhanced sentence or the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences shall not exceed the “remaining duration of the remission order”:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image4.png)

18     Section 50T(1) of the Prisons Act also makes it clear that it is not mandatory to impose an enhanced sentence every time an ex-inmate breaches the _basic condition_. When deciding whether to impose an enhanced sentence and in determining the length to impose, the Court has to consider the following four factors as provided under section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act:

> (a)     the gravity of the new offence/s;

> (b)     whether the new offence/s are of similar nature to the ex-inmate’s previous offence/s;

> (c)     the length of time the ex-inmate managed to remain crime-free after being released under the CRO; and

> (d)     all other relevant circumstances, i.e.; any other relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances[^2].

### Main Issue

19     This appeal concerns the principles that govern the determination of enhanced sentences under section 50T(3) and more importantly, the methodology in determining the enhanced sentence when multiple breaches of the _basic condition_ have been committed. The Prosecution had in their submissions proposed an approach that determined the enhanced sentence of 130 days’ imprisonment. I disagreed with certain aspects of their proposed approach that related to the assessment of the overall level of severity to determine the overall enhanced sentence and I also disagreed with their recommendation that it was necessary to impose the heaviest possible enhanced sentence in this case. I will first explain the approach that was proposed and adopted by the Prosecution.

### Prosecution’s Approach

20     The Prosecution had argued that when determining the length of the enhanced sentence to ensure that it is sufficiently deterrent, the following approach should be adopted when the case involves multiple offences:

> (a)      Step 1: The factors under section 50T(3)(a) to (d) have to be individually considered to “determine the severity of the breach for each charge”.

> (b)      Step 2: All the factors under section 50T(3) then must be “considered in the round (and not mathematically) and they may not be given equal weight, depending on the facts of the case.” They explained that this has to be done to establish the “overall level of severity of the breach” in order to ascertain the success of the rehabilitation process under the CRS and the remission period that should be “forfeited” for each charge.

> (c)      Step 3: After determining the “overall level of severity of the breach”, the Court has to consider whether the “overall level of the severity” is within the Low, Medium or High sentencing bands for each charge based on the following matrix:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image5.png)

> (d)      Step 4: Ensure that the aggregate length of the enhanced sentences for the individual charges does not breach the principles of totality and proportionality to ensure that the global sentence is not manifestly excessive.

21     Under Steps 1 and 2, the Prosecution assessed the level of severity for each charge after considering the factors under section 50T(3) to be as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image6.png)

22     Based on the overall assessment of the individual factors, it was the Prosecution’s position that the _overall level of severity_ was “High” which attracted the Band 3 sentencing range. The Prosecution then proceeded to determine the individual enhanced sentences by establishing the two-thirds of the length of the remaining remission period for each charge that the accused had pleaded guilty to. The two-thirds of the length of the Band 3 sentences for the 16 charges were computed to range from 52 days to 87 days, resulting in a potential aggregated sentence of 1214 days (3.3 years).

23     Since the aggregated enhanced sentence of 1214 days’ imprisonment is much higher than the aggregated enhanced sentence that could be imposed under section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act, the Prosecution proposed that the enhanced sentences should only be imposed for the 26th charge and the 45th charge so as not to breach the principles of totality and proportionality (Step 4). Then, as the aggregation of the enhanced sentences for the 26th and the 45th charges (87 days and 52 days respectively) still exceeded the aggregate sentence that is allowed by 9 days, the Prosecution proposed that these sentences be adjusted downwards to 80 days and 50 days respectively which gave an overall enhanced sentence of 130 days. They submitted that the maximum enhanced sentence of 130 days’ imprisonment is “in line with the deep-seated recalcitrance of the accused, as she committed the offences just a mere 2 months after he(r) release from prison…”

### Court’s Approach

24     The first question that I had to consider was whether enhanced sentences should be imposed pursuant to section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act in relation to the offences that the accused had committed during her remission period. Taking into account that (i) the accused had committed multiple offences that were of the same serious nature as those committed in 2017, (ii) she started committing these offences 62 days after being released on conditional remission and (iii) there were no extenuating mitigating factors, I was in agreement with the Prosecution that enhanced sentences for the index charges had to be imposed as her conduct clearly demonstrated her recalcitrance.

25     I also generally accepted the Prosecution’s overall assessment of the four factors under section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act to determine the severity of the breach for each charge and agreed that the _overall level of severity_ is “High”, attracting the Band 3 sentencing range. I also agreed with their recommendation that the severity level should be pegged at two-thirds of the remaining remission period to determine the length of the enhanced sentence. What I had difficulty agreeing with was (i) the need to individually determine the enhanced sentences for the 16 index offences in order to determine the overall enhanced sentence and (ii) their approach in determining the overall enhanced sentence of 130 days’ imprisonment. I could not understand why they had used the aggregated enhanced sentence of 1214 days’ imprisonment as a proxy to determine the overall level of severity when their own assessment with reference to the four factors under section 50T of the Prisons Act was that it is pegged at two-thirds of the length of the remaining duration of her remission period and not the maximum length of the remaining period.

26     In my view, the overall enhanced sentence for multiple charges must reflect the overall severity of the accused’s non-compliance and this should not differ from the level of severity for the individual charges if they are of the same nature. If, therefore, the overall level of severity for the individual charges is assessed to attract the sentence pegged at two-thirds of the length of the remaining remission period, then the total enhanced sentence should also be pegged at two-thirds of the length of the remaining remission period. This assessment should not be calibrated upwards just because their aggregated enhanced sentence of the individual enhanced sentences was much higher than the maximum length of her remaining remission period.

27     Further, as all the breaches involved section 420 charges that were of the same nature, I decided that it was not necessary to establish the level of severity for each breach of the _basic condition_ with reference to the four factors under section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act to establish the overall level of the severity of the accused’s non-compliance. In my view, it would not be appropriate or accurate to assess the level of severity of the individual breaches in vacuo without taking into consideration the totality of the accused’s conduct during the remission period. Therefore, I considered the four factors under section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act collectively and in a holistic manner in respect of all the 16 breaches since all the breaches were committed during the same remission period and under the same CRO. I assessed the level of severity for each factor as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image7.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image8.png)

28     After establishing the overall level of severity, I referred to the Prosecution’s matrix on the Sentencing Bands to establish the sentencing range that the overall level of severity would attract. In this case, it is the Band 3 sentencing range:

![]([2020] SGDC 0283_Image/[2020] SGDC 0283_image9.png)

29     I agreed with the Prosecution that the level of severity should be pegged at two-thirds of the remaining length of the remission period. This meant that based on the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences as provided in the “Summary Sheet” generated on 9 September 2020 by the Singapore Prison Service, the overall enhanced sentence should be around 87 days’ imprisonment. I also decided that it would not be appropriate to calibrate the level of severity upwards to impose the maximum enhanced sentence of 130 days as proposed by the Prosecution for the following reasons:

> (i)     she breached her CRO to help her family with their financial problems and not because of her avarice;

> (ii)     she did not engage in more egregious conduct; and

> (iii)     she had completed almost half of her remission period before committing the first breach.

30     In my view, a distinction must be made between those offenders who become non-compliant immediately after their release and those who do stay compliant for a relatively reasonable period to align the sentencing outcome to the purpose of the CRS and to encourage compliance in the future. This is because the CRS framework cannot be successful if it does not facilitate their rehabilitation by not recognising the efforts made to stay complaint. Therefore, it is critical that any sentencing approach taken by the Courts must motivate and incentivise the offender to stay clean if the objectives of the CRS are to be achieved. As explained by Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M during the Second Reading that meaningful rehabilitation can only take place if the inmate is motivated to change and stay clean:

> “The amendments which seek to introduce the CRS and MAS will strengthen Prisons’ throughcare system, particularly in the aftercare phase. These two initiatives mark a paradigm shift in our rehabilitation of inmates. However, the inmate’s motivation and will to change and his determination to turn over a new leaf for the sake of his family and himself is critical. Together with the support of the community and employers, we will help ex-inmates break the cycle of re-offending, return to their families, and reintegrate into society.”

31     After determining the overall level of severity and the enhanced sentence that can be imposed based on two-thirds of the length of the remaining duration of the remission period, I had to decide whether the enhanced sentence should be imposed for each of the 16 breaches or for some or one of the breaches. I considered whether to impose the enhanced sentences for all the index offences as section 50T(2)(a) provides is that “the court may, …impose an enhanced sentence under subsection (1) for each of those offences” when multiple breaches had been committed subject to the requirement that “the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences imposed under subsection (1) shall not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order” \[see subsection 2(b)\]. It is unclear whether this is intended to be the default approach but what is clear is the Courts have been given the discretion to determine the most appropriate response to the non-compliance and it is for the Courts to decide whether to impose the enhanced sentence for all offences or for only one offence.

32     On the facts of this case, I decided that it would be most appropriate to impose an enhanced sentence for all the offences since the breaches were of equivalent severity and of the same nature and they had been committed under the same CRO during the same remission period. Therefore, I imposed enhanced sentences ranging from 4 days to 12 days’ imprisonment \[4 days’ imprisonment for 13 breaches, 7 days’ imprisonment for 1 breach, 9 days’ imprisonment for 1 breach and 12 days’ imprisonment for 1 charge\] for the index offences committed by the accused, with a total enhanced sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment being imposed. When determining the individual sentences for the multiple offences, I decided that they need not correspond with the sentencing band for the overall level of severity that was pegged to “High Severity” as the same was achieved by the total enhanced sentence that I imposed.

33     I wish to state that I would have considered imposing the enhanced sentence for one or some of the offences if the offences committed during the remission period were of different nature and/or levels of severity. For e.g.; if one or more of the offences involved significantly higher amounts or involved more serious wrongdoings like extortion or forgery for the purpose of cheating, I would have been minded to impose the enhanced sentence for these serious offences as it would be an appropriate response under section 50T to focus on these more egregious breaches. In other words, the Court must adjust its approach to determine the most appropriate respond taking into account the factors listed under section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act.

34     Finally, as the overall enhanced sentence will have to run consecutively with the global imprisonment sentence of 23 months imposed for the index offences, I had to ensure that the overall global sentence (23 months’ imprisonment + additional enhanced sentence) did not breach the principles of totality and proportionality. In my view, the additional sentence of 80 day’s imprisonment that I decided to impose did not make the overall global sentence manifestly excessive as it only increased it by about 2.5 months to a total sentence of 25.5 months’ imprisonment. Further, with about 11% increase only in the global sentence, there is no cause to infer that the additional sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment had breached the principles totality and proportionality.

## Conclusion

35     Applying the enhanced sentencing regime under section 50T of the Prisons Act in a case where the offender had committed only one breach of the _basic condition_ of his CRO is generally not a complicated exercise. The same, however, cannot be said when the case involves multiple breaches by the offender as section 50T of the Prisons Act provides very little guidance. In my view, the most important part of the exercise to determine the overall enhanced sentence is the assessment of the overall level of severity of the offender’s multiple breaches and this can only be done by assessing his conduct in a collective and holistic manner. Based on this approach, I determined that an overall enhanced sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment should be imposed against the accused in addition to the global sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment that was imposed for the index offences. As for whether the enhanced sentence should be imposed for 1 or more offences, I decided to impose for all the charges for the reasons stated above. I wish to reiterate that it would be equally appropriate to impose the enhanced sentence for one or two charges as proposed by the Prosecution as the Court has the discretion under section 50T to determine the most appropriate respond to the breaches committed by an accused during his or her remission period .
