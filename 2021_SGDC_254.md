Additional Evidence – Section 392 of the Criminal Procedure Code

12 November 2021

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

1       Mr Zackeer Abbass Khan was convicted after trial of having conspired to cause grievous hurt. He appealed against his conviction, and also filed Criminal Motion No. 56 of 2020 for certain evidential relief. At the hearing of that Criminal Motion, the High Court ordered additional evidence be taken by another district judge (as the original trial judge had since retired). The parties then attended before me for that purpose. Pursuant to section 392(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, this court is required to state if the additional evidence had any effect on the conviction. I found that they did not. These are the grounds for my decision.

## Background

2       The significance of the additional evidence requires a recount of the case.

3       At the material time, Mr Zackeer ran Zam Zam restaurant along North Bridge Road. A few doors away was a business rival: Victory restaurant, where one Mr Liakath Ali s/o Mohamed Ibrahim (“Ali”) worked. There was pre-existing enmity between Zackeer and Ali over a soured business deal some years earlier.

4       On 22 August 2015, the police arrived at Zam Zam following a complaint of roadside touting purportedly made by Ali against Zam Zam’s employees: Koleth Navas (“Navas”) and Koleth Abdul Nasir (“Nasir”). Heated words ended up being exchanged between those two Zam Zam employees and Ali. The two then complained about the matter to Zackeer. An angry Zackeer then went towards Ali, and an utterance was issued. Zackeer’s behavior against Ali was caught on CCTV. After that incident, Zackeer contacted his friend: Anwer Ambiya bin Kadir Maideen (“Anwer”), to plan a course of action. Anwer was a secret society member, and he was indebted to Zackeer. Those discussions led to Anwer roping in his junior secret society member, one Joshua Navindran s/o Surainthiran (“Joshua”) for the task. Anwer obtained photos of Ali from Navas and sent them along to Joshua. On 26 August 2015, Joshua brought his brother Joel Giritharan s/o Surainthiran (“Joel”) and another friend (“Ramge”) to act as lookouts while he trailed and attacked Ali. A scuffle resulted when Ali retaliated. In the end, Ali was slashed on the face with a knife by Joshua, and Joshua also sustained some injuries to his hand. The outcome of the attack was then reported back to Anwer soon after, who then updated Zackeer. A substantial sum of money then moved from Zackeer to Anwer to Joshua. The facts set out above were beyond dispute.

5       Police investigations into the attack on Ali eventually led to Joshua, Joel, Ramge, Nasir, Navas, Anwer and Zackeer being hauled up one by one. Statements from the lot – except Zackeer’s – _eventually_ painted a picture of a conspiracy whereby Joshua was paid by Zackeer to cause grievous hurt to Ali by scarring his face with a knife. Joshua and Ramge pleaded guilty to their respective roles and were sentenced, while Joel ended up being detained instead under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap. 67). Nasir and Navas were charged for threatening Ali on the 22 August 2015, and both were found guilty after trial (before a separate district judge) and were fined. The court there found that Nasir had threatened Ali “…_the last time should do you but you escaped. This time round, (we) will do you, watch out._”; and that Navas had uttered against Ali: “_I have your photo in my mobile phone. You watch out_.”

6       Zackeer and Anwer were also charged with abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with Joshua to cause grievous hurt to Ali. Both Zackeer and Anwer claimed trial to the charge. Additionally, Zackeer also faced a charge of having threatened Anwer on 22 August 2015 “_in one week, I will poodu (Tamil for hit or kill) you_”. In his defence, Zackeer maintained that the CCTV does not show him threatening Ali. He also explained that he merely instructed Anwer to inform Joshua to give Ali “a verbal warning”, and that the slashing was actually Joshua’s own action in panic. As for the monies, those were handed over to Joshua to help with his medical bills for the hand injury which Joshua suffered. Anwer and Joshua supported Zackeer in their oral testimonies. The trial court nonetheless rejected the defence after finding that Anwer, Joshua and Nasir had each given incriminating statements instead which alluded to the conspiracy. The trial court relied on those statements, together with the evidence of the whatsapp messages exchanged between Anwer, Joshua and Nasir, and thus found that the conspiracy was amply proven and convicted both Zackeer and Anwer. Additionally, the trial court also found the evidence from Ali and Ghazali about the threats uttered on 22 August 2015 to be wholly reliable. Together with the corroborative CCTV footage, and the implicatory position revealed in Nasir’s statement as to what happened that day, the threat against Ali by Zackeer was also found to be amply proven: _PP v Zackeer Abbas Khan & Anor._ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 138</span>. Both appealed: Zackeer against his conviction and sentence, whilst Anwer appealed against his sentence only.

## The High Court’s Order in Criminal Motion No. 56 of 2020:

7       The High Court ordered additional evidence be taken from Joel and Navas by another judge as regards the following three specific points:

> (1)     What if anything did Joshua and/or Anwer inform Joel in relation to what Joel and/or Joshua were required to do in respect of Ali;

> (2)     What did Navas witness while he was in the vicinity of no. 697 North Bridge Road on 22 August 2015 at or about 6.45 am; and

> (3)     Why did Navas send photographs of Ali to Anwer.

8       It was also ordered that such additional evidence be admitted and considered in Zackeer’s appeal against his conviction in MA 9416/2020/01 pursuant to section 392 read with section 237(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) (“CPC”).

## The Additional Evidence:

9       After the matter was remitted, a few rounds of pre-trial conferences were held for the parties to prepare their cases and to indicate how they proposed to cover the three points. The matter was then eventually fixed before me for the additional evidence to be taken. As it turned out, the defence informed me that Navas was still outside of the jurisdiction in Oman, and that Navas was unwilling to offer his evidence from overseas due to some supposed objections from his employer/sponsor in Oman. The prosecution nonetheless indicated that they were prepared to allow the defence to admit the 4 statements recorded from Navas during the investigations and to have them made available to the appeal court for its consideration on points (2) and (3). The 4 statements from Navas were accordingly marked as Exhibits **D25** to **D28**. The proceedings then went ahead with the oral evidence being taken from Joel on Point (1) only. The certified record of proceedings together with the said exhibits are now presented to the High Court for its consideration. I now set out the additional evidence received on the three points.

### 1\. What if anything did Joshua and/or Anwer inform Joel in relation to what Joel and/or Joshua were required to do in respect of Ali;

10     Joel was not called by either party as a witness during the original proceedings. He was still serving his CLTPA detention when he was brought before me. He was the fourth defence witness in the entire proceedings and was accordingly marked as DW4. A review of the record will establish that Joel was not entirely consistent in the terms he used in his testimony. It would thus not do for any party to cite portions of Joel’s testimony out of context. Having reviewed the submissions from the parties about Joel’s testimony, and having assessed him in court, I now set out my understanding of Joel’s evidence.

11      **Initial Discussion:** Joel stated that his involvement started on Sunday 23 August 2015 when Joshua asked him to go along to a meeting which Joshua had with Anwer. Even though Joel knew Anwer, and that all of them were part of the same secret society, Joel said that Joshua was closer to Anwer. During the meeting, Joel thus ended up not participating in the discussions nor did he even stand within earshot when Anwer and Joshua were talking. At one point though, Joshua called Joel over to have a look at a photo of a person whom he later learnt to be Ali. Joel then saw Anwer pass $200 to Joshua, before they left for the task. Joel said that it was then that he learnt from Joshua that the task involved trailing that person in the photo, and that Joshua would need to “_koddu_” that person. Joel understood the Tamil word “_koddu_” to mean getting that person injured or scarred. Joel did not know whether the money received was part-payment for a bigger sum.

12      **The 1st Outing:** After the meeting with Anwer, the two of them then went to the vicinity of Victory restaurant that same night, and did manage to trail Ali from the Golden Landmark Hotel area to the Little India MRT station area before losing sight of Ali. Joel then saw Joshua call Anwer to update him on what happened.

13      **The 1st phone call:** The next day, Joel said that Anwer called him after unsuccessfully trying to get through to Joshua. Anwer told Joel that the paymaster wanted that person Ali injured, and that there was urgency in getting the “_koddu_” done. Joel said he and Joshua did not however put seriousness into the matter and wanted to be done with it and go about their lives because they became concerned when Ali seemed to be aware of them when they trailed him the night before.

14      **The 2nd phone call:** The next day, Anwer called Joel again after unsuccessfully trying to get through to Joshua. Anwer reiterated the urgency and said that he wanted the “_koddu_” to the face. Joel understood this to mean to scar the face of Ali. Joel told Anwer that he would relay the message to Joshua. Subsequently, Joshua told Joel that he had spoken to Anwer and that he was going to do it. Joel agreed to go along.

15      **The night of the incident (26 August 2015):** Joel said that Ramge was supposed to monitor the front of the Victory restaurant, while he and Joshua were monitoring the back. He and Joshua spotted Ali, trailed him, before Joshua went forward towards Ali. When Ali saw Joshua approach with a knife, Ali also took out a knife. In the exchange, Ali was slashed on the face, and Joshua was cut at his hand. Joel said he did not expect that Joshua would be armed because a weapon was never mentioned, and that he thought Joshua just needed to punch the person. Joel then called Anwer to update him on what happened, before the two of them took a taxi to see Anwer. Joel said that Joshua could not go to a government hospital for his injury as Joshua was then wanted for AWOL from his NS obligations and that he would need to see a private doctor instead, and this was why Joshua had a deposit of $1,700/- into his bank account. Joel said he did not know who the monies originated from. Joel confirmed though that Joshua did brag to friends about the cash on Snapchat. Out of that sum, Joel said he ended up borrowing $600-$800 from Joshua because Joel’s girlfriend was then pregnant.

16      **Summary:** To recap, Point (1) sought “What if anything did Joshua and/or Anwer inform Joel in relation to what Joel and/or Joshua were required to do in respect of Ali?”, and the answer from Joel’s testimony was as follows:

> \-    Joel learnt from Joshua that Anwer had instructed Joshua to trail and “_koddu_” Ali, i.e. to injure or scar Ali, and that a sum of money was paid for them to proceed that very night.

> \-    When the first outing was unsuccessful, Joel received two phone calls from Anwer asking about the task. Anwer told Joel that the paymaster wanted Ali injured, that the task was urgent, and that the “_koddu_” had to be to the face of Ali, i.e. to scar the face of Ali. Somewhat contradictorily, Joel nonetheless claims that he thought Joshua just needed to punch Ali because a weapon was never discussed.

> \-    When the task against Ali was completed, more monies were received by Joshua after the outcome was reported back to Anwer.

17     For the additional evidence to be meaningfully considered, it would have been ideal for the contradiction to be addressed. It appeared to me that Joel was being coy about exactly what he knew of the “_koddu_” task and his involvement in the scheme. This appears from two aspects of his offered testimony: 1. the inherent plausibility of carrying out a “_koddu_”, i.e. injuring or scarring a person’s face, with just a punch, and 2. that the handsome sum ultimately received – which Joshua could not resist photo bragging about – were simply for the more mundane purpose of Joshua’s private healthcare medical bills, and which Joel surprisingly nonetheless saw fit to proceed to extract out a large proportion for his own use. The brevity and incongruity of Joel’s testimony on those two areas left them doubtful, and suggested that there was more which he was not letting on about. The obvious suspicion was that the handsome sum – which appeared to far exceed any expectant private medical healthcare bills – was actually the agreed payoff for a commensurately significant injury being caused. The parties before me chose not to specifically address those aspects either during the hearing nor in their subsequent submissions. They may yet do so at the appeal as to the appropriate weight to be attached to Joel’s evidence.

18     As it stands, even if Joel’s testimony as offered up were to be accepted whole, I found that it did not affect the earlier verdict because the testimony did not contradict any of the evidence relied upon by the original trial court judge to convict. On the contrary, it had the effect of affirming the conviction because Joel’s testimony corroborated the evidence relied upon by the original trial court judge to convict in that it confirmed that there was (1) a third party paymaster, (2) who wanted the “_koddu_” task completed on Ali’s face, and (3) that the task was urgent. At the same time, that testimony also served to materially contradict Zackeer’s central claim in his defence that the plan was simply to have Joshua issue a verbal warning to Ali. Joel’s testimony was clear that the assigned task went well beyond the verbal, and that it unambiguously involved physical violence to cause injury and/or to leave a scar on the face of Ali, and that a handsome sum (one worth bragging about) was received after that task was completed.

19     I now turn to address the other evidence received, i.e. the 4 statements taken from Navas during the investigations, and how they related to Points (2) and (3).

### 2\. What did Navas witness while he was in the vicinity of no. 697 North Bridge Road on 22 August 2015 at or about 6.45 am; and

### 3\. Why did Navas send photographs of Ali to Anwer.

20     Navas was never called as a witness in the original proceedings against Zackeer and Anwer because he left the jurisdiction. As mentioned earlier, Navas remained outside of the jurisdiction and refused to offer his evidence before me. The parties instead opted to present his 4 police statements for the court’s consideration. Two aspects of the statements bear mention.

> ■**Reticence:** The police recorded the first statement from Navas on the 29 August 2015 – a few days after the attack on Ali. After comparing notes with the positions taken by the others, Navas was questioned again on three more occasions, and he proceeded to progressively offer up more details as to what happened and his involvement in those three statements. Navas put his initial reticence and denials down to fear and self-preservation. Exactly what that meant, and whether those were the only factors at play for the developing nature of his disclosures remains a point of contention.

> ■**Material Portions Rejected:** In the position eventually offered up by Navas in his statements, he denied any wrongdoing by himself, Nasir and Zackeer on the occasion when the altercation with Ali took place (i.e. on the 22 August 2015). It was apparent that these denials (in so far as he and Nasir were concerned) were not tenable because he and Nasir were found guilty of having uttered threats to Ali on that occasion.

Given that developing character of the content offered up by Navas, plus the fact that material exculpatory portions were ultimately found to be wholly untrue, caution is required in considering the statements. I start by first setting out the position disclosed by Navas in those statements, before returning to consider their effect. Read as a whole, a balanced review of the 4 statements establishes Navas’ claims on Points (2) and (3) to be as follows:

> ■**Events on 22 August 2015:** Navas said that the police arrived at Zam Zam at about 6.40 pm on 22 August 2015. The police checked on Zam Zam’s employees and their work permits, and advised them not to tout by the roadside. The police then went over to Victory to do the same. Navas said he remained at the front of Zam Zam and saw the police approach Ali, and he heard Ali tell the police that Zam Zam employees were always touting till the end of the street. Navas said he became angry and shouted at Ali in Tamil that he should tell the truth. Ali shouted back that Navas should be more respectful when he speaks. Navas replied that Ali should not expect respect if he talked like that to the police. At one point, Navas indicated that he had a photograph of Ali touting which he could show to the police. Ali shouted back and told Navas that he could shove that photograph into the ass of his boss, Zackeer, motioning it crudely as he said so. Navas was angered. Nasir was present and he told Ali that all these problems began only after Ali started work there. The police ended up separating them and warned them to stop arguing. Navas said he then walked away with Nasir.

> ■When Zackeer arrived at the restaurant a while later, Navas then told Zackeer what happened earlier. Zackeer then went to speak with Ghazali who was the boss at Victory. Navas heard Ghazali tell Zackeer that he did not know what happened, and Zackeer responded that if Ghazali did not know, then he should just go back and mind his own business. Navas then heard Zackeer say “I will see how you work”; although Navas said he did not know who that was directed towards, he said that Ghazali was already walking back in by that time but Ali was still standing at the front of Victory then. Navas saw Zackeer then move a short distance away before calling someone on his handphone, and he did not hear what was said in that call.

> ■     **Subsequent Dealings with Anwer:** The day after, Navas said he received a call from Anwer. Navas knew Anwer because the latter was close to Zackeer, and Anwer would also order food from Zam Zam to sell at his own restaurant. After some casual conversation, Anwer asked who was this Ali who had a problem with Zackeer. Navas tried describing, but Anwer indicated that he still could not picture the person. Navas then indicated that he had a photo where Ali was present, and Anwer requested for it. Navas then sent that photo to Anwer via Whatsapp. Navas said the conversation did not raise any suspicion and he thought Anwer just wanted to know Ali’s face.

> ■A few days later, Navas said he received another call from Anwer. The conversation started on something else before Anwer turned to request for the photo of Ali again. Navas questioned, and Anwer explained that he did not manage to see the photo after he deleted it prematurely. Navas indicated that he too had deleted his, but he could take another photo of Ali and send it to Anwer. Navas then went outside the restaurant and discreetly took a photo of Ali, and sent it via Whatsapp to Anwer. Later that night, Navas called Anwer to discuss about getting Anwer’s help to offer employment to a friend of Navas. After that conversation, Anwer asked if Ali was still at Victory. Navas replied that Ali was still there because he saw him a few minutes earlier. Navas again explained that the conversations did not raise any suspicions as to Anwer’s intentions. The next day, Navas learnt from the other Zam Zam staff that Ali had been attacked. That was when he suspected that the photos he sent to Anwer had been misused. Worried and fearful for his future, he decided not to mention his involvement in getting the photos to Anwer when he was first called up by the police for investigations.

21     Objectively, the recount by Navas in his statements of the events of 22 August 2015 partly supported and partly contradicted Zackeer’s position in his defence. It supported Zackeer’s defence because Navas claimed that no threats were uttered to Ali by anyone on that occasion, but it contradicted Zackeer’s defence because Navas’ claims as to what he heard Zackeer utter towards Ghazali and Ali was completely at odds with the version from Zackeer. In deciding on the reliability of Navas’ recount of the events of that day, I noted that substantial aspects of that recount had already been found to be wholly untenable. The claim that no threats were uttered to Ali by anyone was rejected at trial, and both Nasir and Navas were found to have threatened Ali on that occasion. What therefore remained of this tainted statement was the reliability of the last part where it involved Zackeer. Together with the unsatisfactorily changing character of Navas’ position in his statements, all this gave cause for concern over the reliability of Navas’ remaining aspect in that claim, i.e. that Zackeer also made no threat against Ali, and whether Navas was similarly offering up an untruth. There was cause for concern since Navas plainly had reason to be less than objective in implicating his employer Zackeer as that would potentially affect his own future. That Navas was concerned for his future was disclosed by him in his later statements. Conclusions either way could not therefore be drawn because Navas did not offer himself up for questioning. I did not think it was safe in these circumstances to rely on that statement from Navas. The end result was that it therefore had no effect on the earlier verdict to convict Zackeer for threatening Ali.

22     Turning to the final aspect, I did not find the account from Navas in his statements on why he sent photos of Ali to Anwer to have any effect on the earlier verdict to convict. Whilst this account had also plainly changed over time in his statements, there was no other reason put before me as to why it should not be regarded. Therefore, when read objectively, though the account was explicitly self-preserving in that he claimed to know not of Anwer’s intentions, it did not have the effect of contradicting the evidence relied upon by the trial court to convict on the conspiracy charge. On the contrary, based on the little which Navas knew, his recount had the effect of affirming the decision because he said that soon after the altercation on 22 August 2015, Anwer learnt that Zackeer had a problem with Ali, and Anwer called Navas to find out who was this person Ali, and that led to Navas forwarding a photo of Ali to Anwer. That account was wholly consistent that there was conspiracy to cause hurt to Ali.

## Conclusion:

23     The exercise of taking additional evidence under section 392 of the CPC requires the trial court to “state what effect, if any, the additional evidence taken has on its earlier verdict” – section 392(4) CPC. The parties before me made various rounds of submissions as to whether it was even possible for this court to do so since the earlier verdict was recorded by a different judge. However, given the order from the High Court, together with the statutory requirement as worded, I think we are beyond any ambiguity that this court has to render its opinion on the effect of the additional evidence. Having considered the additional evidence placed before me, and having reviewed the decision of the trial court, I found that the additional evidence had no effect on the earlier verdict to convict.
