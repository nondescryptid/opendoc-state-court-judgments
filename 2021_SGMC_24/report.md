Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9045/2021/01\].

15 April 2021

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against an order of Probation.

2       The accused pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 338(b) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed.) (“PC”) for causing grievous hurt to one Wong We Pao (“the victim”) by doing an act so negligent as to endanger the life of that person.

3       Briefly, the particulars of the charge was that On 24 July 2019, at or about 2033 hrs, whilst driving motor car SMK682U (“the vehicle”), the accused failed to keep a proper lookout while travelling along West Camp Road, she collided with the victim, causing him to sustain severe traumatic head injuries which rendered his left arm functionally useless.

## Facts

4       The accused admitted to Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The facts are relatively straightforward. A summary is set out below.

5       At the time of incident, the accused was then 19 years of age.

6       On 24 July 2019, at about 2033 hrs, the accused was driving the vehicle along West Camp Road. This is a two-lane road with a speed limit of 50 km/h. Meanwhile, the victim was cycling along West Camp Road with his friend, who was some distance in front of him. The front and rear lights of the victim’s bicycle were switched on.

7       The accused had been driving on the left lane of the two-lane road (“Lane 1”) when she decided to change lanes to the right lane (“Lane 2”). As she was executing this manoeuvre, she noticed through her right-wing mirror that there was a vehicle approaching from the rear. She decided to swerve back into Lane 1. She was then travelling at about 70 km/h, which was above the speed limit.

8       As she was doing so, the right side of the vehicle collided into back the victim’s bicycle. As a result of the collision, the victim was flung onto the right side of the vehicle’s windscreen, causing it to shatter. The victim then fell onto the road.

9       As the accused stopped the vehicle, several cyclists also stopped to render assistance to the victim. The victim was then conveyed to hospital by ambulance.

10     At the time of the incident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, and traffic volume was light.

11     Meanwhile, the victim was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”) where he received emergency treatment. The victim eventually remained in KTPH for 28 days, after which he was transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”) where he was further hospitalised for 42 days. He remained on hospitalisation leave until December 2019. After his discharge from TTSH, the victim continued his outpatient rehabilitation in Ipoh.

12     The various medical reports revealed that the victim had suffered severe traumatic brain injury. As a result of this injury, his left arm is likely to remain functionally useless permanently. It was noted that, although the victim has resumed work at his company, this has negatively affected his ability to work. Whilst he now works in an office-based environment, the disability in his left arm has rendered him unable to use a computer keyboard.

13     Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted her on the single charge.

## Antecedents

14     The accused has no antecedents.

## Submissions on sentence / plea in mitigation

### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

15     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least two weeks’ imprisonment, and a disqualification period of five years from all classes of vehicles. It was submitted that this would be in line with:

> (a)     the sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution taking precedence over rehabilitation in this case;

> (b)     the application of the sentencing framework laid out in _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span>; and

> (c)     that the disqualification period is suited based on sentencing precedents.[^1]

16     Although the accused was a young offender, and the dominant sentencing objective of is presumed to be that of rehabilitation, the focus on rehabilitation could be diminished or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant, such as “_where the offence is serious_, _the harm is severe_, or _where the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options viable”_: per Menon CJ in _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ \[2015\] 1 SLR 334 at \[30\][^2].

17     In the present case, where the offence was one of negligent driving, deterrence and retribution would override rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing objective. The Prosecution provides below three key reasons, which can be summarised as thus:

> (a)     The principle of rehabilitation is diminished given the nature of the offence. The offence in the instant case is not one arising from any behavioural patterns that can be corrected through rehabilitation. It was a one-off incident that did not arise from any tendency or impulsivity to commit crimes;

> (b)     The principle of retribution is of key consideration due to the harm caused to the victim and culpability of the accused. The punishment meted out should reflect the degree of harm and culpability of the accused. Here, the harm to the victim was severe, and the culpability of the accused was high as she was driving above the speed limit; and

> (c)     The principle of deterrence is of key consideration in cases of negligent driving. It was submitted that drivers should be upheld necessarily ought to be a very high given the likelihood of grievous harm that could arise from negligent driving.

18     Applying the two-step sentencing framework in _Tang Ling Lee_, it was submitted that this case fell under Category 3 of the sentencing band in _Tang Ling Lee_, which gave a presumptive sentencing range of more than two weeks’ imprisonment. Taking into account the factors, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative sentence was four weeks’ imprisonment.[^3]

19     Next, the Prosecution considered the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, and submitted that these warranted a 50% downward adjustment from the starting point of four weeks. Therefore, the appropriate sentence should be two weeks’ imprisonment.

### Plea in mitigation

20     The Defence Counsel submitted that a Probation Suitability Report (“PSR”) should be called.

21     The accused had just turned 19 years old at the time when the offence occurred, rehabilitation should therefore remain the key sentencing principle. The was an extremely high threshold to be met for rehabilitation to be displaced as the primary sentencing consideration and the imposition of an imprisonment term for a young offender (per _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR 449</span> (“_Al-Ansari_”) at \[61\][^4]).

22     The Defence submitted that the following factors to show that rehabilitation remained the primary sentence consideration:

> (a)     the offence was not egregiously serious and not sufficiently serious to displace rehabilitation;

> (b)     that the accused was likely to respond better to a rehabilitative sentence;

> (c)     strong familial support.

23     In addition to the above the Defence cited the following mitigating factors:

> (a)     Early plea of guilt;

> (b)     Remorse. The accused had gone to the hospital to apologise to the victim;

> (c)     Good character. The accused had been active in various volunteering and community projects as per her testimonial from Greendale Secondary School;

> (d)     Rendered assistance to the victim. Although paralysed by the shock of the incident, she assisted the victim and rendered full cooperation to the paramedics and traffic police officers on-site and thereafter made her way to the police station expeditiously to provide a statement.

## Probation Report

24     When dealing with a youthful offender, the court would generally call for PSR and would not embark on an assessment of the offenders suitability for probation without the benefit of such a report: _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[20\] (_“Karthik_”); _Wong Shan Shan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 49</span> at \[19\] – \[21\].

25     Therefore, in light of the accused’s age at the time the offence was committed, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to call for a PSR.

26     The accused was found suitable for probation. The Probation Officer (“PO”) recommended that the accused be placed on 12 months supervised probation. In addition, she would be required to perform 60 hours of community service and her parents were also required to sign a bond to ensure her good behaviour during the period of probation.

27     Notwithstanding the accused’s suitability for probation, the Prosecution maintained their sentencing submission of two weeks’ imprisonment, The Defence continued to urge the court to place the accused on probation.

## Punishment Prescribed by Law

28     The punishment prescribed by law for an offence under s 338(b) of the PC provides that a person shall be liable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The governing sentencing principles for young offenders

29     I next touch upon the governing sentencing principles for young offenders. It is well established that the law takes the presumptive view that, in the sentencing of youthful offenders, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation. This is justified based on the retrospective rationale and the prospective rationale which underlie the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offenders: see _Karthik_ at \[43\]-\[46\].

30     In _Karthik_ at \[65\]-\[67\], Sunderesh Menon CJ laid down the relevant sentencing approach to be taken for young offenders. At the first stage, the court is concerned with the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. While the dominant consideration for youthful offenders is presumptively rehabilitation, its primacy can be diminished by the circumstances of the case or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution. This tends to be the position where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or (d) the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do not exist.

31     As regards to the last mentioned factor, when considering whether or not the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable exist may also be affected by the other considerations such as (a) the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender; (b) the availability of familial support for the offender’s rehabilitative efforts; and (c) any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation.

32     At the second stage of the framework, the court must then select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation.

### Applying the principles: the first stage

33     With the above sentencing principles in mind, I now turn to the facts in the present case to determine the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retained its primacy in the sentencing matrix laid down in _Karthik_.

#### Seriousness of the offence

34     One way of determining the seriousness of an offence (or lack thereof) is by the punishment prescribed by law. For example, in _Karthik_, the accused was convicted of one count of abetting, by conspiracy, the cheating of a motor insurance company under s 420 read with s 116 of the PC. The accused was part of a motor insurance scam that lodged fraudulent claims with insurance companies for “injuries’ suffered in staged accidents. The offence carried a maximum imprisonment of 10 years and a fine: see _Karthik_ at \[70\].

35     In the following cases, probation was also ordered by the court for offenders aged below 21 years who had committed more serious offences in terms of the punishment prescribed by law.[^5] For example,

> (a)     In _PP v Muhammad Haziq Bin Rosli_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 81</span>, the accused was convicted, _inter alia_, for two charges of rioting under s 147 of the PC. The punishment prescribed by law for rioting is a term of imprisonment which may extend up to seven years and caning; and

> (b)     in _PP v. Tan Tristen Joshua Rae Len_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 68</span> and _PP v. Khairul Naim Bin Mohamad Nasir_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 81</span>, the accused persons in both cases were convicted for various drug offences including a drug trafficking charge under s 5(1)(a) p/u s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) (“MDA”) which carries a minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane and a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

36     Therefore, by looking at the punishment prescribed by law for the offence, the present offence cannot be considered a serious one when looking at it in this light. The offence in the instant case is one committed under the negligent limb of s 338 of the PC. The maximum punishment that can be imposed is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both. Even within s 338 of the PC, the punishment prescribed by law for this offence is less severe than that under the rash limb. In fact, it is exactly half that of the rash limb.

37     As highlighted by the Defence, another way to determine the seriousness of an offence is the nature of the offence and the number of offences committed. In this case, the nature of the offence was one of negligent driving whilst there was only a single charge against the accused. I was therefore of the view that even using these factors, I would not consider this a serious offence.

38     At this point I should state that the determination of whether this offence is serious or not is only with regard to whether the present offence is sufficiently serious to displace the primacy of rehabilitation as the dominant consideration for youthful offenders.

#### Culpability of the accused / harm caused

39     I next assessed the culpability of the accused and the harm that was caused.

40     With respect to the harm that was caused as a result of the accused’s negligence, I am in agreement with the Prosecution that the harm caused to the victim was on the high side. As noted in the SOF at \[20\],

>      _“The permanent disability of his left arm has rendered the Victim unable to carry out his line of work, which involves setting up equipment at construction worksites. Though he has since resumed work at his company in an office-based role, the permanent functional uselessness of his left arm has rendered him unable to use a computer keyboard.”_

41     With regard to her culpability, I noted that there was one culpability enhancing factor. This was the fact that the accused was travelling faster than the speed limit of the road, namely 70 km/h on a road with a 50 km/h speed limit.

42     In light of the harm caused and the culpability enhancing factor, the Prosecution had assessed that this case fell within Category 3 of the sentencing framework set out by See J in _Tang Ling Lee_, namely greater harm and higher culpability. However, the Defence submitted that the case, instead, fell within Category 2 of the sentencing framework. It was submitted by the Defence that there was a high threshold that had to be met before a case fell within Category 3. As observed by See J in _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[36\]:

>      _“Cases falling within Category 3 cover the_ **_most serious road_** _traffic cases that give rise to offences under s 338(b) of the Penal Code, where there are_ **_both serious injuries_** _and a_ **_moderate to high degree_** _of culpability._ **_A case falling within the Category 3 sentencing band would usually feature at least two culpability-increasing factors and injuries of a very serious or permanent nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures_** _.”[^6]_

43     This was not a case that was the “_most serious of road traffic cases_”. Regretfully, the victim did suffer severe injuries. However, there appears to be only one culpability enhancing factor in this case. Hence, I adjudged that this did not fall within Category 3, but instead within Category 2 of the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework, albeit on the high end of that range.

44     Having considered the harm caused and culpability of the accused in the instant case, despite the serious injury caused to the victim, I was nonetheless not convinced that the primacy of rehabilitation had been displaced by the other sentencing considerations such as deterrence and retribution, much less eclipsed by them. I would be of a different mind if there were other culpability enhancing factors, for example, if the accused had also been driving the vehicle without a valid driving licence and without insurance, driving under the influence of drink or racing etc.

#### Conditions making rehabilitative sentencing a viable option

45     From the PSR prepared by the PO, I noted that the conditions that make rehabilitation sentencing a viable option were present in this case.

46     The accused has strong familial support. She has a close and warm relationship with his parents and an amicable relationship with her four younger siblings. Her parents were willing to work with the PO to ensure she abides by the probation conditions and to attend the necessary programmes. They intend to continue monitoring her whereabouts, peers and social activities closely and report to the PO if she was non-compliant.

47     The accused has never been in trouble with the law and overall, there has been a positive feedback from the PO. She was cooperative and forthcoming. She had been responsive to the trial probation conditions and had abided by the time restriction imposed. The PO has indicated her readiness to be rehabilitated in a community setting.

### Other Factors Considered

48     At \[10\] of the PAS, the Prosecution submitted that this was a _“ …. one-off incident that did not arise from any tendency or impulsivity to commit crimes; there is thus no behaviour to correct by means of rehabilitation. The sentencing principle of rehabilitation is hence of little value to the case at hand.”_

49     This, in my view, would not be correct. While the primary aim of probation is in the realm of rehabilitation, an order of probation still carried with it a form of deterrence. The accused would have to abide by a time restriction, be required to do 60 hours of community service within the period of probation ordered and that she not drive within the period of probation. Together with the bond for her good behaviour that her parents would have to sign, this would undoubtedly pose a deterrent effect on the accused as her “sentence” would, in effect, last for 12 months.

50     I also disagreed with the Prosecution that there was no rehabilitative need in this case as the offence was not one that required criminal thought. The PSR highlighted the need “_to emphasis to Jia Ying on the importance of complying with rules and laws_” and “_to guide Jia Ying in taking perspectives and recognising the impact of her actions on her victim and others_”.[^7] This will surely allow her to understand and change her mind-set for the future.

51     Finally, the Prosecution had objected to probation being ordered on the basis that this category of cases, ie offences under s 338 of the PC, as _“…. there is no behaviour to be corrected by means of rehabilitation_ ,…_”_ and “ .… _”that the sentencing principle of rehabilitation is hence of little value to the case at hand.”._[^8] However, the Prosecution’s position has not been consistent. I have reviewed cases in which accused persons under the age of 21 years had been convicted for a traffic-related s 338 PC offences and in many of these, the Prosecution had not objected to an order of probation. Just to highlight a few examples:

> (a)     In _PP v Pang Yen Hui Nicole_ (MAC-911637-2019), the accused was convicted of one charge for causing grievous hurt when driving a car so negligently so as to endanger the personal safety of others. The Prosecution did not object to probation being ordered by the court;

> (b)     In _PP v Emmanual Khong Kai Nian_ (MAC- 907637-2020), the accused was convicted of one charge for causing grievous hurt when riding an e-scooter so negligently so as to endanger the personal safety of others. The Prosecution did not object to the calling of a PSR. However, it should be noted that probation was not recommended in this case;

> (c)     In _PP v Toh Zhi Hong_ (MAC-904507-2020), the accused was convicted of one charge for grievous hurt when riding a e-scooter so negligently so as to endanger the personal safety of others. The Prosecution did not object to a PSR being called, nor to probation being ordered.

### The second stage

52     Having considered all the facts of the case in the first stage, I am of the view that the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to a youthful offender in the present case had not been eclipsed by other considerations such as deterrence or retribution.

53     Having made this determination, and all considered, I adjudged that was the most appropriate option in this case to rehabilitate the accused was probation.

54     In addition, it should be emphasized that, contrary to the Prosecution’s views of this, I am of the opinion that whilst the aim of probation is to rehabilitate an offender, in particular a youthful one, it still does carry with it, albeit to a lesser degree, a deterrent effect.

## Sentence Imposed

55     Accordingly, I ordered, as recommended by the PO, that the Accused undergo supervised probation for a period of 12 months. In addition, I also ordered the following, as conditions of probation:

> (a)     the accused is to remain indoors between 2200 hrs – 0600 hrs unless otherwise varied by the Probation Services Branch, in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Court;

> (b)     the accused is to perform 60 hours of community service during the period of probation;

> (c)     the accused is not to drive any motor vehicle for a period of 12 months with effect from the start of the Probation Order

> (d)     the parents are to execute a bond in the sum of $5,000 to ensure the accused’s good behaviour during the period of probation.

56     The Prosecution, being dissatisfied with the order of probation imposed on the accused has appealed against it. The order of probation has therefore been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.
