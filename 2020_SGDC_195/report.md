### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 39-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to a charge under section 57(1)(_d_)(iii) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) for harbouring an immigration offender, Hossan Muhammad Paval, having negligently failed to ascertain if he was acting in contravention of section 15(1) of the Act (“the Charge”). The place in question was a unit located at 10 Lorong 14 Geylang, Wing Fong Court #XXX (“the Unit”).

2       The Accused was represented.

3       I convicted the Accused on 12 June 2020 after a trial. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation and address on sentence presented by the Defence, I sentenced the Accused to a fine of $5,000 (in default 15 days’ imprisonment) on 15 July 2020.

4       The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the sentence is stayed pending appeal. I now set out my reasons for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       The Prosecution adduced evidence that, on 13 September 2017[^1], officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority arrested an immigration offender, Hossan Mohammad Paval (“Paval”) (PW2) at the Unit[^2]. At the time of arrest, Paval had remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period of 13 days[^3].

6       After Paval’s arrest, he informed the Investigation Officer, Inspector Mohamed Rudy bin Mahabut (“Insp Rudy”) (PW1) that the Accused had rented out a room in the Unit to him[^4]. Further investigations revealed that the owner of the Unit had leased the Unit to the Accused through a company, CKL Property Management and Consultant (“CKL”).

7       Paval was offered a composition fine of $100 for overstaying[^5].

8       Other than Insp Rudy and Paval, the Prosecution called three other witnesses for its case. They were:

> (i)     Chuang Kuan Leong, Jason (who ran CKL, a company managing properties for landlords/tenants) (“Jason”) (PW3);

> (ii)     Ng Ah Choon, Jay (who was the property agent for the tenant of the Unit) (“Jay”) (PW4); and

> (iii)     Tan Lay Kian, Jean (who was the property agent for the owner of the Unit) (“Jean”) (PW5).

### The evidence of Paval

9       Paval gave evidence that prior to moving to the Unit, he was staying at Lorong 24, near Guillemard Road[^6] (“Lorong 24”). However, he and five of his friends found themselves locked out of Lorong 24 one night, and had to look for alternative accommodation[^7]. Paval further testified that one of Paval’s friends, Nur Alam Sikder, then managed to get hold of the Accused and the Accused allowed them to stay at the Unit[^8].

10     There were two rooms available in the Unit at that time, and Paval and his friends took the bigger room which could accommodate the six of them. The Accused offered the room to him and his five friends at $250 per person per month. Eventually, the Accused agreed to let them have the room at $1,200 per month, which amounted to $200 per person per month[^9]. Paval also testified that the Accused told them that the rental fee was to be paid in cash by the fifth of every month[^10] and that the Accused then gave them six access cards to access Wing Fong Court, where the Unit was located. In addition, he gave them a key to access the Unit[^11]. Paval and his friends moved in on the same day[^12] and the Accused collected an “advanced payment” of $500 from them about two or three days later[^13].

11     On the day they moved into the Unit, the Accused asked all of them to produce their “documents”. Paval’s friends then showed their work permits to the Accused. As Paval did not have a work permit at that time, he showed the Accused his special pass instead. The Accused took a photo of the special pass and work permits[^14].

12     In addition to the above, Paval testified that, initially, the Accused would visit the Unit more than twice a month to check if the Unit was clean or whether any of them were cooking in the room. The Accused had instructed them not to cook in the room as that would affect the air-conditioning system. Eventually, the Accused visited the Unit less frequently[^15].

13     While Paval could not recall the exact date he moved in, he testified that it was sometime in 2016. He remembered moving out of the Unit in 2017, after about five or six months, as he was unable to pay the rental fee for the whole room when all his roommates moved out of the Unit[^16]. However, after moving out for about a month, Paval got in touch with the Accused, and moved back again as it was convenient for him to get to his place of work from Wing Fong Court.

14     This time around, the Accused gave him a token to access Wing Fong Court and charged him $1,000 for the room which Paval shared with two other friends[^17]. Subsequently, Paval was arrested sometime in July for “gambling”, and was arrested on 13 September 2017 at the Unit for overstaying[^18].

15     Paval further gave evidence that during the months that the Accused was not in Singapore, he and/or his friends would pay the rental fees in cash to one “Rubel”[^19]. Rubel would also help the Accused clean the Unit[^20]. Paval also testified that besides he and his friends, there were about 20 to 23 workers living in the Unit, and that he was told by them that their boss had made arrangements with the Accused for them to stay there, and that the workers were from the Accused’s company[^21].

### Evidence connecting the Accused to the Unit

16     To prove the Accused’s connection to the Unit, the Prosecution adduced evidence from Jean Tan, Jay Ng and Jason Chuang.

17     Jean testified that she represented the owner of the Unit for it to be put up for lease[^22]. She positively identified the Accused to be the main tenant of the Unit[^23]. Jean gave evidence that the Accused was the first Bangladeshi tenant of the Unit as previously, the tenants of the Unit were all Chinese nationals[^24].

18     Jean recalled that the Accused was brought by Jay Ng to the Unit[^25]. After viewing the Unit, she was informed that the Accused was interested in renting the Unit. However, she was told that the Accused was unable to sign the Tenancy Agreement (P4), and therefore, the Tenancy Agreement would be between the owner and CKL[^26], which was a company owned by Jason Chuang. In any event, the owner also preferred to sign the Tenancy Agreement with a company[^27]. The lease started on 1 June 2016, and was subsequently renewed in 2017 for another year. The Accused remained as the main tenant when the lease was extended[^28].

19     It was also Jean’s evidence that the Accused was present when the Unit was handed over pursuant to the Tenancy Agreement[^29], and the Accused was introduced to her by Jason as the “main tenant”[^30]. The Accused was not punctual in the payment of his rent and was late almost every month[^31]. However, he would eventually pay by depositing the amount into a bank account[^32]. When necessary, she would liaise with one “Rubelanko” _via_ WhatsApp for the payment of the rent[^33]. She had met the Accused a total of three times – she first met him when he came to view the Unit. The second time was during the signing of the Tenancy Agreement when the Accused was “officially introduced by Jason” and lastly, when the key to the Unit was handed over[^34].

20     Jay Ng’s evidence was that he was a property agent in 2016[^35], and met Jean, in the course of his work. Jean was looking for tenants for the Unit at that time[^36]. He recalled meeting the Accused when the Accused came to view a property in the Geylang area although he was unable to recall the specific unit[^37].

21     While it was Jay’s evidence that he knew the Accused in the context of the Accused being a tenant, he could not say definitively that the Accused was one of the few whom he had brought to view the Unit, and who subsequently became a main tenant of the Unit[^38]. He was, however, able to confirm that he received a list of names for submission to MOM for approval for stay in the Unit, as required in the Tenancy Agreement[^39]. Jean also confirmed that she received a letter stating that the names of the eight tenants had been registered with the Ministry of Manpower, together with the work permits of the tenants[^40].

22     Jay knew Jason Chuang, whom he referred to as his personal assistant. Sometime after he knew Jason, Jason set up a company, CKL[^41]. Jay’s evidence was that CKL later entered into a Tenancy Agreement (P4) with the owner of the Unit, through him and Jean. This was because the owner preferred leasing the Unit to a company, as opposed to an individual[^42].

23     Jason Chuang testified that he came to know the Accused through a contact who knew some Bangladeshi workers. The contact had called Jason and told Jason that his friend, who was the Accused, was looking for a place for himself. Jason then spoke to Jay and subsequently, an arrangement was made for the Accused to view the Unit sometime in May 2016. After the viewing, the Accused made an offer for the Unit[^43]. The owner accepted the offer and a Tenancy Agreement was entered into by the owner and CKL[^44]. After signing the Tenancy Agreement (P4), CKL then entered into a separate contract (P7) (“the Sub-Tenancy Agreement”) with the Accused since the Accused was the main tenant of the Unit[^45]. The Sub-Tenancy Agreement (P7) reflected the Accused’s name and FIN number[^46].

24     In relation to the payment of the rental fee, the Accused would pass the rental fee to Jason in cash on the tenth of each month, and requested that Jason transfer the amount to the owner as the Accused did not know how to effect a transfer[^47]. On occasions when the Accused was not available or overseas, his friend, who was also a Bangladeshi, would meet Jason on his behalf to hand over the rent[^48]. Jason recalled meeting the Accused’s friend on three to four occasions. However, in 2017 after the Tenancy Agreement was renewed[^49], Jason became too busy to collect rent from the Accused, and he gave the Accused’s contact to Jean so that the Accused could pay directly to her or the owner[^50].

25     Jason was not sure if the Accused stayed in the Unit. For the duration of the Tenancy Agreement (P4) and after it was extended (“the Extended Tenancy Agreement”) (P5), he did not visit the Unit to check if the Accused had stayed there[^51].

## The Defence

### The evidence of the Accused

26     The Accused testified that he had 12 years of education before coming to Singapore to work more than 11 years ago. Out of the 11 years, eight of which were with JL Fireshield Marketing Pte Ltd (“JL Fireshield”). The Accused was a supervisor at JL Fireshield at the time of the trial, and had been one for a few years[^52]. Since 2008, the Accused had been staying at 123A Kitchener Road (“123A”) except for one month in November 2016[^53]. The Accused also testified that his previous mobile number was “XXX”.

27     The Accused claimed that on the day he was told that he had to move[^54] out of 123A, he met his friend, “Ronnie” or “Rony”, who gave him a number to contact. The Accused then called the number and met up with an unknown man. The unknown man brought him to the Unit, and told the Accused that he could stay there for a monthly rental fee of $200 to $220[^55]. The Accused did not find out who he had to pay rent to, nor did he check with the unknown man (whose name the Accused subsequently claimed was “Manik”)[^56].

28     The following day, the Accused claimed that a man came into the room where he was staying and asked if he had moved in the day before. At that time, the Accused was alone in the room.[^57] The Accused described the man to be a “male Singaporean Chinese”[^58] who was more than 50 years old[^59]. The Chinese man did not introduce himself[^60], but asked to check the Accused’s work permit[^61]. He left after checking and taking photos of the Accused’s work permit[^62].

29     The Accused further claimed that the same Chinese man reappeared about one to two weeks later when the Accused was again alone in the room. When the Chinese man appeared the second time, he walked around the room for one to two minutes and then made an offer to the Accused: that the Accused clean the Unit and collect rent from the other residents, and in return, the Accused could stay in the Unit without having to pay any rent[^63].

30     Upon hearing the offer, the Accused kept quiet for a minute or two, and then abruptly, the Chinese man asked the Accused for his rent. The Accused paid him $220, and the Chinese man left. After the encounter with the Chinese man, the Accused called his boss, Leong Fook Keong, John (“John”) (DW5) and narrated the incident to him. The Accused also asked John if he could take up the offer. John told him no, and told him to move out of the premises as soon as possible[^64]. About two weeks later, the Accused moved out of the Unit and returned to 123A on 1 December 2016[^65].

31     With respect to Paval, the Accused claimed that he remembered meeting Paval on a Sunday in Little India, and that was the extent of his association with Paval[^66]. He claimed that he did not know Jason and Jean, and had no idea why he was being implicated by Paval, Jason and Jean[^67].

### The Defence witnesses

32     The Defence called four witnesses to give evidence. They were:

> (i)     the Accused’s ex-colleague and fellow tenant at 123A, Akter Babul (“Babul”) (DW2);

> (ii)     the landlord of 123A, Lee Sek Chin (“Lee”) (DW3);

> (iii)     the Accused’s boss at JL Fireshield, John; and

> (iv)     a handwriting expert, Yang Chiew Yung (“Yang”) (DW4).

33     Babul testified that he came to know the Accused about nine years ago when they were colleagues in a company known as Shafim[^68]. He had been living at 123A for the past nine years and moved out for a month in November 2016, when 123A was being renovated[^69]. He knew at the time he moved out that the renovations would be completed in a month and that he could move back to the same premises thereafter[^70].

34     Lee testified that some repairs had to be made to 123A in November 2016[^71]. It was Lee’s evidence that he told the Accused and some of the tenants that they had to move out for a period. However, after the repairs were done, they could move back to 123A, if they wanted to do so. He was unable to recall the number of tenants who moved out as it was too long ago[^72]. Subsequently, the Accused called him in late November, asking if he could move back and Lee informed the Accused that he could do so as Lee had already completed the repairs[^73].

35     The Accused’s boss, John, gave a glowing review of the Accused’s character and capabilities as the supervisor of JL Fireshield[^74]. He testified that the Accused moved to “Geylang” for a month when it was being renovated. While John was unable to recall the month or year the Accused moved out[^75], he claimed that the Accused moved to Geylang, while the other four workers moved to Serangoon[^76]. He further claimed that the Accused called him after two weeks of his move to Geylang, and informed him that a Chinese man had approached him to “take care of the premises, cleaning up and things like that”[^77]. The Accused felt that there was something “fishy”, and so John advised him to call Lee and asked Lee to allow the Accused to move back to 123A as soon as possible[^78].

36     The Defence also call a handwriting expert, Yang, to testify. Yang was from The Forensic Experts Group, and had vast experience in forensic document examination (D10). Yang testified that she was asked to compare the specimen signatures of the Accused and the signatures in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement (P7). It was her testimony that the signature in question was “completely different” from the specimen signatures provided by the Accused, and therefore, there were “insufficient features” that she could use for comparison between the signatures[^79]. There was thus “little, or no basis for comparison”[^80]. Yang concluded that the “evidence is inconclusive” as to whether the Accused had made the signatures in P7[^81], that is to say, she was unable to say if the Accused had written the signature in P7, or somebody else had written it[^82].

## Closing Submissions

### The Prosecution’s submissions

37     The Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses was credible and reliable. They were truthful witnesses and the testimonies of Paval, Jean, Jay and Jason were “largely consistent”. Furthermore, there was no reason for any of them to frame the Accused[^83].

38     The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused was not a credible witness and his evidence was inconsistent and illogical[^84]. The Prosecution further surmised that the Accused had rented the Unit to house additional migrant workers required to complete JL Fireshield’s projects[^85].

### The Defence’s submissions

39     The Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that the Prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reason doubt as investigations were incomplete, the Prosecution witnesses were not credible, and there was insufficient evidence against the Accused[^86].

40     The Defence argued that the Prosecution failed to call various persons to the stand even though Paval and Jean had mentioned them in their testimonies[^87]. In addition, the enforcement officers failed to seize the mobile phones of the Prosecution witnesses, and consequently failed to retrieve any communication or phone logs between them and the Accused. Nor did the Prosecution adduce any documentation or proper evidence identifying the Accused as the main culprit[^88].

41     In relation to the credibility of the Prosecution witnesses, the Defence submitted that “little weight should be given” as they were unreliable and inconsistent in aspects of their testimonies, for example, in relation to the signing of the Sub-Tenancy Agreement (P7), and the handing over of the keys to the Unit and the payment of the rental fees[^89].

42     The Defence also submitted that the Accused was a credible witness who was consistent in denying that the signatures in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement were made by him and in maintaining that he only resided at the Unit for a month in November 2016[^90].

## My decision

### The ingredients of the charges

43     In order to establish the Charge against the Accused, the Prosecution had to prove:

> (a)     the Accused provided shelter to Paval between 1 and 13 September 2017;

> (b)     the Accused negligently failed to ascertain if Paval had acted in contravention of the provisions of the Act; and

> (c)     Paval was an immigration offender at the material time.

44     Section 57(7) of the Act states:

> Where, in any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1)(_d_)(ii) or (iii), it is proved that the defendant has given shelter to an immigration offender, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the defendant has harboured him with reckless disregard as to whether he is an immigration offender or negligently failing to ascertain as to whether he is an immigration offender, as the case may be.

### Credibility of the Prosecution witnesses

45     The main witnesses for the Prosecution were Paval, Jean and Jason. Paval, Jean and Jason were unequivocal in identifying the Accused to be the person connected to the Unit.

#### Paval

46     Paval positively identified the Accused to be the one allowing him to stay at the Unit over two separate periods, and more importantly, the period in question: between 1 and 13 September 2017. He gave a textured and detailed account of how he came to be acquainted with the Accused, the arrangements in relation to the rental of the room for both periods (for example, the dos and don’ts of the “lease”, the handing over of the access cards and rooms keys, the payment of rent) and his dealings with the Accused. He also testified that the rent would be handed over to Rubel, on the months when the Accused was not around, and further gave evidence that while he was unable to recall the Accused’s exact mobile number, he knew the number ended with the digits “33”. This was consistent with the Accused’s evidence that his previous mobile number was “XXX”.

47     Paval had already been dealt with for his immigration offence by the time he testified against the Accused in court. His answers were forthcoming and consistent throughout despite rigorous cross-examination. He was candid in admitting that Rubel had told him not to mention his name to the authorities. I have no reason to believe that Paval had framed the Accused and was trying to shield “the real culprits” instead, as alleged by the Defence.

#### Jean and Jason

48     The Accused’s connection to the Unit was also confirmed by Jean, who positively identified the Accused to be the main tenant of the Unit at the material time, having rented the Unit from the owner through CKL from June 2016 to May 2018. Jean knew that the Accused was the main tenant of the Unit, even though the Tenancy Agreement and the Extended Tenancy Agreement (P4 and P5 respectively) were signed by Jason’s company, CKL.

49     Jean further testified that she had liaised with one “Rubelanko” for the payment of the monthly rent. “Rubelanko” appeared to be the long-form of “Rubel”, which was the name mentioned by Paval in relation to his evidence on the payment of rent. There was absolutely no reason for Jean to implicate the Accused and identified the Accused to be the main tenant if that was not true. She had nothing to gain by falsely implicating the Accused as the main tenant, if the main tenant had been someone else. Further, it could not be mere coincidence that both she and Paval identified the Accused as the person connected to the Unit during the relevant period.

50     I next considered the evidence of Jason. Jason’s evidence cemented the Accused’s connection to the Unit. He testified that his company had signed the Tenancy Agreement and the Extended Tenancy Agreement on behalf of the Accused, who was the main tenant. Likewise, Jason had no reason to lie and frame the Accused by claiming that the Accused was the main tenant. The Sub-Tenancy Agreement reflected accurately the name and FIN number of the Accused, and I accepted Jason’s evidence that the Accused was the one who provided these details. Indeed, how else would Jason, Jay or their staff have the Accused’s particulars and reflect them in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement, if the Accused had not given his particulars to them?

51     As for Jay’s evidence, while he was unable to recall which property the Accused was associated with, he was able to identify the Accused as a tenant whom he had dealt with. Apart from this aspect of his evidence, I did not consider the rest of Jay’s evidence critical to the Prosecution’s case.

#### The witnesses had no reason to lie

52     I found Paval, Jean and Jason to be credible, having heard their testimony and observed their demeanour in court. While there may be some facts or details which these witnesses were unable to recall, I recognised that their memory in relation to these might have been affected by the passage of time, as their contact with the Accused happened at least a couple of years prior to the start of the trial.

53     For Jean, Jason and Jay, it was likely that they had not paid attention to details relating to the signing and preparation of the Tenancy Agreement, the Extended Tenancy Agreement and the Sub-Tenancy Agreement as they probably had not expected that they had to come to court to give evidence on the tenancy in relation to the Unit at the time these documents were executed. These documents were routine documents that they came across in the course of their work. In dealing with discrepancies and/or inconsistencies of this nature, I found the observation made by Abdul Hamid J in _Chean Siong Guat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span> at 64 instructive:

> … In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies … On the other hand, if a magistrate finds the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them.

54     The above observation was endorsed by Yong Pung How CJ in _Sundara Moorthy Lankathran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 253</span> at \[40\], and more recently by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in _Jayasekara Arachchilage Hemantha Neranjan Gamini & anor v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 689</span> at \[66\]. I did not think that the evidence of these witnesses in relation to the charge against the Accused was undermined in any way by the minor discrepancies and/or inconsistencies. Nor did these discrepancies or inconsistencies affect the veracity of the evidence of Jean, Jay and Jason.

55     The Prosecution witnesses had no reason to lie – Paval was not known to Jean, Jay and Jason at all. As for Jean, Jay and Jason, their relationship did not extend beyond their work and I could not think of any reason why they would collaborate with each other to frame the Accused.

56     I therefore was of the view that there was sufficient evidence from the Prosecution to prove the Charge against the Accused.

### The Accused was not a credible witness

57     Having found that there was sufficient evidence against the Accused, I considered whether the Accused had raised a doubt to the Prosecution’s case.

58     The Accused’s defence was one of bare denial. He denied having any association with Paval beyond the chanced meeting with him at Little India one Sunday. He denied having met Jean, Jason and Jay in the past, and that the first time he saw them was during the trial. He denied being the main tenant of the Unit. However, the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses showed otherwise and the Accused offered no explanation as to why the Prosecution witnesses would falsely implicate him, how Paval knew his mobile number and how his particulars came to be reflected in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement.

59     Further, the Defence did not challenge Paval’s evidence that he had the Accused’s number and Jason’s evidence that the Accused had provided the particulars reflected in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement. I did not think that a bare denial of knowledge on the part of the Accused, without more, was sufficient to raise a doubt to the Prosecution’s case.

60     It is also trite that any “matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to \[the witness\]”. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 is clear:

> It seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and passed it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit…

> \[emphasis added\]

61     I next considered the Accused’s narrative of his stay at the Unit in the month of November 2016. I rejected the Accused’s account of the events surrounding his stay in the Unit as his narration was inconsistent, and at times illogical:

> (i)     The Accused claimed that his friend “Ronnie” or “Rony” gave him the contact of an unknown man when the Accused was looking for accommodation during the period that 123A was undergoing renovation. He maintained, rather illogically, that he did not know the name of this unknown person[^91].

> However, rather belatedly, almost towards the end of the Accused’s cross-examination, when the Accused probably realised that it was no longer tenable for him to maintain the position in relation to the unknown man, he claimed that the unknown man was one “Manik”[^92].

> (ii)     The Accused gave various differing versions of how and where he first met the unknown man. For example, the Accused initially claimed that when he arrived at the vicinity of Geylang, he called the unknown man who then “waved” at him[^93]. Then, the Accused claimed that the unknown man was already at the front gate of the Unit when he waved at the Accused[^94]. Finally, the Accused said that the unknown man was actually in the Unit when the Accused arrived. Upon the Accused’s arrival, the unknown man opened the gate and door to allow the Accused into the Unit[^95].

> (iii)     I found the Accused’s failure to:

>> (a)       find out the exact rent payable, the arrangement for the payment of the rent and the applicable house rules; and

>> (_b_)  request for an access card to Wing Fong Court,

> illogical and unbelievable.

> On the point of the access card, in particular, I found it incomprehensible that the Accused did not request for an access card to Wing Fong Court before he packed his belongings to move into the Unit[^96]. And even after he had moved in, he did not deem it necessary to have an access card which was needed in order for him to gain entry into the compound of Wing Fong Court, choosing instead to wait for other residents of Wing Fong Court to open the side gate to let him into the compound[^97].

> (iv)     The Accused gave inconsistent accounts of whom he met when he first moved into the Unit and of his first encounter with the Chinese man[^98]. As for his second encounter with the Chinese man, I found the narration that the Chinese man had paced round the Accused’s room without saying anything to be ludicrous. With respect to the purported offer, I found it illogical that the Chinese man would approach the Accused and trust the Accused to help him in the manner described, when he did not know the Accused at all.

> Furthermore, it was surprising that the Accused had paid the Chinese man $220 without first ascertaining from him the rent payable.

62     I also considered the credibility of the alleged phone call that the Accused made to John after his second encounter with the Chinese man. It was not disputed that the Accused was a valued employee as far as John was concerned. John relied heavily on the Accused to supervise his workers, including workers supplied to his company by manpower agencies. The Accused was responsible for the punctuality and discipline of the workers and in ensuring that the workers did their job properly. In addition, the Accused helped to take care of the accommodation of JL Fireshield’s workers and the workers from the manpower agencies[^99]. John, therefore, had a vested interest in giving evidence which was favourable to the Accused.

63     I further observed that while John was unable to remember the month and year the Accused moved out of 123A, he was able to remember, with surprising clarity, the contents of the alleged phone call which happened almost four years ago. In any event, although John tried to corroborate the Accused’s account of the alleged phone call, his version was inconsistent with the Accused’s. The Accused claimed that he sought John’s advice on whether to accept the Chinese man’s offer and John told him not to accept, whereas John gave evidence that the Accused told him that he found something “fishy” about the Chinese man’s offer. John did not mention that the Accused asked him if he (the Accused) could accept the offer. I therefore placed little weight on John’s evidence in relation to the alleged phone call by the Accused.

### The alleged inadequacies in the investigations

64     The Defence placed considerable emphasis on the signatures in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement, claiming that the Accused did not make them, and adducing documents which purportedly bore the Accused’s “real” signatures. The Defence also appointed a handwriting expert.

65     I found that Yang’s evidence did not assist the Defence case, and was at best, neutral. Indeed, she was clear in saying that she was unable to conclude whether the Accused had made the signatures in the Sub-Tenancy Agreement. Given the obvious difference in the signatures, I took the view that there was no real value in having the signatures analysed by a handwriting expert (see _Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 227</span> at \[26\] to \[28\]).

66     Even if I accepted that the signatures in the Defence exhibits bore the Accused’s signatures, it did not mean that the Accused did not sign the Sub-Tenancy Agreement using a different signature. Whether the Accused had in fact signed the Sub-Tenancy Agreement could be proved either by way of expert evidence, or by the oral testimonies of Jean and Jason – Jean and Jason were unequivocal in their evidence that the Accused was the main tenant. I found Jean and Jason to be credible witnesses and there was no reason for them to lie.

67     The Defence raised other points on the inadequacies of the investigations, for example, the lack of phone logs, etc. While these might strengthen the Prosecution’s case against the Accused, the lack of which was not detrimental to its case, as the Prosecution’s case was based primarily on the evidence of Paval, Jean and Jason, all of whom I found to be credible witnesses. In any event, it is not the Prosecution’s burden to prove its case beyond all doubt (see _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[68\]).

### The Accused’s motive

68     The Prosecution theorised that the Accused had rented the Unit for the purpose of housing workers working for JL Fireshield, either as an employee of JL Fireshield or a worker supplied by a manpower agency. I did not think that it was necessary to prove the Accused’s exact motive for renting the Unit. The Accused could have used the Unit to house JL Fireshield’s workers, which was not inconsistent with Paval’s testimony that most of the workers at the Unit were “the Accused’s workers”. It would also be consistent with John’s evidence that he depended heavily on the Accused to arrange for accommodation for JL Fireshield’s workers[^100] and that it would be good if he could house all his workers in one location[^101]. Alternatively, it could be that the Accused saw how lucrative it would be to use the Unit for subletting to other migrant workers and therefore used it as a means to earn extra income for his family.

69     However, the Accused’s motive was not determinative in ascertaining whether the Accused had harboured Paval and the motive of an offender is also not an ingredient of the Charge.

## The sentence

70     An offence under section 15(1)(_d_)(iii) of the Immigration Act is punishable with a fine not exceeding $6,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both.

### Antecedents

71     The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence

72     The Prosecution submitted that the key sentencing position for such an offence is that of general deterrence. The case precedents showed that the sentence for a first-time offender, who pleads guilty, is a fine which is between $3,000 and $4,000. A fine of $4,000 was imposed in cases where the period of harbouring was longer. As the Accused had claimed trial, the Prosecution submitted for the maximum fine of $6,000.

### The mitigation plea

73     In mitigation, the Defence submitted, _inter alia_:

> (i)     the Accused was the sole breadwinner of his family, earning only about $1,800 per month[^102];

> (ii)     the Accused was a simple-minded person of mild temperament[^103]; and

> (iii)     the Accused was untraced[^104].

74     The Defence submitted for a fine of not more than $4,000[^105].

### Decision on sentence

75     From the precedents, the starting point for sentencing in an offence under section 15(1)(_d_)(iii) of the Immigration Act is a fine which is between $3,000 and $4,000, depending on the length of time which the immigration offender had overstayed. This is applicable to an offender who is a first time offender and who pleads guilty to the offence.

76     In the present case, the Accused had claimed trial. While it was the Accused’s right to claim trial to the charge, it would mean that the Accused was not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of a first-time offender pleading guilty to his charge in a timeous manner.

77     I did not find any exceptional factors in the mitigation plea. It is well established that, other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (_Ong Ker Seng v PP_ \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 406 at \[30\] and _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[31\]).

78     However, I accepted that the Accused had no previous conviction in Singapore and had been law-abiding for the past ten years that he was working in Singapore, and I accorded due weight to these factors. In addition, Paval’s period of overstaying was not long – having remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period of about two weeks.

79     The Prosecution did not raise any aggravating factors in the present case, apart from suggesting that the Accused had provided accommodation to Paval for monetary gains. While that might have been the motivation, I did not consider that to be particularly aggravating. This was also not a case where the Accused had conducted his defence in a vexatious manner, making spurious allegations against the Prosecution witnesses.

80     In the circumstances, while I took the view that a fine which was higher than $4,000 was appropriate, I did not think that the maximum fine of $6,000 was warranted given the lack of aggravating factors. I therefore imposed a fine of $5,000 (in default, 15 days’ imprisonment) on the Accused.

## Conclusion

81     The case did not present any complex issue of law. Having considered the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, the Charge against the Accused, and a fine of $5,000 (in default, 15 days’ imprisonment) was fair.
