### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

1       These grounds set out the decision which I make and my reasons therefor in a renovation dispute between the parties, heard by me.

2       Having carefully read the parties’ closing and reply submissions and examined the record, my decision is to substantially allow the Plaintiff’s claim and to allow a limited portion of the Defendant’s counter-claim.

3       This dispute concerns renovation works done by the Plaintiff for the Defendant at a condominium unit at “XX-XX Horizon Tower Condominium” (“the flat”).

4       The Plaintiff’s claim is for outstanding payment of $121,257.69 for the renovation works. The Defendant says that the Plaintiff failed to do the renovations with due care and competence so that they were not reasonably free from defects and fit for their purposes.[^1] The Defendant says that owing to the alleged defects, whatever sum that may be due to the Plaintiff would be neutralised by the Plaintiff’s counter-claim and result in the Plaintiff having to pay the Defendant $32,019.15 “as rectification costs” and $21,000 “as compensation amount” for loss of use of the flat.[^2]

5       The Defendant had bought the flat in early 2014. The flat was for the Defendant’s and his family’s occupation.[^3]

6       In August 2014, the Defendant employed Kloud LLP to draw up a design for the flat.[^4]

7       The Plaintiff’s claim for the outstanding payment is based on there being three agreements, one for the sum of $110,000 for original works first agreed (“original works”), a second in the sum of $150,000 for variation works (“variation works”) and a sum of $16,257.69 for additional items which the Plaintiff bought and installed at the flat based on several requests made by the Defendant (“additional variation works”). Including a payment of $50,000 which the Defendant made on 9th February 2015[^5], parties agree that the Defendant has paid to the Plaintiff a total sum of $155,000, leaving the balance which the Plaintiff claims.

8       The Defendant had initially disputed any agreement between the parties, at any rate, for the variation and additional variation works; the Plaintiff having pleaded that the parties agreed on each of the three components of the works[^6], the Defendant denied this but then pleaded that there was an agreement in respect of the original works[^7]. This position was reiterated in the Defendant’s opening statement.[^8] In his AEIC, the Defendant admitted that he agreed to the variation works.[^9] However, he maintained that when the Plaintiff sought a second payment on 3rd February 2015, which led to his second payment of $50,000, he was “alarmed as \[he\] had not agreed to the installation/costing of the above items.”[^10], by which he referred to the additional variation works. The position thus is now that parties agree that there were two agreements, one for the original works and the other for the variation works. The Defendant’s position remains that he “did not agree to the installation and/or the cost of the additional variation works.”

9       The Defendant’s case is that there was a firm date for completion of the renovation works in that “the Plaintiff’s Roy represented to the Defendant that the renovation works would be completed by Christmas _i.e._ 25 December 2014.” [^11]

10     The trial occupied three days. The first day was concerned with my hearing and ruling on a preliminary objection of the Defendant. The testimonial part of the trial took place during a later tranche of two days.

11     Each party called three witnesses.

12     The Plaintiff called Mr Teo Khoon Ling Roy (“Roy”), the Plaintiff’s director involved in the contractual negotiations with the Defendant[^12], Mr Johnny Shang Chia Hui, the Plaintiff’s director who supervised the works[^13] and Mr See Choo Lip, a quantity surveyor who had featured as the parties’ single joint expert[^14] but whose report and addendum were disowned by the Defendant.

13     The Defendant himself testified.[^15] He also called two witnesses. Mr Neo Thiam Soon, a technical officer of Inspect First Singapore Pte Ltd (“Inspect First”), who provided evidence of fact concerning defects he observed at the flat during his site visit on 31st May 2015.[^16] Providing expert evidence for the Defendant was Mr Lem Shen Yeong, a quantity surveyor who said that he made a site visit to the flat on 17th March 2018.[^17]

14     This case has had a troubled procedural history. As parties perhaps realised, the resolution of this dispute would turn much on expert evidence. As I shall explain, this has been so and my decision is informed by my assessment of the merits of the parties’ respective experts’ evidence. In particular, I accept Mr See’s evidence.

15     I need to first advert to the procedural history because it has an impact on the quality of the experts’ evidence, directly in respect of Mr See’s, and indirectly in respect of Mr Lem’s.

16     In his preliminary objection, the Defendant claimed that Mr See’s evidence should be inadmissible because of without prejudice privilege.[^18] Parties had attended mediation sessions at the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution from 19th October 2015. At a CDR session on 17th June 2016, it was suggested that parties jointly appoint a third party expert surveyor. Over several weeks, parties exchanged proposals for such a single joint expert. The Defendant rejected the Plaintiff’s proposals. In the event, on 26th July 2016, the Plaintiff agreed to Mr See’s appointment based on the Defendant’s proposal.[^19]

17     In the letter dated 28th November 2016, the Defendant’s solicitors, Donaldson & Burkinshaw, instructed Mr See on the terms of his appointment. An extract from Annex A to the letter reads:

> \[The Plaintiff\] and \[the Defendant\] have agreed to jointly engage Mr See Choo Lip of PMC World Pte Ltd (“the Expert”) to investigate and provide his impartial findings on the following issues in dispute, _such findings to be regarded as binding on both_ \[the Plaintiff\] and \[the Defendant\]:

> …[^20]

> (emphasis added)

18     In Part B of the Annex, it was stated that “\[The Defendant\] says that there were defects in the renovation works – please see Annex A to \[the Defendant’s\] Defence and Counterclaim dated 15 July 2015.” The “issue” for Mr See’s “determination” was to “determine which of the defects alleged by \[the Defendant\] are made out and which are not.” and “Insofar as any of the alleged defects are made out, to provide an estimate of the reasonable cost to make good these defects.”

19     It is noteworthy that the list of defects set out by the Defendant at Annex A of his pleading is taken from an inspection report dated 31st May 2015 prepared by Inspect First.

20     I heard submissions of counsel for the preliminary objection and rendered my oral decision in the afternoon of the first tranche of the trial on 26th December 2018.[^21] I dismissed the preliminary objection and upheld the admissibility of Mr See’s evidence including his report and his subsequent addendum dated 18th August 2017. The short reason for my decision was that Mr See’s appointment and terms thereof were the product of the parties’ negotiations, and thus was not privileged. I ordered the costs of the preliminary objection to be the plaintiff’s costs in the cause and reserved it for the conclusion of the matter.

21     It would be apparent that had the Defendant abided by his agreement, Mr See’s views concerning the defects listed in Annex A of his pleading, and rectification costs, would have been the end of the matter and it would have been amicably resolved. In the result, this did not happen.

22     Indeed, after the trial concluded, the Defendant filed an application to amend his Defence and Counterclaim to include supposedly “incomplete works”. Based on the record, the Defendant’s allegation of incomplete works is derived from Mr Lem’s report (although one cannot be sure about its provenance). The Plaintiff had duly objected to Mr Lem’s evidence including the allegations concerning allegedly incomplete works. Mr Lem had made references to such allegedly incomplete works. Two consequences arose out of these allegations.

23     On the basis of these allegations, Mr Lem derived “an assessment of the value of the renovation work performed by \[the Plaintiff\]. He arrived at an estimate of S$183,055.37…”[^22] (as opposed to the agreed price for the original works and the variation works). Using the alleged value of the work, deducting $68,120 (being the quotation of an entity that did not testify, Heavenly Homestead), adding GST to the difference, and last deducting sums paid to account by the Defendant, _i.e._ $155,000, the Defendant said that the Plaintiff owed him $32,019.15 as “rectification costs”.[^23]

24     Owing to the position that works remained “incomplete”, Mr Lem opined that the “contract completion date” was 1st February 2015 so that the “delay in completion as at 17 March 2018) was 1,140 days. This has extended to 1,251 days as at 6 July 2018 \[the date of Mr Lem’s AEIC\].”[^24] I note, but only in passing, that 1st February 2015 differed from the Defendant’s position that the contracted completion date was 25th December 2014.

25     In turn, this led to the Defendant saying in opening, the following:

> As a result of \[the Plaintiff’s\] delay, \[the Defendant\] had suffered loss of use of the \[flat\] for which he should be compensated. Based on the rental rates for an equivalent 2,303 square foot property at Horizon Towers at approximately $7,000 per month, \[the Defendant\] had suffered loss of use at (approximately):

>> a.       S$21,000 (S$7,000 per month x 89 days: 25 December 2014 to 24 March 2015);

>> b.       Further or in the alternative, S$250,220 (approximately S$200 per day x 1,251 days: 1 February 2015 to 6 July 2018).[^25]

26     I pause to say that in closing the Defendant has implicitly resiled from that humongous claim for so-called loss of use and fallen back on his pleaded position of 89 days x $7,000, _i.e._ $21,000. [^26]

27     The Defendant did not make any application to amend his Defence and Counterclaim at any time before or during the trial to include a case for saying that the Plaintiff failed to complete the contracted works. This was in spite of the Plaintiff’s notice of objections filed on 24th July 2018 and the Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Mervyn Foo’s, numerous objections during the trial. I dismissed the summons to amend his Defence and Counterclaim, which the Defendant unsuccessfully took on appeal to the High Court.[^27]

28     In spite of the court’s refusal to allow amendment, the Defendant’s closing submissions continued to argue at length that Mr Lem’s points about allegedly incomplete works should be taken into account.[^28] For example, the Defendant says:

> In adjudicating on the issues above, the Court must necessarily make a finding on the extent to which \[the Plaintiff’s\] renovation works are complete, and the state of the property. Next, the Court would also have to assess \[the Plaintiff’s\] liability to rectify said defects/incomplete works, and if so, the value of rectification. In this regard, the Court would derive invaluable assistance from Mr Lem’s expert opinion regarding the completion date and value of the renovation works.[^29]

29     The trite situation in respect of pleadings is very simply that it is not open to the Defendant to say that any of the works was incomplete or that there was any alleged consequence therefrom. Neither is it open to the court to make a finding concerning this, it being an un-pleaded point.

30     As pointed out by the High Court in _Abdul Latif b Mohammed Tahiar (trading as Canary Agencies)_ v _Saeed Husain s/o Hakim Gulam Mohiudin (trading as United Limousine)_ \[2003\] 2 SLR (R) 61 at \[7\]:

> Having heard arguments from both counsel, I came to the conclusion that the arguments by the plaintiff’s counsel as respects the Mercedes claim was without merit for the simple reason that the sum awarded by the court below was exactly the sum that was particularised and claimed in the plaintiff’s Amended Statement of Claim. _Although a higher figure was mentioned in the plaintiff’s accountant’s report, strangely, no application was ever made to the court to amend the pleadings. It is a settled principle of law that parties stand by their pleaded case and any defect in the pleadings cannot be cured by any averments in affidavits_, let alone an oblique reference in counsel’s closing speech (see _The Gold Ores Reduction Company v Parr_ <span class="citation">\[1892\] 2 QB 14</span>; _Novotel Societe D’ Investissements Et D’ Exploitation Hoteliers v Pernas Hotel Chain (Selangor) Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] 1 MLJ 210</span> at 214 and _Spedding v Fitzpatrick_ (1888) 38 Ch D 410).

> (emphasis added)

31     It may be convenient now to deal with my assessment of the respective experts’ opinions.

32     In _Saeng-Un Udom_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 1</span>, the Court of Appeal laid down principles for the analysis of expert evidence, particularly where there is no opposing expert evidence. Even though the case before me has proceeded on the basis that each party is leading his own expert evidence (albeit with objections by the other party), even as Mr See commenced, and indeed in substance completed, his role and his report and addendum as the parties’ single joint expert whose views were to be binding on parties, I have taken heed of the guidance of the Court of Appeal at \[26\] of the judgment, which I now set out:

> 26    The duties of a judge in dealing with expert opinion are succinctly stated in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 10 (Butterworths, 2000) at para 120. 257:

>> As to reception of the evidence, the court may, if there is no definite expert evidence to the contrary, agree with the expert (_Official Administrator Federated Malay States v State of Selangor_ <span class="citation">\[1939\] MLJ 226</span> but it must not blindly accept the evidence merely because there is no definite opinion to the contrary (_Re Choo Eng Choon, decd_ (1908) 12 SSLR 120). Apart, however, from that duty, the duty of the court is largely negative. Ex hypothesi, the evidence is outside the learning of the court. Therefore, the role of the court is restricted to electing or choosing between conflicting expert evidence or accepting or rejecting the proffered expert evidence, though none else is offered (_Muhammad Jefrry bin Safii v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR 197</span>). _The court should not, when confronted with expert evidence which is unopposed and appears not to be obviously lacking in defensibility, reject it nevertheless and prefer to draw its own inferences. While the court is not obliged to accept expert evidence by reason only that it is unchallenged_ (_Sek Kim Wah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] SLR 107</span>), _if the court finds that the evidence is based on sound grounds and supported by the basic facts, it can do little else than to accept the evidence_.

> \[emphasis in the original\]

33     In my view, Mr See has substantial expertise in quantity surveying. He has had over 30 years of experience in the construction industry as a quantity surveyor and project manager. He taught several runs of the Contract Administration and Estimating Course conducted by the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers since year 2000. He has contributed to the Rawlinsons’ Australian Construction Handbook with “various construction rates and prices for Singapore” (said to be a comprehensive building and construction reference book in its 36th edition in 2018).[^30]

34     On the other hand, Mr Lem “inadvertently” did not even include his curriculum vitae in his AEIC. In cross-examination, he said that he is a “tech member” of the SISV, an entry level member thereof.[^31]

35     Mr See’s opinion is logical, objective and clearly defensible and his methodology was also meticulous.

36     In his “Joint Expert Report”, Mr See stated that he conducted two joint inspections; one on 9 December 2016 “to identify the extent of defects listed in Annex A of the Defence.”; and another on 7 March 2017 “to identify the extent of variations listed in the Plaintiff’s email of 30 October 2014 and additional works listed in the Statement of Account dated 23 March 2015.”[^32]

37     I provide a sampling of his views.

38     Regarding item 62 of Annex A to the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim, for which Mr See deducted $3,500 for the entire marble floor for it to be re-polished because he opined that the dullness of the marble was “consistent throughout the marble floor of the unit.”[^33]

39     In respect of the main door of the flat, at item 4 of the same Annex, which did not have a Fire Safety Bureau certificate, Mr See deducted a sum of $1,819.60 for the door to be replaced, but stated this in the text of his report:

> Item 4 of the list of defects is the main door that does not qualify as a fire rated door as there is no FSB serial sticker at door frame and door panel. The Plaintiffs notify that the FSB serial sticker is in their possession. In order to avoid the trouble of having the door replaced, parties may agree to have the FSB serial sticker fixed and the amount that I have assessed may be omitted.

40     The sum of $1,819.60 comprised a sum of $1,450 for the cost of the main door and the balance for labour costs of replacement.[^34]

41     In respect of a shoe cabinet where the doors were not affixed, this being a replacement shoe cabinet that the Plaintiff had re-done to replace one that was insufficiently deep owing to a design issue, Mr See deducted $1,105 for the Defendant to have the doors fabricated afresh and installed. In the text of his report, Mr See explains:

> Item 8 of the list of defects is the nine missing doors to the full-height shoe cabinet. The Plaintiffs notify that the doors are in their possession. In order to avoid the trouble of having the doors fabricated again, parties may agree to have the doors installed by the Plaintiff and the amount I have assessed may be omitted.[^35]

42     On the other hand, Mr Lem’s report inexplicably bore no reference at all to Annex A of the Defence and Counter-claim.

43     Instead, Mr Lem took the position that the works were incomplete. Since the point is un-pleaded, that would be the end of the matter.

44     But, I am troubled by how he came about the idea that he could label the entire works incomplete owing to several minuscule items not being in place. The FSB sticker and the shoe cabinet minus doors are examples. Given the limited extent of the issues, “defects” would be the reasonable characterisation. The Defendant took that approach in pleading in Annex A of the Defence and Counterclaim, even as he did not at trial. Owing to what I see as a semantic sleight of hand, Mr Lem’s approach has the dual consequence that he moved away from the contract prices (for the claims in respect of the original works and variation works), as explained in the next paragraph, and he opines that “incomplete” items should be replaced.

45     Mr Lem’s position about incomplete works has co-mingled with his strange approach of using a so-called progress payment claim method, resulting in his asserting that the value of the work is $183,055.37. [^36] The contract for the original works, styled “contractual agreement”, does not provide for how payments are to be sought and made.[^37] There is no basis to depart from the parties’ contract to superimpose a requirement for so-called progress claims.

46     Mr Lem observed thus in his report:

> \[The Plaintiff\] commenced work on the premises on 29 September 2014 and payments were made by \[the Defendant\] on a monthly basis based on the progress of works on site. Despite the constant delay on the completion and list of defects present on site, \[the Defendant\] still honoured payments to \[the Plaintiff\] with accumulated paid amount of S$155,000.00. However, \[the Plaintiff\] had failed to complete their rectification work till to-date.[^38]

47     The extract just set out, in my view, betrays a partiality to the Defendant whose word he accepted. In one respect, _i.e._ that the Defendant paid monthly depending on progress of works, was factually wrong.

48     In regard to the shoe cabinet, Mr Lem took the view that as it had missing door panels, it was incomplete.[^39] He supported accepting and applied the Heavenly Homestead quotation,[^40] which provided for a new shoe cabinet priced at $12,500 and costs of removing the existing shoe cabinet at $500. This was, with respect, an example of a hugely disproportionate approach considering that the Plaintiff’s Statement of Account showed that it proposed to charge $2,160 to “supply labour and materials to dismantle full height shoe cabinet and fabricate deeper shoe cabinet”.[^41]

49     In this connection, I note that the same quotation would charge $3,800 for a half-hour fire-rated main door and $450 to remove the existing door. Again, by comparison, Mr See’s view (as noted above) with respect to the cost of the door was $1,450.

50     With respect, I have found Mr Lem’s views to be indefensible.

51     I agree that the Defendant’s counter-claim for rectification costs fails to mitigate his damages.[^42]

52     In _The “Asia Star”_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 1154</span>, the Court of Appeal pronounced thus at \[45\] of the judgment:

> 45    Having said that, we are of the view that Lord Macmillan’s observations (at 506 of _Banco de Portugal_) apply less strongly in a case where the aggrieved party rejected a reasonable opportunity to reduce its own loss. In other words, while it may be a general principle of the law on mitigation that the court will not nicely weigh on sensitive scales the measures taken by an aggrieved party to mitigate its loss, this principle will ordinarily apply more strongly in cases where the question before the court is whether the aggrieved party engaged in unreasonable _action_ as opposed to unreasonable _inaction_. Once the defaulting party establishes that the aggrieved party had reasonable options before it, greater justification will usually be needed from the aggrieved party which, despite knowing that it must act reasonably to mitigate its loss, does nothing at all. After all, the duty to mitigate encapsulates a policy consideration of the law that, once a civil wrong has occurred, the aggrieved party should be encouraged to be self-reliant or proactive in attempting to reduce its loss, instead of pinning all its loss on the defaulting party (see Andrew Burrows, _Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract_ (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2004) at p 122). Doing nothing at all will only infrequently be the most efficient, the most reasonable or the least costly option available to an aggrieved party. In the final analysis, both Lord Macmillan’s comments in _Banco de Portugal_ and the High Court’s remarks in _Jia Min Building Construction_ merely suggest that the standard of reasonableness is to be applied in a practical and commonsensical way, with particular sympathy for the aggrieved party. These cautionary remarks do no more than colourfully reiterate what has already been factored into the subjective element inherent in the reasonableness inquiry.

53     Whilst I have noted that the scope of the Defendant’s claim only became apparent when AEICs were exchanged, and that the Defendant does not appear to have disputed Mr Foo’s mitigation point,[^43] I find that the Plaintiff sufficiently (if prophetically) pleaded the issue of mitigation when it pleaded at \[16\] of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim that “Without prejudice to the Plaintiff’s position set out in paragraph 16 (_sic_) herein, the Plaintiffs further reserve the right to dispute the quantum of the alleged rectification costs once the same have been quantified by the Defendant.”[^44]

54     So far as defects were concerned, the Defendant was the aggrieved party so that I should not weigh up his actions too nicely. Unfortunately, even with that refrain mind, I find that the Defendant unreasonably rejected several opportunities to have the defects rectified. He rejected Roy’s offers to rectify the defects as he was evidently unwilling to make further payments towards the works as Roy requested. Then, having come into CDR, where parties are thought to have signalled a willingness to try to reach out to each other to avoid trial, and Mr See having proffered his views by which the Defendant himself agreed with the Plaintiff to be bound, he rejected Mr See’s views. Instead, he engaged Mr Lem, and by reference to a quotation from a contractor who was not called as a witness, the rectification of the defects escalated exponentially. I find that the Plaintiff has proven that the Defendant has failed to mitigate his damages.

55     In respect of rectification costs, subject to my need to account for mitigation, my decision is that I should accept Mr See’s opinion, which includes the additional variation works. For completeness, as a question of fact, I say in connection with the additional variation works, that I accept that the Plaintiff had no reason to incur the costs of the purchases and installation work, had they not received the Defendant’s go ahead.

56     Mr Foo argues that I should consider removing the sum of $1,819.60 owing to the Plaintiff having procured the (correct) FSB sticker. (See \[39\]-\[40\] above.) I would do that, but, not because I wish to lay down any condition requiring the Plaintiff to affix the FSB sticker. It does not need to do so if does not wish to. In addition, by parity of reasoning, although Mr Foo has not asked, I would also deduct $1,105 from the defects. (See \[41\] above.) I deduct these two sums because I find that the Defendant failed to mitigate his damages in that if he had acted reasonably and accepted Roy’s offer timeously, these two items of loss would have evaporated.

57     To round up this aspect, I now outline Mr See’s views on the values of the works and their rectification costs by reference to his report and the addendum, and state my findings.[^45]

58     For work done, which is the basis of the Plaintiff’s claim, Mr See accepted that the original works came to $110,000 (as claimed). Hence, I would allow this component. For the variation works, he deducted a sum of $5,700 for “armouring coating at kitchen walkway” because he wished to have the Plaintiff show that this was done as this work could not be visibly established.[^46] So far as this affects the Plaintiff’s claim, this means that I allow $144,300 ($150,000 - $5,700) for the variation works. In respect of the additional variation works for which the Plaintiff claims $16,257.69, Mr See valued them at $15,362.90, which is a _quantum meruit_ evaluation. Thus, Mr See’s figures would total $269,662.90 ($110,000 + $144,300 + $15,362.90).

59     Deducting the amount paid of $155,000 by the Defendant, the amount of $114,662.90 would be the quantum of the Plaintiff’s claim, which I allow.

60     In respect of defects for which the Defendant is entitled to damages, Mr See opines that there are defects in the original works and the variation works, requiring $14,274.20 and $6,410, respectively, to put right. As I said, I would reduce these amounts, specifically, the amount of $14,274.20, by $1,819.60 and $1,105, _i.e._, $2,924.60. So, for defects in the original works, I would allow a lower amount of $11,349.60.

61     These sums of $11,349.60 and $6,410 total $17,759.60 which is the sum I allow for the Defendant’s counter-claim for rectification costs.

62     I move on to deal with the Defendant’s claim for loss of use of the flat pegged to its rental value owing to an alleged delay in completion from 25th December 2014 to 24th March 2015.

63     The alleged completion date is nowhere documented. If there were an agreement for a firm completion date, particularly since this was to be for renovations to the new home of the Defendant, one would reasonably expect that there would be some written note of it. Indeed, the text of the WhatsApp messages exchanged on 5th January 2015 between Roy and the Defendant suggest to me that there was no firm December date. In response to the Defendant’s question at 1315 hours, “You think can finish before CNY or not?”, the reply at 1316 hours was “I asking him oso. We meeting vanity, carpentry and a few pple and estimating the schedule. Let u noe by today.” At 1317 hours, the Defendant sent three messages which said “Ok bro. If really cannot, the (_sic_) towards mid March.”, “Give you guys some breathing space.” And “I know Msian all go back for two weeks one.” To which, the response at 1317 hours was “K bro thanx. I will rush as much as possible. Let u noe later.”[^47]

64     This WhatsApp exchange would be odd since there is no reference at all to a missed deadline in December 2014. To the contrary, the Defendant said that he would be comfortable with a completion of the flat in March 2015.

65     Moreover, the Plaintiff correctly, in my view, relies on the authority of a High Court decision which says that this would not be a permissible basis of claim for loss of use when the flat was meant to be the Defendant’s home and was never at any time to be rented out. In _Yap Boon Keng Sonny_ v _Pacific Prince International Pte Ltd and anr_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 385</span>, Judith Prakash J, as her Honour then was, dealt with this issue as follows:

> 118    The defendants submitted that it was not correct for the plaintiff to use market rental value as a means to measure his loss of use of the property. In this connection, dicta in the case of _Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 853</span> was relied on. Andrew Phang Boon Leong J, observed at \[143\]–\[146\] and \[148\]:

>> 143    … The market rental value as a means to measure the loss of use to the owner, although convenient, is flawed. The market rental value reflects components of interest costs, depreciation, maintenance and property taxes. Given that the plaintiff was not able to shift to the subject property which was not completed on time, the full costs of certain components embedded within the market rental value such as depreciation and maintenance cost of the building and property taxes would have not been incurred whilst the plaintiff remained at its former premises. …

>> 144    There are, in fact, three main scenarios that could have possibly resulted in (as well as justified) the use of market rental to estimate loss of use.

>> 145    The first is if the plaintiff was waiting to commence its business in the subject premises and as a result of the delay had to incur the expenses of renting _alternative premises_. …

>> 146    A second possible scenario is if the plaintiff had required the subject premises _in addition to_ its former premises. …

>> …

>> 148    A remaining scenario is where the plaintiff had decided to retain its former premises and desired the subject premises as _an investment_. If so, then the delay in the completion of the subject premises would have resulted in the loss of rent that could have been obtained from these premises. …

>> \[emphasis in original\]

> …

> 120    I agree that in this case it would not be correct to measure the loss caused to the plaintiff by the delay in completion by having reference to the cost of renting similar premises in the vicinity. This is for two reasons. First, the plaintiff did not rent similar premises in the vicinity and did not incur that rental expense. Second, it was clear from the plaintiff’s evidence that he and his wife had purchased the property and undertaken the project with the sole aim of making the completed house the family home. At the time of the purchase, the plaintiff, his wife, their four children, the plaintiff’s mother-in-law and a maid were all residing in a maisonette flat in Tampines. This was a squeeze and the plaintiff wanted to obtain more living space for his family. This intention on the part of the plaintiff continued throughout the project as manifested by the amount of time and care that the plaintiff and his wife devoted to the construction and the furnishing of the interior of the house. Thus, it was the plaintiff’s intention throughout to move his family into the house upon completion. At that stage, his maisonette in Tampines would have been vacant and available for rent. The delay in the completion of the house deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity of earning income from the maisonette for about one and half months. I consider therefore that the loss to the plaintiff has to be calculated with reference to what he could have made from renting out the flat in Tampines rather than to what he could have made from renting out the property since he did not have any intention of earning an income from the property.

## ORDER

66     I would dismiss the Defendant’s counter-claim for loss of use.

67     My decision is thus that the Plaintiff’s claim is allowed in the sum of $114,662.90 and the Defendant’s counter-claim is allowed in the sum of $17,759.60. These sums would be set off, _i.e._ the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff $96,903.30 with interest thereon at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ.

68     With respect, counsel on both sides have taken great trouble over this matter. In particular, the closing and reply submissions on each side occupy _circa_ 100 pages. Where my reasons as set out herein do not deal with points they have raised, counsel may take it that I nevertheless carefully considered them but found that they do not impact my decision.

69     I propose to fix the costs of both the claim and the counter-claim as well as those concerning the preliminary objection. Counsel would please let me have their written submissions concerning costs, not exceeding three pages, within 14 days from the date of issue of these grounds of decision.
