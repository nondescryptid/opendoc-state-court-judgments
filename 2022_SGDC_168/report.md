29 July 2022

### District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam:

1       This is an appeal by the Accused person, Claus Nicolajsen (“the Accused”), against a sentence of one week’s imprisonment imposed for the offence of giving false information to a police officer.

## Facts

2       The Accused is a male, Danish national, aged 45 years. He works in Singapore for DSV Air & Sea Singapore PTE Ltd as the Vice President for the APAC region. At the time of the offence, he resided at The Coast located at 276 Ocean Drive, Singapore, with his wife and two children.

3       On 22 October 2019, the Accused’s wife Liu Xia, (“the Accused’s wife”) left their residence to spend the afternoon with her friends at the Sentosa Golf Club, where she consumed wine during dinner. She informed the Accused that she would be at the Sentosa Golf Club and the Accused was aware that she would be drinking alcohol at the club. She left the club at around 9.30pm to return home. Whilst driving home, she collided into a lamp post along Allanbrooke Road, Singapore, after which, she continued to drive home. She arrived at The Coast shortly before midnight and sought the Accused’s assistance to re-park her car in the car park.

4       When the Accused went down to the car park, he met a Sentosa ranger who informed him that his wife had collided into something whilst driving earlier that day. Following this, his wife returned to their unit and did not leave the unit till about 9am the next day.

5       On 23 October 2019, at or about 12.30am, IO Nor Faizal Yahya (“IO Faizal”), a Traffic Police Officer from the Singapore Police Force, called at the Accused’s unit, to look for the Accused’s wife to speak to her about the collision. IO Faizal was accompanied by several officers from the Singapore Police Force, the Sentosa ranger Gian Boon Chong (“the Sentosa ranger”) and a security officer from The Coast (collectively referred to as “the other personnel”).

6       The Accused answered the front door and informed IO Faizal and the other personnel that his wife was not in the unit and that she was at Holland Village with her friends. The Accused said this repeatedly when in fact his wife was in the unit at the time. IO Faizal asked the Accused to make a call to his wife. The Accused went into the unit, ostensibly to call his wife. He returned to inform IO Faizal that he had tried to call his wife. The Accused then expressed irritation that IO Faizal was still wanting to speak to him when it was already well past midnight. He also disagreed with IO Faizal that he had earlier come up the elevator with his wife. The Accused stated that his wife was at Holland Village and said that he has repeated this “500 times”. IO Faizal and the other personnel left the unit.

7       IO Faizal checked with the security officers from The Coast and ascertained that the Accused’s wife had not left The Coast. IO Faizal and the other personnel returned to the Accused’s unit. This time they went to the back door of the unit and asked to enter the unit. The Accused who answered the door, refused entry. The Accused repeated that his wife was at Holland Village although she was in the unit at the time. IO Faizal then gave the Accused his name and contact number and told the Accused to inform his wife to report to the Traffic Police Headquarters later that morning.

8       Both visits to the unit by IO Faizal and the other personnel were captured in the video footage.

9       The Accused’s wife went to the Traffic Police Headquarters on 23 October 2019 at about 11.02am, more than 12 hours after the collision. She underwent a breathalyser test and the result was “Passed”. The breathalyser test was conducted after a significant lapse of time. This meant that the Police were unable to obtain a reliable or accurate result of the Accused’s wife’s breath or blood alcohol levels at or close to the time of the accident.

10     On 25 October 2019, at about 3.20pm, the Accused provided a statement to IO Faizal at the Traffic Police Headquarters. The Accused stated that at the material time on 23 October 2019, he did not know where his wife was, but she had texted him to say that she was at Holland Village.

## The Charge

11     The Accused was charged with one count of furnishing false information to IO Faizal, an offence under section 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“section 182 offence”). The charge reads as follows:

12     DAC 914308-2021:

> …are charged that you, on 23 October 2019 at about 12.30am, at 276 Ocean Drive #XXX, Singapore (“the **unit**”), did give information which you knew to be false to a public servant, _to wit_, by informing Investigation Officer Nor Faizal Yahya (“the **IO**”), a Traffic Police Officer from the Singapore Police Force, that Liu Xia was not at the unit, but at Holland Village instead, knowing this information to be false, and knowing it to be likely that you would thereby cause the omission of investigations by the IO, which the IO ought not to have done if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

13     The Accused pleaded guilty to the charge. He was untraced for prior offences.

14     The Accused’s wife was charged with offences under section 65(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) and section 84(1) RTA. She pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a global fine of $1400, in default 7 days’ imprisonment, and a disqualification for 3 months.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

15     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of between two to three weeks’ imprisonment. The following factors pertaining to the Accused’s culpability were highlighted.

> (a)     The Accused knew that the information given was false (as opposed to merely having reason to believe that it was false); and

> (b)     The Accused provided the false information repeatedly on 23 October 2019 during the two visits to his unit by the Police, and again on 25 October 2019 when he provided his statement to the Police, thereby persisting with the lie. The Accused persisted with the false information even after being warned when he was providing his statement to the Police, that making a false report is a criminal offence.

16     The following aggravating factors pertaining to the harm caused by the Accused’s offence were highlighted.

> (a)     The false information resulted in a perversion of the course of justice as the Accused’s wife could not be administered a breathalyser test in good time;

> (b)     The predicate offence which the Accused sought to help avoid is a serious offence (drink driving); and

> (c)     The Accused ultimately never recanted the false information.

17     The Prosecution relied on the High Court decision in _Koh Yong Chiah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 243</span> (“_Koh Yong Chiah_”) at \[50\] for the proposition that a custodial term is the starting point where appreciable harm is caused by the section 182 offence. The Court in _Koh Yong Chiah_ set out at \[43\] and \[44\] various factors that go towards determining the culpability of the offender and the harm caused by the offence. The Prosecution argued that these factors feature in the present case and having regard to these aggravating factors, a sentence of between two to three weeks’ imprisonment would be fair and in line with the precedents cited.

18     The Prosecution further submitted that the Accused’s false statements had caused appreciable harm primarily because he perverted the course of justice by shielding his wife from possible prosecution for drink driving and a potential conviction and a mandatory disqualification from driving (see _PP v Ng Jia Jie_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 223</span> (“Ng Jia Jie”) at \[46\]). The potential harm that arose from the Accused’s falsehood was that of his wife possibly escaping liability for an offence as a direct consequence of the Police’s inability to follow up with full and proper investigations into her predicate offence of drink driving. Drink driving has been characterised as a “serious menace to the safety of the community” by CJ Menon in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[38\]. Even though a breathalyser test was ultimately administered, the delayed test would not correctly reflect the actual alcohol level at the time of the incident (_Ng Jia Jie_ at \[55\]).

19     The Prosecution argued that compared to the case of _Ng Jia Jie_, where the predicate offence of drink driving is similar, the Accused’s culpability here is higher since he persisted with the lie despite knowing it to be patently false. The false information was not recanted at any point. In contrast, in the case of _PP v Yeo Fang Yi_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 9</span> (“_Yeo Fang Yi_”), the predicate offence was also drink driving, but in that case, the offender recanted the false information three years after the incident.

20     The Prosecution added that it bears noting that the Accused did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. In fact, preparations for trial fixed on 11 – 14 April 2022 were well underway until relatively late in the day, when the Accused finally decided to plead guilty on 31 March 2022.

21     The Prosecution submitted the following table which outlines the brief facts of the case precedents which the Prosecution relied on:

## Mitigation Plea and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

22     The Defence submitted that the Accused is remorseful for his actions and accepts the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts without qualification of the plea. The Defence relied on the case of _Yang Suan Piau Steven v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 809</span> at \[23\] (“_Yang Suan Piau Steven_”) to argue that the custodial threshold was not crossed in the present case. It was submitted that the facts of this case fall within the “exceptions to the norm” specified in _Yang Suan Piau Steven_ and a fine of $2,500 would suffice. The Defence proceeded to elaborate on the exceptional circumstances seen in the present case.

23     The Accused’s residence at The Coast was a 4-bedroom unit with a large floor area of about 2,500 square feet. There were two separate lifts leading to the unit, one which opens directly into the unit, and another which opens outside the unit, near the rear door. By reason of the size of the unit and the presence of two exits, members of the household may not know or see whether the other person is in the unit at any point in time or in which part of the unit the other person is in or whether the other person has left the unit altogether. Additionally, the family owns two cars which the Accused and his wife use interchangeably.

24     On 22 October 2019, the Accused’s sons had fallen ill. Usually, the Accused’s wife took care of the children when they were not well. On that day, the couple had a disagreement and the Accused’s wife left their home at about 12 noon, leaving the care of the children to the Accused and their domestic helper. The Accused’s wife texted the Accused to say that she would be at the Sentosa Golf Club with her friends, after which she would proceed to Holland Village with them. In the six years that they had been married, the Accused had not known his wife to consume more than two glasses of red wine (or its alcoholic equivalent) in one day, and she would drink only about once a week. More importantly, she would not drive if she felt that she had consumed more alcohol than usual. She would take a taxi or call the Accused to fetch her home.

25     On 22 October 2019, sometime between 9:30pm and 10:00pm, the Accused’s wife returned to the unit and asked the Accused to help re-park the car. She had parked the car head-in but the condominium’s management had a standing rule against parking vehicles head-in. The Accused went down to the car park to re-park the vehicle tail-in. He met a Sentosa Ranger at the car park who informed him that the vehicle which his wife had driven that day had collided into something. It was later ascertained that the object was a small lighting device. While the Accused was conversing with the Ranger, his wife went into the lift lobby, presumably to go to up to their unit. The Accused re-parked the vehicle and then returned to the unit alone.

26     When the Accused returned to his unit, he heard his children crying in the master bedroom but he did not see his wife. Shortly after midnight, the doorbell rang. The Accused answered the door and found IO Faizal at his front door. IO Faizal asked to speak to his wife but did not say why he wanted to speak to her. When IO Faizal asked about the Accused’s wife’s whereabouts, the Accused replied that she was at Holland Village. When IO Faizal asked the Accused to call her so that IO Faizal could speak to her, the Accused went into the unit and tried to call his wife 12 times, instead of checking if she was either in her bedroom or in the children’s room. The Accused then invited IO Faizal to enter the unit to look for his wife but IO Faizal simply told the Accused to wait in the unit. This visit by IO Faizal was captured in the video footage.

27     At this juncture, the Defence repeated that the Accused unreservedly accepts the Statement of Facts without qualification. The Accused had no reason to believe that his wife was at Holland Village or that she had left the unit.

28     Not long after, at about 1:00am, IO Faizal visited the unit again. This time he rang the doorbell at the back door. The Accused once again answered the door. IO Faizal requested to enter the unit but the Accused refused. This visit was captured in the video footage as well.

29     The Defence pleaded the following in mitigation. The Accused had worked long hours that day, close to 14 hours. He was tired and also had to deal with his children’s sickness in his wife’s absence. In addition, he had to deal with IO Faizal on at least five occasions that same night which added to his stress. His irritation stemmed from having been aroused from his sleep at a very late hour. He was also not told that his wife was being investigated for drink driving, or that the police officers wanted to carry out a breathalyser test on her. He had initially invited IO Faizal to check whether his wife was in the unit but this was declined. The Accused deeply regrets that he had failed to act conscientiously or to co-operate with IO Faizal. On hindsight, the Accused accepts that his actions were uncooperative. Nevertheless, he pleads for leniency on the grounds that it was a late intrusion at a time when his children had started crying again, and the appearance of so many police officers at his home over what seemed to him to be a minor incident was unexpected.

30     The Defence further pleaded that the Accused had cooperated with the authorities during the course of investigations. The Accused pleaded guilty to the amended charge at the earliest possible stage and avoided a full-blown trial which has saved cost and time for everyone. Even if it is thought that the Accused had committed the offence to protect his wife, he had not sought any personal gain from it. The collision did not cause any harm or personal injury. The property damage was considered so minor that the Accused’s wife was not asked to pay for the repairs to the lamp. There were no other aggravating circumstances in this case.

31     The Defence submitted that the present case is similar to _Yang Suan Piau Steven_ in that there are no other aggravating circumstances. The offender in that case was found guilty of having given false information on at least three occasions regarding the tampering of the fuel gauge in his car to deceive the Customs officer who was recording the fuel gauge readings. He maintained the untruth until the officer physically checked the car and found a remote control device which was used to tamper with the fuel gauge readings. Notwithstanding the undeniable intention to deceive the officer, Chan Sek Keong CJ substituted the custodial sentence with the maximum fine for the offence. The main reason for the reduction in sentence was the absence of aggravating factors. CJ Chan stated:

> _“The motivation… (for giving false information by making a false report) …was not attempting to evade prosecution or shield someone from prosecution …The statement of facts did not disclose any factor which could be considered aggravating…(thus)…a high fine would serve the ends of justice for this offence” (emphasis added)_

32     CJ Chan’s reasoning in the above passage was cited with approval by the Court in _Koh Yong Chiah_ at \[27\] where the Court noted that the absence of personal gain and non-aggravating factors constituted “exceptions to the norm”.

33     The Defence went on to submit that the lack of co-operation with IO Faizal cannot be construed as a possible “aggravating factor”. The Defence referred to the transcription of the conversation with IO Faizal, which was recorded in the video footage, and stated that the disagreement with the police officer is something which is unlikely to ever recur. The Accused had disagreed that he had returned to the unit with his wife. The Defence conceded that the Accused was irate and impolite to IO Faizal and he deeply regrets this. It was pleaded instead that it is commonplace for everyone in the European Union (“EU”) to see clearly defined “_right to respect for…private and family life…_” without interference by a public authority. The exception being “_in accordance with the law…necessary…in the interests of national security, public safety or …the prevention of disorder or crime…_”.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) In short, EU citizens have come to expect a right to privacy in their home and may even sue a public official for an invasion of that right. It was reasonable for the Accused to expect that when the police officers came asking to see his wife at a late hour, they should state the criminal offence that they were investigating, rather than assert that the Accused and his wife had gone up the lift together. If they had stated that they were investigating a possible drink driving offence by his wife, then the Accused’s refusal to co-operate can be seen as an aggravating factor. In the circumstances, the Defence submitted that the argument with IO Faizal should not be taken as an aggravating factor.

34     The Defence further submitted that the harm must be causally connected to the provision of false information. IO Faizal did not state that he was investigating the Accused’s wife for drink driving or that he wanted to perform a breathalyser test on her. Without such knowledge, the delay in administering the breathalyser test cannot be attributed to the Accused. The Defence contrasted this with the facts in _Yang Suan Piau Steven_ where the offender in that case had deliberately sought to mislead the Customs officer.

## Prosecution’s Reply

35     The Prosecution based its arguments on what the Accused was deemed to know at the point in time.

36     The Prosecution argued that it is true that IO Faizal did not mention what offence he was investigating at the time, but to say that the Accused was clueless is wrong. From the background facts, it can be seen that the Accused was aware that his wife was involved in a traffic accident prior to returning home. The Accused also knew that she would have been drinking with her friends before driving home. That is seen in the Statement of Facts. She arrived home and then the Police came knocking on the door asking for her. So it is not a case where the Accused would have been totally ignorant of what might have triggered the visit. It is then only a question of whether he was aware of the magnitude or the severity of the predicate offence.

37     In this case, there were other circumstances which would have alerted him to the gravity of the offences. In the video footage, it is noted that there was an exchange where the Accused invited the officers to return the next morning but IO Faizal’s response was, “_Well, I am here at this hour for a reason_”. IO Faizal then proceeds to repeatedly ask the Accused to cooperate. The Accused could also see that there was a large group of officers standing around - at least five personnel, and they had come at least twice to ask about his wife. Given these circumstances, the Accused should not be able to assert that he was unaware that there was something serious that the Police were investigating. It is not a big leap to imagine that it had something to do with her driving after having spent some time with her friends at the club drinking and playing golf. Despite all this, the Accused repeatedly lied to the officers.

38     The Prosecution also pointed out that while it has been raised that the Accused’s children were sick and that the Accused was tired and irritated, and had in the spur of the moment, responded in anger, the fact is that the Accused maintained this falsehood days after as well. In his police statement recorded two days later, the Accused maintained his false statements and had not recanted. He had had time to think about what had happened and he chose to maintain his version.

## Defence’s Rejoinder

39     The Defence countered the Prosecution’s assertions by arguing that it is not appropriate to conclude that knowing about the accident translates to knowing that investigation into drink driving was the ensuing consequence. There is a world of difference between careless driving involving knocking into something and drink driving with drink driving being an arrestable offence. Further, it was also within the Accused’s knowledge, as stated in the Statement of Facts, that whenever his wife was not confident of driving, she would take a taxi or call him to drive her home. It is also significant that in the earlier visit by IO Faizal, the Accused had invited him to come in. This demonstrates that the Accused was not looking to conceal any offence or avoid an investigation. He was tired and irate when they kept coming back and so he had refused them entry. The Defence repeated that there was no nexus between the false information provided and the harm caused.

## Decision on sentence

40     This is a case where the Accused was charged with giving false information to a police officer, thereby causing the police officer to omit to carry out investigations into the predicate offence of drink driving, which the officer would not have done if the true state of facts had been known to him. The Accused pleaded guilty to the section 182 offence. I found that the elements of the charge had been made out in the Statement of Facts and convicted him on the charge. The offence is punishable with imprisonment for up to one year, or with a fine of up to $5,000 or with both. After hearing submissions from parties, I sentenced the Accused to one week’s imprisonment.

41     I now set out my reasons for rejecting the Defence’s plea for a sentence of a fine only and for imposing a custodial sentence.

### Sentencing Approach

42     The central question in this case is whether the custodial threshold is crossed based on the facts of this case.

43     The 3-Judge Panel of the High Court in _Koh Yong Chiah_ has provided sentencing guidance for the section 182 offence. The Court held that whether the custodial threshold is crossed should essentially be determined based on the degree of harm caused or likely to be caused by the section 182 offence (at \[50\]). This refers to both actual and potential harm (at \[51(c)\]). It was stated that if appreciable harm might be caused by the section 182 offence, the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term. The court qualified that 1) the harm must be causally connected to the provision of false information, and 2) the harm in question must be more than de minimis (at \[51(a)–(b)\]). The Court further stated that the duration that the falsehood was maintained would usually be a relevant factor to assess the potential harm caused by the offence. This determination of the appropriate starting point is the first step of the test.

44     The second step is to consider other relevant sentencing factors to take into account the level of culpability of the offender and to determine if the starting point should be departed from and what would be the appropriate quantum of fine or length of imprisonment. These relevant sentencing factors include:

> (a)     whether the offender knew or merely believed that the statement given was false;

> (b)     whether the offender intended or merely knew it to be likely that the harm would arise;

> (c)     whether the giving of false information was pre-meditated or planned, or whether it was simply spontaneous;

> (d)     whether active, deliberate or sophisticated steps were taken by the offender to bolster the deception and boost the chances of hoodwinking the public authorities;

> (e)     the motive of the offender in giving the false information (malicious, revenge, innocuous, or altruistic intention);

> (f)     whether the deception was perpetrated despite or in active defiance of a warning not to lie;

> (g)     the number of times the lie was actively said;

> (h)     the number of people instigated or involved in the deception, and the specific role played by the offender;

> (i)     whether the offender had exploited or exerted pressure on others in the commission of the offence; and

> (j)     whether the offence is committed due to threat or pressure or fear of another person, which is a mitigating factor.

45     The Court set out further factors which are relevant in assessing the level of harm caused by the offence:

> (a)     whether the false statement was recanted, and if so, after how long;

> (b)     the gravity of the predicate offence which the offender seeks to avoid or help another avoid;

> (c)     the investigative resources unnecessarily expended;

> (d)     the extent to which the innocent victims were affected, how many victims were affected, and the seriousness of the falsely-alleged crime; and

> (e)     whether the offender obtained a financial advantage from the commission of the offence.

### Analysing the main harm and culpability factors in the present case

#### Assessment of whether appreciable harm had been caused

46     It was undisputed that the Accused’s wife had consumed alcohol at the Sentosa Golf Club before driving home. On the way back, she was involved in a minor collision with a lighting fixture. This collision came to the attention of the Sentosa Ranger who must have then alerted the Police. The Police arrived at the Accused’s home to look for his wife. The Accused falsely informed the enforcement officers that his wife was not at home. Consequently, no breathalyser test was administered on the Accused’s wife until the following morning.

47     The Prosecution submitted, and I agree with the Prosecution, that the main appreciable harm caused, is the willful perversion of the course of justice. The Accused’s falsehoods had prevented IO Faizal from carrying out full investigations in a timely manner. He had been prevented from administering the breathalyser test within hours of the collision in order to obtain a reliable or accurate reading of the Accused’s wife’s breath or blood alcohol levels. The Accused had thus frustrated the investigative and evidence-gathering process and shielded his wife from possible prosecution for a drink driving offence. Drink driving has been characterised by the High Court as a serious offence.

48     The Defence strenuously argued that the harm caused was not causally connected to the false information provided by the Accused. IO Faizal did not inform the Accused that he was investigating the Accused’s wife for drink driving or that he wanted to perform a breathalyser test on her. The Accused was not aware that the Police were contemplating the more serious offence of drink driving. He thought that they were simply looking into a case of careless driving. Without such knowledge, it was argued that the delay in administering the breathalyser test cannot be attributed to the Accused. The Accused did not deliberately seek to mislead the police officer, unlike the offender in the case of _Yang Suan Piau Steven_.

49     It appears that the Defence has conflated two separate issues. The first issue relates to the actual harm resulting from the false information provided by the Accused. This would be the IO’s inability to conduct full and timely investigations. This was a direct outcome of the Accused’s falsehoods. It may or may not have been intended by the Accused, but it is causally connected to the provision of the false information. The second issue has to do with the Accused’s culpability in terms of what had motivated the Accused to furnish the false information or what was intended by the Accused when he made the false statements. The two issues are distinct and separate. In other words, even if the type of harm was not intended by the Accused, the fact that it was occasioned by the Accused’s actions or false statements is sufficient to establish that the harm caused was causally connected to the provision of the false statements.

50     It is irrelevant that the Accused was unaware of the seriousness of the predicate offence. The fact is, the Accused had provided false information to IO Faizal and as a result, IO Faizal was prevented from conducting proper investigations. Despite the investigative resources expended that night, when about five officers repeatedly visited the Accused’s unit, they were prevented from uncovering the truth due to the false information given. This was the actual and appreciable harm caused by the Accused’s falsehoods which was by no means de minimis. There was also the potential harm of a possible drink driver escaping detection and continuing to drive on the roads, thus jeopardising the safety of other road users. Given these facts, I was satisfied that appreciable harm was caused and the starting point should be a custodial sentence.

#### Consideration of other relevant sentencing factors

51     I turn now to assess the level of _culpability_ involved.

52     The Defence submitted that the Accused was tired and irritable when IO Faizal and the other personnel arrived at his home. The false information was provided without an intention to deceive IO Faizal. The Accused had in fact invited IO Faizal to enter the unit to look for his wife. It was further asserted that as an EU citizen, the Accused valued his privacy, and was upset by the repeated intrusions into his home at a late hour and seemingly without good reason. IO Faizal made repeated visits to his home - at least five times – but each time he failed to disclose what offence he was investigating. The Accused was not told that his wife was being investigated for drink driving, or that the police officers wanted to carry out a breathalyser test on her. It was also submitted that even if it is thought that the Accused had committed the offence to protect his wife, he had not sought any personal gain from it.

53     I had some difficulty with these arguments as there were several anomalies here.

54     On the point that the Accused was unaware that IO Faizal was investigating his wife for drink driving, I had to agree with the Prosecution that the Accused cannot plead that he was completely clueless as to why IO Faizal and the other personnel had arrived at his doorstep at that late hour. Based on the information which he had received prior to their arrival – that his wife had drinks at the club, after which she drove the car, and then collided into a lamppost, which collision was noted by the Sentosa ranger, who had identified his wife as the driver – it would not have been too difficult for the Accused to guess that IO Faizal’s request to see his wife was related to the collision she was involved in. He may even have had suspicions that her drink drinking was an issue. As pointed out by the Prosecution, IO Faizal had alluded to the seriousness of his visit when he stated, “Well, I am here at this hour for a reason”. Even if these thoughts or suspicions had not occurred to the Accused during IO Faizal’s first visit, they must have occurred to him by the time IO Faizal came calling for the fifth time. It is simply incredible that the Accused remained clueless throughout. Yet, each time the officers visited him that night, the Accused persisted in falsely informing them that his wife was not at home.

55     It was argued by the Defence that the Accused was tired and irate, and this had led him to provide the false information to IO Faizal. Presumably, the argument here is that the Accused was not in the correct frame of mind and was ‘not thinking right’ because he was tired and sleepy. As pointed out above, this argument may hold if there was only one visit, but it is hard to accept as a credible one when there were numerous repeat visits by IO Faizal. Notably, the Accused maintained his lies even when the police recorded a statement from him two days later. It was not argued that he was tired or irate then. The fact is, the Accused had several opportunities to recant his false statements, but he chose not to. This heightens his culpability.

56     It also bears noting that the Defence’s arguments regarding the Accused’s concerns about the intrusion into his privacy, is at odds with the Accused’s invitation to IO Faizal to enter his unit to check if his wife was there. At that point, IO Faizal had not asked to inspect the unit. He merely wished to speak with the Accused’s wife. Yet the Accused had invited him to enter the unit. The Accused’s behaviour is puzzling to say the least. I could only conclude that perhaps, he was not as concerned with the incursions into his privacy as submitted.

57     Overall, there was little to detract from the fact that the Accused had persistently lied to IO Faizal about his wife’s whereabouts. Presumably, his intent was to shield her from a breathalyser test and possible prosecution for a drink driving offence. In these circumstances, I disagreed with the Defence that this case fell within the ‘exceptions to the norm’. I saw no reason to depart from the presumptive custodial sentence.

### Sentencing precedents

58     Parties were agreed that the sentencing approach in _Koh Yong Chiah_ was the applicable test in the present case. This approach was adopted and applied in _Ng Jia Jie_, where similar to the present case, the predicate offence was one of drink driving. The offender had provided false information to shield his friend from investigations into a possible drink driving offence. The offender had maintained his false statement for two days before recanting. He was a first offender who had pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 12 days’ imprisonment.

59     In _Yeo Fang Yi_, the predicate offence was also drink driving. The offender had lied that she was the driver of the vehicle and underwent a breathalyser test. The actual culprit was not identified until the offender recanted her false statements three years later. The offender pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions. She was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

60     The Defence placed significant reliance on _Yang Suan Piau Steven_ where the offender had used a remote control device to tamper with the fuel gauge readings in his car. He gave a false statement to the Customs officer that the fuel tank was ¾ full. He maintained the falsehood on at least three occasions until the Customs officer physically checked the car and found the remote control device. He pleaded guilty and the Court sentenced him to two weeks’ imprisonment. On appeal, the sentence of imprisonment was substituted with a fine of $4,000.

61     The Defence also cited _PP v Alvin Chan Siw Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 411</span> (“_Alvin Chan Siw Hong_”) where the offender had given a false report to the police stating that his motorcycle was stolen in Singapore when in fact it was stolen in Malaysia. The offender was found out and charged in Court. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine of $4,000. The Prosecution filed an appeal against the sentence but later withdrew its appeal.

62     A closer study of _Yang Suan Piau Steven_ and _Alvin Chan Siw Hong_ show that these cases are actually of little assistance to the Defence.

63     In _Yang Suan Piau Steven_, Chan Sek Keong CJ at \[42\] was quick to draw the distinction between cases where the predicate offence is a less serious one with little wastage of investigative resources, and one where the predicate offence may involve significant harm to people or damage to property or may involve serious public policy considerations. From the Legislature’s perspective, a breach of the ¾ tank rule under the Customs Act fell under former category of less serious offences while road traffic offences such as speeding and driving under the influence of drink or drugs would fall under the latter category of more serious offences. The public policy considerations for the two types of offences are not the same. CJ Chan held that for the less serious category of offences a fine would be sufficient to deter would-be offenders (at \[50\]).

64     The sentence imposed in _Alvin Chan Siw Hong_ was discussed in the judgment in _Koh Yong Chiah._ Chao Hick Tin JA who delivered the judgment on behalf of the 3-Judge Panel stated at \[31\] that the sentence imposed in _Alvin Chan Siw Hong_ was too lenient. The starting point should have been a custodial sentence given that the attempted insurance fraud had the potential to cause significant financial losses to the insurer (\[55\]).

65     Based on the sentencing precedents cited by parties, I concluded that the sentencing norm for the present factual matrix is a custodial sentence of between one to two weeks’ imprisonment.

### Calibrating the appropriate sentence

66     The Accused pleaded guilty to the charge and had no prior convictions. I accepted the Defence’s submission, which was not refuted by the Prosecution, that the Accused had entered his plea to an amended charge at the earliest opportunity. He faced a single charge and there were no further charges taken into consideration for sentencing. It was repeatedly asserted by the Defence that the Accused was tired, irritable and possibly even sleepy, when IO Faizal questioned him at his home. I did not find any particular mitigatory value in this argument. It does not reduce or limit the Accused’s culpability for furnishing patently false information to the police. I accept that the Accused was not motivated by personal gain to commit this offence. It is also unlikely that the Accused would reoffend. In the circumstances, I found that a short custodial sentence would be appropriate. The Accused was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

## Conclusion

67     The degree of harm caused by the Accused’s false statements coupled with his persistence in maintaining the falsehood, firmly tipped this offence over the custodial threshold. There were no other compelling aggravating factors to merit a lengthy term of imprisonment. A term of one week’s imprisonment is in my view, adequate to meet the sentencing objectives in this case. It is not manifestly excessive.

68     The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed has filed this appeal. The execution of the sentence has been stayed pending the appeal. The Accused is presently released on bail.
