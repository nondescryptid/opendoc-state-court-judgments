\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 009/2019/01.\]

14 January 2020

### District Judge Jasbendar Kaur:

The Accused in this case is Toh Teng Seng, a 67-year old Singaporean. He was charged under section 65B(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276) for using a mobile communication device while the car that he was driving was in motion on the road. He claimed trial to the charge. The trial was heard over three days and at the end of the trial, I convicted him. After hearing the sentencing submissions by the Prosecution and the Accused’s mitigation, I ordered the Accused to pay a fine of $800, in default 4 days’ imprisonment and in addition, I ordered that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes for a period of six months. These grounds are issued as the Accused filed an appeal against his conviction.

## Main Facts

2       On 10 May 2018 at about 5.13 pm, patrol officers Sergeant Nurul Suhaillah Bte Yacob (PW 1), a Traffic Police Officer and Corporal Syed Ahmad Bin Omar Alsagoff (PW2), an AETOS officer were patrolling along Sims Avenue towards Sims Avenue East before Geylang Lorong 31 in an unmarked police patrol car when they spotted the Accused’s vehicle SLT4043C travelling at slow speed in the centre lane with the vehicle’s brake lights coming on and off. Observing this, PW 1 first asked her partner to check if there were vehicles in front of the Accused’s vehicle and when he responded in the negative, she decided to follow the Accused’s car.

3       While driving alongside his car on the passenger’s side, both patrol officers saw the Accused holding a mobile phone in his left hand and “typing” with his thumb. PW 2 then used a camcorder to video the Accused driving and using his mobile phone. This video recording was tendered in Court and it was admitted as Exhibit P1. After about 10 seconds of observation, the patrol officers decided to stop the Accused. PW 1 placed the blinker on top of the patrol car and switched on the siren to catch the Accused’s attention to signal him to pull over to the side. The Accused complied and he parked his car at the side of the road, with the police patrol car stopping behind it.

4       PW 2 alighted first and approached the Accused’s vehicle where he saw the Accused attempting to insert an earpiece into his mobile phone as he alighted from his car. Thereafter, both PW 2 and the Accused moved to the front of the police patrol car where PW 1 was standing. There, PW 1 instructed the Accused to unlock the screen of his black coloured iPhone Plus for her to examine the mobile phone. When she took possession of the phone and examined it, she noticed a WhatsApp message received at 1709 hours displayed on the screen. PW 1 then proceeded to question the Accused on whether he had been using his mobile phone while he was driving. According to the Prosecution’s case, the Accused denied using his mobile phone while driving to make phone calls but admitted that he had used the mobile phone “because of ---some alarm---alarm” and/or that he had attempted to insert his earpiece into the mobile phone. This exchange was captured by PW2’s body-worn camera, which recording was tendered in court and admitted as Exhibit P4. The Accused’s mobile phone, including the SIM card, was subsequently seized and sealed in a polymer bag (Exhibits P5, P6 and P7) and this was done after the Accused was allowed to transfer some work related content to his friend’s mobile phone from his mobile phone.

5       During this incident, the weather was fine, traffic flow was moderate and visibility was clear.

6       Many of the abovementioned facts were not disputed by the Defence. The Accused confirmed that the vehicle in question belongs to him and that he was driving along Sims Avenue East when he was stopped. It was also not in dispute that the mobile phone seized by the patrol officers belonged to the Accused and that it was in his possession when he was driving. The Accused, however, denied holding and using the mobile phone when he was driving along Sims Avenue East and he denied informing the patrol officers that he had used the mobile phone or that he had tried to insert his earpiece when he was driving. He challenged the observations of the patrol officers by claiming that they could not have seen him using the mobile phone when they were driving alongside and looking into his vehicle as (i) he was not holding the mobile phone in his left hand and (ii) the officers would not have been able to see his left hand holding the mobile phone as their line of sight would have been hindered since he was driving a much taller vehicle.

7       It was also part of his case that the officers may have stopped him purely based “on their speculation and not what they have saw”. The Accused suggested that the officers might have decided to check on him simply because he was driving a “bit slowly” and not because they had seen him using his mobile phone. He further suggested that PW 1 might have assumed that he had been using his mobile phone after she learnt that he had been stopped before for the same wrongdoing when she was questioning him.

8       Based on the defence put forth by the Accused and the fact that the video recording Exhibit P1 did not show the Accused using his phone, I had to consider two main issues in this case:

> (i)     Whether the patrol officers had in fact seen the Accused holding and using his mobile phone when they were driving alongside his vehicle; and

> (ii)     Whether the Accused had admitted to the patrol officers that he was checking his mobile phone and/or inserting his earpiece when he was questioned at the scene.

#### Issue 1:   Did the patrol officers see the Accused holding and using his mobile phone when they were driving alongside his vehicle?

9       The Defence’s case was that the patrol officers could not have seen him using his mobile phone as he was not holding it in his hand when they were observing him and more importantly, their evidence should not be believed as it would have been physically impossible for the patrol officers to have observed this when they were driving alongside him. They highlighted the fact that both patrol officers were not very tall (about 163 cm tall) and that they were travelling in a police patrol car that was of lower height than the Accused’s vehicle. Evidence was produced to show that the Accused’s vehicle was a Toyota Estima Aeras Premium 2.4 CVT, an MPV that stood at 1.73 m and the police unmarked car was a Toyota Altis that stood at 1.46 m \[Exhibit D2\]. It was their case that the height difference would have hindered the officer’s line of sight and at best, they would only have been able to see his head and shoulders. In other words, they could not have seen the Accused holding his mobile phone in his left hand closer to his waist area as described by them.

10     To support his claim, the Accused conducted an enactment on 1 May 2019 using his car and a vehicle that was similar in make and size to the police patrol car. Based on what was observed during the enactment, the Accused argued that the officers in the patrol car could not have seen his waist area and that this would only have been possible if they had raised their heads above the top the patrol car - “Unless he---he---he extended his head out of the ---the car window.” To demonstrate this, he referred to the photographs that were taken during the enactment and stated that the officers’ eye level had to be at the same position as the mobile phone shown in photograph No. 7 of Exhibit D3 in order for the patrol officers to see what was shown in photograph No. 8 of Exhibit D3. The Accused stated that since the patrol officers did not extend their heads out of the patrol car, photographs Nos. 1 to 6 taken during the enactment showed that they would only have been able to see his head and shoulders when they were travelling alongside his vehicle and this cast a doubt on their evidence:

> Q:    So besides the video, would ---would it be possible for the PW 1 or PW 2 to see you with their own eyes?

> A:    Impo---posi---impossible. If you don’t believe, you ---you all can---can conduct a test yourself to---the police officer, yes, can---can contact a---a test themselves.”[^1]

11     The Defence also argued that the Prosecution failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that the patrol officers had seen him using his mobile phone, as their video recording Exhibit P1 did not support their case. First, the recording did not show that his vehicle was travelling slower than other vehicles and nor did it show that his brake signal lights were coming on and off. Second, the video recording done with the camcorder confirmed his claim that their line of sight was limited as it did not show him holding and using his mobile phone.

12      _Finding_: The fact that the Accused’s vehicle was a taller car was not in dispute and I accepted the Defence’s position that it would have been challenging for the patrol officers to observe the Accused when they were driving alongside him. However, having assessed the evidence, I found no reason to doubt the credibility of the evidence of the patrol officers. My findings were based on the following reasons.

13     First, the patrol officers had decided to check on the Accused not on a hunch or their omination. They did so after they had observed him travelling slowly in the centre lane and “braking a very weirdly manner” when there were no vehicles in front[^2]. PW 1 stated that she had observed that the brake lights of the Accused’s vehicle “keeps braking and then release, braking and release. So something was wrong somewhere. That’s why I overtake him.”[^3] While it is true that the video recording did not specifically show the brake lights coming on and off, I did not think that this fact materially affected the credibility of the patrol officers’ evidence, especially when the recording Exhibit P1 confirmed other material aspects of their evidence. The recording showed that there were no vehicles travelling ahead of the Accused’s car and that the Accused’s slow speed caused some vehicles to overtake him on his left. What is important is that the recording showed that the patrol officers had some basis to pursue and check on the Accused and that they had acted without any bias.

14     Second, the photographs taken and videos made during the Defence’s enactment confirmed the patrol officers’ evidence on what they had observed. Both officers stated that they were able to see the Accused holding a mobile phone in his left hand closer to the bottom of the steering wheel (near his waist area) and that he was using his thumb to “type”. Even though the video recording Exhibit P1 only showed the Accused’s head and shoulders, the photographs and videos taken by the Defence during the enactment showed that it would have been possible for the patrol officers to have seen more than what was captured in photograph No. 4 of Exhibit D3 when they were driving alongside the Accused vehicle. Photographs Nos. 2.1 and 2.2, which were tendered after 10 May 2019 \[Exhibit D4A\] showed that it would have been possible for the patrol officers to see most of the steering wheel and most of the Accused’s torso since these photographs were taken with the handphone camera that was positioned at the driver’s eye level. These two photographs are produced below:

![]([2020] SGDC 0011_Image/[2020] SGDC 0011_image1.png)

15     Basically, these photographs belied the Accused’s claim that it would have been _impossible_ for the patrol officers to have seen him holding his mobile phone closer to his waist area. In any event, his counsel had agreed during Closing Submissions that these photographs do show that the patrol officers “could have” seen the lower end of the steering wheel[^4]. As photograph 2.2 of Exhibit D4 represented what could have been seen by the driver of the police patrol car (i.e. the position shown in the first four photographs in Exhibit D3), I was compelled to accept the evidence of the patrol officers on what they had observed and infer that the video recording captured by PW 2 (Exhibit P1) was not what PW 1 and PW 2 actually saw with their own eyes when driving alongside the Accused’s car.

16     Third, I also found that the patrol officers’ evidence was supported by the information recorded in the patrol car’s log sheet by PW 1 (Exhibit P3). Entry number 20 stated that PW 1 spotted the Accused holding a mobile phone in his left hand and “typing” and that she trailed the Accused’s car for 10 seconds before signalling him to stop. I gave weight to this evidence as it was a contemporaneous record filed by PW 1.

17     Fourth, both patrol officers gave credible evidence in court on how they managed to observe the Accused for about 10 seconds when they were driving alongside his car. PW1 testified that she was able to see the Accused holding and using his mobile phone as she “actually stood up slightly a little but not exactly standing up but actually, made an effort to look---at it.”[^5] She also stated that she saw him “typing” with his fingers – “I could see, like, his fingers was moving actually… and he keep on taking glances to his phone, look in front.”[^6] When queried further, PW 1 explained that the act of “typing” was done with his thumb and that she only decided to signal him to stop when she was certain that the Accused was using his mobile phone while he was driving - “Because definitely I saw him using the phone on his left hand typing something.”[^7] Her evidence was supported by PW2 who stated that when he was alerted by PW1, he had stretched upwards (“stood up”) in his seat to take a look and he had seen the Accused holding his mobile phone in his left hand and he saw his thumb moving.

18     When accessing their evidence, I did take into account the fact that patrol officers are trained to observe and check on moving vehicles on the road when conducting patrols. PW 1 mentioned this fact when she stated the following:

> Q:    So as you were driving you were observing?

> A:    Yes, co---correct. I could---

> Q:    Yes.

> A:    see it from---

> Q:    Yes.

> A:    side, I look in front. Yah.

> …

> Q:    Sergeant Nurul, were you trained to do this?

> A:    Yes, Sir.

> Q:    Driving while observing?

> A:    Yes, Sir. This is how we catch offences on the road as a daily basis.”[^8]

19     Fifth, the video recording captured by PW2 on the camcorder, which did not show the Accused using his phone did not affect the credibility of PW 2’s evidence as this recording may not represent his line of sight when he was observing the Accused. PW 2 explained that before he started recording, he had “stood up” on his seat (without lifting his body from the car seat) to glance at the Accused and when he did this, he had observed him holding his mobile phone and “typing” with his thumb. This meant that it was only by stretching upwards that he was able to see the Accused holding and using his mobile phone and he would not have been able to capture the Accused holding and using his mobile phone when using the camcorder if he had not done the same.

20     Sixth, the fact that PW 2 decided to immediately use the camcorder to record the Accused’s offending behaviour strongly suggested that he must have seen the Accused committing an offence as otherwise he would not have been compelled to make a recording. In addition, his observation that the Accused was “Looking up and looking down” was confirmed by the video recording which showed that the Accused was distracted when he was driving. What is important is that the Accused admitted that he was distracted, albeit he stated that this was because he was searching for a piece of paper that he had misplaced that detailed his shopping list - “So while I was driving, I kept looking for the ---the piece of paper.”[^9] As the Accused’s state of distraction of just looking up and down did not suggest that he was looking for a piece of paper that he had misplaced, I accepted the evidence of PW 1 who stated that the distraction that they had observed was due to him using his mobile phone:

> “So I could see his fingers was moving, and then he keep on taking glances to his phone, look in front. That is why I believe that is why he started brake and release the brake and continue.”[^10]

21     For the reasons stated above, I found that the patrol officers, PW 1 and PW 2, had indeed seen the Accused holding and using his phone when his car was in motion.

#### Issue 2 :   Did the Accused admit to the patrol officers that he was checking his mobile phone because he heard the mobile phone alarm and/or inserting his earpiece when he was driving his car?

22     It was part of the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had admitted to using his mobile phone when he was queried at the scene as he had shared with them that “Because I see alarm so I listen” and/or that he was trying to insert his earpiece into the phone. The Accused denied making any admissions to the patrol officers when he was questioned by them. It was his case that he had much difficulty in understanding the officers when they were questioning him in English and that he could not remember the exchange as described by the officers. What he could recall was that when he was questioned, he had informed the officers that “I did not use the phone” and that he did not make any phone calls. He stated that he may have mentioned the words “alarm, alarm” to the officers but this was done when he was transferring content to his friend’s phone and when PW 1 kept asking him not to press the phone indiscriminately.

23      _Finding_: The statement by the Accused that he was checking his mobile phone because he had heard the mobile phone alarm was important because if he had indeed done this while his vehicle was in motion, the Accused would have admitted to using his mobile phone. This is because section 65B(3) provides that the phrase “use” in relation to mobile communication device “means to hold it in at least one hand while operating any of its functions.” Having assessed the evidence, I found that the video recording Exhibit P4 did not support the Defence’s version of the facts.

24     Evidence was adduced to show that PW 2 had switched on his body-worn camera when he had asked the Accused to alight from his car and move to the front of the patrol car. Both patrol officers stated that the Accused mentioned that he was checking the mobile phone because of “alarm, alarm” when he was asked if he was using his phone. PW 2 described this exchange during his cross-examination as follows:

> Q:    Okay. During your questioning of my client, did he admit that he used his phone?

> A:    Yes, he said ---yah, he was checking, uh, alarm. Alarm. That is what ---“[^11]

25     The Accused’s version was quite different. He stated that when he had alighted from his vehicle, he brought along his mobile phone and he was trying to insert his earpiece that had fallen out. When the patrol officer approached him and saw this, he “Asked me not to move.” When the Accused explained that he was merely trying to insert the earpiece that had fallen out, the police officer “told me that I was using the phone while I was driving the car. I told him that I did not.” As he had not done anything with the mobile phone when he was driving, “…So, I told the police, says all along I have never used the ---the---the phone.”[^12] Basically, the Accused denied making any admissions to the patrol officers.

26     However, the Accused’s version was contradicted by the recording captured by the body-worn camera Exhibit P4. The recording showed that when the Accused was asked why he was using his phone, he had replied “Because of some alarm---alarm” and “Because I see alarm so I listen---”:

>   
| 

PW 1 Q:

 | 

Do you know why I stopped you?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Because I want to hear handphone.

 |
| 

PW 1 Q:

 | 

What were you using with your phone?

 |
|

Because of ---some alarm---alarm.

 |
| 

PW1 Q:

Are you sure alarm only?

 |
| 

A:

Yah, yah, you can see---you can see.

 |

PW1 Q:

 | 

Besides alarm, what---what---what else were you doing?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Because I see alarm so I listen ---

 |
| 

PW1 Q:

 | 

Because earlier on I see you using your phone and that is why I stopped you

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I never ---I never call one. ---

 |
| 

PW1Q:

 | 

You know my vehicle was behind you all the way, you speed limit was extremely slow, after a little while I decided to stay on your left and I saw your vehicle. You were using your phone. Let me explain first. Observe for more than 10 seconds ok and then I stopped you.

 |

  
  

27     During his cross-examination when he was confronted with the video recording Exhibit P4, the Accused suggested that his responses as captured in the video were not reliable, as he may not have understood the questions that were posed to him in English. He also said that he might have uttered the words “alarm, alarm” not in response to the questions that were posed to him. He explained that he might have uttered these words when PW 1 accused him of pressing the phone indiscriminately during the content transfer.

28     I did not accept the Accused’s evidence on this as his responses captured in the video recording Exhibit P4 clearly showed that he was able to understand simple English and that he understood the simple questions that were posed to him \[as transcribed in paragraph 26 above\]. Further, I was compelled to reject his explanation on why he might have mentioned the words “alarm, alarm” as his explanation simply did not make sense. Based on this, it was my finding that the Accused had admitted that he was checking his mobile phone as he had heard the alarm when the patrol officers questioned him, which meant that he had admitted to using the phone while he was driving to the patrol officers.

## Conclusion

29     Although the video recording Exhibit P1 did not show the Accused using his mobile phone, I found that there was ample credible evidence that showed that the Accused was distracted when he was driving his motor vehicle on 10 May 2018 at about 5.13 pm along Sims Avenue towards Sims Avenue East before Geylang Lorong 31 and this was because he was using his mobile phone. Apart from the fact that the two patrol officers had observed him for about 10 seconds holding his mobile phone in his left hand and “typing” with his thumb, he had also admitted to the patrol officers that he had used his mobile phone when he stated that he was checking his mobile phone after hearing the alarm. As such, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt on the charge and I, accordingly, found the Accused guilty and I convicted him on TP 186089092011.

## Sentence

30     Based on the fact that the Accused was a first offender for this offence, the Prosecution sought a fine of $800 and a disqualification order for all classes for six months. As part of the Accused’s mitigation, his counsel submitted that a nominal fine of $600 and a 4-month disqualification would suffice as he was not driving in a reckless or dangerous manner and that he had used the phone for a short period of time.

31     Having heard the submissions and having considered the facts, I sentenced the Accused to pay a fine of $800 (in default, 4 days’ imprisonment) and in addition, I imposed a disqualification order for all classes for 6 months \[**_Tan Kian Tiong v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 131</span>\]. No appeal has been filed in respect of the sentence imposed.

32     The Accused paid the fine on 10 June 2019. On the application of the Defence, a stay was granted on the disqualification order on 12 July 2019 pending appeal.
