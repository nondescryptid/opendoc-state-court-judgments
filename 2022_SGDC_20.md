\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9013/2022/01.\]

28 January 2022

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       The accused, a 37-year-old woman, pleaded guilty to five charges, all of which arose from her acts of seeking to deceive the Ministry of Social and Family Development (the “MSF”) into making to her payments to which she was not entitled under various COVID-19-related financial support schemes. These five charges consisted of the following:

> (a)     two charges for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”), which I shall refer to as the “cheating charges” (each of them being a “cheating charge”);

> (b)     two charges for attempting within the meaning of s 511 of the Penal Code to commit the offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code, which I shall refer to as the “attempted cheating charges” (each of them being an “attempted cheating charge”); and

> (c)     one charge for committing forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code, which I shall refer to as the “forgery charge”.

2       Having convicted the accused on these five charges I imposed sentences ranging from two to four months’ imprisonment per charge, as follows:

> (a)     three months’ imprisonment for one cheating charge, which involved the sum of $500;

> (b)     four months’ imprisonment for the other cheating charge, which involved the sum of $2,400;

> (c)     three months’ imprisonment per attempted cheating charge, each of which involved the sum of $2,400; and

> (d)     two months’ imprisonment for the forgery charge, which involved the sum of $1,000.

3       In agreement with the prosecution I ordered that the sentences for four charges – namely the cheating charges, the forgery charge and one attempted cheating charge – run consecutively so that the global sentence was 12 months’ imprisonment. The accused has lodged an appeal against sentence and so I set out now in writing my reasons for imposing these sentences. Pending the appeal I have stayed execution of the sentence and granted bail fixed at $10,000 on non-monetary terms in order that the accused may have interim liberty so long as bail is furnished. But it appears that she remains incarcerated as at the date of these grounds of decision because bail has not been furnished.

## Facts

4       The five charges on which the accused was convicted stemmed from five applications that she submitted between April and November 2020 under three different financial support schemes administered by the MSF. All three schemes were designed to address the economic and social impact of COVID-19. I set out below a brief description of these schemes according to the statement of facts.

> (a)     The Temporary Relief Fund (“TRF”) was open from 1 to 30 April 2020 to applicants who had been retrenched or suffered substantial loss of personal income due to COVID-19 after 23 January 2020 and who met other eligibility criteria. Successful applicants would receive a one-off pay-out of $500 regardless of the actual amount of income they had lost by reason of COVID-19.

> (b)     The COVID-19 Support Grant (“CSG”) was open from 4 May to 30 December 2020 to a few categories of applicants who had been affected by the economic impact of COVID-19. One such category consisted of applicants who by reason of the COVID-19 pandemic had found themselves after 23 January 2020 in involuntary unemployment due to retrenchment or contract termination, and who met other eligibility criteria. Successful applicants within this category would receive three consecutive monthly payments based on their last-drawn monthly income, up to a maximum of $800 a month, even if they subsequently obtained a job within that three-month period.

> (c)     The Courage Fund (“CF”) was open from 6 April 2020 to 31 December 2021 to a few categories of applicants from lower-income households that had been affected by COVID-19. One such category consisted of applicants from households in which at least one member of the household had contracted COVID-19, and which met other eligibility criteria. Successful applicants would receive a one-time lump-sum cash payment the amount of which depended on the household’s per-capita income, up to a maximum of $1,000.

### The cheating charges

5       The cheating charges arose in the following way. The accused submitted an application under the TRF on 30 April 2020 and an application under the CSG on 5 May 2020. In both these applications she declared that she had lost her job at Iyad Perdaus Child Development Centre (“Iyad”) due to COVID-19. This declaration was false, and she knew it to be so, because she had in fact lost her job at Iyad for reasons that had nothing to do with COVID-19. Iyad had employed her as a pre-school teacher on 2 January 2020 on condition that she serve a six-month probationary period. Her performance at work was assessed to be unsatisfactory, and in April 2020 she absented herself from work without prior notice on 14 days. As a result Iyad issued a letter to the accused on 30 April 2020 discontinuing her employment and informing her that her work performance during the probationary period had not met expectations. Iyad did not face any financial difficulties due to COVID-19 that necessitated the retrenchment of employees.

6       In support of both these applications the accused submitted forged letters. They were forged in the sense that she used software to modify the text of the letter that Iyad had in fact issued on 30 April 2020 while leaving intact Iyad’s letterhead and the signature on the letter. For the application under the TRF, she added words stating that Iyad had “decided to lay-off teachers” due to COVID-19 and that she was “one of the affected ones”. For the application under the CSG, she added words stating that Iyad “must eliminate approximately 3 positions” due to COVID-19 and that her “position is one that will be eliminated”.

7       Both these applications were successful. Consequently MSF paid the accused $500 pursuant to the TRF application and $2,400 pursuant to the CSG application. At the time of the hearing before me the accused had not made any restitution. In this way the accused by deceiving the MSF dishonestly induced the MSF into delivering money to her and thereby committed offences under s 420 of the Penal Code. The TRF application on 30 April 2020 gave rise to one cheating charge and the CSG application on 5 May 2020 gave rise to the other.

### The attempted cheating charges

8       The attempted cheating charges arose in the following way. In October 2020 the accused submitted two applications under the CSG, one on 1 October and another on 4 October. In both these applications she declared that she had lost her job at the Singapore Indian Development Association (“SINDA”) due to COVID-19. This declaration was false, and she knew it to be so, because she had in fact never shown up for work at SINDA even though SINDA had on 29 July 2020 offered her a contract of employment as a tutor for the period from 29 July to 31 December 2020. The true characterisation of events was that she had in effect not accepted SINDA’s offer of employment at all. This was reflected in an e-mail that SINDA sent on 20 October 2020 informing her that her contract of employment would be treated as null and void by reason of her failure to render her services.

9       In support of both these applications under the CSG in October 2020 the accused submitted forged letters. They were forged in the sense that she used software to modify the text of the letter that SINDA had in fact sent to her to offer her a contract of employment while leaving intact SINDA’s letterhead and the signature on the letter. For the application submitted on 1 October 2020 she submitted two forged letters: one had words added stating that her “last day is on 03/10/2020” and the other had words added stating that she had “contracted Corona Covid 19” while “teaching a class” at SINDA. For the application submitted on 4 October 2020 she submitted a forged letter that had words added stating that she had “contracted Corona Covid 19 on the frontline” and that her “last day of employment will be on 3 October 2020”.

10     In both these applications the accused stated that “Ravin” was her point of contact at SINDA but she gave her own contact number as that of “Ravin”. This was so that should the MSF wish to contact someone at SINDA to verify the applications it would reach her instead of anyone at SINDA.

11     Both applications were not successful. The MSF took steps to verify her applications and eventually discovered that she had submitted forged letters, and so did not make any payment to her. Hence these applications gave rise to charges for attempted cheating rather than cheating: she intended to deceive the MSF and intended dishonestly to induce the MSF into delivering money to her, and took a substantial step towards carrying out that intention by submitting the applications under the CSG, thereby attempting within the meaning of s 511 of the Penal Code to commit an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code.

### The forgery charge

12     The forgery charge arose in the following way. On 12 November 2020 the accused submitted an application under the CF in which she sought a payment of $1,000 on the basis that she had contracted COVID-19. This was false because she had not contracted COVID-19 at any time, and she knew it to be so. In support of the application she submitted three forged electronic records in the following manner.

> (a)     She forged a mobile-phone text message purportedly sent by a hospital stating that she had contracted COVID-19. She did so by typing out a message to that effect on her mobile phone, using as templates examples of text messages sent by hospitals she had obtained on the Internet, and inserting her personal particulars into the message before sending it to herself.

> (b)     She forged a letter purportedly issued by Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“NTFGH”) stating that she had contracted COVID-19. She did so by using software to edit examples of letters sent by NTFGH that she had obtained on the Internet. She edited these example letters by inserting her personal particulars.

> (c)     She forged a 20-day medical certificate purportedly issued by NTFGH. She did so by using software to edit examples of medical certificates issued by NTFGH that she had obtained on the Internet. She edited these example medical certificates by inserting her personal particulars.

13     The forgery charge concerned only the mobile-phone text message. She made that false electronic record with intent to cause the MSF to part with money in the form of payment under the CF, and she did so intending to use the false text message for the purpose of cheating, that is, for the purpose of deceiving the MSF and thereby dishonestly inducing the MSF to deliver money to her. In this way she committed an offence under s 468 of the Penal Code.

### Charges taken into consideration

14     The facts described above also gave rise to eight charges that were taken into consideration. Seven of these charges were for committing forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code: leaving aside the forged mobile-phone text message that was the subject of the forgery charge, she had submitted seven forged electronic records in support of her applications under the TRF, CSG and CF – namely, two letters purportedly from Iyad, three letters purportedly from SINDA, and a letter and a medical certificate purportedly from NTFGH – and each forged document was the subject of a charge taken into consideration.

15     The remaining charge taken into consideration was for attempting within the meaning of s 511 of the Penal Code to commit the offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code. This arose from the application that the accused submitted under the CF on 12 November 2020.

## The sentencing ranges and general considerations

16     For the cheating charges and the forgery charge, ss 420 and 468 of the Penal Code provide in identical terms that the accused “shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine”. Thus for these charges imprisonment is mandatory and the maximum term of imprisonment per charge is 10 years. For the attempted cheating charges, pursuant to s 512(2)–(3) of the Penal Code the maximum term of imprisonment per charge is 10 years but imprisonment is not mandatory.

17     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that there was a need in this case to impose sentences that would achieve general deterrence. In seeking to deceive the MSF the accused had committed her offences against a public institution, and as the prosecution pointed out, citing _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (at \[24\]), it is well-established that offences against public institutions constitute a type of offence that warrants general deterrence. I also agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the need for general deterrence was further heightened by the fact that the accused had committed her offences within a context of crisis. The TRF, CSG and CF were made up of public funds set aside to assist Singapore citizens and permanent residents who had sustained real loss as a result of the crisis that was – and is – the COVID-19 pandemic. Every dollar wrongfully paid out of these financial support schemes to a person not entitled to receive payments from the schemes would mean one less dollar available to the MSF to disburse to people in genuine, perhaps even dire, financial need. In order to increase the likelihood that finite public funds meant to alleviate economic hardship would go only to the truly deserving I thought it appropriate to send the signal that dishonest attempts to divert those funds into ineligible hands would attract substantial terms of imprisonment.

## Precedents

18     I was much guided by five unpublished sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution involving offences under ss 420 or 468 of the Penal Code committed in connection with the TRF or the CSG. Although the unpublished nature of those precedents meant that I was not shown any written record of the court’s reasons for the sentences imposed in those cases, the prosecution provided me with descriptions of the facts in the precedents and I was able to see from those descriptions that there was a high degree of similarity between this case and those precedents in terms of their factual circumstances, in that they all involved deceit practised on the MSF in order to induce the MSF into making payments under the TRF or CSG. This meant that this case and those precedents had in common the especial need for general deterrence mentioned above. Hence I thought that it was appropriate to use the precedents to get a sense of the range of sentences that would be reasonable in such factual circumstances calling for general deterrence.

19     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the precedents suggested that where the offender pleaded guilty and had no relevant criminal history it would be reasonable to impose the following sentences:

> (a)     two to three months’ imprisonment for offences concerning the TRF where the MSF paid out $500 to the offender and the offender subsequently made restitution; and

> (b)     ten weeks’ to three months’ imprisonment for offences concerning the CSG where no payment was made by the MSF to the offender.

20     The first precedent was _PP v Goh Edward_ SC-904587-2020 (17 September 2020) (District Court). The offender in that case pleaded guilty to two charges of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code that arose from two applications that he submitted under the CSG that were each supported by a forged retrenchment letter. The offender submitted these applications not for himself but for his parents – one for each parent. The sentences imposed for the charges was one and two months’ imprisonment, with the sentences to run consecutively for a global sentence of three months’ imprisonment. There were a few significant mitigating factors in the offender’s favour: (a) he derived no personal financial benefit from the offences, (b) he genuinely believed that his parents had been retrenched due to COVID-19, and (c) his mother had in fact been retrenched due to COVID-19 but had not obtained a genuine retrenchment letter. Given these mitigating factors I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that this precedent involved “unique facts” that warranted a reduction in the sentences imposed.

21     The second precedent was _PP v Chow Jia Chuan_ SC-904583-2020 (19 November 2020) (District Court). The offender in that case pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code and two charges for attempting to do so. The charge under s 420 of the Penal Code arose from an application that he submitted under the TRF that contained a false declaration that he had lost at least 30% of his income due to COVID-19. The MSF was induced into paying $500 to him under the TRF but he later made full restitution. The sentence imposed for this charge was two months’ imprisonment. The two charges for attempting to commit an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code arose from two applications that he made under the CSG in which he falsely declared that he had lost his job due to COVID-19 (he had in fact voluntarily resigned) and that were each supported by a forged retrenchment letter. The MSF did not make any payment to him pursuant to these applications. For these charges three months’ imprisonment was imposed per charge. The global sentence was five months’ imprisonment.

22     The third precedent was _PP v Muhammad Faizal Bin Khaled_ SC-907130-2020 (22 March 2021) (District Court). The offender in that case pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code and one charge for attempting to do so. The charge under s 420 of the Penal Code arose from an application that he submitted under the TRF that contained a false declaration that he had lost at least 30% of his income due to COVID-19 (he had in fact voluntarily resigned before 23 January 2020) and that was supported by a forged retrenchment letter. The MSF was induced into paying $500 to him under the TRF but he later made full restitution. The sentence imposed for this charge was three months’ imprisonment. The other charge arose from an application that he submitted under the CSG that was supported by a forged payslip and a forged retrenchment letter. The MSF did not make any payment to him pursuant to this application. The sentence imposed for this charge was also three months’ imprisonment. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a global sentence of six months’ imprisonment.

23     The fourth precedent was _PP v Mohammad Fauzi Bin Jumari_ SC-900614-2021 (4 May 2021) (District Court). The offender in that case pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code. This arose from an application that he submitted under the TRF that contained a false declaration that he had lost at least 30% of his income due to COVID-19. When a MSF auditor subsequently conducted checks on his application he falsely stated that he used to receive $700 to $1,000 in sales commission but no longer did so due to COVID-19. The MSF was induced into paying $500 to him under the TRF but he later made full restitution after the commencement of investigations into the offence. The sentence imposed was two months’ imprisonment.

24     The fifth precedent was _PP v Ong Hong Beng, Benny_ SC-900615-2021 (1 July 2021) (District Court). The offender in that case pleaded guilty to one charge of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code. This arose from an application that he submitted under the CSG in which he furnished a forged retrenchment letter in support of a false declaration that he had been retrenched due to COVID-19 (he had in fact voluntarily resigned). The MSF did not make any payment to him pursuant to this application. The sentence imposed was ten weeks’ imprisonment.

## The appropriate sentences in this case

### The individual charges

25     The accused, who had no legal representation, did not say anything in mitigation at the hearing before me. Consequently the only mitigating factors apparent were that she had no criminal record and had pleaded guilty at an early stage. But in seeking to derive the appropriate sentences in this case by making comparisons with the sentences imposed in the five precedents cited by the prosecution I gave these mitigating factors no weight because they were also present in the precedents and would therefore have been taken into account already in the sentences imposed in the precedents.

26     For the cheating charge involving the application under the TRF pursuant to which the accused received $500, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment should be imposed. Given the range of two to three months’ imprisonment suggested by the precedents where the offender had made restitution of the $500 received under the TRF, I thought that it was fair and reasonable of the prosecution to submit that a sentence at the upper end of the range would be appropriate even where the accused had not made any restitution at the time of the hearing before me. Accordingly I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment for this charge.

27     For the cheating charge involving the application under the CSG pursuant to which the accused received $2,400, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of four to five months’ imprisonment should be imposed. I agreed that the sentence for this cheating charge should be higher than the three-month term of imprisonment imposed for the cheating charge pertaining to the TRF because this cheating charge concerned a larger sum of money paid out by the MSF and thereby involved a greater degree of harm warranting greater punishment. Moreover, given that the precedents suggested that it was reasonable to impose three months’ imprisonment where the MSF had not made any payment pursuant to a deceitful application under the CSG, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that where, as in this case, the accused had in fact received the $2,400 payment from the MSF and made no restitution there should be an uplift applied to that sentence to take into account the actual loss and harm to the MSF that eventuated. Both paths of reasoning led to the conclusion that the prosecution’s submission was once more fair and reasonable, and so I imposed a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for this charge.

28     For the attempted cheating charges, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment should be imposed per charge. In effect the prosecution submitted that it would be appropriate to follow the precedents in which three months’ imprisonment was imposed for unsuccessful attempts to cheat the MSF in connection with the CSG. I thought that this was a fair and reasonable submission and so imposed three months’ imprisonment for each of the attempted cheating charges.

29     For the forgery charge, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of two to three months’ imprisonment should be imposed. This charge involved the CF whereas in the precedents involving forgery under s 468 of the Penal Code the offences were committed in respect of applications under the CSG. That distinction was material because the maximum payments under these financial support schemes were different: it was $1,000 under the CF but $2,400 under the CSG. The lower monetary amount that could be sought in an application under the CF meant that, all else being equal, forgery in connection with the CF would carry smaller potential for harm than forgery in connection with the CSG and so would merit a less severe sentence.

30     The precedent of _PP v Ong Hong Beng, Benny_ suggested that for forgery in connection with the CSG it was reasonable to impose ten weeks’ imprisonment. I did not think this premise was undermined by the fact that lower sentences of one and two months’ imprisonment were imposed in the precedent of _PP v Goh Edward_ because the sentences in that case depended on unusual mitigating factors that were absent from this case. Adjusting downwards from this starting point of ten weeks’ imprisonment while bearing in mind that the sentence for the forgery charge had to be substantial on account of the need for general deterrence, I thought two months’ imprisonment – the lower end of the prosecution’s submission – was appropriate for this charge.

### The global sentence

31     I thought that the prosecution was correct to submit that it would not be unfair to order that the sentences for all five charges run consecutively given that each charge concerned a separate and distinct act of deception practised on the MSF. But the prosecution was prepared to accept that the sentence for one of the attempted cheating charges could be ordered to run concurrently and so I considered it appropriate in principle that the sentences for the cheating charges (three and four months’ imprisonment), the forgery charge (two months’ imprisonment) and one attempted cheating charge (three months’ imprisonment) should be ordered to run consecutively.

32     This would yield a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. Looked at in the round I did not think that this was crushing or disproportionately high. As the prosecution pointed out, this global sentence was but one-tenth of the maximum sentence of ten years’ imprisonment that could have been imposed for any of the individual charges. Although the global sentences imposed in the prosecution’s precedents did not exceed six months’ imprisonment, I thought that a significantly higher global sentence in this case was justified because the precedents involved at most three applications under the COVID-19-related financial support schemes but in this case there were five such applications. The greater repetition of the accused’s criminal conduct suggested an increased need for specific deterrence in this case relative to the precedents.

33     In particular, in _PP v Muhammad Faizal Bin Khaled_ the global sentence was six months’ imprisonment where there were two applications, one under the TRF and one under the CSG, pursuant to which the offender could have received up to $2,900 in payments and in fact received $500 which he eventually returned. In this case, there were more than twice as many applications as there were in that precedent, and the accused could have received up to $8,700 – that is, $2,400 for each of the three applications under the CSG, $500 for the application under the TRF and $1,000 for the application under the CF – which was precisely three times what the offender could have received in that precedent. Moreover, in this case the accused did in fact receive $2,400 for which no restitution was made. This meant that there was in this case appreciably higher culpability and harm, both potential and actual, than there was in that precedent, and in that light I thought that a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was not unwarranted in this case.

34     I should add that, though I did not take this into account at the time I imposed the sentences, I think that a global sentence in this case of 12 months’ imprisonment would not be out of line with the ranges set out in _Public Prosecutor v Husniyati binte Omar_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 255</span>. In that decision District Judge Edgar Foo opined after consideration of various sentencing precedents that for offences under s 420 of the Penal Code where “the benefit/loss arising is in the range of $5,000 to $10,000, the sentencing benchmark should be in the range of 2 to 6 months” (at \[81\]). In this case the total potential benefit to the accused and corresponding loss to the MSF was $8,700. Given that $8,700 is within the highest third of the $5,000-to-$10,000 range, this should as a starting point place this case at the higher end of the range of two to six months’ imprisonment. Hence, were the accused facing a single charge involving the sum of $8,700 it would not be unreasonable to start around five months’ imprisonment. It would then be necessary to increase the sentences to a significant extent to take into account the pressing need for general deterrence in the context of cheating offences involving COVID-19-related financial support schemes as well as the fact that the accused had committed five separate offences over a period of about seven months. On the whole I do not consider excessive an uplift of seven months’ imprisonment from the notional starting point of five months’ imprisonment.

## Compensation

35     As I was obliged to do I considered whether I should make an order that the accused pay compensation to the MSF in respect of the $2,900 that had been paid to her. I considered this question after I had imposed the sentences. I understood the prosecution’s pre-hearing position to be that it was not seeking a compensation order because the accused would not have the financial means to comply with it. But when the prosecution clarified this with the accused at the hearing she said that she had the financial ability to make restitution of this amount because she had started working. Nonetheless I thought that it would not be appropriate to make a compensation order because in sentencing her I had taken into account the fact that she had hitherto not made restitution, in that the lack of restitution meant greater actual harm justifying a higher sentence. Having in this sense penalised the accused for not having made restitution – or, to put it another way, not having given her the benefit of the downward adjustment to the sentence that restitution would ordinarily entail – I did not think it would be fair to her to compel restitution because it would be tantamount to punishing her twice for the same thing. Therefore I made no order of compensation against her.
