Civil Procedure – Production of documents – Objections – Whistleblowing policy

30 October 2020

### Deputy Registrar Koh Jiaying:

1       This was the plaintiff’s application for the first defendant to produce the unredacted copy of a document shown at Annex A of the summons, and for the plaintiff to be at liberty to inspect and make copies of the same. While Annex A of the summons was a two page document, it was not disputed that the redacted document that was produced to the plaintiff was a three page document, with the third page left out in error and being immaterial to the application as it was not redacted.

2       The unredacted document sought for production was a chain of emails beginning with an email from the plaintiff to one Mr Yang Ban Seng of ComfortDelGro dated 30 October 2019 at 9:22:20 AM GMT (“CDG Email”) and ending with an email sent to Greg Mittman on 31 October 2019 at 1.14 pm (“CDG Email Chain”). Based on the pleadings, the CDG Email was the beginning of a chain of events which led to the termination of the plaintiff’s employment with the first defendant on 31 October 2019.

3       After considering the parties’ submissions, I allowed the application in part and ordered, in essence, that the first defendant produce Annex A, with some of the information unredacted, and that the plaintiff be at liberty to inspect the document so produced and to be provided with copies thereof. I set out the grounds for my decision below.

## Background

4       The plaintiff was previously employed by the first defendant as a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer pursuant to an employment contract executed by the plaintiff on 15 November 2018 (“Employment Contract”). The second defendant is the Chief Executive Officer of the first defendant and the defendants are represented by the same set of solicitors (“defendants’ counsel”). While the plaintiff has brought various claims in the present action against the defendants, the material claim relevant to the present application was the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant for wrongful termination of the plaintiff’s employment. A primary allegation made by the plaintiff in this regard was that the plaintiff was accused of offering data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) services to a third party whilst being employed with the first defendant and the first defendant having failed to carry out any due inquiry process before terminating the plaintiff’s employment.[^1]

5       In denying the plaintiff’s allegation of wrongful termination, the defendants’ pleaded case, amongst other things, was that the plaintiff had in the CDG email, solicited business in respect of digital transformation, AI, human capital management and business transformation services offered by a consulting group which the plaintiff stated he was in the midst of setting up, with such services being in competition with the services offered by the first defendant, despite being in the full-time employ of the first defendant at the material time.[^2] It was further pleaded that the second defendant noted that the CDG email warranted an urgent investigation into the plaintiff’s conduct and that the first defendant had conducted due inquiry in accordance with section 14(1) of the Employment Act.[^3]

6       It is helpful to set out a chronology of the key documents filed and/or served by the parties in the main action to provide the context of the application.

> (a)     Statement of Claim filed on 23 March 2020;

> (b)     Defence and Counterclaim filed on 15 April 2020;

> (c)     Plaintiff’s Notice to Produce Documents referred to in Pleadings dated 17 April 2020 which was served on the defendants on 17 April 2020 (“Notice to Produce”);

> (d)     Notice where Documents may be inspected dated 22 April 2020 served on the plaintiff on 22 April 2020 (“Inspection Notice”);

> (e)     Reply and Defence to Counterclaim filed on 29 April 2020;

> (f)     Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) filed on 13 May 2020;

> (g)     Further and Better Particulars filed by the defendants on 28 May 2020 (“F&BPs”); and

> (h)     Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No.1) filed on 3 June 2020.

7       The redacted CDG Email Chain was produced pursuant to S/No. 1 of the plaintiff’s Notice to Produce, requesting “the email dated 30 October 2019 (and any attachments) referred to at paragraph 22(a)” of the Defence and Counterclaim filed on 15 April 2020. This email was defined as the “CDG Email” in paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim and I had therefore used the same term in \[2\] above. While the defendants’ Inspection Notice stated that the documents mentioned in the Notice to Produce may be inspected at the defendants’ counsel’s office by prior appointment on 29 or 30 April 2020, the defendants’ counsel proposed furnishing copies of the documents requested under cover of an email to the plaintiff’s counsel in light of the Circuit Breaker measures in effect at that time. These Notices were served pursuant to O 24 r 10(1) and r 10(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) respectively.

8       Copies of the documents mentioned in the Notice to Produce, including the CDG Email, were then provided to the plaintiff’s counsel on 27 April 2020. While the initial document produced by the defendants on 27 April 2020 was the CDG Email (extracted as a stand-alone document), further to an exchange of correspondence between the parties, the defendants furnished the redacted CDG Email Chain, in the manner set out at Annex A of the summons (with the third page), to the plaintiff on 29 April 2020. The plaintiff thereafter took out the present application to compel the first defendant to produce the unredacted copy of the CDG Email Chain.

## Legal basis of application

9       As the defendants’ counsel submitted, in their skeletal submissions, that production of the unredacted CDG Email Chain should be refused pursuant to O 24 r 5 and r 7 of the Rules of Court, I requested parties to submit on the legal basis of the application during the hearing.

10     Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed that the present application was made under O 24 r 11 of the Rules of Court, for the court to make an order for the production of the documents in question for inspection at such time and place, and in such manner as it thinks fit, subject to O 24 r 13(1) of the Rules of Court, which essentially provides that production is to be ordered only if necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. Further to plaintiff’s counsel’s confirmation of the legal basis of the application, defendants’ counsel also took the position that the application should be considered under O 24 r 11 of the Rules of Court.

11     In my view, the plaintiff’s position that the present application was made under O 24 r 11 of the Rules of Court was clearly consistent with the chronology of events set out in \[7\] and \[8\] above, and the hearing therefore proceeded on this basis.

## Document sought: CDG Email or CDG Email Chain?

12     Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the CDG Email Chain was referred to in paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) as it was mentioned that “the CDG Email was eventually forwarded to Mr Yeo at around 10.59 am” and further, that the defendants’ provision of the redacted email chain was an implicit admission that the CDG Email Chain was referred to.

13     The first defendant submitted that the CDG Email formed the only portion of the unredacted CDG Email Chain that was referred to directly at paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim and any disclosure in excess of the CDG Email went well beyond the first defendant’s strict legal obligations, and that the plaintiff was furnished with a copy of the redacted CDG Email Chain without any admission as to the relevance and/or necessity of such information. During oral submissions, the defendants’ counsel added that by providing the redacted CDG Email Chain, they had produced the CDG Email received by the first defendant in its original form, but that it was sufficient for the purpose of litigation if only the CDG Email was produced. The defendants’ position was that they were not obliged to produce the rest of the CDG Email Chain.

14     The specific document sought in the Notice to Produce was “the email dated 30 October 2019 (and any attachments) referred to at paragraph 22(a)” of the Defence and Counterclaim filed on 15 April 2020, which reads:

> “On 30 October 2019, it was brought to the 2nd Defendant’s attention that the Plaintiff had sent an email dated 30 October 2019 at 9.22 am from his personal email account (XXX) to one Mr Yang Ban Seng (“Mr Yang”), the Chief Executive Officer of the ComfortDelgro Group (the “CDG Email”).”

15     In respect of the plaintiff’s counsel’s submission in \[12\] above, I noted that paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim filed on 15 April 2020 did not contain any reference to the email being forwarded to Mr Eugene Yeo, the first defendant’s Chief Operating Officer. This reference was only included in paragraph 22(a) when the Defence and Counterclaim was amended on 13 May 2020. In view of the lack of reference to the CDG Email being forwarded to Mr Eugene Yeo in the Defence and Counterclaim, which was the subject of the Notice to Produce, it was clear that the plaintiff specifically sought the email dated 30 October 2019 and any attachments to the same, _ie._ the CDG Email, in the Notice to Produce.

16     Plaintiff’s counsel further argued that it was clear that a document need not be expressly mentioned in the pleadings in order to invoke O 24 r 10 of the Rules of Court (which provides for a party’s entitlement to inspect documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits) and that where a document was not explicitly referred to in pleadings or affidavits, the court’s task was to ascertain whether, on a fair meaning of the words in their context, there was a “direct allusion” to the document and relied on _SK Shipping Co Ltd v IOF Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHCR 14</span> (“_SK Shipping_”) in this regard: see _SK Shipping_ at \[19\] to \[22\].

17     The plaintiff’s submission based on this position was that even if there was no explicit reference to the CDG Email Chain in the Defence and Counterclaim, there was a “direct allusion” to the same. I was unable to accept the plaintiff’s submission. It was clear that the plaintiff specifically sought only the email dated 30 October 2019 and any attachments to the same, _ie._ the CDG Email, in the Notice to Produce, and not “any document by which the email dated 30 October 2019 was brought to the attention to the second defendant’s attention” or the equivalent. Even if the plaintiff had sought such a document, I was of the view that there was no “direct allusion” to the CDG Email Chain as there was no indication that the email was brought to the attention of the second defendant by way of a document. To this end, the learned Assistant Registrar in _SK Shipping_ had referred to English case law, which alluded to the following principles in ascertaining whether there is a “direct allusion” to a document in pleadings or affidavits, namely first, that a document is directly alluded to if reference is made to the contents of the document as opposed to merely the effect of a document and second, a document is directly alluded to if the words used, on their fair meaning, convey the act of making the document itself as opposed to a mere reference to a transaction: _SK Shipping_ at \[22\].

18     I therefore found that the plaintiff’s Notice to Produce only sought the CDG Email, and not the CDG Email Chain. However, having made that determination, I did not agree with the first defendant that any disclosure in excess of the CDG Email went well beyond the first defendant’s strict legal obligations. Instead, I was of the view that while the plaintiff’s Notice to Produce only sought the CDG Email, the first defendant’s obligation was to set out the CDG Email fully, in the manner received by the first defendant in its entirety (_ie._ the CDG Email Chain), subject to any redactions made based on valid objections. I did not think that the first defendant only needed to produce the portion of the CDG Email Chain (being the manner in which the CDG Email was received by the first defendant) which the first defendant stated to be relevant because it was the portion of the document that was referred to in the pleadings. In this regard, _Diagcor Bioscience Incorporated Ltd v Chan Wai Hon Billy_ \[2015\] HKCU 1853 at \[15\], cited by the Court in _B2C2 Ltd v Quoine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 67</span> (“_B2C2_”) at \[18\] makes clear that “the starting point is that there should be full disclosure of the parties to the litigation of all those materials which are going to be considered and which may be put before the court. The onus is on the party seeking to restrict disclosure to justify it and to show why, in all the circumstances, notwithstanding onerous undertakings as to confidentiality and the like, nevertheless documents should not be shown to the litigant on the other side.”

## Validity of the first defendant’s objections to production

19     The next question that arose was whether the objections made by the first defendant to the production of the redacted portions of the CDG Email Chain were valid.

### Confidentiality of the redacted portions of the CDG Email Chain

20     The first defendant’s main objection was that the production of the unredacted CDG Email Chain for inspection would be in breach of its Whistle Blowing Policy. Based on the affidavit filed by Gregory Mittman on behalf of the first defendant, the confidential portions of the CDG Email Chain had been redacted and this included redaction of the identities of the persons through whom the CDG Email was passed, in compliance with the first defendant’s Whistle Blowing Policy dated 25 July 2011 (“WBP”). It was further stated in Mr Mittman’s affidavit that aside from the identity of the whistleblower (“WB”), the CDG Email Chain also contained identifying information that could easily point out the identity of the WB and the “\[first\] defendant \[had\] resisted providing the un-redacted CDG Email Chain in furtherance of upholding its Whistle Blowing Policy and protecting the identity of the WB in line with its corporate values of protecting people who report corporate wrongdoing”.

21     The first defendant also submitted that the information was redacted “to protect the confidentiality of all persons who were involved in whistleblowing/highlighting \[the plaintiff’s\] misconduct to \[the defendants\]” but went further to state that the information which remained redacted was in respect of communications involving persons outside of the first defendant’s organisation and the identity of the WB. During oral submissions, the defendants’ counsel went a step further by submitting that the provision of the redacted portions would also affect commercial relationships and personal relationships, as “Mr Yang and whoever he forwarded the email to should not have to be obliged to explain himself \[_sic_\]”.

22     In respect of the issue of protection of commercial relationships and personal relationships, no mention was made of this issue in Mr Mittman’s affidavit, and in any event, the legal basis for protection of such relationships was unclear. Given that the WBP only applied to the first defendant’s employees, the company did not owe any obligation to any third parties under the WBP to protect their identities. I also did not agree that the scope of the WBP extended to the protection of any commercial relationships and personal relationships, whether of the first defendant or of the WB, if such relationships were affected by the whistleblowing. Based on Clause 3.2 of the WBP, the obligation of the first defendant was to protect the whistleblowing employee, and not external parties, from possible reprisals or victimisation.

23     In respect of the protection of the confidentiality of all persons who were involved in whistleblowing, the first defendant relied on its WBP. Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed during oral submissions that the plaintiff was not disputing that the WBP applied to employees. However, the plaintiff submitted that the WBP was not intended to cover employment disputes like the present as the WBP, with reference to Clauses 2.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.3 and 2.5.1, and that the intention of whistleblowing, was for employees to raise concerns relating to ethical and public interest considerations such as criminal acts, miscarriages of justice or dangers to health and safety of individuals.

24     Clause 2.4.1 of the WBP provides that “\[a\] whistle blower is someone in the Company who witnesses behaviour by another employee that is either contrary to the mission and core values of the Company, or threatening to the public interest, and who decides to highlight the issue to the relevant internal authorities for purpose of scrutiny and rectification”. Clause 2.2 encourages employees to bring any ethical and legal violations that they are aware of to the management’s attention. The possible scenarios for whistleblowing are listed in Clause 2.4.3 and Clause 2.5.1 provides that “whistle blowing occurs when an employee raises a concern about danger or a legal requirement that affects others (e.g. customers, members of the public, or the Company). The person blowing the whistle is usually not directly or personally affected by the danger or illegality and hence does not have a personal interest in the outcome of any investigation into the raised concerns.” Clause 3.2 encourages employees to speak up about genuine concerns in relation to criminal activity, bribery, breach of a legal obligation (including negligence, breach of contract, breach of security, breach of administrative law), miscarriage of justice, danger to health and safety or the environment, and the cover-up of any of these in the workplace.

25     Based on a plain reading of the above-mentioned clauses of the WBP, I did not agree that the WBP is limited to instances where employees raised concerns relating to ethical and public interest considerations. It was clear that the WBP has a wide scope, and also covers concerns about danger or a legal requirement that affect others including the first defendant and/or a breach of a legal obligation, or in fact any behaviour that is contrary to the mission and core values of the first defendant.

26     It was stated in Mr Mittman’s affidavit that the WB was alarmed that the plaintiff was conducting work on the side of his day job with the first defendant for his personal interests, and that the plaintiff was selling services of an unknown “consulting group” to a third party, _ie_. CDG, which was a real and serious conflict of interests as an employee of the first defendant. In my view, the WB’s concerns fell within the scope of the WBP, as it related to possible behaviour that was contrary to the mission and core values of the first defendant, and that the WB had followed the procedure under the WBP by informing Mr Eugene Yeo, the Chief Operating Officer and thereafter the Chief Executive Officer. As such, Clause 3.3 of the WBP applied such that the investigation would be dealt with in confidence. Accordingly, any information identifying the WB would be confidential.

27     The next question that arose was whether the redacted information would in fact identify the WB and accordingly be confidential, and if so, whether such information should still be produced after balancing the degree of prejudice to one party of risking disclosure of its confidential information, and the degree of prejudice caused to the other of being denied access to documents which were relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute: see _B2C2_ at \[29\]. Although the relevant provision examined in _B2C2_ was O 110 r 17 of the Rules of Court, given that the court examined cases that touched on O 24 of the Rules of Court and did not accept that the effect of O 110 r 17 of the Rules of Court mandates a different approach to dealing with discovery of confidential documents to that which exists under O 24 of the Rules of Court, the court’s views in _B2C2_ in relation to confidentiality would clearly be applicable to the present case.

28     As O 24 r 13(2) of the Rules of Court allows the court to inspect the document for the purposes of deciding whether the first defendant’s claims or objections were valid and I took the view that the court doing so may resolve the dispute between the parties, thus saving time and costs for the parties, I asked the defendants’ counsel, at the first hearing of this application on 5 August 2020, to take instructions on the inspection of the CDG Email Chain by the court. Pursuant to the first defendant’s agreement conveyed to the court on 11 August 2020, a copy of the unredacted CDG Email Chain was provided to the court on 12 August 2020.

29     As set out in the table below, eight of the redacted lines in the CDG Email Chain did not identify or lead to the identification of the WB and would not, in my view, constitute confidential information. In respect of the references to the redacted lines in the CDG Email Chain, there is a header at the top right-hand corner of the document which I referred to as Redaction Line No. H and 30 lines that have been redacted in the CDG Email Chain, which I referred to as Redaction Line Nos. 1 to 30, with the first starting from the top, underneath the phrase “Greg Mittman greg@myrepublic.com.sg”.

#### Disclosure of the identity of the WB

30     I then turned to the plaintiff’s submission that the identity of the WB was revealed by the first defendant, which would mean that the redacted information categorised as identifying the WB above would no longer be confidential.

31     The plaintiff submitted that as Mr Mittman’s account was that the WB forwarded the plaintiff’s email to Mr Yeo at 10.59 am on 31 October 2019 and the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) also stated that the first defendant’s manager who first received the plaintiff’s email also forwarded the email to Mr Yeo at 10.59 am, there could be no dispute that the WB in this case was one Lavinia Koh.

32     The facts pleaded in paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1), if read together with the F&BPs would essentially be that “\[o\]n 31 October 2019 in the early hours of the morning, it was brought to the attention of the \[first\] Defendant’s management (Lavinia Koh) that the Plaintiff had sent an email dated 30 October 2019 at 9.22 am (GMT) or 5.22 pm (SGT) from his personal email account (XXX) to one Mr Yang Ban Seng (“Mr Yang”), the Chief Executive Officer of the ComfortDelgro Group (“the CDG email”). An inquiry into the conduct of the Plaintiff commenced, with discussions on the CDG email taking place between the \[first\] defendant’s managers (Lavinia Koh, Malcolm Anthony Rodrigues, Gregory Albrecht Mitman \[_sic_\], Yeo Kok Wee Eugene and Ho Chee Ching Isabella) in the course of the morning. The CDG email was eventually forwarded to Mr Yeo at around 10.59 am.”

33     I set out the chronology of events in respect of the CDG Email Chain, based on Mr Mittman’s account in his affidavit:

> (a)     On 31 October 2019[^4] at around 1.23 am, a representative of the first defendant, the WB, was sent a copy of the CDG email.

> (b)     The WB received the CDG email in the wee hours of the morning of 31 October 2019. The WB decided to take this matter up with Mr Yeo, who was also the plaintiff’s direct manager, first thing in the morning.

> (c)     On 31 October 2019 at around 9.15 am, the WB met face to face with Mr Yeo at the first defendant’s offices and raised concerns with Mr Yeo about the CDG email. The WB then showed Mr Yeo the CDG email on the WB’s mobile phone, without forwarding him a copy of the same.

> (d)     Upon showing Mr Yeo the CDG email, the WB and Mr Yeo discussed that the plaintiff’s actions could have adverse ramifications on the first defendant. The WB and Mr Yeo jointly decided that this matter was of sufficient severity to be raised to the first defendant’s CEO, the second defendant. They made arrangements to meet with the second defendant approximately one and a half hours later at an offsite meeting.

> (e)     At around 10.59 am that morning, the WB then forwarded a copy of the email to Mr Yeo, without any explanatory comment or context in the cover email.

> (f)     At around 12.00 pm that day, an offsite meeting was held with the second defendant, the WB and Mr Mittman. The WB forwarded a copy of the CDG email to Mr Mittman around 12.59 pm, without any explanatory notes or context in the cover email.

> (g)     Mr Mittman led the first defendant’s legal and IT teams in concluding its investigations into the plaintiff’s conduct until about 1.00 pm.

> (h)     Around 1.30 pm, Mr Mittman reported his findings to the second defendant and advised the first defendant that it had sufficient grounds to terminate the plaintiff’s employment for cause and without notice.

> (i)     A termination meeting was held with the plaintiff thereafter and the plaintiff was served the Notice of Termination in accordance with his immediate dismissal.

34     Based on paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) read with the F&BPs, the CDG email was brought to the attention of the first defendant’s management, Lavinia Koh, in the early hours of the morning. Based on the chronology in \[33\] above, the WB was sent a copy of the CDG email at 1.23 am on 31 October 2019 and did not forward the CDG email or bring the CDG email to the attention of the first defendant’s management (being Mr Eugene Yeo) until 9.15 am on 31 October 2019. Based on the pleaded case, only Lavinia Koh was aware of the CDG email in the early hours of the morning. Matching the pleaded case to the chronology above, I was of the view that the identity of the WB had in fact been disclosed by the first defendant and was no longer confidential information.

#### Whether confidentiality should be a bar to production if the identity of the WB had not been disclosed

35     Even if I was wrong in the determination that the identity of the WB had in fact been disclosed by the first defendant, based on the facts of the present case, after balancing the degree of prejudice to one party of risking disclosure of its confidential information and the degree of prejudice to the other of being denied access to documents which are relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute in question, I did not think that the grounds of confidentiality in this case were compelling such that an order of production of the redacted portions should be refused in entirety.

36     In Mr Mittman’s affidavit, he stated that the first defendant has every reason to stand by its internal policies, which govern the way the first defendant regulates its work environment and process and that the first defendant has a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees can rely on and abide by the same in their conduct. Such legitimate interest of the first defendant has to be weighed against the public interest in open justice and the equivalent public interest in ensuring a fair trial in which both parties have unfettered access to all relevant material: see _B2C2_ at \[16\]. In respect of the prejudice to the first defendant, the defendants’ counsel submitted that the disclosure of the identity of the WB could result in retaliatory action by the plaintiff and/or other related persons or entities against the WB and that the disclosure could call into question and efficacy and sanctity of the first defendant’s WBP vis-à-vis its employees and erode the first defendant’s employees’ trust in the first defendant’s handling of confidential complaints raised and may in turn discourage the good faith escalation of complaints by the first defendant’s employees.

37     While it had been stated that in Mr Mittman’s affidavit “\[t\]hat the plaintiff is presently seeking to uncover the identity of the person who had exposed his misconduct is entirely inappropriate and unnecessary, and can only be interpreted as acts with retaliatory intent”, there was no evidence or specific statement in his affidavit in respect of the WB’s fear of retaliatory action in this case or the basis of such fear, especially given that the plaintiff was no longer with the company, bearing in mind the principle that a party who obtains documents by process of court can only use them for the purpose of those proceedings and nothing else, and the plaintiff’s position that he knew of the identity of the WB since 27 May 2020.

38     Having dealt with the potential prejudice to the first defendant, I considered the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff by being denied access to documents which are relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute in question. Were the redacted portions of the CDG Email Chain relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute in question?

39     Based on the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleged, amongst other things, that the first defendant wrongfully terminated his employment as he has never offered data and AI services to a third party whilst being employed with the first defendant, and no due inquiry was conducted. The first defendant pleaded that due inquiry was conducted.

40     In respect of the issue of lack of due inquiry, it is important to set out the elements of “due inquiry” to determine if the redacted portions of the CDG Email Chain are relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute. In _Long Kim Wing v LTX-Credence Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 151</span>, the court was of the view that “due inquiry” means something more than just the making of inquiries and the conduct of an investigation, and that the phrase suggests some sort of process in which the employee concerned is informed about the allegation(s) and the evidence against him so that he has an opportunity to defend himself by presenting his position, with or without other evidence: see \[161\] and \[162\]. Therefore, “due inquiry” would consist the making of inquiries, the conduct of an investigation and a process in which the employee concerned is informed about the allegation(s) and the evidence against him so that he has an opportunity to defend himself by presenting his position.

41     Given that the portions involving solely the first defendant’s managers would undoubtedly form part of the inquiry, the production of the unredacted CDG Email Chain in respect of the emails involving at least the first defendant’s management would be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute in question. Finally, an additional factor in this case was that the WB took part in the inquiry, in her capacity as one of the first defendant’s managers, as pleaded in paragraph 22(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) read with the F&BPs, and whose evidence would be material given also that she was the first of the first defendant’s managers to whose attention the CDG Email was brought to. The issue of how the CDG Email was brought to her attention would be evidence that would be relevant as this would have begun the inquiry.

42     Weighing the prejudice against the first defendant and the prejudice against the plaintiff in this regard, I did not think that the first defendant’s objections due to confidentiality in order to protect the identity of the WB in this case should be a bar to production at this stage of the analysis.

43     In respect of the first defendant’s objections, I made it clear to parties that my determination did not mean that WBs who report incidents pursuant to the first defendant’s WBP would no longer be protected. My decision is limited to the facts of this case, taking into account the pleadings, the parties involved, the identity of the WB and the role the WB played in the inquiry as well as in the first defendant. I did not think that the efficacy and sanctity of the first defendant’s WBP would be called into question so easily due to my determination, given that a WBP or any other company policy which was the subject of any court proceedings, would in any event be open to scrutiny by the court. On the other hand, if the first defendant’s position was that there should be blanket protection over all WBs based on their own interpretation of their own WBP, that may also cause some concern among their employees.

44     Given the above findings, the only issue left for consideration was whether the disclosure of the redacted information was necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.

## Necessity

45     Necessity is a requirement before production can be ordered: see O 24 r 14 of the Rules of Court. To this end, it is clear that an assertion that the documents are necessary because they are relevant will not be enough, as documents may be relevant to a case without being necessary to it: _Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and other applications_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 39</span> at \[37\].

46     The plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff’s case against the first defendant is for wrongful dismissal on the basis that no due inquiry had taken place before the first defendant summarily terminated his employment. The first defendant’s defence is essentially that it had conducted due inquiry.

47     The plaintiff’s position was that the CDG Email Chain is relevant and necessary as it shows the following:

> (a)     when the inquiry first began;

> (b)     the manner in which the inquiry took place;

> (c)     the times when different persons received the plaintiff’s email to Mr Yang;

> (d)     the identities of all the persons who received and forwarded the email.

> (e)     the views in the cover emails, if any, articulated about the plaintiff’s email to Mr Yang as these would have influenced and/or shed light on the course of the investigations;

> (f)     the nature of the discussion in the email chain which can only be seen from the contents of the email chain;

> (g)     at paragraph 24(m) of Mr Mittman’s affidavit, he claimed he required the email in order to “facilitate the investigations”, further confirming that the email chain was vital.

48     The first defendant did not dispute that the CDG Email Chain forms part of the inquiry conducted by the first defendant but stated that it only sets out a small component of the inquiry. The first defendant further submitted that given that the first defendant had yet to file its AEIC to introduce key evidence as to the due inquiry, the production of the unredacted CDG Email Chain was simply not necessary given the present stage in proceedings and would in any event be ill-timed. In respect of the latter submission, I agreed with the view of the court in \[50\] of _SK Shipping_, that there is no temporal dimension to the test of necessity under O 24 r 13 of the Rules of Court, which did not give the court the flexibility to defer an order for production to a later stage of proceedings once it is found that such production was necessary. Finally, the first defendant also submitted that emails exchanged between and with parties outside of the first defendant’s management that ran the inquiry into the plaintiff’s alleged misconduct leading up to the termination of his employment with the first defendant are strictly neither relevant nor necessary to fairly disposing the issues in dispute.

49     As mentioned above, based on the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff alleged, amongst other things, that the first defendant wrongfully terminated his employment as he has never offered data and AI services to a third party whilst being employed with the first defendant, and no due inquiry was conducted. In respect of the cause for the termination, while the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had at a minimum, engaged in activities relating to the plaintiff offering data and AI services to a third party whilst employed full time by the first defendant, no other activities of the plaintiff prior to the termination have been pleaded. As such, it appears that the issue is whether the first defendant was entitled to terminate the plaintiff’s employment for misconduct, on the basis that the plaintiff had offered data and AI services to a third party whilst employed full time by the first defendant. Based on my inspection of the unredacted CDG Email Chain, the redacted portions did not touch on this issue and the relevant text of the emails and identities of the external parties would therefore not be relevant and necessary for the fair disposal of this issue.

50     In respect of the latter issue of lack of due inquiry, I had determined that the production of the unredacted CDG Email Chain in respect of the emails involving at least the first defendant’s management would be relevant and material to the resolution of the dispute in question (see \[41\] above). Given such materiality, I am of the view that the production of the unredacted CDG Email Chain in respect of the emails involving solely the first defendant’s managers would be necessary for disposing fairly of the cause of matter.

51     In respect of the redacted portions involving external parties, I have stated above that based on my inspection, the text in the emails from the external parties did not touch on the issue of the plaintiff’s alleged conduct of offering data and AI services to a third party whilst employed full time by the first defendant. Such text also did not relate to the making of inquiries in respect of the plaintiff’s alleged conduct, and would therefore not be relevant to the conduct of an investigation in respect of the plaintiff’s alleged conduct, and the process where the employee is informed about the allegation(s) and the evidence against him to allow him an opportunity to defend himself. In short, the redacted text in the emails from the external parties or the identities of the external parties are not relevant to the plaintiff’s alleged misconduct and it is not necessary for the court to order the production of such text either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.

## Conclusion

52     For the above reasons, I ordered that:

> (a)     The first defendant shall produce a copy of the document shown at Annex A (with the omitted third page) with the following to be unredacted:

>> \-       Redaction line no. H (top right-hand corner redaction on the first page)

>> \-       Redaction lines 1 to 5 (with line 1 beginning immediately below the phrase “Greg Mittman <greg@myrepublic.com.sg>”)

>> \-       Redaction line 7

>> \-       Redaction lines 23 to 30,

>> by 18 September 2020.

> (b)     The plaintiff shall thereafter be at liberty to inspect and peruse the documents so produced, and to make notes of its contents, and be entitled to be supplied with copies thereof on payment of the proper charges.

53     In making the above orders, I highlighted to parties that it may be helpful for them to discuss how inspection should be done in view of some redactions being in place, and that in this regard, they may wish to refer to _Fermin Aldabe v Standard Chartered Bank_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 194</span>, which discussed, among other things, the inspection of electronically stored documents. I informed parties that they were at liberty to write in to seek further directions in respect of how inspection should be conducted, if necessary.

54     Pursuant to parties’ submissions on costs, I fixed costs of the application at $4,500, including disbursements, to be paid by the first defendant to the plaintiff after taking into consideration that the plaintiff had succeeded in the application, although not in entirety.
