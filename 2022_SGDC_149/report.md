Tort – Negligence – Breach of duty

Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 18/2022.\]

12 July 2022

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is a motorcyclist who was injured in a road traffic accident involving two other vehicles – a Toyota Vellfire driven by the first defendant and a Mini Cooper driven by the second defendant. He was flung forward from his motorcycle after he applied brakes to avoid a perceived encroachment onto his path of travel by the Toyota Vellfire and then run over by the Mini Cooper upon landing on the ground.

2       The trial on the issue of liability against both defendants was in two tranches. Before his case was closed, the plaintiff reached a settlement with the second defendant whereby interlocutory judgment at 10% liability was entered by consent.

3       The trial then continued against the first defendant at the end of which I found that the plaintiff was primarily at fault for the accident. I apportioned liability to the first defendant at 15% only. The plaintiff, being dissatisfied, has appealed to the High Court and I set out herein the grounds of my decision.

## Plaintiff’s claim

4       The accident happened on the morning of Monday 3 September 2018 at around 9.45am when the plaintiff was travelling to work on the Central Expressway (“CTE”) towards the city. The weather was clear, the road surface was dry and the traffic volume was described as moderate[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

5       According to the plaintiff, he was riding his motorcycle on Lane 1 (_ie_ the first lane from the right) of the CTE at the material time. The first defendant was driving the Toyota Vellfire on the left of the plaintiff’s motorcycle immediately behind the second defendant’s vehicle, the Mini Cooper, on Lane 2. While he was riding beside the first defendant’s vehicle, it had suddenly inched to the right from Lane 2 to Lane 1 without giving any prior signal[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

6       As a result, the plaintiff swerved to his right and applied his brakes to avoid a collision with the first defendant’s vehicle. This caused him to lose control of his motorcycle which then flipped forward and collided into the second defendant’s vehicle. The plaintiff was flung off and landed on the road in front of the second defendant’s moving vehicle which then ran over him. He suffered multiple injuries and was conveyed to hospital[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

7       The plaintiff disclosed that he had been given a warning by the Traffic Police for careless driving. He had, however, brought this claim against both the defendants alleging that they are also liable for the injuries which he suffered from the accident[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4).

8       In support of his claim, he relied on four video footages obtained from the front facing cameras of the first and second defendants’ vehicles as well as the front and rear-view footages of the accident supplied by a non-party who had witnessed the accident[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

## The first defendant’s defence

9       The first defendant denied any negligence on his part and sought for the plaintiff’s claim to be dismissed against him. The first defendant’s case can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     There was no collision and/or contact between his vehicle and the plaintiff's motorcycle.

> (b)     He was lawfully driving straight along Lane 2 of the CTE, when the plaintiff’s motorcycle suddenly zoomed past his vehicle on the right at a great speed, before skidding and tumbling right in front of the second defendant’s vehicle that was travelling ahead of his vehicle.

> (c)     As such, the injuries, losses and/or expenses allegedly suffered by the plaintiff cannot be attributed to any collision with the first defendant’s vehicle.

> (d)     The injuries, losses and/or expenses allegedly suffered by the plaintiff were caused solely and entirely by the plaintiff’s negligence in the riding, management and control of his motorcycle.

10     The first defendant provided photographs of his vehicle which showed there was no evidence of contact or collision damage with the plaintiff’s motorcycle. He also furnished video footages obtained from the front and rear facing cameras of his vehicle to corroborate his account. He had provided the video footages to the Traffic Police to assist them in their investigation. Action was subsequently taken by the Traffic Police against the plaintiff for an offence of careless driving[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6).

## Issues

11     The issues that the court had to determine were purely factual, namely:

> (a)     Whether the first defendant had driven his vehicle in such a manner that it had caused the plaintiff’s motorcycle to flip; and

> (b)     Whether the accident was caused and/or contributed to by the plaintiff’s riding, management and control (or lack thereof) of his motorcycle.

### Whether the first defendant had driven his vehicle in such a manner that it had caused the plaintiff’s motorcycle to flip

#### The plaintiff’s case

12     The plaintiff had pleaded the particulars of the first defendant’s negligence as follows[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7):

> (a)     failing to give sufficient or timely warning or signal of the first defendant’s approach and/or intention to change from Lane 2 to Lane 1;

> (b)     failing to give way to the plaintiff’s motorcycle which was travelling straight along Lane 1;

> (c)     encroaching into the plaintiff’s path along Lane 1 without warning;

> (d)     colliding and/or grazing onto the rear of the plaintiff’s motorcycle when changing lanes without warning;

> (e)     failing to take account of the path of the plaintiff’s motorcycle along Lane 1;

> (f)     failing to give way to the plaintiff who had the right of way as he was travelling straight along Lane 1;

> (g)     failing to keep any proper lookout or to have any or any sufficient regard for other traffic travelling along Lane 1, including the plaintiff’s motorcycle;

> (h)     failing, in the circumstances, to exercise or maintain any or any proper or effective or cautious control of the first defendant’s vehicle;

> (i)     failing to exercise reasonable care, skill or prudence in the control of his vehicle;

> (j)     causing the plaintiff to swerve away from the first defendant’s vehicle which resulted in the collision between the plaintiff's motorcycle and the second defendant’s vehicle; and

> (k)     causing the plaintiff to be run over by the second defendant’s vehicle.

13     The crux of the plaintiff’s case was that the first defendant had acted negligently when he made a sudden movement to the right without any signal and encroached into the plaintiff’s lane. The sudden encroachment had caught the plaintiff by surprise. The plaintiff’s immediate reaction was to move his motorcycle to his right and applying both front and rear brakes which led to him being flung off his motorcycle[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8).

#### The first defendant’s case

14     The first defendant contended that on the evidence adduced, the plaintiff has failed to make out his pleaded claim against him of encroachment as he had remained within his lane at all times. He therefore could not be held liable in negligence to the plaintiff who had apparently reacted to an entirely self-perceived threat[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9).

15     The first defendant had testified that he was travelling within Lane 2 at all times. As far as he knew, he was just driving following the traffic in front and keeping within Lane 2. He was travelling at about 70 to 80 km/h, and if the cars in front of him slowed down, he would have reasonably slowed down as well[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10).

16     On the day of the accident and at the material time, he was going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital which was not too far away from where he was travelling. He was not in a hurry as his appointment was for a blood test and he was not really concerned about time. He disagreed with the suggestion from the plaintiff’s counsel that he was trying to make progress by moving to Lane 1 to exploit the clear lane on his right and said that he was quite comfortable in his lane[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11).

17     The plaintiff had zoomed past the length of his car and then flipped. After the accident, the first defendant kept left and drove off as there was no contact between the plaintiff’s motorcycle and his vehicle. He had subsequently attended at the Traffic Police to make a report of the accident out of caution[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12).

#### My finding

18     The plaintiff’s case had relied primarily on the video footages of the accident taken from the dashboard cameras of a third party’s vehicle travelling on Lane 3 at the material time. He had initially reported to the Traffic Police (through his father) that his motorcycle had grazed the front portion of the first defendant’s vehicle after it had inched to the right lane without giving any prior signal. However, he did not maintain the same version in his AEIC. During cross-examination by Mr Patrick Yeo (“Mr Yeo”), counsel for the first defendant, he explained that the police report was based on events that he had recounted to his father while he was in a semi-conscious state. After regaining full consciousness, he had viewed the videos of the accident that the third party had posted on a social media platform, Facebook, and he then realised that no collision had taken place between his motorcycle and the first defendant’s vehicle[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

19     After he had viewed the video footages many times over, the plaintiff was unsure of how the accident had taken place and whether there had in fact been a collision between his motorcycle and the first defendant’s vehicle as the whole incident had happened too fast[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14).

20     The plaintiff had appointed an accident reconstructionist, Melvin Lum Kah Whye (“PW2”), to bolster his claim. PW2 had come to the following conclusions after analysing three video footages, namely (1) the footage from the front-facing camera of the first defendant’s vehicle, (2) the footage from the front-facing camera of the second defendant’s vehicle and (3) the footage taken from the rear-facing camera of the third party’s vehicle[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15):

> (a)     The travel speed of the first defendant’s vehicle was about 22 km/h at the material time.

> (b)     The travel speed of the second defendant’s vehicle was about 17 km/h at the material time.

> (c)     The maximum travel speed of the plaintiff’s vehicle (pre-braking) was about 47 km/h at the material time.

> (d)     It was observed from the third video footage that the first defendant did not indicate his intention to execute a lane change manoeuvre into the plaintiff’s travel lane. If the first defendant had signalled his intention (to change lanes) early, the plaintiff would have had the opportunity to apply brakes more gradually. If the first defendant had signalled his intention early, it was unlikely that the plaintiff would have fallen from his motorcycle.

> (e)     Alternatively, the accident would have been avoided if the first defendant had waited for the plaintiff to pass before executing the lane change manoeuvre.

> (f)     Given the unexpected and sudden encroachment of the first defendant’s vehicle, the plaintiff had to react between possibly slamming into the first defendant’s vehicle versus a possible fall or slide from hard braking. It was prudent of the plaintiff (or any rider in his circumstances) to have chosen the latter option as this is more likely to cause the rider less harm.

> (g)     The second defendant’s vehicle would not have rolled over the plaintiff if the second defendant had braked upon hearing the impact of the motorcycle.

> (h)     The second defendant’s failure to brake had resulted in aggravating and/or adding severe injuries to the plaintiff by the second defendant’s vehicle rolling over the plaintiff not just once but twice. The right front and rear wheels of the second defendant’s vehicle had rolled over the plaintiff.

21     PW2’s firm conclusion that the first defendant’s vehicle had encroached onto the Plaintiff’s path of travel was rigorously challenged by Mr Yeo in cross-examination. He had sought to discredit PW2’s opinion on the basis _inter alia_ that:

> (a)     PW2’s analysis was based on incomplete information such as the rear video footage from the first defendant’s in-vehicle camera. This had clearly shown the plaintiff riding at high speed in comparison to the vehicles around him at the material time. PW2’s finding that the plaintiff was travelling at a maximum speed of 47 km/h was clearly in error.

> (b)     PW2’s insistence that the speed of the plaintiff’s motorcycle was only 47 km/h was based solely on the front view footage from the first defendant’s in-vehicle camera despite the direct evidence from the plaintiff that he had been riding at 80 to 90 km/h at the material time[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

> (c)     PW2’s opinion that it is normal and common for a motorcycle performing an emergency brake to flip or vault over[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

> (d)     PW2’s conclusion that the first defendant’s vehicle had encroached onto the plaintiff’s path of travel in Lane 1 was based entirely on a single still frame (PW2’s report at Appendix 8b, Frame 1A) derived from the rear-view footage of the third party’s vehicle. As the third party was travelling on Lane 3 and some five car-lengths ahead of the first defendant’s vehicle, the perspective from the camera angle might suggest that the front right portion of the first defendant’s vehicle had crossed the dividing line into Lane 1 when this was in fact not the case.

22     While Mr Yeo’s cross-examination had impugned PW2’s opinion considerably, I did not agree that his evidence was altogether unreliable. Having viewed the video footages from the front-facing camera of the first defendant’s vehicle and those from the third party’s vehicle multiple times in court as well as in conjunction with the closing submissions filed by parties, I found as follows:

> (a)     The first defendant had manoeuvred his vehicle slightly to the right as could be seen from the front video footage of his vehicle, in particular at the six second mark.

> (b)     The manoeuvre of the first defendant’s vehicle to the right had caused the front right tyre of the vehicle to traverse the broken white line between Lane 1 and Lane 2, and extending slightly into Lane 1.

> (c)     Because the movement of the vehicle to the right was not significant (which had been described as a “micromovement” by counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Avery Chong (“Mr Chong”), the first defendant’s perception was that his vehicle had stayed within Lane 2 at all material times.

> (d)     The video footage from the third party’s vehicle (identified as Video 3 in PW2’s Report) at Frame 1 does show the front right side of the first defendant’s vehicle on the boundary of Lane 2. While the enlarged version (identified as Frame 1A in PW2’s Report) was rather grainy or blurry as admitted by PW2, the video when played did show the relative positions of the first and second defendants’ vehicles from the broken white line between Lane 1 and Lane 2, and the right side of the first defendant’s vehicle could be seen traversing slightly over the boundary between Lane 1 and Lane 2.

23     In terms of the extent of the encroachment by the first defendant’s vehicle onto Lane 1, I had agreed with Mr Yeo’s submission that the suggestion of 20 cm proffered by PW2 was entirely speculative given that he had not done the actual measurements of the white lane marking as he could have.

24     When the video footage from his vehicle was played in court, the first defendant had also agreed that his vehicle had moved slightly to the right before moving back although he maintained that he had stayed within Lane 2 at all times[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). As could be seen from the video, almost immediately after the slight movement to the right of the first defendant’s vehicle, the plaintiff’s motorcycle had flipped.

25     Based on my analysis of the overall evidence, I found that the first defendant had driven his vehicle in such a manner, namely by failing to keep well within his lane of travel at all material times, that it had caused the plaintiff to react to a perceived threat of encroachment into Lane 1 whereby he immediately applied his brakes hard and which led to him losing control resulting in the motorcycle flipping forward in consequence.

26     The first defendant’s manner of driving by not keeping well within his lane of travel was negligent in that he had failed to have sufficient regard for other traffic travelling along Lane 1 in particular the plaintiff’s motorcycle. This failure on the first defendant was a causative factor in the accident that caused the plaintiff’s injuries.

### Whether the accident was caused and/or contributed to by the plaintiff’s riding, management and control (or lack thereof) of his motorcycle

#### The first defendant’s case

27     The first defendant had pleaded that it was the plaintiff’s negligence that had caused the accident, particularised as follows:

> (a)     riding his motorcycle at an excessive speed in the circumstances;

> (b)     failing to keep a proper lookout and/or have any or any sufficient regard for other vehicles in the circumstances;

> (c)     failing to steer a safe and proper course in the circumstances;

> (d)     failing to have any or any sufficient regard for other road users in the circumstances;

> (e)     failing to exercise due care and caution in the management of riding his motorcycle;

> (f)     failing to observe traffic conditions along the said road so as to deal with the ordinary exigencies of traffic;

> (g)     failing to exercise proper care, skill and prudence in the management and/or control of his motorcycle; and

> (h)     losing control of his motorcycle and causing it to skid and tumble right in front of an unknown motor car.

#### My finding – plaintiff contributorily negligent

28     The rear video footage from the first defendant’s vehicle had provided clear and objective evidence that the plaintiff’s motorcycle was travelling at a significantly higher speed as compared with all the other vehicles on the road at the material time. Notably, the plaintiff had omitted this particular video footage from his AEIC.

29     The plaintiff conceded on the witness stand that he was riding at 80 to 90 km/h[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19). While it had not been alleged that at 90 km/h, the plaintiff had exceeded the speed limit for that section of the road, the plaintiff’s speed of travel in the circumstances of the traffic at the material time did not allow him sufficient time to respond safely and appropriately to the exigencies of traffic ahead of him. Had he been riding at a slower and safer speed, he would not have needed to jam his brakes causing him to lose control and be flung onto the road.

30     Further, the video evidence showed that he had not been riding in the middle of Lane 1 which was clear of traffic but was riding so close to the dividing line between the lanes. Had he kept well within Lane 1, he could have reasonably and safely avoided the first defendant’s vehicle when it traversed the boundary between the two lanes. The plaintiff’s manner of riding showed that he had failed to steer a safe course of travel for himself and had substantially contributed to the accident.

31     The plaintiff had lost control of his motorcycle after he jammed on his brakes which was a dangerous manoeuvre at high speed causing him to be flung forward. The actions taken by the plaintiff jamming on his brakes was an unreasonable response to a perceived threat of encroachment by the first defendant’s vehicle which did not take place. The reasonable response to the first defendant’s vehicle being driven slightly over the boundary line between the lanes would simply be to steer towards the middle of Lane 1 to avoid contact instead of the hard braking that had caused the plaintiff to lose control of his motorcycle. The plaintiff had admitted that there was no contact whatsoever between his motorcycle and the first defendant’s vehicle at any time.

32     It was substantially the plaintiff’s manner of riding and management of his motorcycle that had caused his motorcycle to flip landing him on the road and being run over by the second defendant’s vehicle. This was also the likely reason for him to have received a warning from the Traffic Police for careless riding although he was the party injured in the accident.

33     As highlighted by Mr Yeo in his closing submissions, at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was a relatively new and inexperienced rider. He had obtained his licence on 29 November 2017, about ten months before the accident. His inexperience would have been a reason for his inability to exercise proper management and control of his vehicle.

34     The plaintiff’s failure to exercise proper care, skill and prudence in the management and/or control of his motorcycle, his failure to observe traffic conditions along the road so as to deal with the ordinary exigencies of traffic and his failure to steer a safe and proper course in the circumstances had substantially caused and/or contributed to the accident and his injuries. Accordingly, I found the plaintiff contributorily negligent.

## Apportionment of liability

35     The first defendant had been negligent to some extent in failing to have due regard to the presence of the plaintiff’s motorcycle when he drove and/or manoeuvred his vehicle such that the front right wheel had traversed the dividing line between Lane 1 and Lane 2. In my assessment, however, the plaintiff’s contributory negligence was of a far greater extent – he had failed to manage his motorcycle properly while riding at a high speed, had ridden too close to the boundary of Lane 1, and had lost control when he reacted to the slight manoeuvre of the first defendant’s vehicle to the right by applying his brakes in such a manner that caused his motorcycle to flip forward and him falling on the road to be run over by the second defendant’s vehicle.

36     I apportioned liability to the first defendant at 15%. Accordingly, interlocutory judgment was entered in the plaintiff’s favour against the first defendant at 15% of the damages to be assessed.

## Costs orders

37     After judgment was delivered, Mr Yeo informed the court that the first defendant had made an offer to settle on liability at 20% to the plaintiff on 4 August 2021 which had been rejected. As the plaintiff had obtained a judgment that was not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, Mr Yeo submitted that the first defendant should be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the offer to settle which he quantified at $20,000 excluding GST and reasonable disbursements. This sum took into account the work done in preparing for the two tranches of trial and the cross-examination of the plaintiff’s expert witness, the accident reconstructionist.

38     Mr Chong for the plaintiff did not contest the plaintiff’s liability for indemnity costs but submitted that a reasonable sum to award would be $15,000.

39     As the judgment obtained by the plaintiff was less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle from the first defendant, I agreed with Mr Yeo that the plaintiff had to pay the first defendant costs from the date of service of the offer on 4 August 2021. For the work done which encompassed preparation for trial, cross-examination of the witnesses and closing submissions, I fixed costs on an indemnity basis at $16,000 plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be paid by the plaintiff to the first defendant.

40     In accordance with O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court 2014, the plaintiff would be entitled to costs on a standard basis against the first defendant from the date of the writ up to the date of the offer to settle. As the plaintiff had obtained interlocutory judgment at 15% against the first defendant and 10% (by consent) against the second defendant for damages to be assessed for his injuries, I ordered that the determination of the plaintiff’s costs against the first defendant on a standard basis from the date of the writ up to the date of the offer to settle and the plaintiff’s costs against the second defendant be reserved to be dealt with at the assessment of damages.
