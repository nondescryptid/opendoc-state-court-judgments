Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Road Traffic Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9050/2022/01.\]

30 March 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Joey Lee, a 28 years-old male Singapore citizen faced the following change under s 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)(“RTA”):

Charge

> That you are charged on 30 October 2021 at about 8:55 am along Admiralty Road East towards Admiralty Road West Lamp Post 44 being the owner of motor car number SCJ8338K did permit one Koh Huan Lin to use the said vehicle for which a motor vehicle licence under Part I of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276 was not in force (Expired 22 June 2021) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276.

2       On 7 March 2022, he pleaded guilty to a proceeded charge under s 29(1) of the RTA and admitted to the particulars of the offence as set out in the charge without any qualification.

3       After carefully considering the accused’s plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, I imposed a fine of $500 in default one day’s imprisonment. As the accused is presently in a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”) I ordered the default sentence to take effect from 7 March 2022 if the fine was not paid.

4       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against his sentence on 16 March 2022. He had served his default sentence on 7 March 2022 as the fine was not paid.

5       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

6       The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 29(1) of the RTA is a fine not exceeding $2,000.

## Antecedents

7       The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

8       The Prosecution sought a fine of between $500 to $700 for the charge.

## Mitigation

9       In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused stated that any leniency would be good but otherwise had nothing further to add.

## My decision on sentence

### S 29(1) RTA

10     The usual sentence imposed for a first offender for an offence under s 29(1) of the RTA is a fine of between $500 to $700.

11     In the present case, the accused had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge under s 29(1) of the RTA. After considering the fact that the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to a single charge and was presently in DRC, I imposed the lower end of the usual fines imposed, namely a fine of $500 and in default of payment a minimal period of one day’s imprisonment. I had ordered his default sentence to take effect on 7 March 2022 itself as he is presently in DRC. As the fine was unpaid, the accused has since served his default sentence on 7 March 2022.

12     It is unclear why the accused had elected to file this appeal against sentence nine days after having served the default sentence.
