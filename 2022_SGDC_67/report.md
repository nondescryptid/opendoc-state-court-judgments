Evidence – Whether a video recording is inadmissible hearsay evidence – Basis for admitting a video recording

Evidence – Evidential value of a video recording compared to testimonial evidence

29 March 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       Video evidence is now a common feature of litigation. This is not surprising given the ease in which such evidence can be produced (such as from handphones) as well as the proliferation of video recording devices (such as in-car cameras as well as private/public surveillance cameras).

2       Yet, despite the proliferation of video evidence, the legal basis for admitting such evidence has seldom been considered in detail in local jurisprudence.

3       DC/DC 2794/2015 (“**DC 2794**”) provided a useful opportunity to address this evidential issue. This is because the Defendants’ attempt to admit video evidence in the case had been met with strenuous objections by the Plaintiff. More of this will be discussed shortly.

4       For the moment, these are the background facts:

> (a)     DC 2794 is the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants for damages he had suffered as a result of a road accident.

> (b)     The Plaintiff is an Indian national. At the material time, he was a construction worker in Singapore.

> (c)     The 2nd Defendant operated Annway Transport Services (“**Annway**”). At the material time, Annway provided bus services to ferry foreign workers from a pick-up point in Tekka Lane back to their respective dormitories. The 1st Defendant was one of the 2nd Defendant’s bus drivers.

## The Plaintiff’s case

5       According to the Plaintiff’s pleaded case –

> (a)     The road accident occurred on 23 September 2012 at about 10.30 pm at the junction of Race Course Road and Tekka Lane.

> (b)     At the material time, the Plaintiff was waiting in a queue to board a private bus bearing the registration number PC 7667A (“**the Bus**”). Before the Plaintiff could board, the Bus _suddenly_ moved and its front left tyre rolled over his right foot.

> (c)     The accident was caused solely by the negligence of the Bus’s driver.[^1]

## The Defendants’ case

6       In their submissions, the Defendants accepted the following:[^2]

> (a)     The Bus belonged to the 2nd Defendant.

> (b)     The 1st Defendant was driving the Bus at the time of the accident.

> (c)     The front left wheel of the Bus had rolled over the Plaintiff’s right foot.

> (d)     If the 1st Defendant was found liable for negligent driving, the 2nd Defendant would be vicariously liable for the accident.

7       The Defendants disputed the Plaintiff’s account of the accident. It was their case that the accident was caused, or contributed to, by the Plaintiff’s own negligence in that he had rushed towards and attempted to board the Bus while it was still moving.[^3]

## Issues for determination

8       The key triable issues for DC 2794 were thus the following:

> (a)     How did the accident happen?

> (b)     To what extent were the Plaintiff and the Defendants responsible for the accident?

## Preliminary issues

9       Before addressing these issues, I would like to first deal with some preliminary issues that the Plaintiff had raised at the trial.

### Whether the affidavits of the 2nd Defendant and Wong Kelvin were admissible

10     The first arose because neither Defendants testified at the trial. The 1st Defendant is a Chinese national and had apparently returned to China by the time of the trial. The 2nd Defendant was apparently not able to testify because he was recovering from brain tumour. However, no medical certificate was furnished to confirm this claim.[^4]

11     Instead of coming to court to personally admit his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“**AEIC**”) and be subjected to cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant chose to admit his AEIC through his son, Wong Kelvin (“**Kelvin**”). Kelvin filed an AEIC which enclosed the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC. He also testified at the trial on the contents of the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC as well as on other matters which were within his (i.e., Kelvin’s) personal knowledge.

12     The Plaintiff submitted that the AEIC of both Kelvin and the 2nd Defendant were inadmissible. This was because what the Defendants were seeking to do was to have the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC admitted without him testifying. According to the Plaintiff, this was objectionable for the following reasons:[^5]

> (a)     It was a contravention of O 38 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court which provides that –

>> … at the trial of an action commenced by writ, evidence-in-chief of a witness shall be given by way of affidavit and, unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties to the action otherwise agree, _such a witness shall attend trial_ for cross-examination and, _in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court_.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> (b)     Without the 2nd Defendant affirming his AEIC in court, his AEIC would be inadmissible hearsay evidence. The Plaintiff acknowledged that the Defendants could have attempted to invoke s 32(1)(j)(i) of the Evidence Act to admit the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC. The Plaintiff however submitted that they had failed to prove that the latter was “unfit because of his bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness” – thus failing to satisfy a requirement for s 32(1)(j)(i).

> (c)     The 2nd Defendant’s account of the accident (as contained in his AEIC) was also inadmissible hearsay evidence. This was because the 2nd Defendant was absent at the accident and did not have any personal knowledge of the matter: s 62(1) of the Evidence Act.

> (d)     Finally, to the extent that Kelvin’s evidence was based on what he had gathered from the 2nd Defendant, such evidence would be “plainly hearsay upon hearsay”.

13     I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submissions. Accordingly, I found the AEIC of both the 2nd Defendant and Kelvin to be inadmissible. I did not consider them in determining the triable issues in this case.

### Whether Kelvin’s testimony was admissible

14     The next preliminary issue concerned the admissibility of Kelvin’s _testimony_.[^6] The Plaintiff urged me to disregard Kelvin’s _testimony_ by relying on two submissions.

15     First, the Plaintiff submitted that if I were to reject Kelvin’s AEIC as being inadmissible –

> “… then it necessarily follows that Mr Wong Kelvin’s testimony … is _irrelevant_. It is equivalent to Mr Wong Kelvin not entering the witness box to give any testimony at all”.[^7]

> \[emphasis in original text\]

16     I was unable to agree with the Plaintiff’s broad-brush treatment of Kelvin’s evidence. There is no reason why, as a matter of principle, the inadmissibility of Kelvin’s _AEIC_ should render his entire _testimony_ irrelevant – or for that matter, inadmissible. In my judgment, whether Kelvin’s testimony is relevant and admissible is highly facts specific. It depended on whether (and if so, which portion of) his testimony was based on his personal knowledge.

17     In this regard, I noted that Kelvin was in charge of the operational and administrative matters involving the 2nd Defendant’s business.[^8] As such, Kelvin had attended at the scene soon after the accident.[^9] Kelvin had also testified that (a) cameras were installed on the Bus and video footages (including of the accident) had been recorded, and (b) he had caused these video footages (“**Video**”) to be extracted from the recording system and produced as evidence in DC 2794.[^10] In my judgment, Kelvin’s testimony on such matters – which were within his personal knowledge – was relevant and admissible.

18     The Plaintiff’s second argument as to why Kelvin’s testimony should be disregarded was on the basis that –

> ... there was no application by the Defendants at any time, or even at the Trial itself, to seek leave of the Honourable Court to adduce _oral evidence_ from Mr Wong Kelvin in lieu of the general rule that Evidence-in-Chief of a witness must be given by Affidavit. See Order 38 Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court.[^11]

> \[emphasis added\]

19     I found this submission to be plainly unmeritorious given the following:

> (a)     Kelvin’s testimony during his examination-in-chief was merely confined to confirming and admitting his AEIC.[^12]

> (b)     It was _the Plaintiff’s counsel_ who had elicited extensive testimony from Kelvin on various matters (which were not contained in the latter’s AEIC) during cross-examination.

> (c)     One such example was Kelvin’s testimony that the Defendants would be able to obtain the contact details of Peter Tan (a potential witness to the accident) and could thus have contacted him to give evidence. Relying on this piece of evidence, the Plaintiff had urged me to draw adverse inference against the Defendants for not calling Peter Tan as a witness. In my judgment, it would be _grossly unjust_ for the Plaintiff to submit that I should rely on Kelvin’s testimony where it advanced the Plaintiff’s case or discredited the Defendants’ case, but not where such testimony advanced the Defendants’ case or discredited the Plaintiff’s case.

### Whether the Video was admissible

20     The last (and perhaps the most important) preliminary issue concerned the Defendants’ intention to admit the Video in evidence.

21     To recap, according to Kelvin, the Video showed how the accident had occurred. The Video was played during the trial. It showed the following:

> (a)     The Video showed four quadrants. (The Plaintiff did not dispute the Defendants’ evidence that there were four cameras on the Bus, and that the footages from each of these cameras were shown simultaneously in the quadrant.[^13])

> (b)     Three of the quadrants showed footages. The Plaintiff did not dispute the Defendants’ evidence that these three quadrants showed the following:[^14]

>> Channel 2: Traffic coming towards the rear of the Bus.

>> Channel 3: The left exterior side of the Bus.

>> Channel 4: The right exterior side of the Bus.

> (c)     In the Video, Channel 1 – which was supposed to show footages of the _interior of the Bus_ – was a blue/blank screen. This was because the camera/recording system for Channel 1 was not working at the material time.

> (d)     The date and time of the footages were shown at the top right-hand corner of the Video.

> (e)     Channel 3 showed the following:

>> (i)       For about two minutes before the accident, the Bus was moving and stopping intermittently.[^15] During the times when the Bus stopped, its passenger door remained closed. The 1st Defendant did not allow any passenger to board the Bus. This was so even when passengers were knocking on its door from the outside.[^16]

>> (ii)       At 22:22:34, a man – with a dark skin tone in white/light-coloured long-sleeve shirt – first appeared at the bottom part of the quadrant with his hand holding to the side of the Bus (“**the Man**”).

>> (iii)       Initially, the Man was walking on the road, alongside the moving Bus. As the Bus picked up speed, he began trotting/jogging by the side of the Bus – his hand still holding to its left side.

>> (iv)       At 22:22:40, when the Bus slowed down, the Man was sandwiched against the Bus by a crowd which had suddenly converged at its left side.

>> (v)       The Man continued walking on the road, alongside the slowly moving Bus, together with the crowd.

>> (vi)       At 22:22:48, the Bus began to slowly turn to the left.[^17]

>> (vii)        **At 22:22:57, the Man suddenly fell and his limb(s) was under the Bus.**

>> (viii)       Between 22:23:00 to 22:23:02, the Man crawled away from the Bus.

22     According to the Defendants, the Man was the Plaintiff.

23     The Plaintiff strenuously objected to the admission of the Video on the following grounds:

> (a)     The Man was not the Plaintiff.[^18]

> (b)     The Video was inadmissible hearsay evidence.[^19]

> (c)     If Channel 1 was working, it would have shown passengers boarding the Bus at the material time, and this would have supported the Plaintiff’s claim as to how the accident had occurred. Given that the Video showed the other channels but not Channel 1, the prejudicial value of the Video outweighed its probative value.[^20]

24     I was not persuaded by the Plaintiff’s submissions. These are my reasons.

#### The Plaintiff is the Man in the Video

25     Because of the image quality of the Video, I was not able to positively identify the Man as the Plaintiff.

26     Nonetheless, this did not preclude me from rejecting the Plaintiff’s assertion that the Man was not him or that the Video had not been sufficiently proved.[^21]

> (a)     First, the implication of the Plaintiff’s assertion was that the _same bus_ had been involved in _two_ distinct accidents on the _same night_, at the _same time_, at the _same location_, with two allegedly different persons being _injured in the same manner_ – i.e., their foot being rolled over by the Bus’s wheel. Such an assertion is inherently incredible. When the Plaintiff’s counsel was invited during oral submissions to address this observation, he candidly acknowledged that he could not provide a response.

> (b)     Second, Kelvin had testified that the Video was extracted from the recording system and related to the Plaintiff’s accident with the Bus. Kelvin further testified that the Bus was involved in _only one_ accident on 23 September 2012 at about 10.30 pm at the junction of Race Course Road and Tekka Lane.[^22] The Plaintiff did not challenge Kelvin’s evidence that the Bus was involved in only one accident at the material time.

> (c)     Finally, I noted that the Video contained footages which were consistent with certain key aspects with the Plaintiff’s evidence, and that this reinforced the fact that it was a record of his accident with the Bus. For instance, the Video corroborated the Plaintiff’s claim that (i) the road was crowded with passengers who were waiting to board the Bus (Plaintiff’s AEIC at \[3\]) and (ii) the accident occurred when the Bus was making a turn around a corner (Plaintiff’s AEIC at \[3\]).

#### The Video is not hearsay evidence

27     I now turn to the Plaintiff’s submission that the Video is inadmissible hearsay evidence.

28     Hearsay evidence is defined as “the assertions of persons made out of court whether orally or in documentary form or in the form of conduct tendered to prove the facts which they refer to (_ie_ facts in issue and relevant facts)”: _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span> (“**_Soon Peck Wah_**”) at \[26\]. The hearsay rule provides that such an out-of-court assertion is not to be admitted as proof of its contents, unless the maker of the assertion is in court to give evidence on, and be subject cross-examination, on the assertion.

29     In Singapore, the hearsay rule is embodied in s 62(1) of the Evidence Act: _Soon Peck Wah_ at \[27\] and \[34\]. That provision states –

> 62.—(1) _Oral evidence must_ in all cases whatever _be direct_ —

>> (a)    if it refers to _a fact which could be seen_, it must be the evidence of _a witness who says he saw that fact_;

>> (b)    if it refers to _a fact which could be heard_, it must be the evidence of _a witness who says he heard that fact_;

>> (c)    if it refers to _a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner_, it must be the evidence of _a witness who says he perceived that fact by that sense or in that manner;_

>> (d)    if it refers to _an opinion_ or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of _the person who holds that opinion on those grounds_.

>> \[emphasis added\]

30     In my judgment, the Plaintiff’s submission is clearly misconceived.

31     First, the Plaintiff did not cite any authority or principle for his submission that the Video was hearsay evidence.

32     Second, the admission of the Video plainly did not fall within the scope of s 62(1) of the Evidence Act. To adduce evidence in the Video, a witness was not required to testify what he had seen on it. In line with the best evidence rule, a court would view the Video directly to determine the events recorded therein.

#### The Video speaks for itself

33     Third, the Defendants’ purpose of admitting the Video was not to prove the truth of an out-of-court assertion. Their purpose of admitting the Video was to show _what had been recorded_ by cameras on the Bus at the time of the accident. After viewing the Video, a court can then make the relevant inferences and findings. In line with this –

> (a)     The Video can be regarded (and admitted) as a _“document” under the Evidence Act_, following _Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd v Pang Chee Kuan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 577</span> at \[113\] to \[118\]. Section 3(1) of the Evidence Act defines “document” to include “any film (including microfilm), negative, tape, disc or other device in which one or more visual images are embodied so as to be capable (with or without the aid of some other equipment) of being reproduced therefrom. Under s 63 of the Evidence Act, the contents of a “document” (such as the footages in the Video) may be proved by primary or by secondary evidence. Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of court: s 64 of the Evidence Act.

> (b)     The Video can also, following common law, be regarded (and admitted) as _real evidence_ – i.e., evidence which a court could consider on the basis of its own perception for the purpose of determining the inferences to be drawn: see e.g., _Karamat v R_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] AC 256</span>; _Buckingham v Daily News Ltd_. <span class="citation">\[1956\] 2 QB 534</span>; \[1956\] 2 All ER 904; _Taylor v Chief Constable of Cheshire_ <span class="citation">\[1986\] 1 WLR 1479</span>; _R (Bridges) v Chief Constable of South Wales Police_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 WLR 672</span> at \[5\]; _R v Nikolovski_ \[1996\] 3 SCR 1197 at \[28\]; Tan YL ‘Making Sense of Documentary Evidence (II)’ \[1994\] SJLS 111 at pages 124 – 126. It is well established that real evidence is not subject to the hearsay rule.

34     For completeness, I wish to state the following:

> (a)     It is not anomalous to regard the Video as _both_ a “document” and as real evidence. This is no different from a case where parties had written the terms of a contract on a piece of paper and appended their signatures on it. Plainly, this piece of paper is a “document” (as the word is used in both its ordinary meaning and in its technical meaning under s 3(1)(f) of the Evidence Act) as well as real evidence.

> (b)     Suffice to note, not all real evidence is in the form of a “document”. An example would be a weapon used in the commission of an offence. For such evidence, s 62(3) of the Evidence Act gives a court the discretion to require its production for its inspection.

35     Finally, _as a matter of principle_, there is no good reason why the Video should be rejected as being hearsay:

> (a)     The rationale for the hearsay rule flows from the fact that a witness who has no personal knowledge of a fact cannot verify whether it is true. Consequently, evidence from such a witness is unreliable and should be excluded from consideration: _Soon Peck Wah_ at \[27\].

> (b)     Such concerns regarding the reliability of evidence generally do not apply to a video recording. This is because a video recording does not suffer from issues that commonly affect testimonial evidence, such as errors in judgment/observation, contamination of evidence, heuristics and bias, as well as distortions/ forgetfulness due to the fallibility of memory. In fact, the strength of a video recording lies in its ability to allow a court to directly assess the evidence itself, untainted by a human filter.

36     This is not to say that a video recording will always be accepted at face value as accurately representing what it purports to show. After all, we live in an age where a video recording can be edited. That said, in the absence of tampering, the value of a video recording as an objective and contemporaneous evidence that accurately and vividly records all information regarding a disputed event cannot be doubted.

37     In the present case, I found no reason to believe that the Video had been tampered with.[^23]

> (a)     Kelvin was responsible for the video recording system on the 2nd Defendant’s buses at the material time.[^24] According to him, because of the nature of the recording system, the Video could not be viewed until it had been extracted by the vendor of the system.[^25] This suggested that it would have been difficult for the Defendants and/or Kelvin to have tampered with the Video.

> (b)     The cameras and recording for Channels 2 to 4 of the Video were clearly functioning properly at the material time. This is evident from a viewing of the Video – which showed an uninterrupted recording of footages on Channels 2 to 4 of about five minutes,[^26] covering the period before, during and after the accident, without any observable anomalies.

> (c)     I noted that there was no footage for Channel 1. This suggested that the camera and/or the recording for Channel 1 was not functioning properly at the material time. In my judgment, this did not prove that the footages in Channels 2 to 4 had been tampered with, or that the entire recording system was not working properly.

> (d)     Indeed, the Plaintiff did not allege that the footages in Channels 2 to 4 had been tampered with either. In fact, the Plaintiff had conceded that he did not have any basis to do so.[^27]

38     In summary, I found that the Video was not hearsay evidence.

#### The probative value of the Video is not outweighed by its prejudicial value

39     I will now turn to the Plaintiff’s last reason as to why I should disregard the Video. According to the Plaintiff, the footages on Channel 1 was crucial in determining the circumstances of the accident. This was because those footages would have corroborated the Plaintiff’s case that passengers were _boarding and entering_ the Bus at the material time. The Plaintiff submitted that to admit the Video without these footages would be prejudicial to his case.[^28]

40     I did not find any merit in the Plaintiff’s submissions.

> (a)     First, the issue of whether passengers were boarding the Bus just before the accident could be determined not only from Channel 1, but _from Channel 3 as well_. This is because Channel 3 contained footages of the left side of the Bus where the passenger door was. That door could be seen in the middle of the channel. Channel 3 showed that the Bus’s passenger door was _closed_ at all material times _before_ the accident. It was opened only at 22:23:09 – i.e., about 12 s _after_ the accident had occurred.[^29] Even after the passenger door was opened, only one person could be seen boarding the Bus (at 22:23:10).

> (b)     Second, it was not the Plaintiff’s case that he had been injured while he was in, or in the process of stepping onto, the Bus. It was the Plaintiff’s case that he had been injured while he was _outside_ the Bus. In the circumstances, whether there were footages from Channel 1 to show passengers boarding the Bus is irrelevant. What is more relevant are footages of outside the Bus to show how did the accident happen.

> (c)     Finally, it is important that a court should be able to take full advantage of evidence such as the Video in resolving factual disputes:

>> (i)       Courts have repeatedly emphasised that objective and contemporaneous evidence is more reliable, and carries more weight, than evidence based on memory: see e.g., _Lew, Solomon v Kaikhushru Shiavax Nargolwala_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 61</span> at \[210\]; _Esben Finance Ltd v Wong Hou-Lianq Neil_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 82</span> at \[64\]. This is because objective evidence is not affected by the limitations of testimonial evidence.

>> (ii)       It cannot be seriously disputed that video evidence is an objective and contemporaneous record of events. Such evidence offers a court the experience of witnessing a disputed event first-hand without learning it through the second-hand filter of a witness who may be unreliable or partisan.

>> (iii)       Video evidence is especially valuable in cases where factual findings have to be made of an event that occurred many years ago – where the ability of honest witnesses to recall accurately the event would have been significantly degraded. This is especially true in the present case, where the Plaintiff had to testify about an event that took place some _10 years ago_.

>> (iv)       Finally, video evidence offers a court the advantage of repeated replay. This allows a court to scrutinise the details and circumstances surrounding a disputed event and thus make better factual findings. As will be seen shortly, this benefit is amply demonstrated in the present case.

## My decision

### How did the accident happen?

41     Having dealt with the preliminary issues, I will now address the issue of how the accident had occurred. On this issue, the parties had presented two vastly conflicting versions: see \[5\] – \[7\] above.

42     If the Plaintiff were to succeed in his claim that the Defendants were wholly responsible (and that he was entirely blameless) for the accident, then the Plaintiff would have to prove his pleaded case on a balance of probabilities – namely that the Bus suddenly moved off while he was boarding it.

43     After careful consideration, I rejected the Plaintiff’s pleaded case. I came to this decision for several reasons.

44     First, _before_ the trial, the Plaintiff had told various persons how he came to be injured by the Bus. Several of these accounts materially contradicted his pleaded case:

> (a)     The first time when the Plaintiff gave a formal account of the accident is in his police report dated 28 November 2012 (i.e., about two months after the accident). There, the Plaintiff had alleged that –

>> “… _while I was about to board_ bus PC 7667A at T-junction of Tekka Lane and Race Course Road, the said vehicle moved off causing my right leg to be run over by its front left tyre”.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> Based on the above account, the accident happened when the stationary Bus which the Plaintiff was about to board suddenly moved off.

> (b)     The Plaintiff however appeared to have given a different account of the accident to his doctors. According to undated case notes (presumably prepared after the Plaintiff’s discharge on 26 October 2012), the following – presumably based on information provided by the Plaintiff – was recorded:[^30]

>> “Ran over by tour bus at 1030pm _while crossing road_

>> _Was pushed by someone behind him and fell_

>> Right lower limb ran over by 1 bus tyre”

>> \[emphasis added\]

> Based on the above, the accident appeared to have been caused by an unidentified person who pushed the Plaintiff while the latter was crossing a road – and that the accident was not caused by the Plaintiff falling off the Bus which suddenly moved.

> (c)     Based on a medical report dated 13 August 2013, the Plaintiff appeared to have largely maintained the version of the accident as stated \[44(b)\] to his doctors at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.[^31]

> (d)     In his Statement of Claim filed in September 2015, the Plaintiff reverted to the account of the accident which he had previously told the police – albeit with one additional significant detail. This detail being that people were _queuing_ to board the Bus when the accident happened:

>> “As the Plaintiff was _about to board the bus_ and was _still in the queue_ thus bus _suddenly_ moved forward and thereby causing the bus’s front tyre to go over the Plaintiff’s right foot”.[^32]

>> \[emphasis added\]

> (e)     In February 2017, the Plaintiff however gave a different account of the accident in his AEIC. This time, the Plaintiff alleged that the injury was caused when the Bus suddenly moved _around a corner_ away from the intended bus stop:

>> 4    As some of the remaining passengers and myself were about to board the said bus slowly started to move forward as it realised that the buses that were blocking the pick up point along Tekka Lane were slowly moving forward away. All the passengers then started to move towards the pick up point. However, the bus stopped at the edge of the entrance to Tekka Lane as the pick up point was still blocked by another bus. _I saw passengers starting to board the buses at the entrance of Tekka Lane. I then followed what I believed was the queue when suddenly it moved forward around a corner, away from the intended bus stop_ and is front left tyre suddenly went over my right foot. I then shouted in pain and the bus driver came down to assist me. ...

>> \[emphasis added\]

45     Second, _during the trial_, the Plaintiff gave further accounts of the accident which contradicted his pleaded case. Some of these are listed below:

> (a)      _When the Plaintiff had first noticed the Bus and how the accident had happened_.

>> (i)       In his AEIC (at \[3\] and \[4\]), the Plaintiff stated that he first noticed the Bus _when it had stopped along the footpath_ of Race Course Road, a distance away from the designated pick up point. The Plaintiff then approached the Bus and was injured when the Bus suddenly “moved forward around a corner”.

>> (ii)       During cross-examination however, the Plaintiff alleged that he did not notice the Bus _until after it had turned_, its front wheel rolled over his foot, and stopped.[^33] In his closing submissions, the Plaintiff maintained the position he had given during cross-examination, and that the accident “occurred entirely as a result of the 1st Defendant’s careless driving and/or error of judgment _when executing the turn of the 2_nd_Defendant’s bus_”.[^34] \[emphasis added\]

> (b)      _Whether there was a crowd_. The Plaintiff’s pleaded case gave the impression that there was an orderly queue of passengers boarding the Bus when it suddenly moved off.

>> (i)       However, in his AEIC (at \[3\]) and during examination-in-chief, the Plaintiff testified that the road was crowded with persons who were also waiting to board the Bus.

>> (ii)       Strangely, in cross-examination, the Plaintiff changed his evidence – this time claiming that there was “no big crowd” at the material time.[^35]

46     Finally, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case was materially discredited by the Video which showed the following:

> (a)     The 1st Defendant did not stop the Bus to pick up passengers along Race Course Road.

> (b)     The Bus’s passenger door was closed at all material times. No one – including the Plaintiff – was boarding the Bus when the accident occurred.

> (c)     There was no queue of passengers waiting to board the Bus. Instead, a large crowd had gathered around the passenger door and on the left side of the Bus. They were jostling and behaving chaotically, waiting for the door to open so that they could board the Bus. (This was conceded by the Plaintiff during re-examination.[^36])

> (d)     The Bus did not suddenly move off from a stationary position when the accident happened. The Plaintiff was walking on the road alongside the moving Bus at the time of the accident.[^37]

47     In my judgment, these material discrepancies could not be simply dismissed away as being confusion on “nitty gritty details” brought about by cross-examination, as suggested by Plaintiff’s counsel during oral submissions. In my judgment, the discrepancies seriously undermined the reliability and credibility of the Plaintiff’s pleaded case regarding the accident.

### Did the accident occur due to negligent driving by the 1st Defendant?

48     In my judgment, the accident had occurred in the manner recorded in Channel 3 of the Video. There is no reason to believe otherwise.

49     From the Video, when the Plaintiff first appeared in Channel 3, a large crowd could be seen gathering and jostling by the left side of the Bus. The situation was chaotic. (In his closing submissions, the Plaintiff had in fact described the scene as one where there was a “sea of foreign workers around the bus”.[^38]) Despite the presence of a packed crowd jostling by the left side of the Bus, the 1st Defendant continued to drive and turn the Bus to the left – i.e., _in the direction_ where the crowd had converged besides the Bus.

50     During oral submissions, the Defendants’ counsel submitted that the 1st Defendant should not be held liable for any injury that could arise from the manner he had driven the Bus, including to the Plaintiff. Counsel cited various reasons to support his position, e.g., the accident was caused by someone in the crowd pushing the Plaintiff and that the accident was unexpected.

51     I found the submissions by the Defendants’ counsel to be disingenuous.

52     First, counsel’s submission that the accident was due to someone pushing the Plaintiff was not part of the Defendants’ case. Counsel did not provide any evidential basis for his submission that the Plaintiff had been pushed.

53     Second, the submission by the Defendants’ counsel that the accident was unexpected flew in the face of logic. This was not a case where the Plaintiff had suddenly stepped alongside the Bus from out of nowhere on a road with low human traffic. The Plaintiff was part of a crowd that had gathered at the left side of the Bus for more than 20 s.[^39] For counsel to submit that the 1st Defendant was entirely blameless in driving the manner that he did showed that the 1st Defendant was either grossly negligent (if he did not notice the presence of the crowd at all) or extremely reckless/callous (if he chose to drive despite knowing the presence of the crowd). I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that “\[i\]t was entirely foreseeable that continuing to drive the bus forward in those circumstances would cause injury to the bystanders in the vicinity of the bus” and that to do so would have been dangerous and reckless.[^40]

54     It is well-established that as a driver, the 1st Defendant owed a duty of care to all other road users, including persons such as the Plaintiff: _Ng Swee Eng v Ang Oh Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 321</span> at \[17\]. In my judgment, the 1st Defendant had breached his duty of care by driving the Bus – a large vehicle – and turning to the left without keeping a proper lookout and without ensuring that there was no one standing near the Bus.[^41]

55     I found that the 1st Defendant’s negligent driving had caused injuries to the Plaintiff right foot.

> (a)     The precise point when this occurred could be seen from Channel 3 at about 22:22:57. The Video showed that as the Bus was slowly turning to the left, the Plaintiff suddenly fell and part of his leg was caught under the Bus. The Plaintiff was later seen to crawl away from the Bus.

> (b)     The medical evidence revealed that the Plaintiff’s right foot suffered from “extensive crush injury”.[^42] Such an injury is consistent with his foot having been rolled over by the Bus.

### Did the Plaintiff cause or contribute to the accident?

56     In my judgment, the 1st Defendant’s negligent driving was not the sole cause for the accident. I found that the Plaintiff had also failed to take reasonable care for his own personal safety at the time of the accident. From the Video, the following is clear:

> (a)     The Plaintiff had created a dangerous situation for himself by _choosing_ to walk on the road, beside a moving bus, in a packed crowd – instead of standing clear from the bus. The Plaintiff ought to have objectively foreseen the dangerous situation that he was in, and to have known that he should not have been walking beside the moving Bus in a crowd in the first place.

> (b)     When walking beside the moving Bus, the Plaintiff did not take reasonable measures to guard himself against the foreseeable harm that one or both of his feet might be rolled over by the Bus’s front left wheel. For instance –

>> (i)       The Plaintiff had positioned himself very close to the Bus. In fact, he was so close to the Bus that his body could be seen was touching its left side at various points in time.

>> (ii)       The Plaintiff had failed to keep a proper lookout for the Bus’s left front wheel. At no point in time did he look downwards in the direction of the Bus’s left wheel when walking alongside it.

>> (iii)       The Plaintiff had failed to take reasonable evasive action, to avoid his foot being rolled over, when the Bus was turning to the left. At the material time, the Plaintiff was looking ahead and would have known that the Bus was changing its course. As the Bus was turning slowly, the Plaintiff would have sufficient opportunity to stay clear of the Bus and its wheels. From the Video, the Plaintiff did not appear to show any concern about the dangerous situation that he was in or take evasive actions.

57     The fault of the 1st Defendant was in driving and turning left, despite the presence of a crowd that was on the left side of the Bus. That said, if the Plaintiff had not chosen to walk with a crowd on the road, alongside the moving Bus as it was turning on that fateful day, the accident would have been avoided.

58     The Plaintiff submitted that if I were to find that him contributorily negligent, then the extent of his liability towards the accident should be no more than 15% as the 1st Defendant was more blameworthy. He relied on several precedents to support his basis for apportionment of liability.[^43] I did not find the precedents helpful as they involved vastly different facts.

59     In determining what is a “just and equitable” apportionment of liability, there are two key considerations: first, the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct; and second, the relative moral blameworthiness of the parties’ conduct: _Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> at \[118\].

60     In my judgment, it would be just and equitable that the Plaintiff and the Defendants should bear _equal_ responsibility for the accident, with the 2nd Defendant being vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st Defendant. In other words, the apportionment of liability would be 50% to the Plaintiff and 50% to the Defendants.

### Plaintiff’s submissions on adverse inference

61     Before concluding, I would like to briefly touch on the Plaintiff’s submission that I should draw adverse inferences against the Defendants given the following:

> (a)     The 2nd Defendant had failed to testify at the trial.[^44]

> (b)     The Defendants had failed to call Peter Tan to testify. The Plaintiff submitted that based on the Defendants’ case, Peter Tan was a “bus marshal” at the material time and an eyewitness to the accident. The Defendants had the means to locate Peter Tan and to call him to give evidence.[^45]

62     The court may draw an adverse inference under s 116 (g) of the Evidence Act from the absence of a witness who might be expected to give material evidence: _Cheong Ghim Fah v Murugian s/o Rangasamy_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 628</span> at \[39\], \[42\](1) and \[43\].

63     I declined to draw an adverse inference for the 2nd Defendant’s failure to testify at the trial. These are my reasons:

> (a)     The Plaintiff had failed to specify _what is the material evidence_ that the 2nd Defendant could give at the trial for which he was suspected of consciously concealing or holding back by not testifying.

> (b)     In my judgment, the 2nd Defendant would not have been able to give material evidence regarding the circumstances of the accident. Based on the Defendants’ case, the 2nd Defendant was not at the accident scene at the material time. Given that he did not witness the accident, any evidence that the 2nd Defendant could give about the accident would be hearsay. Indeed, this was the Plaintiff’s position as well.[^46]

64     As for Peter Tan, the Plaintiff’s submission that he was a material eyewitness could perhaps find some support from a statement filed by the 1st Defendant on 5 October 2012 with the police (“**Police Statement**”). In the Police Statement, the 1st Defendant stated the following:[^47]

> “Peter Tan is not my friend as stated in the report. However, he is a supervisor of Little India Express and he was _not inside the bus_ as stated in the report. He was _actually on the pavement in front of the bus witnessing the accident_”.

> \[emphasis added\]

65     In my judgment, the Police Statement was not a reasonable basis for drawing an adverse inference against the Defendants for failing to call Peter Tan to testify. I had doubts about the reliability of the Police Statement that the Peter Tan had witnessed the accident.

> (a)     First, the 1st Defendant had not been consistent regarding Peter Tan’s role during the accident. In this regard, I noted that in a police report filed on 24 September 2012, the 1st Defendant had stated the following:[^48]

>> “Suddenly, my friend namely, (_sic_) Peter Tan, who was also _inside the bus_, asked me to stop the vehicle because _he saw from the bus left mirror_ one pedestrian foot was rolled over by the bus front left tyre”.

>> \[emphasis added\].

> (b)     Second and more importantly, Peter Tan had apparently filed a report dated 23 September 2012 regarding the accident (“**the Report**”). From the Report, it appeared that Peter Tan did not witness the accident:[^49]

>> “At about 10.22 pm, PC 7667A – “C” was about to turn in to Tekka Lane to pick up passengers. Just after turning, a group of _about 15 to 20 passengers started to rush at the bus, pushing one another, even before the bus had come to a stop. Suddenly, a man cried out and I noticed something unusual._ I quickly instructed the driver to stop the bus then reverse slightly. I then saw a man crawling away from the left front wheel of the bus. At that moment, I noted that his right heel was injured. ...”

>> \[emphasis added\]

> (c)     From the Report, it is evident that Peter Tan came to notice the Plaintiff and realised that an accident had occurred only _after_ he heard the latter’s cry. When this point was highlighted to the Plaintiff’s counsel during oral submissions, he accepted that Peter Tan would not have witnessed the accident with his own eyes.

66     For completeness and the avoidance of doubt, I wish to stress that I did not give any weight to the Police Statement and the Report in deciding on the issue of liability. These documents are hearsay evidence – neither the 1st Defendant nor Peter Tan had testified at the trial.

## Conclusion

67     For the above reasons, I awarded interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff with liability for the accident apportioned at 50% to the Plaintiff and 50% to the Defendants, with the 2nd Defendant being vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st Defendant. Damages are to be assessed.
