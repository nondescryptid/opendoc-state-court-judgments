Civil Procedure – Rules of Court – Striking out

Abuse of Process – Collateral attack on previous decision

11 February 2022

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       This decision concerned the Defendant’s application to strike out the whole of the Plaintiff’s claims in this action. The central issue was whether the Plaintiff’s claims constituted a collateral attack on an earlier criminal conviction against the Plaintiff. Having heard the parties, I answered the question in the affirmative and struck out the Plaintiff’s claims. As this application engaged a very specific form of abuse of process which is not frequently raised, I have decided to set out the grounds of my decision in detail.

## Background

2       To better understand this case, one has to start with the background to the Plaintiff’s earlier criminal conviction.

### The Criminal Proceedings

3       The Plaintiff is an individual who was placed under compulsory urine supervision from May 2019 to May 2021, under an order (the “**Supervision Order**”) made pursuant to Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap. 185, Rg 3) (“**MDR**”).[^1] The Supervision Order provided that during the period of supervision, the Plaintiff “\[shall\] _not leave Singapore without the approval of the supervision officer_”.[^2] Approval was subsequently granted in or around June 2019 for the Plaintiff to be placed on Hair Supervision Scheme instead, but the terms of the Supervision Order was otherwise unchanged.[^3]

4       The Plaintiff did leave Singapore on 4 July 2019 and was charged under the MDR for having done so without approval. The charge sheet dated 2 March 2021 in respect of DAC-9022-2020 (the “**Charge**”) states: [^4]

> …that \[the Plaintiff\], on 4 July 2019 (Thursday), in Singapore, being a person subject to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 28 May 2019, which Supervision Order was issued under Regulation 15(2) of the \[MDR\], did leave Singapore without the approval of the Supervision Officer as required under the Order…

5       The Plaintiff claimed trial to the Charge.

6       The trial in respect of the Charge (as well as various other charges against the Plaintiff) (collectively, the “**Criminal Proceedings**”) took place between 3 and 16 March 2021.[^5] On 5 April 2021, the District Judge who presided over the Criminal Proceedings gave his oral verdict. The Plaintiff was convicted of the Charge (amongst other charges) and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment with an enhanced sentence of 72 days’ imprisonment.[^6] The Plaintiff did not appeal against her conviction or sentence in relation to the Charge.

7       In the Criminal Proceedings, one of the issues raised by the Plaintiff was that she in fact had approval to travel out of Singapore on 4 July 2019. That approval was allegedly granted by (amongst others) the Defendant on 4 June 2019 and permitted the Plaintiff to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019. In convicting the Plaintiff of the Charge, the District Judge specifically addressed this issue, and _found that no approval was given to the Plaintiff to travel on 4 July 2019_. A metaphorical note should be placed here as this point is central to my decision in this application. For this reason too, I set out below the oral verdict of the District Judge (as transcribed) on this issue in full:[^7]

> Now, for the 1st charge of absconding, or---or of leaving Singapore without the permission of…her supervision officer, this charge is based on the validity of the Supervision Order, which is exhibit P2. Now I find that this was indeed a validly issued order, and this fact of the order and service was not challenged by the accused \[i.e. the Plaintiff\]….Now in this order, it’s stated under part D of the---of this part that the accused not to leave Singapore without the approval of the supervision officer. Okay. **It’s not disputed from the ICA records, P8, that the accused did leave Singapore on 4th of July to Malaysia** and returned to Singapore on 7th of July 2019 through the Woodlands Checkpoint. This fact is accepted. **The only issue of fact is whether approval has been given by a supervision officer, or any other CNB officer** that is authorised to give such permission. **The accused says that approval has been given to her to travel on 4th of June in a meeting with CNB officers and that such approval was a continuous approval. However, the email correspondence which…supported the oral testimony of the CNB officers, that the approval was for one-time travel and the accused was expected to report for her---and supervision on 18th of June 2019 and any further travel needs to be---she will need further approval**. The accused clearly \[inaudible\] that she had not received the approval and was merely insistent that the documentation which she had submitted was good enough to obtain such approval. **However the consistent reply by CNB is that such documentation was not sufficient and no approval has been granted. By the agreements that this accused---that no approval has been given is overwhelming, right?** The strongest evidence in the form of contemporaneous email documents, right, particularly the one dated 28th of June 2019 from Leslie Lee to her, that she must submit her application for travel with supporting documents and that she should not leave without…CNB’s approval. At---sorry, without CNB’s explicit written permission. And the replies is that she had already sent all her documentation, but again, Leslie Lee had replied on 1st July that CNB do not accept her screenshots as sufficient for her travel application. **The email messages presented a very clear picture. The accused knew she had yet to obtain the approval and was very upset that the CNB was not accepting her documents in the form of screenshots in support of application.** I want to make this point clear particularly to the accused. This trial is not about whether CNB has exercised their discretion correctly in not granting her approval to travel. **The matter I’ll decide is whether such approval was given and clearly it was not. I therefore find that this 2nd charge of absconding, the Prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt**….

\[emphasis added in bold\]

8       As mentioned, the Plaintiff did not appeal against her conviction on the Charge.

### The present civil proceedings

9       On 27 July 2021, the Plaintiff commenced the present proceedings (the “**Suit**”) against the Defendant, who is at all material times a director at the enforcement division of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”).[^8]

10     The Plaintiff’s claim in the Suit, as pleaded, was that _“_\[o\]_n the day 4 June 2019_, \[the Plaintiff\] _was given approval to travel for her work as a touring artiste by_ \[the Defendant\]” [^9] and as a result of the Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff was “_charged in court and imprisoned for not having travel approval, when she did in fact have travel approval prior to her travelling out of the country_”. [^10]

11     The Defendant’s defence was largely along the lines as the findings of the District Judge in the Criminal Proceedings, namely that although an one-time travel approval was granted to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019, that only permitted the Plaintiff to travel overseas between 4 June 2019 to 18 June 2019.[^11] The Plaintiff’s subsequent travel on 4 July 2019 was not approved and she was accordingly duly charged and convicted of the Charge.[^12] The Defendant denied any wrong-doing.[^13]

### The striking out application

12     On 14 October 2021, the Defendant made the present application to strike out the whole of the Plaintiff’s claims in the Suit (the “**Striking Out Application**”).

## Parties’ Positions and Issues

### The Defendant’s Position

13     The Defendant’s primary ground for the Striking Out Application was that the Suit constituted a collateral attack on the decision in the Criminal Proceedings, and therefore amounted to an abuse of the processes of the court.[^14] This was because the District Judge had already heard and decided in the Criminal Proceedings that the Plaintiff did not have approval to travel out of Singapore on 4 July 2019. In raising and attempting to relitigate this issue in this Suit, the Plaintiff was mounting a collateral attack on the decision made in the Criminal Proceedings, and this ought not be allowed.[^15]

14     Alternatively, the Defendant submitted that the Suit ought to be struck out because:

> (a)     the Plaintiff’s claims were “_plainly unsustainable_” as it was clear beyond question that the Plaintiff did not in fact have approval to travel out of Singapore on 4 July 2019;[^16] and/or

> (b)     that the Plaintiff had demonstrated a lack of seriousness or good faith in her conduct of the Suit, in that the Plaintiff had on different occasions oscillated between wanting to discontinue the Suit, to continue the Suit, to commence a fresh proceeding or to submit her claims to “_international arbitration_”.[^17] The lack of seriousness was also evidenced by the fact that many of the documents which the Plaintiff sought to rely on in the Suit and in this Striking Out Application appeared to be of questionable origin and authenticity.[^18]

### The Plaintiff’s Position

15     The Plaintiff did not dispute the fact of the Criminal Proceedings, nor her conviction of the Charge. The Plaintiff also accepted that in convicting her of the Charge, the District Judge found that the Plaintiff did not have approval to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019. In fact, the Plaintiff acknowledged that the purpose of the present Suit was for the court to revisit this issue (i.e. whether the Plaintiff had approval to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019) and hopefully arrive at a different conclusion. The Plaintiff explained that the reason why she commenced this Suit instead of filing an appeal in the Criminal Proceedings was because she believed that the evidence given by some of the witnesses in the Criminal Proceedings were “_corrupt_”. As such, the Plaintiff did not believe there was any utility in her filing an appeal in the Criminal Proceedings, or seeking “_judicial review_” of that decision.

16     As for the Defendant’s submissions that her claims were “_plainly unsustainable_” or that there was a lack of seriousness in her conduct of the Suit, the Plaintiff submitted as follows:

> (a)     First, that the claims in the Suit were not untenable and that they were “_backed by hard evidence_”; and

> (b)     Second, the shifting of positions on the part of the Plaintiff was caused by conflicting and changing instructions she was receiving from her “_bosses_”. In this regard, it is the Plaintiff’s position that she is a military intelligence officer who works for the British intelligence department and the Singapore government.[^19]

### The Issues

17     Given the parties’ respective positions, the following issues arose for determination in this Striking Out Application:

> (a)     First, whether the Suit constituted a collateral attack on the decision of the court in the Criminal Proceedings and if so, whether the Suit ought to be struck out on that basis (the “**Abuse of Process Issue**”); and

> (b)     Second, whether the Suit should be struck out on the alternative grounds that the claims were plainly unsustainable and/or that there was a lack of seriousness or _bona fides_ in the manner in which the Plaintiff had conducted the Suit (the “**Frivolous/Vexatious Issue**”).

18     A determination in favour of the Defendant on either of these two issues would be fully dispositive of the Striking Out Application. Since the Defendant’s counsel indicated that the Abuse of Process Issue was his primary argument, I shall start with that.

## Issue 1: The Abuse of Process Issue

19     It is trite that an action can be struck out on the basis that it is an abuse of the process pursuant to Order 18 Rule 19(1)(d) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). The categories of conduct rendering a claim an abuse of process are wide-ranging, but the type most commonly associated with this ground is perhaps re-litigation in one form or another.

20     The unique feature of this Striking Out Application (and the Abuse of Process Issue in particular) was that the form of abuse identified here did not involve re-litigation _between the same parties or their privies_, but where the instant proceeding was said to constitute a “_collateral attack_” on an earlier decision of another court. This raised the following sub-issues for consideration, namely:

> (a)     First, whether a “_collateral attack_” on an earlier decision of another court can constitute an abuse of process, where there is _no re-litigation between the same parties or their privies_.

> (b)     Second, if the first question is answered affirmatively, what constitutes such a “_collateral attack_”?

> (c)     Lastly, whether the present Suit constituted a “_collateral attack_” on the decision made in the Criminal Proceedings and ought to be struck out on that basis.

### Is “collateral attack” of an earlier decision a form of abuse of process where there is no similarity of parties?

21     The answer to the first sub-issue, in short, is yes.

22     The leading case on this form of abuse of process is the House of Lords’ decision in _Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police and others_ <span class="citation">\[1982\] AC 529</span> (“**_Hunter_**”). In _Hunter_, six defendants were convicted of murder in a trial in which they challenged the admissibility of certain confessions on the grounds that these confessions were extracted by the police by infliction and threats of violence. A _voir dire_ was held and the trial judge rejected these allegations, finding that there had been no physical violence or threats thereof made by the police to the defendants. The confessions were found to be admissible and the defendants were convicted of murder. The defendants later commenced a civil suit against the police for damages for assault, based on the same allegations of violence. That civil claim was struck out as an abuse of process by an unanimous decision of the House of Lords.

23     Lord Diplock delivered the leading judgment in _Hunter_. While careful not to lay down any rigid rules, His Lordship outlined the “_collateral attack_” doctrine as one generally concerned with the situation where an intending plaintiff seeks to relitigate an issue on which a determination has previously been made by another court of competent jurisdiction after due process (at 536B and 541H – 542C):

> The abuse of process which the instant case exemplifies is the **initiation of proceedings in a court of justice for the purpose of mounting a collateral attack upon a final decision against the intending plaintiff which has been made by another court of competent jurisdiction in previous proceedings in which the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of contesting the decision in the court by which it was made**.

> …

> My Lords, collateral attack upon a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction may take a variety of forms. … But the principle applicable is, in my view, simply and clearly stated in those passages from the judgment of A. L. Smith L.J. in Stephenson v. Garnett <span class="citation">\[1898\] 1 Q.B. 677</span>, 680-681 and the speech of Lord Halsbury L.C. in Reichel v. Magrath (1889) 14 App. Cas. 665, 668 which are cited by Goff L.J. in his judgment in the instant case. I need only repeat an extract from the passage which he cites from the judgment of A. L. Smith L.J.:

>> ‘… the court ought to be slow to strike out a statement of claim or defence, and to dismiss an action as frivolous and vexatious, yet it ought to do so when, as here, it has been shewn that the **identical question sought to be raised has been already decided by a competent court**.’

> The passage from Lord Halsbury’s speech deserves repetition here in full:

>> ‘… I think **it would be a** **scandal to the administration of justice** **if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to set up the same case again.**’

\[emphasis added in bold\]

24     This formulation of the “_collateral attack_” doctrine bears much similarity to the concept of “_issue estoppel_”, with the critical difference that the former does not necessarily involve re-litigation _between the same parties or their privies_. In fact, Lord Diplock expressed his preference (shared by the other Law Lords in _Hunter_) to limit the use of the description “_issue estoppel_” to “_that species of estoppel per rem judicatam that may arise in civil actions between the same parties or their privies_”: see _Hunter_ at 540H – 541B. The “_collateral attack_” doctrine is concerned with something different, which is “_the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which… would bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people_”: see _Hunter_ at 536C – 536D.

25     In _Arthur J S Hall & Co (a firm) v Simons; Barratt v Woolf Seddon (a firm); Harris v Scholfield Roberts & Hill (a firm)_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 AC 615</span> (“**_Arthur J S Hall_**”), Lord Hoffmann explained the different policy considerations which underlie the prohibition against re-litigation (save by way of an appeal). Quite apart from protecting the _private_ interest of a defendant, there is a _wider policy consideration_ in not relitigating the same issue, even if such repeated litigation does not entail vexing the same defendant multiple times (at 701A – 701C):

> The law discourages relitigation of the same issues except by means of an appeal. The Latin maxims often quoted are nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa and interest rei publicae ut finis sit litium. They are usually mentioned in tandem but it is important to notice that the policies they state are not quite the same. **The first is concerned with the interests of the defendant: a person should not be troubled twice for the same reason.** This policy has generated the rules which prevent relitigation when the parties are the same: autrefois acquit, res judicata and issue estoppel. **The second policy is wider: it is concerned with the interests of the state. There is a general public interest in the same issue not being litigated over again. The second policy can be used to justify the extension of the rules of issue estoppel to cases in which the parties are not the same but the circumstances are such as to bring the case within the spirit of the rules**.

\[emphasis added in bold\]

26     Therefore, the “_collateral attack_” doctrine is _not_ so much concerned with protecting the _private interests_ of litigants, but the _wider public interest_ in preserving (amongst others) the _finality and integrity_ of judicial decisions emanating from courts of competent jurisdiction and the general _orderly_ administration of justice. As such, courts possess the power to strike out attempts to relitigate issues _even where it is between different parties_, but only if justice and public policy demands it: see _Arthur J S Hall_ at 702E – 702F.

27     The “_collateral attack_” doctrine is without doubt a feature of modern English law: see _Koza Ltd and another v Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 WLR 170</span> (“**_Koza_**”) at \[30\] and \[36\]. Fortunately, the more relevant question as to whether it is also a feature of Singapore law has recently been answered affirmatively by the Court of Appeal in _Beh Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 2 SLR 180</span> (“**_Beh Chew Boo_**”).

28     In _Beh Chew Boo_, the Court of Appeal had to decide if the prosecution’s decision to reinstate and proceed with a number of charges previously stood down pending the prosecution of a capital charge (of which the accused was eventually acquitted) constituted an abuse of process. Although the issue of dissimilarity of parties did not strictly arise in _Beh Chew Boo_, the Court of Appeal endorsed the principles in _Hunter_ and clarified that the doctrine of abuse of process is founded not only on the private interest of a defendant, but also on the “_public interest of the state in not having issues repeatedly litigated_” (at \[82(d)\]). This wider public interest reflects the risk of the administration of justice being brought into disrepute, which would happen if a litigant in a subsequent civil case were permitted, without restraint, to relitigate the same issue by simply changing the form of the proceedings (at \[82(d)\]).

29     Accordingly, the first sub-issue is undoubtedly to be answered in the affirmative. A civil proceeding is liable to be struck out as an abuse of process if it constitutes a “_collateral attack_” on an earlier judicial decision, _even if the parties to the proceedings are not the same_.

### What constitutes an abusive “collateral attack”?

30     True to the proverbial saying that the devil lies in the details, a resounding reminder permeating the decisions outlining the “_collateral attack_” doctrine is that there are no hard and fast rules or categorical limits as to the situations constituting an abusive collateral attack. Much depend on the facts. There are, however, some guiding features.

31     In _Hunter_, emphasis was placed on the fact that the very same allegations of violence against the police, which was the central feature in the civil claim, had already been comprehensively investigated and finally determined in the earlier criminal proceedings: see _Hunter_ at 538A – 539B, 539D – 539E, 541B – 541C and 542D. The prominent feature in _Hunter_ was the _exacting similarity and overlap_ in the issues to be determined. The intending plaintiffs’ ulterior purpose in instituting the civil action was also a factor taken into account: see _Hunter_ at 541E – 541G.

32     In _Arthur J S Hall_, Lord Hoffman observed that it would _ordinarily_ be an abuse of process for a civil court to be asked to decide that a subsisting criminal conviction was wrong (at 706D – 706F):

> It follows that in my opinion **it would ordinarily be an abuse of process for a civil court to be asked to decide that a subsisting conviction was wrong.** This applies to a conviction on a plea of guilty as well as after a trial. **The resulting conflict of judgment is likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute**…. The proper procedure is to appeal, or if the right of appeal has been exhausted, to apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission under section 14 of the 1995 Act. **I say it will ordinarily be an abuse because there are bound to be exceptional cases in which the issue can be tried without a risk that the conflict of judgments would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.**

\[emphasis added in bold\]

33     Lord Steyn in _Arthur J S Hall_ shared this view (at 679E – 679H):

> **Public policy requires a defendant who seeks to challenge his conviction to do so directly by seeking to appeal his conviction**. In this regard the creation of the Criminal Cases Review Commission was a notable step forward.…\[T\]he functioning of the Commission must be improved. But I have no doubt that the principle underlying the Hunter case must be maintained as a matter of high public policy. In the Hunter case the House did not, however, "lay down an inflexible rule to be applied willy-nilly to all cases which might arguably be said to be within it": Smith v Linskills <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 WLR 763</span>, 769, per Sir Thomas Bingham MR. **It is, however, prima facie an abuse to initiate a collateral civil challenge to a criminal conviction. Ordinarily therefore a collateral civil challenge to a criminal conviction will be struck out as an abuse of process**. 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

34     In _Beh Chew Boo_, the Court of Appeal took a more nuanced approach and outlined different considerations where the collateral attack is said to be:

> (a)     on a prior civil judgment, in later civil proceedings;

> (b)     on a prior criminal judgment, in later civil proceedings;

> (c)     on a prior civil judgment, in later criminal proceedings; and

> (d)     on a prior criminal judgment, in later criminal proceedings.

35     On the second of these scenarios (which is relevant to the Striking Out Application) the Court of Appeal endorsed the holding and reasoning in _Hunter_, and observed that _Hunter_ had been consistently considered and applied by the English courts (at \[58\] – \[67\]). The Court of Appeal then summarised the following principles from the authorities (at \[82\]):

> We found the authorities in the criminal-civil and criminal-criminal scenarios to be relevant to the present situation. The following broad principles could be distilled from the cases.

>> (a)    The court has the inherent power to prevent the use of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.

>> (b)     **Finality is an important aspect of any system of justice**.

>> (c)    A verdict of acquittal (after the avenues of appeal have been exhausted) is to be treated as incontrovertibly correct.

>> (d)     **The doctrine of abuse of process is founded** not only on the private interest of a party not to be vexed twice in respect of the same complaint but **also on the public interest of the state in not having issues repeatedly litigated**. These interests reflect unfairness to a party on the one hand, and the risk of the administration of justice being brought into disrepute on the other. **On the latter point, it would bring disrepute to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of in one case, the litigant in a civil case were permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to reopen the same issue**. This should similarly be the case in the criminal-criminal context.

>> (e)     **The “proper method” of challenging any aspect of a trial judge’s decision is to make that challenge in an appeal against the trial judge’s decision**.

>> (f)    The initiation of later proceedings collaterally challenging an earlier judgment is not necessarily an abuse of process, but it may be. The court’s power to strike out or prohibit the subsequent proceedings on the basis that it is an abusive collateral attack on the prior judgment should only be used where justice and public policy demand it. **Whether or not there is an abusive collateral attack in any given case is a fact-sensitive enquiry**.

>> (g)    It may be an abuse of process to continue a prosecution in the light of a prior court decision. An improper motive is not necessary for subsequent proceedings to constitute an abuse of process. In the criminal-criminal context, the key yardstick should be whether there would be manifest inconsistency between the court’s findings in the new proceedings and the earlier judgment. There would clearly be such a risk of manifest inconsistency if there is an “identical” material issue in both the prior and subsequent proceedings….

\[emphasis added in bold; citations omitted\]

36     The following principles derived from the cases above were helpful in my consideration of the present application:

> (a)     Where the collateral attack is said to be on a prior _criminal_ judgment in later _civil_ proceedings, there is necessarily a dissimilarity of parties given the unique nature of criminal proceedings: see _Arthur J S Hall_ at 702A – 702D.

> (b)     While the parties may be different, a later civil proceedings can still constitute an abusive collateral attack on the prior criminal judgment. The primary consideration underlying this form of abuse of process is the public interest of the state in not having issues repeatedly litigated. Such repeated litigation disrupts finality of judicial decisions and may bring the administration of justice into disrepute: see _Beh Chew Boo_ at \[82(b)\] and \[82(d)\].

> (c)     It would _ordinarily_ be an abuse of process for a civil court to be asked to decide that a subsisting criminal conviction was wrong, but there is no presumption either way: see _Arthur J S Hall_ at 706D – 706F; _Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd v Sinclair and others (Emmott, Part 20 defendant)_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 WLR 2646</span> at \[48(2)\].

> (d)     Whether a subsequent civil challenge constitutes an abusive collateral attack on a prior criminal decision is a _fact-sensitive_ query depending on (amongst others):

>> (i)       The extent or degree of overlap in the issues determined / to be determined in the two sets of proceedings: see _Hunter_ at 541B and 542D;

>> (ii)       The nature and effect of the earlier criminal decision and the nature of the subsequent civil claim: see _Arthur J S Hall_ at 643G;

>> (iii)       Whether the prior criminal decision was made by a court of competent jurisdiction in which the intending plaintiff had the full opportunity to contest: see _Hunter_ at 541B;

>> (iv)       The intending plaintiff’s purpose or motive in instituting the subsequent civil proceedings: see _Hunter_ at 541F; and

>> (v)       The ground(s) relied on to justify the collateral challenge: see _Arthur J S Hall_ at 643G; _Koza_ at \[37\].

### Was this Suit an abusive “collateral attack” on the decision in the Criminal Proceedings?

37     In my view, the Plaintiff’s claims in the Suit constituted an abusive collateral attack on the decision made in the Criminal Proceedings, and ought to be struck out.

#### Identity of issue

38     The situation in the present case bore much similarity to that in _Hunter_, and the feature bearing most weight on my mind was the exacting similarity in the issues determined in the Criminal Proceedings, and those which the Plaintiff sought to have determined in this Suit.

39     As the Plaintiff conceded, the issue central to her claim in this Suit was whether she had approval to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019. This was the _same issue_ which the Plaintiff had raised in the Criminal Proceedings, and which was determined against the Plaintiff. This issue was not merely a procedural or ancillary issue discussed by-the-by in the course of the Criminal Proceedings. It related to an _essential element_ of the Charge and was a _substantive defence_ raised by the Plaintiff in the Criminal Proceedings.

40     Of course, there was a difference between the Charge and the claim in the present Suit. The Charge against the Plaintiff was for leaving Singapore without the approval of “_the Supervision Officer_”[^20] while the claim in this Suit was that the Plaintiff had received travel approval _from the Defendant_. While I recognised this, it was in my view a distinction without a difference here, for two reasons.

41     First, in both the Criminal Proceedings and in this Suit, the Plaintiff was referring to the _exact same instance_ of approval having been given, namely an approval allegedly given by CNB officers (including the Defendant) to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019. In fact, there is _no dispute_ (whether in the Criminal Proceedings or in this Suit) that _an approval_ was in fact given to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019. The only dispute was whether it permitted the Plaintiff to travel on 4 July 2019. This was clear from the transcript of the Criminal Proceedings[^21] and also confirmed to me by the Plaintiff during the oral hearing of this Striking Out Application on 4 January 2022:

You raised in \[the Criminal Proceedings\] that you had approval to travel on 4 July 2019?

 |
| 

PIP:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Ct:

 | 

The approval you say was granted on 4 June 2019 and it was a continuous approval?

 |
| 

PIP:

 | 

Right.

 |
| 

Ct:

 | 

That is the same approval which you are referring to in your claim against the Defendant in these proceedings?

 |
| 

PIP:

 | 

Correct.

 |

  
  

42     Accordingly, there is _one single occasion_ on which approval was allegedly given by CNB officers to the Plaintiff and the inquiry into the _contents_ of _that approval_ was the _exact same factual issue_ arising in both the Criminal Proceedings and in this Suit.

43     Second, the findings made by the District Judge in the Criminal Proceedings _addressed this precise factual issue_, namely the _ambit_ of the approval given by CNB officers to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019, and whether it permitted the Plaintiff’s travel on 4 July 2019. The District Judge found that no such approval was given to the Plaintiff:[^22]

> **The only issue of fact is whether approval has been given by a supervision officer, or any other CNB officer that is authorised to give such permission. The accused says that approval has been given to her to travel on 4th of June in a meeting with CNB officers and that such approval was a continuous approval. However, the email correspondence which…supported the oral testimony of the CNB officers, that the approval was for one-time travel** and the accused was expected to report for her---and supervision on 18th of June 2019 and any further travel needs to be---she will need further approval.… This trial is not about whether CNB has exercised their discretion correctly in not granting her approval to travel. **The matter I’ll decide is whether such approval was given and clearly it was not**. I therefore find that this 2nd charge of absconding, the Prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt….

\[emphasis added in bold\]

44     Accordingly, despite the _cosmetic_ difference between the term of the Charge and the Plaintiff’s claim in the Suit, the _substantive factual inquiry_ arising in both the Criminal Proceedings and in this Suit was the same, which was _whether the approval granted to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019 permitted the Plaintiff to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019_. There was no doubt to my mind that a finding against the Plaintiff on this issue had already been made by the District Judge in the Criminal Proceedings.

45     There were various implications arising from such identity of issues. The most pertinent ones insofar as this Striking Out Application was concerned were as follows:

> (a)     First, this identity of issues meant a risk of inconsistent findings if this Suit was permitted to proceed.

> (b)     Second, and somewhat paradoxical to the first point, was that it was difficult to envisage under what circumstances a factual issue determined _against_ the Plaintiff on the higher criminal standard of proof (i.e. beyond any reasonable doubt) could be determined in _favour_ of the Plaintiff on the lower civil stand of proof (i.e. on the balance of probabilities). In the words of Lord Diplock in _Hunter_, this appeared to be “_wholly inconsistent with any possibility_”: see _Hunter_ at 543C. In my view, this meant a _heightened risk_ of bringing the administration of justice into disrepute should this Suit be allowed to proceed.

> (c)     Third, the finality of the judgment in the Criminal Proceedings would be at risk. As mentioned, the issue as to whether the Plaintiff had approval from CNB officers to travel out of Singapore on 4 July 2019 was an essential element of the Charge against her. The factual issue in question was not merely peripheral to, or an alternative ground for, the decision on the Charge. In fact, the oral verdict delivered by the District Judge on the Charge was dedicated nearly exclusively to addressing this factual issue (see \[7\] above). That being the case, the Plaintiff’s conviction of the Charge could not _logically_ be sustained if she was able to prove on a balance of probabilities that she had the requisite permission to travel out of Singapore on 4 July 2019.

46     Outlining the foregoing implications individually as I have done at \[45\] above may seem to be splitting hairs. I have however done so because I found it important to explain in detail the _nature_ of the overlapping issue and its _relevance and importance_ in the _context_ of the two proceedings we are concerned with. This is because a potential for inconsistent findings between the earlier and the pending proceedings _may not_, in and of itself, amount to an abuse of process: see at _Beh Chew Boo_ at \[84\]. For example, if the overlapping issue related to a point decided _in favour_ of the claimant in an earlier criminal proceeding, then even though re-litigation on the same issue in a subsequent civil proceeding may still lead to “_inconsistent_” findings, such potential for inconsistency would not, to my mind, bring the administration of justice into disrepute, because “_inconsistent_” findings reached _this way_ can yet be _logically congruent_ given the different applicable standards of proof in criminal and civil proceedings.

47     Ultimately, my main concern in this case was that the overlapping issue here was _of such a nature in the context of the two proceedings_ that it would be _wholly incongruous_ (if at all possible) for different conclusions to be reached and, as such, would _almost certainly_ bring the administration of justice into disrepute if such different conclusions were indeed reached.

#### Nature of the Criminal Proceedings and whether the Plaintiff had the opportunity to contest the Criminal Proceedings

48     The nature of the Criminal Proceedings and whether the Plaintiff had the opportunity to contest those proceedings are also relevant considerations in determining if a subsequent proceeding constitutes an abusive collateral attack: see _Hunter_ at 541B.

49     In this case, there could be no dispute that the court in the Criminal Proceedings had competent jurisdiction. No challenge to jurisdiction was raised. Further, as the Plaintiff had confirmed, there was no appeal filed against the District Judge’s decision in the Criminal Proceedings and that decision therefore currently stands as final.

50     Further, it would be apparent from the background set out at \[5\] to \[7\] above that the Plaintiff had the opportunity to contest the Charge against her in the Criminal Proceedings. Specifically, the Plaintiff had the opportunity to present her case, evidence, and to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses on the issues pertaining to (a) whether she was granted travel approval by CNB officers on 4 June 2019; and (b) whether such approval permitted the Plaintiff to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019. Save for the Plaintiff’s suggestion that some of the evidence given by witnesses in the Criminal Proceedings were “_corrupt_” (which I would address at \[52\] to \[61\] below), there was no suggestion that the Plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to be heard on her defence in the Criminal Proceedings.

51     These factors were not by themselves determinative, but strengthened the Defendant’s case that the present Suit constituted an abusive collateral attack on the decision in the Criminal Proceedings, as it was a decision reached by a court of competent jurisdiction after due process.

#### Plaintiff’s reason for commencing the Suit

52     Lastly, I address the Plaintiff’s reason for commencing this Suit, which was the same reason why she chose not to appeal against the District Judge’s decision in the Criminal Proceedings.

53     Consideration of this issue is necessary not only because motive is a relevant (though not determinative or necessary) factor, but more importantly because if there were indeed new evidence not called at the Criminal Proceedings which will “_entirely change the aspect of the case_” at the civil trial, then it _may_ be permissible for the Plaintiff to relitigate the matter despite the risk of inconsistent findings: see _Hunter_ at 545; _Beh Chew Boo_ at \[65\]. This was a possibility contemplated by the House of Lords in _Hunter_, where the Law Lords considered that the presence of highly probative “_fresh evidence_” obtained subsequent to the earlier proceedings _may_ justify a later collateral challenge. On the facts in _Hunter_, however, the issue was a non-starter since “_the so-called ‘fresh evidence’ on which_ \[the defendants sought\] _to rely in the civil action was available at the trial or could by reasonable diligence have been obtained then_” (at 545B).

54     In this case, the Plaintiff was very clear in her oral submissions before me that she had commenced this Suit with a view of revisiting the issues canvassed in the Criminal Proceedings, and, in particular, to prove that she had approval to leave Singapore on 4 July 2019. The Plaintiff chose to commence this Suit instead of filing an appeal in the Criminal Proceedings because she believed that some of the evidence given by witnesses in the Criminal Proceedings were “_corrupt_” and therefore if she had filed an appeal, the appeal will be determined based on the same “_corrupt_” evidence. The Plaintiff therefore hoped for the issue to be investigated based on fresh evidence to be adduced in this Suit.

55     Although the Plaintiff appeared to hold a very firm belief that some of the evidence given in the Criminal Proceedings were “_corrupt_” and submitted that there were “_a lot of evidence confirming corruption_”, I was unable to discern any such evidence based on the documents put forward in this application.

56     The Plaintiff filed three affidavits in opposition of the Striking Out Application, each with no substantive content save to “_refer to_” certain documents exhibited. More importantly, none of the documents exhibited in the Plaintiff’s affidavits met the high threshold of “_new evidence_” that “_entirely changes the aspect of the case_”. The evidence submitted by the Plaintiff were namely the following:

> (a)     An email from the Plaintiff to “_\[redacted\]@gmail.com_” (“**Dayang Email Address**”) dated 4 June 2019 apparently recounting a conversation which the Plaintiff had with “_Leslie_”, where “_Leslie_” had confirmed that the Plaintiff had “_continuous travel approval_” and that it was not necessary for the Plaintiff to furnish any evidence as “\[Leslie’s\] _higher management are aware that_ \[the Plaintiff does\] _not live in Singapore and have meetings all around the world_”;[^23]

> (b)     An email from the Plaintiff to the Dayang Email Address dated 30 June 2019 apparently containing the Plaintiff’s “_monthly report for JUNE 2019_”, which included an “_Observation_” made by the Plaintiff that “_Leslie is not my Supervision Officer; I suspect corruption and multiple breaches in protocol._”[^24]

> “_Leslie_” refers to Mr. Lee Yong Sin (Leslie), a CNB officer who had contact with the Plaintiff during the material period in mid-2019.[^25]

> (c)     A document titled “_Affidavit of Dayang Johari_” dated 30 November 2021 which purported to provide confirmation from one “_Dayang Johari_” acting on behalf of a “_Johari Family_”, that the Plaintiff was “_working with_ \[Dayang Johari\] _under Military Special Ops – Intelligence_”. Although the document purported to be an affidavit made by “_Dayang Johari_”, it did not bear the signature of its purported maker and was not affirmed or sworn before a commissioner for oaths. Instead, it only bore a stamp which showed an eagle-shaped logo with the words “_Johari Family_”.[^26]

> (d)     An email from the Plaintiff to “_lindycameron@dfid.gov.uk_” dated 13 December 2021 (and copied to various others) attaching a “_handover letter_” purportedly from one “_Timothy Gibbons Cameron_”, who appeared in that letter to be announcing his retirement and purporting to hand over his work in the “_International_ \[Communication\] _Operations_” to the Plaintiff.[^27]

57     The most I was able gather from the documents submitted by the Plaintiff, as supplemented by the Plaintiff through oral submissions before me, was that the Plaintiff was working for military intelligence and had, in that capacity, investigated suspected corruption and/or breach of protocol by certain CNB officers.

58     As the Defendant’s counsel pointed out, the origin and authenticity of some of the documents relied on by the Plaintiff were suspect, as they did not bear the signature of their maker(s).[^28] I agreed and had similar reservations.

59     Further, _even if_ I were to take the documents at their face value, they only went so far as to show that the Plaintiff as a military intelligence officer had _suspected_ corruption and/or breach of protocol on the part of certain CNB officers_, without any objective evidence_ of the alleged corruption. The Plaintiff’s own self-serving suspicion as evidenced only in the emails which she had composed cannot constitute “_new evidence_” that “_entirely changes the aspect_” of the Suit.

60     Further, even the “_suspicion_” raised by the Plaintiff related _only_ to the conduct of the CNB officers _at the material time in June and July 2019_ and was clearly available to the Plaintiff at the time of the Criminal Proceedings. There was no evidence that the testimonies given by the CNB officers or any other witnesses at the Criminal Proceedings _in March 2021_ was in any way procured or tainted by “_corruption_”.

61     Accordingly, I was not convinced that the Plaintiff’s reason for commencing this Suit justified a collateral challenge on the decision in the Criminal Proceedings.

#### Conclusion on the Abuse of Process Issue

62     In view of the foregoing, I found that the commencement and continuation of the Suit constituted an abusive collateral attack on the decision in the Criminal Proceedings, and accordingly ordered that the Suit be struck out in its entirety.

## Issue 2: The Frivolous/Vexatious Issue

63     Given my finding on the Abuse of Process Issue, it was not necessary for me to determine the Frivolous/Vexatious Issue. Indeed, the Frivolous/Vexatious Issue was not the focus of the oral submissions before me. I would therefore only limit myself to the following brief observations.

64     First, in the absence of the prior Criminal Proceedings (which is a hypothetical assumption quite devoid of meaning given what in fact transpired), I would not have been inclined to strike out the Suit on the basis that it was doomed to fail. Although the Defendant submitted documentary evidence which suggested that the approval granted to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019 was not a “_continuous_” approval, these documentary evidence all post-date 4 June 2019 and therefore could not directly evidence the contents of the communication made to the Plaintiff on 4 June 2019. While the subsequent correspondence might be helpful in shedding light on the contents of the communication on 4 June 2019, it did not mean that the Plaintiff’s case was doomed to fail or plainly unsustainable at this stage.

65     Second, I would similarly not have been inclined to strike out the Suit on the basis of the Plaintiff’s changing positions as to whether she wished to continue with the Suit (and if so in what manner). Quite apart from the reason given by the Plaintiff for the changing positions (i.e. the Plaintiff was receiving changing and/or conflicting instructions from her “_bosses_”), I considered it the Plaintiff’s prerogative to decide if and how she wished to continue with the proceedings. Short of an estoppel arising (which was not alleged by the Defendant), I did not see how communicating such intentions to the Defendant and subsequently resiling from it from time to time (as the Plaintiff had done in this case) rendered the Suit liable to be struck out. I did not consider the nature and frequency of such communications sufficient to warrant the drastic measure of a striking out in this case.

66     Lastly, I would add that I had some difficulties understanding what exactly was the conduct on the part of the Defendant which was said to have constituted a breach of duty. If the Plaintiff’s case was that the Defendant _did_ give continuous travel approval to her on 4 June 2019 which permitted her to travel on 4 July 2019, and it was not alleged that the granting of such approval was in itself wrongful, then what duty has the Defendant breached and how? Given my findings on the Abuse of Process Issue, it was not necessary for me to ponder on this further and I would refrain from doing so, especially given that the Defendant did not raise this potential pleading deficiency and the matter was not explored in any degree of detail before me.

## Conclusion

67     For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff’s claim in this Suit was struck out as an abuse of process.

68     Parties have been directed to file written submissions on the issue of costs. I will give my decision on costs after having considered these submissions.
