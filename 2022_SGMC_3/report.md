### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to three charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.

2       He argued that he had only fetched Song Luping for the airport, medical check-up, Ministry of Manpower, and Cheng Seng Motor, as a favour to his busy friend, one “Quan Quan”. The Defence described the Accused as a Good Samaritan.

3       All things considered, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. He was convicted on all the charges.

4       The Accused was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $28,000 i/d 10 weeks’ imprisonment. Under s 23A of the EFMA, he was ordered to pay $20,800 i/d 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

5       I set out my reasons.

## Charges and legal context

6       The Accused faced three charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap. 91A)(“EFMA”):

> You, Ng Han Bee, are charged that you, sometime in January 2019, in Singapore or elsewhere, did receive directly from one Song Luping, a sum of $12,000 via WeChat app as consideration for her employment as a sales executive under Cheng Seng Motor (UEN: 05502800D), and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act Chapter 91A (2009 Rev Ed), punishable under section 22A(2) of the same Act.[^1]

> You, Ng Han Bee, are charged that you, sometime in December 2018, in Singapore, did engage in a conspiracy with Chia Siew Boon Matthew (“Chia”), the sole proprietor of Cheng Seng Motor, to obtain a Work Pass for a foreign employee, Song Luping (“Song”), to work for Cheng Seng Motor, a trade or business that did not require the employment of such a foreign employee and failed to employ her, to wit, and in pursuance of that conspiracy, an act took place on 9 January 2019, to wit, Chia applied for an S Pass for Song to work as a sales executive for Cheng Seng Motor, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment; and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22B(1) read with section 23(1) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Chapter 91A, and punishable under section 22B(1) of the same Act.[^2]

> You, Ng Han Bee, are charged that you, sometime in February 2019, in Singapore, did receive directly from one Song Luping, a sum of $12,600 as a condition for her employment as a sales executive under Cheng Seng Motor, to wit, you collected the said sum from Song Luping through an online app called we-chat and the said payment was made in order for her to hold on to the work pass as a sales executive under Cheng Seng Motor and free-lanced as a performing artiste around Singapore and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22A(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A) (2009 Rev Ed), punishable under section 22A(2) of the same Act.[^3]

7       During the trial, the Prosecution amended the three charges. Section 131 of the Criminal Procedure Code was engaged. Both the Prosecution and the Defence declined to recall any witnesses.[^4]

## Agreed statement of facts

8       Sometime before 9 January 2019, the Accused introduced Song Luping (“Song”)[^5] of the People’s Republic of China to Chia Siew Boon Matthew[^6] (“Chia”)[^7].[^8]

9       Chia was trading as Cheng Seng Motor (UEN: 05502800D) with a registered address at 1 Kaki Bukit Avenue 6, #01-49, Autobay @ Kaki Bukit, Singapore 417883.[^9]

10     On 9 January 2019, Chia made an S Pass application for Song to work as a sales executive with Cheng Seng Motor through his employment agent Multi lnternational Employment Pte. Ltd. (EA Licence No. 07C4004).[^10]

11     On 18 January 2019, Song’s S Pass application was approved and an in-principle approval was issued to Song. A copy of the in-principle approval dated 18 January 2019 is at Annex A of the Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”).[^11]

12     On 29 January 2019, Song arrived in Singapore. On 1 February 2019, Song underwent the required Medical at MCR Clinic Pte. Ltd. (UEN: 201430682D) at 633 Veerasamy Road #01-118 Singapore 200633.[^12]

13     Subsequently, on 8 February 2019, Song signed a declaration form stating that the information in her application for an S Pass is true and correct. Chia also signed the declaration form on the same day as director of Cheng Seng Motor. A copy of the signed declaration form dated 8 February 2019 is at Annex B of the ASOF. The Accused received from Song, through WeChat, at least $24,000 in two instalments, sometime in January 2019 and February 2019 respectively.[^13]

14     However, Song was never employed under Cheng Seng Motor because the business did not require her as a Sales Executive. Song did not perform any work for Cheng Seng Motor. Song showed up at the premises of Cheng Seng Motor and posed for a few photographs of her pretending to work at Cheng Seng Motor.[^14]

15     Instead, from 8 February 2019 to sometime in April 2019, Song freelanced as a Performing Artiste at various night clubs around Singapore.[^15]

16     On 9 September 2021, Song pleaded guilty to one charge under s 10(1) and punishable under s 10(2)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”), with one charge under s 22(1)(d) EFMA being taken into consideration for sentencing. She was fined $6,000 (i/d three weeks’ imprisonment) on the same day. The charges and statement of facts pertaining to her guilty plea are at Annex C of the ASOF.[^16]

17     On 20 May 2021, Chia pleaded guilty to one charge under s 22B(1) EFMA and one charge under s 22A(1)(a) EFMA. One charge under s 22A(1)(b) was taken into consideration for sentencing. Chia was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment with a $3,000 penalty for the charge under s 22B(1) EFMA and a fine of $11,000 (i/d four weeks’ imprisonment) for the charge under s 22A(l)(a) of the EFMA. The charges and statement of facts pertaining to his guilty plea are at Annex D of the ASOF.[^17]

## Prosecution’s case

18     The Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Chia to obtain an S pass for Song in relation to Cheng Seng Motor without her actually working for the company.[^18] The Accused received $24,600 from Song.

## Defence’s case

19     The Accused had only fetched Song for the airport, medical check-up, Ministry of Manpower, and Cheng Seng Motor, as a favour to his busy friend, one “Quan Quan”.[^19] The Accused was not paid.[^20] Essentially, the Accused was a Good Samaritan.

20     There was no written agreement between the Accused and Song. Song did not have the records of her WeChat communication with the Accused.[^21]

21     The Accused is not an employment agent; he is an assistant at pubs.

## Issues to be determined

22     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     What was the sum of $24,600 used for (‘Issue 1’);

> (b)     What was the provenance of the educational certificate for the S pass application (‘Issue 2’);

> (c)     What were the Accused’s role and interaction with Song Luping (‘Issue 3’); and

> (d)     Why were photographs of Song Luping taken at Cheng Seng Motor (‘Issue 4’).

## Issue 1: What was the sum of $24,600 used for?

23     It was undisputed that the Accused received from Song at least $24,000. The ASOF stated that:

> The Accused received from Song, through WeChat, at least $24,000 in two instalments, sometime in January 2019 and February 2019 respectively.[^22]

24     Song testified that they agreed that she would pay the Accused, who would then ready the S pass for her to work in Singapore as a singer.[^23] The Accused told Song that she did not have to report to the office, i.e. Cheng Seng Motor.[^24] Song did not know whether the money would be paid to Chia for Cheng Seng Motor.[^25]

25     The Accused changed his testimony on how much of Song’s money remained in his WeChat account. During his examination-in-chief, he said that he still had _$18,000_, which was $24,000[^26] from Song minus $6,000 (_viz._ $2,000 per month for 3 months) that he had handed to Chia.[^27] However, in cross-examination, he claimed that he only had _$15,000_, which was $24,000 - $6,000 - $3,000, with the $3,000 given to the employment agent.[^28]

26     Notably, this $3,000 was not mentioned at all during his examination-in-chief. The Accused also produced no documentary evidence pertaining to this $3,000.[^29]

27     After sifting the Accused’s testimony, there remained many unanswered questions about the money that the Accused had asked Song to transfer to his WeChat account. First, why did the Accused hold onto a fairly large sum of money? As the money had been transferred to him in January and February 2019,[^30] he had kept the money for close to three years.[^31] This cast doubt on his claim that he had not benefitted financially in helping Song to find employment in Singapore.

28     Second, the Accused was alive to the suspicious financial arrangement. For example, why did the Accused have to transfer $2,000 every month for Song to Chia?[^32] If Song was indeed Chia’s employee, why would the employee have to pay the employer?

29     On a related note, why did Song transfer the money to the Accused and not directly to Chia? The Accused claimed that Song did so because she could only transfer money using WeChat as Song did not know Chia and she was in China.[^33]

30     I did not accept the Accused’s claim because Song came to Singapore and met Chia, and Song would be able to hand the money directly to Chia. Furthermore, the money was not handed to Chia in a lump sum; instead, the Accused said that he handed some money to Chia over a few months (i.e. when Song was _already_ in Singapore).[^34] And Song had transferred $12,600 to the Accused _after_ she had landed in Singapore.[^35] The above points militated in favour of the conclusion that the Accused was Song’s employment agent and played an integral role in the criminal machination.

31     Third, the numbers do not appear to add up. For example, the Accused claimed that he had handed $6,000 (_viz._ $2,000 _per month_ for 3 months) to Chia; however, this differed from his Defence Counsel’s cross-examination of Song that it was supposed to be $2,000 every _2 months_.[^36] Furthermore, at a rate of $2000 per month, the $24,000 would run out in 12 months, and would not last for 24 months.

32     What was the total sum that Song transferred to the Accused via WeChat? The Accused claimed that the total sum was $24,000.[^37] I did not accept this. I accepted Song’s evidence – she testified that it was $24,600: $24,000 plus an additional $600 that was used for an educational certificate.[^38] Next, we turn to examining the provenance of the educational certificate.

## Issue 2: Provenance of the educational certificate for the S pass application?

33     The details of the educational certificate for Song’s S pass application were as follows:[^39]

> Country of Awarding Body/Institution/University: CHINA

> Name of Awarding Body/Institution/University: GUANGDONG TRADE VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL

> Main Campus or Affiliating College Attended: -

> Qualification: VOCATIONAL EDUCATION CERTIFICATE OF GRADUATION

> Faculty: BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

> Mode of study: FULL-TIME

> Period of study: 01 SEP 2007 to 01 JUL 2010

34     I accepted Song’s testimony that it was the Accused who had told her to get the educational certificate;[^40] Song’s evidence on this was unchallenged during cross-examination: the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 as analysed in the Court of Appeal cases of _Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 771</span> at \[66\] and _Asnah Bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> at \[115\] (see also Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 2013), at \[20.96\]). Song also said that she did not graduate from the said school.[^41]

35     I did not accept the Accused’s evidence that Song had sent him the educational certificate and that he had played no part in helping her to obtain this educational certificate.[^42]

## Issue 3: Accused’s Role and Interaction with Song Luping?

36     It was undisputed that the Accused:

> (a)     Met Song at a steamboat dinner in Singapore in late 2018, where Song told the Accused that she wanted to work in Singapore,

> (b)     Exchanged WeChat messages on Song’s employment in Singapore,

> (c)     Met Song at the airport and brought her to Tiong Bahru on 29 January 2019,[^43]

> (d)     Brought Song on 1 February 2019[^44] for her medical check-up,

> (e)     Brought Song to the Ministry of Manpower, and

> (f)     Brought Song to Cheng Seng Motor.

37     The Accused claimed that he had only fetched Song for the airport, medical check-up, Ministry of Manpower, and Cheng Seng Motor, as a favour to his busy friend, one “Quan Quan”.[^45] Essentially, the Accused was a Good Samaritan.

38     I did not accept this. In my judgment, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Chia to obtain an S pass for Song in relation to Cheng Seng Motor without her actually working for the company. The Accused was the employment agent for Song. That is why the Accused brought her to and fro for many places, including Changi airport, her medical check-up, Ministry of Manpower, and Cheng Seng Motor.[^46] These trips took place on different days.

39     I accepted Song’s testimony on the Accused’s interaction with her and his role in obtaining her S pass for Cheng Seng Motor. We will proceed chronologically.

##### Accused’s Discussion with Song at Jalan Sultan’s Steamboat Place

40     The Accused met Song along with 1 to 2 friends at a steamboat place at Jalan Sultan.[^47] This was in late 2018 when Song was due to return to China.[^48] The Accused was known to some people as “Andy” while Song called him “Ke Ai Ge”.[^49] Song did not know much about the Accused but she knew that he was an agent who could help with her work pass application.[^50]

41     Prior to this meeting, the Accused and Song had WeChat discussions on Song wanting an S Pass to work as a singer in Singapore.[^51] At the steamboat place, Song again told the Accused that she wanted an S Pass to work as a singer in Singapore.[^52] They discussed how much it would cost to apply for an S Pass and how long it would take for such a pass to be issued to Song.[^53]

42     The Accused claimed that Song wanted to find an office job to be an administrative clerk.[^54] I did not accept the Accused’s claim, which was denied by Song. It was undisputed that:

> (a)     The Accused did not ask Song about her desired salary, expected working hours or the type or size of company she wanted to work for,[^55] and

> (b)     Chia did not ask the Accused about Song’s qualifications or her expected working hours.[^56]

##### Upon Arrival in Singapore

43     The Accused met Song at the airport on 29 January 2019.[^57] Song testified that the Accused fetched her from the airport as her agent.[^58] He then brought her to Tiong Bahru.[^59]

##### Medical Check-Up

44     The Accused brought Song for her medical check-up on 1 February 2019.[^60] This medical check-up took place at MCR Clinic Pte. Ltd. at 633 Veerasamy Road, #01-118, Singapore 200633.[^61]

##### Ministry of Manpower

45     The Accused, as Song’s agent, brought her to the Ministry of Manpower to take photographs and collect the pass.[^62]

##### Cheng Seng Motor

46     The Accused brought Song to Cheng Seng Motor.[^63] The Accused took photographs of Song at Cheng Seng Motor.[^64]

47     I accepted Chia’s evidence. Chia testified that both the Accused and Chia birthed the idea to apply for an S pass for Song in relation to Cheng Seng Motor without her actually working for the company.[^65] Chia’s testimony that this idea was from both of them was unchallenged during cross-examination.[^66] Chia testified that he did not intend to employ Song as a sales executive at Cheng Seng Motor.[^67]

48     According to Chia’s evidence:

> (a)     Chia knew Song through the Accused who recommended her to Cheng Seng Motor in December 2018.[^68]

> (b)     The Accused brought Song in, settled all the paperwork, and was in charge of making the arrangements.[^69]

> (c)     The Accused handed the Declaration Form[^70] to Chia.[^71]

> (d)     The Accused brought Song to Cheng Seng Motor, where Chia only met her once in the office.[^72] Song came into the office for her to know who was the Boss, _viz._ Chia.[^73]

## Issue 4: Why were photographs of Song Luping taken at Cheng Seng Motor?

49     It was undisputed that the Accused took photographs of Song at Cheng Seng Motor.[^74] The ASOF stated that:

> Song showed up at the premises of Cheng Seng Motor and posed for a few photographs of her pretending to work at Cheng Seng Motor.”[^75]

50     The Accused claimed that Song requested him to take photographs of her at Cheng Seng Motor.[^76] I did not accept this. I accepted Song’s evidence – she testified that she did not ask him to take these photographs.[^77] Instead, it was the Accused who let her sit there and took a few photos.[^78] Song did not know the purpose of these photographs that were taken by the Accused.[^79]

51     Song stated that her handphone can be seen on the table in the photographs,[^80] which should have been taken using the Accused’s handphone;[^81] Song’s evidence on this was unchallenged during cross-examination.[^82] While the Accused later claimed that Song had two handphones, this had likewise not been asked of Song during her cross-examination.[^83]

52     In my judgment, the purpose of the photographs was to create a false impression that Song was generally working at Cheng Seng Motor.[^84]

## Impeachment

### The Law for impeachment

53     Guidance on the scope and relevance of an impeachment exercise can be found in _Osman Bin Ramli v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 959</span> at \[29\] to \[32\]:

> (a)     First, “innocent” discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies.

> (b)     Second, the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions in his evidence. “Serious discrepancies” or “material contradictions” are those that go to the crux of the charge against the accused person.

> (c)     Third, even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded.

54     The credit of the witness is impeached upon the inconsistent former statement being proved, _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[22\].

### Statement to the Ministry of Manpower

55     In the present case, the Prosecution sought to impeach Mr Desmond Chan Chee Chuen’s (“Chan”)[^85] credit on portions of his statement[^86] to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) and his testimony in court under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act. The Prosecution succeeded in doing so. I shall analyse the two portions of Chan’s statement which were highlighted by the Prosecution in court, against his testimony.

56     In court, Chan testified that he had told the Accused to fetch Song from the airport when she arrived in Singapore.

57     However, Chan’s statement[^87] to the MOM stated as follows:

> Q7:    Did you ask Andy to fetch Song Luping from the airport when she arrived in Singapore?

> A7:     No, I never ask Andy to fetch Song Luping from airport because I did not even know who is Song Luping and I did not even know when she would arrive in Singapore.

> \[emphasis added\]

58     Chan also testified that he had told the Accused to fetch Song to MOM for fingerprinting.

59     However, Chan’s statement[^88] to the MOM stated as follows:

> Q10:  Did you ask Andy to bring Song Luping to MOM for fingerprinting?

> A10:   No, because this has nothing to do with me selling insurance.

> \[Emphasis added\]

60     With regard to the discrepancies, Chan said that during the statement recording, he could not recall whether he had told the Accused to fetch Song from the airport and also to bring her to MOM for fingerprinting. Chan explained that he was given very short notice of about 2 to 3 days to appear at MOM for his interview. Chan replied to the recorder’s questions to the best of his knowledge. As this case took place years ago, Chan only remembered that he had told the Accused to fetch Song from the airport when Chan went through some documents in his emails or text messages.

61     Chan added that it was usually the employment agency’s responsibility to bring the employee to MOM for fingerprinting. However, as both Chan and Mr Koh Soon Heng, who worked at Multi lnternational Employment Pte. Ltd., were not free, Chan had asked the Accused to fetch Song to MOM.

62     In the present case, there were serious discrepancies that went to the crux of the charges: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[26\], and _Mohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[33\].  I was unable to accept Mr Chan’s explanation for the discrepancies for four reasons.

63     First, the following facts are undisputed: after the statement was recorded, it was read back to Chan who was also given a copy of the entire statement for him to check for errors. Chan amended the first page of his statement.

64     Second, if Chan could not recall whether he had told the Accused to fetch Song from the airport and to MOM, Chan could simply have told the recorder that he could not recall these details. He did not do so. This was not in keeping with other parts of his statement such as A4 and A5 where he explicitly told the recorder that he could not recall certain details.

65     Third, there was a ring of truth for Chan’s statement[^89] as he provided specific reasons as to why he did not ask the Accused to fetch Song from the airport or to MOM for fingerprinting. In this regard, Chan stated that he did not ask the Accused “to fetch Song Luping from (the) airport because (he) did not even know who is Song Luping and (he) did not even know when she would arrive in Singapore” [^90] Chan added that he did not ask the Accused to bring Song to MOM for fingerprinting “because this has nothing to do with (him) selling insurance”.[^91]

66     Fourth, Chan did not produce any of the documents that he claimed to have referred to such as emails or text messages to support his explanation.

67     In the circumstances, Chan’s credit was impeached. In my analysis of the impeachment application, I took into account the totality of the evidence tendered at trial: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[21\].

68     I was aware that even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it did not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence; the court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: _Osman Bin Ramli_ at \[32\].

69     In this regard, I accepted Chan’s testimony that he is a director of an insurance agency and that he is not employed by Multi International Employment Pte. Ltd. Chan’s testimony on his employment ran counter to the Accused’s testimony. The Accused had insisted that Chan (referred to as “Quan Quan”) is an employee of Multi International Employment Pte. Ltd., as seen from the court transcripts:

> Q    And this Ms. Quan Quan is an employee of is a---is a employee of Multi International?

> A    Yes.[^92]

> …

> Q But you mentioned that your friend Quan Quan works for this company, right?

> A    Yes. [^93]

> …

> Q    So, Mr. Ng, your evidence is that you were also helping this person called “Quan Quan” who works at the Multi International Employment agency, am I correct?

> A    Yes.[^94]

> …

> Q    Okay, thank you. I’d just like to move on to another area, Mr. Ng. Earlier, you gave evidence in Court. You said that you felt your responsibility was towards him as a friend. Him, being Quan Quan from the employment agency.

> A    Yes, yes, yes. I said so.[^95]

70     Given that the Accused and Chan are friends who have met up every fortnight for several years, it was difficult to believe that the Accused did not know that Chan was not employed by Multi International Employment Pte. Ltd.. This is buttressed by the fact that in Chan’s statement to MOM, Chan stated that he had told the Accused that he “runs an insurance company” and “right from the beginning, (the Accused) already knew that (Chan is) selling insurance policies”.[^96]

## Verdict

71     Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on all the charges.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed punishment

72     The prescribed punishment for s 22B(1) of the EFMA is punishment with imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 months and not more than 2 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000.

73     The prescribed punishment for s 22A(1)(a) punishable under s 22A(2) of the EFMA is a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

74     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment set by Parliament: _Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 684</span> at \[44\] (Benny Tan, _Assessing the Effectiveness of Sentencing Guideline Judgments in Singapore Issued Post-March 2013 and A Guide to Constructing Frameworks_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1004</span> at \[46\]).

75     The court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence, _viz._ Completeness principle: _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[60\] and _Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 265</span> at \[152\]-\[154\].

### Antecedents

76     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

77     The Prosecution sought the following sentences:[^97]

> (a)      MAC 900323-2021: fine of $14,000;[^98]

> (b)      MAC 900324-2021: 7 months’ imprisonment;[^99] and

> (c)      MAC 900325-2021: fine of $14,000.[^100]

78     Under s 23A of the EFMA, the Prosecution also sought an order of $21,600 to be paid.[^101]

### Mitigation plea

79     The Defence sought the following sentences:

> (a)      MAC 900323-2021: fine of $10,000;

> (b)      MAC 900324-2021: 6 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)      MAC 900325-2021: fine of $10,000.[^102]

80     Under s 23A of the EFMA, the Defence also sought an order of $15,000 to be paid.[^103]

### Decision on sentence

81     The interplay of harm, culpability, mitigating and aggravating factors lends itself well to sentencing. While facts are the cornerstone, harm and culpability are the pillars on which we place the cross-beams of aggravating and mitigating factors.

82     Harm is a measure of the injury that has been caused to society by the commission of the offence: _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> at \[41\]. Harm may:

> (a)     Cleave into “physical harm” and “psychological harm” for maid abuse cases under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span> at \[70\]-\[72\] (see also _Public Prosecutor v Bong Sim Swan, Suzanna_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 82</span> at \[60\]-\[63\] and \[74\]-\[79\]);

> (b)     Include serious economic loss to the victim under s 17(1) of the Medical Registration Act: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1153</span> at \[69\]; and

> (c)     Include potential harm – consider if there was:

>> (i)       a sufficient likelihood of the harm arising, and

>> (ii)       the seriousness of the harm risked: _Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 682</span> at \[77(c)\] and _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ at \[67\].

83     I was mindful that in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the sentencing court should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 1005</span> at \[58\], _Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 144</span> at \[57\], and _Koo Kah Yee_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 261</span> at \[56\] (see also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Ed, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.3\] and \[4.5\]).

#### Legislative intent of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Amendment) Bill

84     In the Second Reading of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Amendment) Bill on 11 September 2012, the then-Acting Minister for Manpower, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin explained the objectives of the EFMA’s amendments as follows:

> …_Sir, the proposed amendments to the EFMA will enhance the Government's ability to ensure the integrity of our work pass framework. Recognising that EFMA contraventions range widely from administrative infringements to criminal offences, these amendments will introduce a calibrated and appropriate response to different types of contraventions. In totality, the changes will allow my Ministry to step up enforcement actions against errant employers, errant foreign workers and syndicates more expeditiously and effectively_, **_thereby enhancing deterrence against EFMA contraventions, which ultimately hurt Singaporeans_**.

> \[emphasis added\]

85     The EFMA’s legislative intent is to deter an abuse of the work pass regime by individuals such as the Accused.

86     General deterrence is the main sentencing consideration for offences under the EFMA. This is brought to sharper focus for offences under s 22A and s 22B of the EFMA, which were introduced via s 17 of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Amendment) Bill.[^104]

87     Culpability is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act: _Public Prosecutor v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span> at \[35\] (see Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) at \[4.5\]).

88     The sentencing court should prioritise substance over form and undertake a qualitative, fact-specific analysis as to how the offender has contributed and to what extent the offender is instrumental to the overall scheme: _Lau Wan Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 240</span> at \[85\]. For completeness, an offender who takes on a pivotal role in the scheme may be highly culpable, even if he or she is not the mastermind of the scheme (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[12.077\]; see for example, _Than Stenly Granida Purwanto v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 576</span> at \[17\]).

89     In the present case, both the Accused and Chia birthed the idea to apply for an S pass for Song in relation to Cheng Seng Motor without her actually working for the company. In other words, both the Accused and Chia were equally culpable.

90      Parity Principle. I was aware that the parity principle in sentencing between co-offenders urges that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. Put simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished: _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> at \[1\] and _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[112\].

91     What is crucial in applying the parity principle is not whether the accused feels aggrieved that a co-accused person has been treated more leniently, but whether the public, with knowledge of the various sentences, would perceive that the accused had suffered injustice. The parity principle rests on the need to preserve and protect public confidence in the administration of justice: _Chong Han Rui_ at \[47\] and _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[112\].

92     The parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair. But ultimately, what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case: _Chong Han Rui_ at \[52\].

93     In the present case, both the Accused and Chia were the masterminds. Chia had pleaded guilty. The Accused claimed trial. Although claiming trial is not an aggravating factor, no discount would be given to offenders such as the Accused who elect to claim trial.

94     Sentencing is ultimately an exercise in evaluative ethical judgment: _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[48\] (see Sir Anthony Hooper, _Sentencing: Art or Science_, <span class="citation">(2015) 27 SAcLJ 17</span>).

95      Personal Circumstances. The Accused alluded to the fact that being the sole bread-winner, his incarceration would bring hardship to the family.[^105]

96     However, personal circumstances such as financial difficulties and hardship caused to family by their incarceration have no mitigating value save in the most exceptional cases: _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[10\]-\[11\] and _Chua Ya Zi Sandy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 204</span> at \[11\]-\[14\]. Hardship to the family is a natural consequence when a family’s breadwinner decides to commit an offence and is imprisoned for it: _Kannan s/o Birasenggam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 15</span> at \[10\]. In the present case, I saw no cogent reasons to consider his personal financial and family circumstances as valid mitigating factors.

97      Claiming Trial. Although claiming trial is not an aggravating factor, no discount would be given to offenders who elect to claim trial: _Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 174</span> at \[21\] to \[22\] (see also _Kreetharan s/o Kathireson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 91</span> at \[37\]) (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[20.147\]).

98      Section 23A of the EFMA. I gave full weight to Song’s evidence that she had handed $24,600 to the Accused. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was appropriate to factor in the sum of $3,000 (_i.e._ the sum that the Accused had handed to Chia), which had already been disgorged from Chia.[^106] In addition, I took into account the $800 that had been paid to Chan for the insurance, which was supported by a receipt.[^107]

99     I had difficulty accepting the Accused’s claim that he paid $3,000 to an employment agency for two reasons. First, he did not mention this $3,000 at all during his examination-in-chief. Second, no documentary evidence was produced for this $3,000.[^108]

100    In the circumstances, under s 23A of the EFMA, I ordered the Accused to pay $20,800 (_viz._ $24,600 - $3,000[^109] - $800[^110]) i/d 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

101     Sentence. All things considered, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="35.82%"> <col width="64.18%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>MAC No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">900323 of 2021</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $14,000</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(i/d 5 weeks’ imprisonment)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">900324 of 2021</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">7 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">900325 of 2021</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $14,000</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(i/d 5 weeks’ imprisonment)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">7 months’ imprisonment</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">and fine of $28,000</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(i/d 10 weeks’ imprisonment)</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Under s 23A of the EFMA, $20,800 i/d 6 weeks’ imprisonment is to be paid</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

102     Totality Principle. The sentence is in line with both limbs of the totality principle: _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam_ (see _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 941</span> at \[150\] where the Court of Appeal considered that the sentence sought by the Prosecution would have violated both limbs of the totality principle).

103     Proportionality Principle. I kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[30\]. Under the proportionality principle, the sentence to be imposed must not only bear a reasonable proportion to the maximum prescribed penalty, but also to the gravity of the offence committed (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[06.091\]-\[06.093\]) (see also Ho Hsi Ming Shawn, _The Centrality of Proportionality: A Golden Thread in Sentencing_, Singapore Law Gazette (July 2020)).

## Conclusion

104    Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on all the charges.

105    He was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $28,000 i/d 10 weeks’ imprisonment. Under s 23A of the EFMA, he was ordered to pay $20,800 i/d 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

106    In closing, I am grateful for the hard work and submissions of both sides.
