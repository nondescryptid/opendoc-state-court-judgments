\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9154/2022/01.\]

31 August 2022

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       Lee Kia Yih, male/52 years old (hereinafter referred to as “the Offender”) pleaded guilty to the commission of various acts of harassment on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders. These were offences punishable under Section 28(2)(a) of the Moneylenders Act (Chapter 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”). He admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) in support of the five charges proceeded with and was convicted accordingly. He also admitted to the remaining four charges of assisting an unlicensed moneylender and consented to have them taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purposes of sentencing.

2       The Offender was sentenced to an imprisonment term of four months for each harassment offence. Two of the imprisonment sentences were ordered to run consecutively, as required by law under Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010. The remaining three sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The total sentence was eight months of imprisonment. He has filed an appeal against the sentence.

## Charges

3       The Charge in _DAC 907039 of 2021_ reads as follows:

> “You, Lee Kia Yih (Male / 52 years old), are charged that you, on 11 April 2021, at about 8.11 p.m., at Block 34 Marsiling Drive #XXX, Singapore 730034 (“the flat”), while acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender known as “Solomon”, did commit an act likely to cause alarm to the flat occupant, namely Qamaruddin Bin Yazid (“Qamaruddin”), in connection with a loan taken by Qamaruddin, _to wit_, by handing over one envelope containing a debtor note to Qamaruddin instructing him to contact an unlicensed moneylender known as “Ben” at XXX, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 28(2)(a) read with Section 28(3)(a) of the Moneylenders Act (Chapter 188, 2010 Rev Ed).”

4       The other four of the five proceeded charges of harassment committed on various days were framed in the same manner with differences in the methods of delivering the debtor notes.

## Summary of Facts

5       The Offender is a “debtor-turned-runner” who committed acts of harassments on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders. He did so by either leaving debtor notes at the borrower’s units or passing them to the occupants of the units. The five proceeded charges relate to acts of harassment committed on various days within the span of about two weeks between 1 and 12 April 2021.

6       The Offender had received several SMS (Short Messaging Service) advertisements regarding the provision of loans in January 2021. As he needed money, he responded to the advertisements and spoke to “Robin”, “Sam” and “Solomon”. He knew that they were unlicensed moneylenders (“UMLs”). He obtained loans of $1,000 from “Robin”, $800 from “Sam” and $400 from “Solomon”.

7       The Offender was unable to repay the loans he had taken from the UMLs. To pay off his debts, he agreed with the UMLs to deliver debtor notes to various units as instructed by the UMLs. In exchange, the UMLs would offset $50 per unit from the outstanding loan amounts owed to the respective UMLs.

## Antecedents

8       The Offender did not have any previous convictions.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

9       The State Prosecuting Officer submitted for a sentence of between four to seven months of imprisonment per charge and for only two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively as required by law. The suggested global sentence would be between 8 and 14 months of imprisonment.

### Mitigation plea

10     The Offender was unrepresented. He pleaded for a lenient sentence. He said that he resorted to borrowing from the UMLs as he had been “scammed by other people” and ended up in debt.

## Sentence

11     Causing harassment on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender is punishable under Section 28(2)(a) of the MLA which provides that:

> “(2)  Subject to subsection (3), any person who, acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender, commits or attempts to commit any of the acts specified in subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and –

>> (a)    shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall also be liable to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000”

Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment is a mandatory requirement.

12     The calibration of the appropriate sentence would have to account for the harm caused and the offender’s culpability that is based on the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the relevant sentencing factors.

### Guidance from High Court cases

13     The cases of _PP v Nelson Jeyaraj s/o Chandran_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1130</span> (“**_Nelson Jeyaraj_**”), _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> and _PP v Quek Li Hao_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 152</span> (“**_Quek Li Hao_**”) provided us with the relevant considerations in calibrating the appropriate sentences for UML harassment cases. The primary sentencing principle for such cases is Deterrence. This need for deterrence arises from the threats to public safety and security caused by acts of harassment committed by UMLs.

14     As observed in _Ho Sheng Yu Garreth v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 19</span> at \[137\], the primary sentencing consideration in such cases is that of deterrence:

> “The courts have noted Parliament’s implacable resolve to combat all manner of illegal moneylending activities. This has been emphatically manifested through a series of legislative changes that have robustly enhanced the punitive consequences of such offending conduct. The sentences meted out by the courts for moneylending offences have, to date, been severe, and are underpinned by the desire to signal that there will be no judicial tolerance for such conduct.”

### The Calibration of the Sentence

15     In passing the sentence, I had taken into account that the Offender had no criminal record and had pleaded guilty. I decided to impose an imprisonment term per charge at the lower end of the range that the Prosecution had submitted because the Offender had pleaded guilty at an early stage of the judicial proceedings and that he had no criminal antecedents.

16     The Prosecution’s suggested range of four to seven months of imprisonment is reasonable based on the benchmark sentences set in the High Court case of **_Nelson Jeyaraj_** by Justice Steven Chong (as he then was). The benchmark sentence of imprisonment of 12 months and 3 strokes of the cane where damage is caused was reiterated by Justice Tay Yong Kwang (as he then was) in the case of **_Quek Li Hao_**.

17     The facts of the present case are less egregious than the facts in **_Nelson Jeyaraj_** and **_Quek Li Hao_**. Therefore, a lower sentence per charge is justified in the circumstances. No caning was imposed as there was no damage or hurt caused. The Offender had committed the offences of harassment and assisting the UMLs in respect of a total of nine different units in the span of about 2 weeks between 30 March and 13 April 2021. A tabulation of the relevant details can be found in the Schedule of Offences prepared and tendered by the Prosecution.

18     The Offender claimed in mitigation that he was in need of money because he had been cheated and had to resort to borrowing money from UMLs. His attempt at blaming his acts of harassment on the unfortunate situation he was in after being “scammed by other people” suggested a lack of remorse for his actions. There was little mitigatory value in his claim.

## Conclusion

19     The global sentence of 8 months of imprisonment imposed in this case is to address the sentencing objectives of general and specific deterrence as presented by the facts and circumstances of this case. The total sentence covered five distinct offences of harassment with four other offences of assisting UMLs taken into consideration for sentencing.

20     The Offender’s application to defer his sentence to take effect and start from 14 September 2022 was granted. He is currently on bail pending his surrender to serve his sentence.
