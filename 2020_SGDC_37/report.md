Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Bail – Show cause hearing – Sections 104 and 107A Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 16/2019/01.\]

17 February 2020

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal filed by Woo Weng Yu Jordan (“the surety”) against a forfeiture order made against him.

2       On 14 March 2019, the surety executed a bail bond in the sum of $11,000 for the accused, Keith Chia Zhen Guang. The surety had stood bail for the release of the accused, whom the surety said was his friend, when the accused was arrested for failing to attend night court on 23 May 2018, 2 October 2018 and 27 February 2019 in answer to a total of 11 Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) charges against the accused.

3       Subsequently, the accused failed to attend night court again on 1 October 2019. Neither did the surety appear in court to explain the absence of the accused. The surety was therefore issued with a Notice to Surety to show cause as to why the full bail sum of $11,000 should not be forfeited against him.

4       On the day of the show cause hearing on 4 November 2019, the surety brought the accused to court to surrender as the charges against the accused were still outstanding.

5       After hearing from the surety, I then ordered a sum of $2,500 out of the total bail sum of $11,000 to be forfeited. This amounted to about 23% of the original bail sum. As per his request, I had allowed him to pay the sum in five equal instalments of $500 per month with the first payment due on the day of the show cause hearing and the last payment due on 2 March 2020.

6       The surety, being dissatisfied, has appealed against the forfeiture order made by me. He paid the initial first instalment of $500. He has yet to make payment for the balance sum of $2,000 pending the outcome of his appeal.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

### The accused and the surety

7       The accused faced collectively 12 charges prosecuted by LTA. They included:

> (i)     8 charges for failing to pay Electronic Road Pricing (“ERP”) pursuant to rule 7(1)(f) of the Road Traffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules 2015;

> (ii)     2 charges for parking pursuant to rules 22(b) and 22(f) Road Traffic Rules (Cap 276, R20, Rev Ed 1999);

> (iii)     1 charge for using and keeping of vehicle without licence pursuant to s15 of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”); and

> (iv)     1 charge for causing or permitting a vehicle to be used for which a valid licence was not in force pursuant to s29(1) of the RTA.

8       Additionally, the accused faced 11 counts of show cause for failing to attend night court at the first mention for 11 out of the 12 charges on 23 May 2018, 2 October 2018 and 27 February 2019 respectively. As a consequence, pursuant to s133(6) of the RTA, the accused would have to at the conclusion of the proceedings explain in court the reasons for his failure to attend court despite the notices being issued and served upon him to do so.

9       In addition, due to the accused’s non-attendance in the night court on the three occasions, warrant to arrest was issued against the accused for the said 11 charges with bail offered at $1000 with one surety for each charge. The total bail sum offered for the 11 charges was therefore set at $11,000.

10     On 14 March 2019, the accused was arrested by the Enforcement Division of LTA. On the same day, the surety stood bail for the sum of $11,000 for the accused. The surety signed a bail bond declaring that he would ensure the attendance of the accused in court until the proceedings relating to his existing charges have been disposed of. In the event of the accused’s default, the surety agreed to be bound and to have the said sum of $11,000 being forfeited to the Government of the Republic of Singapore.

11     At the same time, the surety understood, acknowledged and signed the “Acknowledgement of Duties as Bailor” form, which essentially stated the following:

> …

> I understand that:

>> (a)    Upon the custody of the accused being handed to me, it is my duty to ensure his/her punctual attendance at all dates and times prescribed in the bail form. In this regard, I will find out, in advance, all dates and times when his/her attendance in court or at the Police Station is required;

>> (b)    I am to ensure that the accused complies with all bail conditions, including the conditions that he/she does not leave Singapore unless he/she has obtained permission from the court or Investigation Officer (IO) in-charge of the case (whichever is applicable) I will remain in constant contact with the accused and be aware of his/her movement so as to ensure his/her compliance;

>> (c)    If the accused is taken ill on a court date, I should ensure that the accused consult a doctor immediately and obtain a medical certificate stating that he/she is not fit to attend court. Where the accused has obtained such a medical certificate, I will attend court on the accused’s behalf to inform the court of his/her condition and tender the medical certificate to the judge.

>> (d)    Similarly, in cases where the accused is unable to report for bail at the Police Station because he/she has taken ill, I will inform the IO in-charge of the case of the accused’s medical condition and furnish the medical certificate as proof.

> I am aware that my duties as bailor will continue until the proceedings are finally concluded by the court or until I am formally discharged as bailor.

> I am aware that standing bail is a serious responsibility not to be undertaken lightly. I hereby declare that I will faithfully discharge my duties as a bailor, and I will forfeit to the State the bail sum of $11,000 should I fail in performing my duties as bailor.

> I also declared that I am a person of means and that I have personal assets worth at least that sum. In the event of forfeiture, I acknowledge that I am liable to the maximum term of six months imprisonment in the event that I am unable to make full payment of the sum forfeited.

> …

12     Unfortunately, for the surety, the accused did not attend night court again on 1 October 2019. In the circumstances, a Notice to Surety was sent to the surety directing him to pay the said penalty of $11,000 or to appear in court on 4 November 2019 to show cause why the bond should not be forfeited and payment of the said sum should not be enforced against him.

### Show cause hearing

13     At the show cause hearing on 4 November 2019, as mentioned earlier, the surety brought the accused to court to surrender in answer to the outstanding LTA charges.

14     By obtaining the cooperation of the accused, the surety hoped that the court would consider this as a mitigating factor and not forfeit the entire bail sum of $11,000.

15     The surety explained that the accused had failed to turn up in court on 1 October 2019 because of the accused’s work commitments. This was despite the fact that the surety had reminded the accused repeatedly to attend court prior to his court date.

16     In mitigation, the surety pleaded for leniency as he was not a man of means and was only attempting to help the accused by agreeing to be his bailor. He was an employee and received his salary at the end of each month. If too large a sum were to be forfeited, he would be faced with financial hardship.

## PRINCIPLES GOVERNING BAIL FORFEITURE

### Duties of a surety

17     Section 104(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code \[Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012\] (“CPC”) sets out the duties of a surety as follows:

> **Duties of surety**

> **104.—(1**)    A surety must —

>> (a)    ensure that the released person surrenders to custody, or makes himself available for investigations or attends court on the day and at the time and place appointed for him to do so;

>> (b)    keep in daily communication with the released person and lodge a police report within 24 hours of losing contact with him; and

>> (c)    ensure that the released person is within Singapore unless the released person has been permitted by the police officer referred to in section 92 or 93 (as the case may be) or the court to leave Singapore.

### Procedure for forfeiture of bonds with sureties

18     Since 21 June 2019, section 107A of the CPC states the procedure for forfeiture of bonds with sureties as follows:

> **Procedure for forfeiture of bond with sureties**

> **107A.—(1**)    This section provides for the forfeiture of the following bonds:

>> (a)    a bond with one or more sureties;

>> (b)    a bond with sureties to keep the peace;

>> (c)    a bond with sureties for good behaviour.

> (2)    If it is proved to a court’s satisfaction that —

>> (a)    the released person for whose appearance a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(_a_) was executed has, without _reasonable excuse_, failed to comply with any duty imposed on the released person to surrender to custody, to be available for investigations, or to attend court on the day and at the time and place appointed for the released person to do so;

>> (b)    the person bound by a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(_b_) has, without reasonable excuse, failed to keep the peace; or

>> (c) the person bound by a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(_c_) has failed to be of good behaviour,

> the court —

>> (d)    must record the basis of such proof;

>> (e)    must forfeit the bond, as far as it relates to the relevant person;

>> (f)    may summon before the court each person bound by the bond;

>> (g)    may call upon each surety bound by the bond to explain why the bond, as far as it relates to that surety, should not be forfeited; and

>> (h)    may call upon the relevant person to pay a sum, being the whole or any part of the amount of the bond, or to explain why the relevant person should not pay that sum.

> (3)    If the explanation given by a surety is _inadequate_, and it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that —

>> (a)    in relation to a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(_a_), the surety is in breach of any of the surety’s duties mentioned in section 104;

>> (b)    in relation to a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(_b_), the surety has, without reasonable excuse, failed to ensure that the relevant person keeps the peace; or

>> (c)    in relation to a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(_c_), the surety has, without reasonable excuse, failed to ensure that the relevant person is of good behaviour,

> the court —

>> (d)    must record the basis of such proof; and

>> (e)    may, having regard to all the circumstances of the case —

>>> (i)    forfeit the whole or any part of the amount of the bond, as far as it relates to the surety; and

>>> (ii)   order the surety to pay the amount forfeited.

> (4)    The court may order that any sum or amount mentioned in subsection (2)(_h_) or (3)(_e_) be paid by instalments. \[emphasis added\]

19     Section 107A(13) defines “relevant person” to mean:

> (a)     the released person for whose appearance a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(a) is executed;

> (b)     the person bound by a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(b); or

> (c)     the person bound by a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(c).

### Nature of the duties of a surety

20     It is perhaps trite law that the obligations of a surety is of utmost importance and any breach of such obligations is very likely to lead to consequences. As observed by Yong Pung How CJ in _PP v. Ram Ghanshamdas Mahtani_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR 517</span> (“_Ghanshamdas Mahtani”)_ at \[4\]:

> It has often been emphasised by the courts that the obligation which comes with standing bail for an accused is not merely a moral one, but has serious legal consequences attached with it. The bailor undertakes real risks, when an accused fails to surrender to his bail.

21     Hence, it cannot be overemphasized that standing bail for someone is a serious responsibility and should never be taken lightly. The potentially bailors must be aware of such consequences before they agree to voluntarily become sureties. This is so even for less serious offences like regulatory offences brought about by prosecuting agencies like LTA for parking and ERP violations, as the bail amount can still be significant.

22     In the more recent High Court decision of _Cher Ting Ting v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 13</span> (“_Cher Ting Ting”)_, which was decided before s107A of the CPC was in force, Chan Seng Onn J laid down a two-stage analytical framework for the courts to determine whether a surety’s bond should be forfeited and if so, the extent of the forfeiture amount. At \[67\], Chan J provided a summary of the approach that may be taken in determining whether forfeiture is appropriate:

> Without derogation from or qualification of the principles that I have described in the preceding paragraphs, the following is a summary of the approach that may be taken in determining whether forfeiture is appropriate:

>> (a)    The court should first consider whether the surety has shown sufficient cause against forfeiture. The key consideration is whether the surety exercised reasonable due diligence in the discharge of his duties as surety. It is for the surety to lay before the court evidence of want of culpability. This is an intensely fact-specific inquiry and the court should have regard to all the circumstances in making its finding.

>> (b)    If the surety satisfies the court that sufficient cause exists, then forfeiture may be waived altogether. But if the surety fails to do so, then the court must consider the extent to which forfeiture is appropriate. The starting point where the surety fails to show sufficient cause is forfeiture of the entire amount of the bond. The surety must demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances to justify any lesser degree of forfeiture; this is a heavy burden to discharge. The degree of culpability of the surety is a crucial consideration in the court’s assessment of the appropriate extent of forfeiture. The court should similarly have regard to all the circumstances (including any subsequent efforts made by the surety, between the date of the accused’s non-attendance in court and the date of the show cause hearing to locate or produce the accused in court) in determining, in the exercise of its discretion, the extent of forfeiture that would be fair and just.

23     In light of the new provision of s107A of the CPC, the two-stage analysis as laid out by Chan J is still applicable. In the first stage, the surety has to show “sufficient cause” for the non-forfeiture. Section 107A(2) states that firstly, it must be proven to the court’s satisfaction that the accused has “without reasonable excuse” failed to comply with any duty imposed on him e.g. to attend court. Next, pursuant to s107A(3) of the CPC, it must be proven to the court’s satisfaction that the explanation given by the surety was “inadequate”.

24     I first come to the ordinary meaning of the term “reasonable excuse”. According to English Oxford _Living_ Dictionaries, “excuse” means a reason or explanation to justify a fault or offence and “reasonable” means having sound judgment; fair and sensible. Read together, the literal meaning of the term means a sound, fair and sensible reason or explanation. Therefore, it cannot be any or a mere explanation by the accused.

25     Following from there, whether or not an excuse by an accused is reasonable has to be determined in light of the particular facts and circumstances of an individual case. The excuse must in my view be fair, sound and sensible taking into account the overall facts of the case. I would add that in instances like failing to attend court by the accused is likely to result in very limited range of situations that can give rise to a “reasonable excuse” in view of the circumstances e.g. hospitalisation, valid medical certificate which excuses the accused from court attendance, incarceration, quarantine order.

26     I then come to the ordinary meaning of the word “inadequate”. According to the online _Cambridge Dictionary_, “inadequate” means not good enough or too low in quality. For an explanation to be “adequate”, it must be satisfactory in relation to a particular purpose.

27     In _Cher Ting Ting_, Chan J held at \[28\] that the key consideration in determining the existence of sufficient cause is whether the surety is able to show that he had _“exercised reasonable due diligence in the discharge of his duties as surety”._

28     Chan J further held at \[34\] that the burden of proof in satisfying the court that sufficient cause exists such that forfeiture should not take place lies with the surety. It is for the surety to lay before the court evidence of want of culpability.

29     As such, an explanation provided by a surety may be considered as “inadequate” if the surety is unable to show to the satisfaction of the court that he had exercised reasonable due diligence in the discharge of his duties based on the evidence presented before the court. If that is the conclusion reached by the court, then the court should proceed with the second stage of the analysis as outlined in _Cher Ting Ting_ by considering the extent to which the bond should be forfeited upon having due regard to the circumstances. The second stage is also consistent with s107A(3)(e) of the CPC.

30     With the new s107A of the CPC and the two-stage analytical framework as laid out in _Cher Ting Ting_ in mind, I proceeded to analyse the evidence and circumstances of the present case.

## REASONS FOR DECISION

### First stage: The surety has not shown sufficient cause against forfeiture

31     The accused did not provide a reasonable excuse for his failure to attend night court on 1 October 2019. According to the surety, the accused informed him that the accused was unable to attend court that day and on those previous occasions prior to being placed on bail because of his work commitments. This was a bare assertion made by the accused without any further proof (e.g. employer’s letter, work roster etc.) being adduced to the court by the surety that this was indeed the case.

32     Next, the surety has not proven or shown that he has exercised reasonable due diligence in the discharge of his duties as a bailor that the accused would turn up in night court for the hearing of his outstanding LTA charges.

33     The surety merely asserted that he had repeatedly reminded the accused to attend court but did not provide evidence as to how he did so or the efforts he had made to ensure the attendance of the accused in night court. This must be viewed particularly in light of the fact that the surety was acutely mindful that the accused had a tendency for not attending court when he stood bail for the accused. The accused had previously failed to attend night court not merely once but three times.

34     Given the profile of the accused, the surety knew or ought to have known that he must be more vigilant in order to secure the court attendances of the accused when he decided to stand bail for the latter. Moreover, being a friend and not an immediate family member of the accused, the surety knew or ought to have known that his task would have been made more difficult as he does not live with the accused or has daily contact with him.

35     Despite that, the surety merely relied on faith and trust alone that the accused would attend court diligently on his own accord. He had the mistaken belief that the accused, as his friend, would not jump bail so long as he reminded the accused to attend court.

36     It has been held in _Ghanshamdas Mahtani_ at \[6\] that mere reliance on faith alone, without more, was insufficient to discharge the onerous duty as a bailor in ensuring the court attendance of the accused.

37     After having a due consideration of all the circumstances, I was of the view that the explanation given by the surety was inadequate and unsatisfactory. In fact, he failed to demonstrate that he had fulfilled his duties of a surety with the required level of due diligence or that there was a want of culpability on his part based on the evidence presented before the court. I therefore proceeded to consider the extent to which the amount of the bond should be forfeited.

### 2nd stage: The appropriate extent to which the bond should be forfeited

38     As held in _Cher Ting Ting_, the starting point where the surety fails to show sufficient cause is forfeiture of the entire amount of the bond. The surety has a heavy burden to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances to justify any lesser degree of forfeiture.

39     The main consideration which I took into account was that the surety had taken the effort between the date of the accused’s non-attendance in court and the date of the show cause hearing to locate and produce the accused in court to surrender on the day of the show cause hearing. This, in my view, justified in favour of a reduction in the forfeiture amount.

40     In _Cher Ting Ting_, Chan J opined at \[62\] that if the accused’s eventual appearance in court and consequently leading to him being placed in custody was due to the efforts of the surety who had located the accused and secured his attendance, then there is good reason for the court to regard such effort as a factor weighing in favour of reduced forfeiture. At \[64\] Chan J added:

> In my view, where the surety can demonstrate that he made substantial efforts between the date of the accused’s non-attendance in court and the date of the show cause hearing to ascertain the reason for the accused’s absence or to locate and trace the accused’s whereabouts, so as to provide useful information to the court and the police to assist in the search for the accused, then the court may take these efforts into account at the second stage of the analysis in mitigating the surety’s earlier lack of due diligence in ensuring the accused’s attendance in court_. If the accused is successfully brought into custody either wholly or partly as a consequence of the surety’s substantial efforts to locate and/or apprehend the accused, that result should be regarded as an additional mitigating factor given that the surety had through the efforts on his part, managed to substantially remedy his earlier lack of due diligence._ \[emphasis added\]

41     Another factor I had considered was the financial circumstances and means of the surety. However, a surety’s lack of means, taken alone, will generally be an insufficient reason for a reduction in forfeiture. If the surety had signed for a sum of $11,000, he was expected to have at least the said amount since in the “Acknowledgement of Duties as the Bailor” form, the surety had declared that he was a person of means and that he had personal assets worth at least the bail amount stipulated.

42     Furthermore, in _Cher Ting Ting_, Chan J reiterated at \[56\]:

> …Such lack of means must amount to an exceptional circumstance warranting departure from the _prima facie_ position of full forfeiture. This is justified on the basis that (a) by executing his bond, the surety is taken to have represented that he is willing and able to shoulder the potential consequences of forfeiture; and (b) the system of bail will not perform its function effectively if the threat of forfeiture is illusory and easily eluded.

43     Having regard to all the circumstances before coming to a decision on the forfeiture amount, I was of the view that a fair and just amount to forfeit in this case was $2,500. This amount represented only about 23% (or less than 25%) of the original bail amount of $11,000 for the forfeiture of the bail bond.

44     Moreover, in past decisions where a surety had made efforts to ensure the accused’s subsequent arrest or attendance in court, the bail sum remitted was not greater than 50%: In _PP v Suhaili binti Rahmat_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 199</span>, the bail sum remitted was $5000 out of $10,000 ( i.e. forfeited 50%) and in _Sabri bin Suboh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 57</span>, the bail sum remitted was $1000 out of $5000 (i.e. forfeited 80%).

45     As such, I would add that I have been rather lenient in coming to my decision. This was especially since the surety was not even a next of kin of the accused, where there would have been a greater impetus for a family member to help bail another family member out from custody.

## CONCLUSION

46     To summarise, as aforementioned, the forfeiture order made against the surety in view of the fact that cause was not shown was as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="37.38%"> <col width="62.62%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>NS No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Forfeiture Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>900852-2019</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Amount of <b>$2,500</b> forfeited.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

47     As the surety wished to pay the forfeited sum by instalments, pursuant to s107A(4) of the CPC, I granted time for the surety to make payment accordingly. Payment was to be made in five equal instalments of $500 per month with the payment of the initial sum of $500 to be made forthwith and the remaining instalments to be paid on the second of each month until full payment is made (i.e. last instalment by 2 March 2020).

48     The surety has appealed on 4 November 2019 against the forfeiture order made against him.
