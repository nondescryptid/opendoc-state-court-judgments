3 July 2019

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part 1   Charges

1       The Accused appeared before me on 3 May 2019. At this stage, the Prosecution has tendered 62 counts of Cheating under section 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“s 417 PC charges”); and 29 counts of Forgery for the purpose of Cheating under section 468 of the same Code (“s 468 PC charges”).

2       The Prosecution proceeded with 15 counts of the s 417 charges. The proceeded charges were all similar in nature and they are reproduced in a tabular form at the end of the Statement of Facts (see \[10\] at pages 5-6 below).

## Part 2   Conviction, Charges Taken into Consideration, Sentence and Appeal

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (Exhibit P1) without qualification. I found her guilty and convicted her accordingly.

4       The Accused then admitted to all the remaining 47 counts of s 417 charges and 23 out of 29 counts of the s 468 charges. She also gave her consent for these admitted charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The Prosecution withdrew the remaining 6 counts of the s 468 charges and she was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on these 6 withdrawn charges.

5       In my deliberation on sentence, I have considered the Prosecution’s position on sentence (Exhibit P3); the Defence’s mitigation plea (Exhibit D1); and their respective oral arguments.

6       The individual sentences that I have imposed are set out in the table below:

7       I ordered four sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively (as indicated above in the table), making the global sentence 28 weeks’ imprisonment.

8       The Accused and the Prosecution were dissatisfied with the sentence imposed. Each of them has filed an appeal against sentence. Pending the hearing of the appeal in the High Court, I have granted the Defence’s application for the Accused to be released on bail.

9       In these Grounds of Decision, I shall first set out the facts of the case. I will then follow up with the reasons behind my decision to impose a total sentence of 28 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Part 3   Facts

10     The portions of the Statement of Facts which are pertinent to the commission of the offences by the Accused are reproduced in full below:

> FIRST INFORMATION REPORT

> 3.    On 13 December 2016 at about 5.51 pm, the complainant lodged a police report at Bedok Police Divisional HQ stating that Silver Bullion Pte Ltd had discovered that the accused had been making fictitious reimbursement claims by providing forged documents for non-existent transactions with other companies or with inflated figures in order to make reimbursement claims for payments that were made to other companies. The location was given as No. 20 Jalan Afifi, #03-02A, Singapore.

> BACKGROUND FACTS

> 4.    Since January 2014, the accused was employed by Silver Bullion Pte Ltd as a Marketing Manager for the Silver Bullion Group (“the Group”), which includes Silver Bullion Pte Ltd and The Safe House SG Pte Ltd. The Group was in the business of providing storage for precious metals. The accused’s responsibilities included designing and creation of marketing collaterals, overseeing marketing and advertising activities, and executing marketing / sales campaigns. As part of her job, she was allowed to either use Silver Bullion Pte Ltd / The Safe House SG Pte Ltd to make payments, or she could pay with her own money before obtaining reimbursement under either company.

> 5.    Sometime after 23 November 2016, the complainant found that the accused had made a total of $67,242 in reimbursement claims from Silver Bullion Pte Ltd and The Safe House SG Pte Ltd in the year 2016, which was a rather large sum of money that drew the complainant’s suspicion. Consequently, internal inquiries were conducted and the complainant subsequently lodged a police report.

> 6.    Since February 2015, the accused conceived of a scheme to cheat both Silver Bullion Pte Ltd and The Safe House SG Pte Ltd by forging documents (such as invoices) of either non-existent or inflated transactions with various suppliers, in order to deceive Silver Bullion Pte Ltd and The Safe House SG Pte Ltd into believing that she had paid for these transactions out of her own pocket, and that she should be reimbursed for them.

> 7.    In this manner, the accused obtained a total of 65 such reimbursements amounting to a total of SGD 75, 846.86 from February 2015 to November 2016. The total amount cheated was SGD 70, 367.24.

> 8.    On or about the dates specified below, the accused did cheat by deceiving either the Director of Silver Bullion Pte Ltd and The Safe House SG Pte Ltd, Gregersen Gregor Juergen, or the Manager of Safe House SG Pte Ltd, John Tay, by inducing them into believing that she was entitled to reimbursement for fictitious payments made to various suppliers, which the accused knew was false, and by such manner of deception, she dishonestly induced them into delivering the said amounts to her.

11     According to the Statement of Facts, the Accused has made full restitution, an amount which came up to $70,367.24

## Part 4   Sentence – Parties’ submissions and the Court’s decision

### A.   Applicable Sentencing Principles

12     In my judgment, general deterrence is applicable to this case. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender. Deterrence is generally not displaced as an applicable sentencing consideration even where an offender demonstrates that he was labouring under familial and financial hardships during the commission of the offence: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[24\] – \[25\], \[27\] and \[29\].

13     I also held the view that specific deterrence in sentencing was applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\].

### B.   Defence’s Sentencing Position – Seeking a fine

14     The Accused’s counsel made a passionate plea for a sentence of a fine per proceeded charge. Her counsel submitted that she “had familial and personal circumstances at the time that forced her to commit” these offences.

15     As the only child of two aged and sickly parents, the Accused had to pay for the expensive medical expenses incurred by her parents. Firstly, her father had a long-time battle with diabetes, and then with kidney failure. Her father had to be admitted to hospital almost every month, and the medical bills started to pile up. Secondly, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2016. She would spend time with her mother by accompanying her mother for treatment as well as helping her mother prepare for the treatments. She was one of the primary care-giver for her medically stricken parents. The period from June 2016 to February 2017 was particularly trying because she had to take care of two sick parents at the same time. After the death of her father in February 2017, she continued to be burdened with her mother’s care and medical bills. Counsel submitted that the Accused did not want her parents to worry about the mounting medical bills and hence committed these offences “under a misguided sense of filial piety”. In summary, counsel submitted that the Accused has committed these offences in order to raise funds for her parents’ medical bills; she did not enjoy any personal gain but she “may have had an indirect benefit because the bills of her parents were being paid for.”

16     Besides the emotional strain of caring for two sickly parents and having to foot the expensive medical bills, the Accused also faced a personal setback. In February 2016, her own engagement came to an end, and she lost her source of strength and support.

17     Counsel also highlighted that the Accused is a person of good character. Counsel referred to the character reference written by Mdm Lim Soke Ying who wrote “… Character-wise, I observe Amanda to be a polite lady who is respectful of others. Her altruistic behaviour has demonstrated her care for the needy when she participated in a few charity drives. … she’s a good lady with strong virtues and an upright character. She will continue to be a valuable member of the society. Let her passion and caring attitude continue to touch the hearts of the needy in the community.” Counsel has also provided several certificates of participation by the Accused in charity work.

18     Counsel referred to four case authorities, namely, _Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 258</span> (“_Goh Kah Heng_”), _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span>, _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> and _Seaward III Frederick Oliver v Public Prosecutor_ \[1994\] 3 SLR (R) 89, in support of his argument that in view of the strong mitigating factors, in particular that the Accused did not commit the offences for a personal gain, the court has the discretion to, and should, impose a fine for the each proceeded charge.

### C.   Section 417, PC – A custodial sentence was warranted

19     I was unable to agree with the Defence’s submissions that a fine for each proceeded charge would be an adequate punishment. My reasons were threefold.

20     Firstly, I was guided by the decision of Menon CJ in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (“_Gan Chai Bee_”). _Gan Chai Bee_ has provided “the proper approach for determining the aggregate sentence in cases involving multiple offences each of which, taken alone, may be a minor offence meriting only a light sentence, but when taken together, demonstrated a single course of criminal conduct.”

21     The first step of the sentencing analysis would be to determine the individual sentences for each proceeded charge. The second step of the sentencing analysis would be to consider the offending conduct in totality: see _Gan Chai Bee_ at \[31\] to \[40\].

22     In respect of the first step of the sentencing analysis, I first considered the case of _Soh Puay Luan v Public Prosecutor_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No. 383 of 1993, unreported) (“_Soh Puay Luan_”). In _Soh Puay Luan_, the appellant’s boyfriend had stolen a credit card. The appellant had made use of a credit card on two occasions to purchase two items of jewellery valued at $5,635 and $4,500 in order to help her boyfriend as he was then in financial difficulties. The appellant did not gain from her offences and made full restitution of the sums involved. The appellant pleaded guilty to two charges under s 417 PC and three other similar charges for the purposes of sentencing. The appellant had a clean record prior to the commission of these offences. On appeal, her sentences of three months’ imprisonment on each count (both to run concurrently) were substituted with a fine of $2,500 on each charge. _Soh Puay Luan’s_ case was discussed in _Wuu David v Public Prosecutor_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 83 at \[15\] and \[16\].

23     At first blush, it would appear that an argument could be made for a fine to be meted as a punishment to the s 417 PC charges faced by the Accused drawing an analogy to _Soh Puay Luan_, in respect of the various sums involved in this case for each individual s 417 PC charge proceeded with.

24     The sentencing complexion changed when we moved to the second step of the sentencing analysis. In _Gan Chai Bee_, Menon CJ at \[39\] held that “when the amounts paid on the claims reflected in _all_ the charges, both proceeded with and taken into consideration, are aggregated, it will readily be seen that the property which the victim has parted with was of more than negligible value. What follows from this is that the conclusion that the custodial threshold was crossed is one that pertains to the totality of the appellant’s offending conduct …”. In the present case, the offending conduct involved the use of forgery, over a long period of time and the total amount cheated came up to $70,367.24. In the circumstances, a fine was simply untenable.

25     Secondly, I followed the decision of _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya_”)_._ In _Idya_, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 417 PC and two charges under the Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev Ed). In dealing with the s 417 PC offence, CJ Menon held that a custodial sentence is generally appropriate where the offence causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value. The sums involved in _Idya’s_ case were $1,800 (“1st cheating offence”) and $10,509 (“2nd cheating offence”), and they were found to be significant amount justifying the imposition of a custodial sentence. Applying _Idya_ to the present case, the sums cheated by the Accused certainly were more than negligible value. I respectfully followed _Idya_ and found that a custodial sentence was warranted in this case.

26     Thirdly, it is trite that an accused’s not making any financial gain from an illegal transaction and having previously contributed voluntary public service were of very little weight as mitigating factors. Financial difficulties were rarely a mitigating factor. See _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ \[1993\] 2 SLR (R) 406 at \[3\] and \[10\]; and _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> at \[75\].

27     The Defence has provided sufficient evidence to show that the Accused was burdened with the financial and emotional aspects of taking care of two aged and sickly parents. And that she has a good character and has voluntarily contributed some of her free time to charities. I thus found this to be a rare case in which some mitigating weight should be given. See _Goh Kah Heng_ at \[94\] and \[95\]. While a strong deterrence message was needed, I was also mindful that such an approach should be tempered with proportionality/retributive justice. See _Law Aik Meng_ at \[30\] – \[33\]. I am persuaded by the defence’s submissions that the Accused’s record of good work and her good character indicate that she possesses a high potential for correction and willingness to change for the better and that she would continue to contribute to the community: see _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[99\] and \[101\]. That said, when the mitigating weight is measured against the strong need for deterrence in this case, as well as the aggravating factors such as the number of offences committed, the long period of the offending, the total amount cheated, and the culpability of the Accused in using forgery to facilitate the commission of the cheating offences, the mitigation was significantly insufficient to tilt the balance from a custodial sentence to a non-custodial sentence.

28     Having found that a fine is not a suitable offence, I now turn to address the issue of the appropriate length of imprisonment to impose.

### D.   Prosecution’s Sentencing Position – Seeking global sentence of at least 36 weeks’ imprisonment

29     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 36 weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors in their submission for a global sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment:

> (a)     Large total loss caused ($70,367.24);

> (b)     Extended duration of offending – 1 year and 9 months;

> (c)     Premediated offence;

> (d)     Exploited the trust reposed in her by her employee; and

> (e)     70 charges were taken into consideration.

30     The Prosecution was asked to state its position on the issue of what it considered to be the appropriate individual sentence per charge. The Prosecution did not render any assistance to the court on this issue because, according to the Prosecution, the case precedents are not consistent.

31     The Prosecution referred the court to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Neo Sea King_ (DAC-906253-2017 and others, unreported) (“_Neo Sea King_”). In _Neo Sea King_, the accused pleaded guilty to 15 counts under s 417 PC with another 53 counts under s 417 PC taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The sum involved for each charge ranged from $1,376.03 to $1,767.59. The total loss caused was $88,561.42. Full restitution was made. The accused was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment per charge with four sentences made to run consecutively giving a total sentence of 40 weeks’ imprisonment.

32     The Prosecution also drew the court’s attention to _Public Prosecutor v Noor Azhar bin Khasan_ (DAC 940848-2016 and others, unreported) (“_Noor Azhar_”). In this case, the accused pleaded guilty to three counts under s 417 PC with another four counts under s 417 PC taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The sum involved for each charge ranged from $4,488.50 to $5,405.40. The total loss caused was $39,966.47. Full restitution was made. The accused was sentenced to 9 weeks’ imprisonment per charge with two sentences made to run consecutively giving a total sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment.

33     The Prosecution appeared to have calibrated its sentencing position purely on the total amount of loss caused. Since the total amount involved in this case ($70,367.24) was less than that ($88,561.42) in _Neo Sea King_, the Prosecution calibrated the sentence of imprisonment from 40 weeks (in _Neo Sea King_) to 36 weeks (for the present case).

34     I agree with the aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution. However, the Prosecution relied mainly on the unreported cases of _Neo Sea King_ and _Noor Azhar_, and this court was not provided with any information regarding the mitigation plea raised in these two cases and how the sentencing courts have dealt with them. As I have stated at \[27\] above, some weight should be given to the mitigation. For this reason, I was unable to agree with the Prosecution’s submission for a global sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment.

### E.   Sentences Imposed

35     In _Idya_, at \[47\] of _Idya_, CJ Menon considered several cases and made the observation that these cases indicated “that custodial sentences for terms of between four and eight months’ imprisonment have been imposed for cheating offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000”. Ultimately, after taking into account all mitigating and aggravating factors, in _Idya_, the appellant’s imprisonment term for the 1st cheating offence was reduced from two months’ to one month and for the 2nd cheating offence the sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge was left undisturbed by CJ Menon.

36     It is a well-established general principle “that in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence” : _Gan Chai Bee Ann_ at \[42\] which followed _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 334 at \[47\] and _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[69\]. I was also conscious that “the court’s discretion in sentencing is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question. … The appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived at after having regard not just to the amounts in question, but also to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case” : _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> at \[368\]. Hence, using the sentences passed in _Idya_ for the s 417 offences as a guide, and based solely on the factual matrix of this case, I calibrated the sentencing range as follows :

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.24%"> <col width="51.76%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Amount Cheated</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence to Impose</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Less than $2000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">5 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">From $2001 to $4000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">7 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">From $4001 to $5000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

37     The individual sentence for each charge can be found at \[6\] above.

### F.   Ordering Four Sentences of Imprisonment to Run Consecutively

38     In my deliberation, I took into account the total number of charges that were proceeded against the Accused, including those charges taken into consideration; the prolonged period with which the Accused had committed these offences; and the large amount of money involved. I was of the view that an appropriate custodial sentence could be achieved by ordering four consecutive sentences of imprisonment. I was mindful that my decision on the total sentence must not fall foul of the sentencing principles (_i.e._ the one-transaction rule and the totality principle) laid down by CJ Menon in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (_“Shouffee”_) at \[25\].

39     It is my judgment that the total sentence of 28 weeks’ imprisonment was on the whole proportionate to the number of offences, the Accused’s culpability and the total amount cheated. It provides a delicate balance that would deter her from reoffending in the future and deter others from engaging in similar conduct. Finally, the total sentence cannot be said to be “crushing”.

## Part 5   Conclusion

40     For the reasons given in Part 4, I meted out the individual sentences and the global sentence at \[6\] & \[7\] respectively.
