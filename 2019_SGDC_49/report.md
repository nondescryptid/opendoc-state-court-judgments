### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

## Introduction

1       The accused, 61 years old, pleaded guilty before me to the following two charges, committed on or before 15 January 2017:

(a)     consuming _methamphetamine_, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”), without authorisation under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA; and

(b)     having in his possession not less than 0.41 gram of _methamphetamine_, a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA, without authorisation under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 8(a) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

2       The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification, and was found guilty and convicted. In sentencing, the accused asked to be put on probation. The Prosecution asked for the usual custodial term.

3       After hearing the parties on sentencing and mitigation, I imposed a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for each charge. I ordered the sentences to run concurrently, resulting in a **global sentence of eight months’ imprisonment**.

4       The accused is appealing against his sentences, and is currently out on bail pending appeal.

## Statement of Facts

5       The salient portions in the statement of facts are set out below:

(a)     On 15 January 2017 at about 6.10 a.m., the accused was arrested at Mount Elizabeth Hospital on suspicion of having consumed a specified drug.

(b)     He subsequently handed over his house keys to a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”), who searched his residence at 263 River Valley Road #08-10, and recovered two packets containing a crystalline substance, and a glass pipe.

(c)     On the same day, the accused provided two bottles of urine samples which were subsequently analysed and found to contain _methamphetamine_.

(d)     The two packets of crystalline substance recovered from the accused’s residence were also analysed and found to contain not less than 0.41 gram of _methamphetamine_.

(e)     The accused admitted that the seized packets belonged to him and that he had them in his possession for the purpose of consumption. The packets were bought from an unknown Australian male on 12 January 2017 for $120. This was not the first time the accused had purchased “Ice” (i.e. _methamphetamine_).

(f)     The accused further admitted that he last consumed “Ice” on 14 January 2017, when he met with an unknown Chinese male at his residence in order to consume “Ice”. The accused got to know this man through an internet chat site. The accused also admitted that he had been consuming “Ice” occasionally in the six months prior to his arrest.

## Antecedents

6       The accused is untraced.

## Mitigation

7       The accused is a British citizen who left the United Kingdom in 1983. He lived and worked in Australia and Hong Kong before being transferred by his employer Unisys Corporation to Singapore in 1994. He was granted Permanent Residence status in Singapore in 1998, and has lived here ever since.

8       In written mitigation, counsel for the accused asked for probation, and in the alternative, a term of imprisonment at the lowest end of the scale reflected in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor_ (“**_Dinesh_**”) – six to 18 months’ imprisonment. However, in his oral arguments, counsel focused on asking for probation.

9       In support of his mitigation, counsel made the following points:

(a)     The accused suffers from a number of medical conditions, including a serious heart condition and sciatica and scoliosis in his lower back;

(b)     The accused was (and still is) suffering from a major depressive disorder arising from various tragic events in his life, including the gang rape of his ex-wife, and there was a causal link between this disorder and the commission of the offences;

(c)     The accused is an active and contributing member of society;

(d)     The accused’s businesses would be impacted if he were to be incarcerated;

(e)     The amount of drugs found was very little;

(f)     The accused has a low risk of re-offending; and

(g)     The government has recognised a growing role for rehabilitation in the Misuse of Drugs Act Amendment Bill which envisage a greater role for rehabilitation and the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“**DRC**”) regime for drug consumers.

10     In summary, counsel argued that all the above established a set of exceptional circumstances which rendered the principle of deterrence less relevant to the accused. Instead, it was the principle of rehabilitation which ought to be adopted. The accused was not likely to re-offend, and incarceration would have dire consequences on his rehabilitation.

#### Psychatric reports

11     Psychiatric reports from three separate psychiatrists were tendered in mitigation, all three of which supported the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder.

12     In his report dated 27 May 2017, Dr Lim Boon Leng from Gleneagles Medical Centre wrote that the accused “_was labouring under the symptoms of depression at and around the time of the alleged offences_”, “\[h\]_is better judgment would be affected_”, and “\[h\]_e was likely using crystal meth as a means to self-medicate and to alleviate his low mood and fatigue_.”

13     In his report dated 10 December 2017, Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr YC Lim”) from Raffles Hospital wrote that “_the accused was turning to the illicit drugs to alleviate his depressive symptoms because his drug of choice (“Alcohol”) was not providing him the relief he sought. In this respect, there appears a “causal link” with his Depression… and the use of the illicit drugs for which he’s currently being charged.”_

14     In his report dated 17 May 2018, Dr Kenneth Koh from the Institute of Mental Health agreed that the accused had major depression at the time of the offences.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

15     The Prosecution relied on the benchmarks set out in _Dinesh_ and asked for a term of at least nine months’ imprisonment for each of the charges. The Prosecution pointed out that the accused in this case was not a one-off consumer. He had consumed drugs occasionally in the six months prior to his arrest. Further, he had sought out the drugs and paid for them. The incident in January 2017 was a planned activity (as opposed to being incidental) in that he had met up with another person specifically to consume drugs.

16     In response to counsel’s request for probation, the Prosecution took the view that the primary starting point for non-youthful offenders in such drug offences was a deterrent sentence, and the circumstances of the present case were not so exceptional as to displace this. While the Prosecution accepted that the accused was suffering from a mental disorder at the relevant time, it was not such a disorder as to cause him to have any problems with impulse control or reduced his culpability in any way. The accused was in control of his actions and had chosen to take the illicit drugs to self-medicate. In this circumstance, deterrence remained the primary sentencing consideration.

## My decision

17     The usual sentence for such drug offences is a term of incarceration. In _Dinesh_, the High Court noted at \[59\] that the “_consumption of drugs is a grave menace and an anathema to the fabric and well-being of society and must be uncompromisingly stamped out.”_ The High Court also made clear that “_all drug offences involving the possession or consumption of Class A drugs inexorably attract custodial sentences, save in purely exceptional cases.”_

18     There was no real dispute between parties as to the usual range of sentences for such offences. The only question was whether this case was so “purely exceptional” that this court should find that probation might be a suitable sentencing option instead.

19     I accept that it is legally possible for the accused to be sentenced to probation. The offences for which the accused has been convicted are not offences “the sentence for which is fixed by law”, and as such will not fall foul of s 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed).

20     Nevertheless, I did not think that this case fell within the category of a “purely exceptional” case such as to displace the dominant sentencing consideration of deterrence.

#### The accused’s psychiatric condition did not render deterrence less effective

21     The main factor which counsel relied upon in making a case for probation, was the accused’s mental condition. There was no dispute between parties that the accused did indeed suffer from a major depressive disorder at the time of the offence, but they differed on whether there was a causal link to the offences.

22     Of the three psychiatrists, only Dr YC Lim stated in his report that there appeared to be a “_causal link_” between the accused’s mental condition and the use of illicit drugs. However, there is no magic in the phrase “_causal link_”. Just because a psychiatrist puts it in his report (or not), does not decide the issue of how significant the mental disorder ought to be in sentencing.

23     The mitigating value of a mental disorder in sentencing, and in particular whether it renders deterrence less effective, depends on a myriad of factors such as “causal link, the nature and severity of the mental disorder and the offender’s ability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions.” (see _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ (“**_Chong Hou En_**”) at \[25\])

24     In the present case, I accept that there was a “_causal link_” between the accused’s mental condition and his use of illicit drugs, in so far as it was because he was trying to alleviate his depressive symptoms that he took the drugs. Indeed, this also appeared to be the basis for Dr YC Lim’s opinion that there was a “_causal link_”.

25     However, what struck me as the more important consideration, was that the accused still retained his ability to make conscious choices, and it was a conscious and deliberate choice of his to consume “Ice”.

26     There is nothing in all three psychiatric reports to suggest that the accused was not in control of his actions. The accused’s account of the offences in Dr Lim Boon Leng’s report detailed how the accused first tried “_meth_” in the middle of 2016 when he “_was very low and needed “some kick_”” and that he “_was curious as to whether crystal meth could be an ‘escape mechanism’_”. The accused apparently stopped when he had very bad palpitations with the drug, but decided to try again in January 2017 because his mood continued to be low and he “_wanted to improve his energy level_.”

27     In Dr YC Lim’s report, the accused’s account was that by January 2017, alcohol was “_no longer helpful in calming him_” and he then researched online for something else to help him. He eventually found someone to give him “Ice”.

28     From the accused’s own account to the psychiatrists, it was clear that he was in control of his decisions and actions at all times, and he had deliberately chosen to try the illicit drugs in an attempt to help himself feel better.

29     I note that counsel also did not seek to argue that there was any impulse control problem with the accused, or that the decision to take drugs did not arise voluntarily.

30     In _Chong Hou En_, the High Court noted at \[24\] that “\[i\]_n spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused, specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence_”.

31     The High Court in _Leon Russel Francis v Public Prosecutor_ also cautioned at \[27\] against condoning the consumption of drugs for the relief of pain or discomfort arising from an existing medical condition. There are proper legal avenues for drugs to be administered or consumed for medical purposes, and there is no excuse for turning to the use of illicit drugs instead.

32     Given the above, I found that the accused’s depression did not displace the principle of specific deterrence, which still applied. The accused made a conscious choice to take illicit drugs, and it is this choice which needs to be deterred.

#### The coming amendments to the MDA are not relevant

33     The amendments to the MDA have not come into effect. In any case, even if they have, they are not relevant to this accused because he has been charged. The excerpts from the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill which counsel set out in his written submissions relate to the enhanced DRC scheme for the Director of CNB to channel more drug abusers to the DRC regime rather than to charge them. That is an executive decision, and it is not for the court to take the view that this accused ought to have been channelled to the DRC regime instead.

34     Once an accused has been charged, the court will deal with the accused according to the law at present. As far as I am aware, the predominant consideration in sentencing drug offenders remains that of deterrence.

35     In fact, the incoming amendments to the MDA appear to introduce new offences, and also new mandatory minimum sentences for drug consumption. It is therefore inaccurate and far too sweeping to say that based on the new DRC scheme, the entire mindset towards drug offences has shifted towards that of rehabilitation rather than deterrence.

36     I therefore did not put any weight on the incoming amendments.

#### Other factors

37     The other factors such as the accused’s ill health and social and charitable contributions, were also of limited mitigatory value. The High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ (“**_Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_**”) observed at \[23\] that “_the only basis on which limited weight might be given to_ \[charitable and other good works by the accused\] _is if they were sufficient to demonstrate that the offence in question was a one-off aberration, which might then displace the need for specific deterrence._”

38     The present offence was not a one-off aberration. The accused had occasionally consumed “Ice” in the six months prior to his arrest.

39     While I appreciated that the accused’s ill health might mean a more difficult time for him when he is incarcerated, I did not think that was a factor which ought to be given much weight in sentencing. It does not affect his culpability.

40     Any other financial hardship on the accused is also not exceptional.

41     The accused is presently 61 years old. All the reasons for taking a rehabilitative approach in sentencing[^1] do not apply to him – (a) any scope for effective rehabilitation is minimal; (b) unlike in a case of a young offender, the number of years left for society to benefit from any rehabilitation on the accused’s part is less; and (c) the accused cannot claim not to have known better.

42     All things considered, I was of the view that general and specific deterrence remained the paramount sentencing consideration applicable in this case. A probation order was wholly inappropriate, and I therefore declined to call for a probation report.

#### The Sentence

43     As set out in _Dinesh_, the sentencing tariff for a first offender for drug consumption or possession is six to 18 months’ imprisonment. There was no exceptional circumstance that placed the accused outside this usual sentencing range.

44     Unlike the offender in _Dinesh_, the accused was not a one-off consumer, and he had deliberately set out to buy and consume the drugs. I was therefore of the view that a sentence higher than six months was warranted.

45     Nevertheless, I have taken into account the fact that the accused was using the drugs to alleviate his depression, and he did not appear to be a habitual drug addict.

## Conclusion

46     Having considered all of the above, I imposed a term of eight months’ imprisonment for each charge and ordered the sentences to run concurrently. The global sentence imposed on the accused is therefore a term of eight months’ imprisonment.
