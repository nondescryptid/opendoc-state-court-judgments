17 February 2022

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The two accused persons Tan Pei Nam (“1st Accused” or “Tan”) and Myran Brandon Pereira Zhi Wei (“2nd Accused” or “Pereira”) each claimed trial to one charge for committing grievous hurt, with common intention, to one Fauzil Bin Abd Rahim (“the Victim”), an offence punishable under s 325 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“PC”).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted both accused persons and sentenced Tan to 12 months and two weeks’ imprisonment and Pereira to 11 months’ imprisonment.

3       In addition, at the conclusion of the trial, Tan also pleaded guilty to an additional charge for using insulting behaviour towards a public servant, an offence under s 6(1)(a) and punishable under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed. 2015) (“POHA”). He was fined $2,500 and has since paid the fine.

4       Both accused persons, being dissatisfied their convictions and the sentence imposed for the s 325 PC charge, have now appealed against both their convictions and sentence. Tan did not appeal against the fine imposed for the POHA charge.

## The Charge

5       The particulars of the charge for causing grievous hurt with common intention was that on 26 December 2017, at or about 1340 hrs, at San Jiang Eating House (“San Jiang”) located at Lorong 12 Geylang, Singapore (“Lorong 12”), the accused persons did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to the Victim by smashing a plastic chair at him and kicking him, causing him to suffer the following injuries:

> (a)     right ulna mid-shaft fracture;

> (b)     3 cm left parietal scalp laceration;

> (c)     2 cm right elbow laceration;

> (d)     2 cm left wrist laceration; and

> (e)     2 x 2 cm abrasion on his forehead.

## Case for the Prosecution

6       The case for the Prosecution was fairly straight forward. Unfortunately, the complication arose because the Victim was found to be medically unfit to give evidence in Court. Hence, the Prosecution’s evidence of the incident rested mainly on the video footage obtained from a police camera (‘POLCAM”) nearby that was facing the scene of the incident.

### Evidence of PW2

7       On 26 December 2017 at about 1345 hrs, the Police were alerted to an incident that had occurred at an eating house along Lorong 12. This was subsequently established to be San Jiang. As per the First Information Report (“FIR”), the caller informed the Police that “_3 Chinese men hit one Chinese with chair, unsure if need ambulance_”.[^1] SGT Chong Yun Chung (“PW2”) was one of the officers from the ground response unit that was activated to attend to the incident.

8       Upon his arrival, PW2 saw a subject (later determined to be the Victim in the case) lying on the walkway of an Indian coffeeshop which was located opposite the said San Jiang (this was later established to be Mufiz Coffeeshop). He had blood on his head. PW2 attempted to obtain more information from him but was unsuccessful as the Victim kept smiling and would not answer his questions.

9       PW2 remained with the Victim until the arrival of the paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) about 10 – 15 minutes later. After the Victim was attended to by the SCDF paramedics, he was conveyed to hospital. Before the Victim was conveyed to hospital, PW2 took photographs of the Victim’s injuries to document them. These photographs[^2] were later sent to the Investigation Officer (“IO”), ASP S Aiswarya (“PW1”).

10     Two persons were subsequently arrested by the Police. They were the 1st and 2nd Accused persons (ie. Tan and Pereira, respectively). This is as per the arrest report[^3] filed by PW2 on the same day.

### Evidence of PW4

11     Doctor Aswin Warier (“PW4”) was the doctor working at the Raffles Hospital (“RH”) Accident and Emergency (“A & E”) Department on the day in question. He attended to the Victim and prepared the subsequent medical report.[^4] He confirmed that the Victim suffered the following injuries, and corresponded the injuries documented by PW2 on the Victim where they were visible.[^5] These were:

> (a)     Pain and swelling of the right forearm due to a right ulna mid-shaft fracture;

> (b)     3 cm left parietal scalp laceration;[^6]

> (c)     2 cm right elbow laceration;[^7]

> (d)     2 cm left wrist laceration; and

> (e)     2 x 2 cm abrasion on his forehead.[^8]

12     Based on the injuries noted on the Victim, namely the lacerations on the arm and forehead, PW4 was of the opinion that the fracture sustained by the Victim was caused by blunt force trauma[^9] and was consistent with the Victim being assaulted[^10]. PW4 further explained that this was because multiple injuries were found on both sides of the Victim. One would expect injuries on the same side if the injuries were caused by a fall.

13     After PW4 had treated the Victim’s abrasions and lacerations, the next step in the treatment was to apply a cast on the fracture. However, the Victim then disappeared from the waiting area. He did not collect his medication or medical certificate (usually about 10 days for such an injury). Neither did he wait for his follow up appointments with the orthopaedic doctor.

### Evidence of PW1

14     PW1 was the IO for this incident. However, she did not proceed to the scene of the incident. As the Victim had been conveyed to RH, she instructed an investigation officer to proceed to RH to record the Victim’s statement. Unfortunately, before this officer could do so, the Victim, as mentioned above, had absconded from the hospital. Subsequently, PW1 applied to RH for the Victim’s medical report.

15     On the day of the incident, a snippet of the POLCAM video footage was sent to PW1. From this footage, PW1 ascertained that the Victim was assaulted by two persons who used chairs to hit him as well as kicking him. The two accused persons were then identified as the persons who had assaulted the Victim. They were then arrested. There was a third person present with the two accused persons at the time of the incident. This was one Jerald Lim (“Lim”). From the video footage, PW1 ascertained that Lim was not involved in assaulting the Victim. He was not arrested.

16     The next day, 27 December 2017, other investigation officers recorded statements from the 1st Accused[^11] and the 2nd Accused[^12]. On 28 December 2017, PW1 also obtained the full POLCAM video footage[^13].

17     Subsequently, efforts were made to locate the Victim. It was only about two months later, on 26 February 2018, that PW1 managed to locate the Victim to obtain a statement. The Victim had been located in police custody, after he had been arrested for other offences. Although the Victim does not appear to have remembered much about the incident, the Victim did remember going to a coffee shop at Lorong 12, that he was assaulted at that coffeeshop and that he was not injured prior to going to the coffeeshop.

### The Victim

18     Although PW1 had eventually managed to locate the Victim and record a statement from him, the Police were subsequently unable to locate him again. The Victim was finally located at Peacehaven Nursing Home (“the Home”) by the new IO of the case, SGT Munira Bee Binte Yahaya (“PW5’). The Victim was a resident of the Home.

19     Doctor Lau Teh Yee (“PW6”) is one of the resident doctors at the Home. He would make weekly visits to the Home to attend to patients of the Home. The Victim has been his patient since his admission on 2 December 2019. He sees the Victim about once a month. PW6 last attended to the Victim on 10 March 2021, the day before he gave evidence in Court. Pursuant to a request from PW5, PW6 prepared the medical memorandum[^14] stating that the Victim was bedbound and was unable to communicate. The Victim was alert but is unable to respond to any verbal instructions. In addition, the Victim was unable to make any intelligible speech or response.

20     According to information obtained from the Home, the Victim had suffered a traumatic brain injury sometime in October 2019 and was operated upon. He has been in his present condition since then and has exhibited no improvement to date. PW6’s professional opinion was that his condition was unlikely to improve in the future.[^15] PW6’s conclusion is also based on reports of the Home’s staff, in particular, the nurses, who tended to the Victim’s day-to-day needs.

#### The Victim’s statement

21     The Defence objected to the admission of the Victim’s statement. The Defence seemed to suggest that PW6 was insufficiently qualified assess the Victim’s condition as he was “_merely a resident doctor of Peace Haven_”[^16] and that such a report should be obtained from a “_psychiatrist or a neurologist specialising in neurology_”.[^17] The Defence, however, did not provide any medical evidence to contradict PW6’s medical assessment that the Victim was medically unfit to give evidence during the trial. Neither was there any evidence that the Victim’s present condition was likely to improve in the future.

22     At the end of the day, I found that PW4 was qualified to give a medical assessment as to whether the Victim was fit or unfit to give evidence in Court. This is despite PW4 not being a psychiatrist or a specialised neurologist. PW6, being the Victim’s primary care physician since December 2019, was clearly in a position to make such an assessment. Accordingly, I admitted the Victim’s statement[^18] under s 32(1)(j)(i) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).

## Submissions at the close of the Prosecution’s case

23     There were no submissions at the end of the Prosecution’s case. I found that there was _“ …. some evidence which is not inherently incredible, and which satisfies each and every element of the charge ….”_.[^19] I therefore called upon both accused persons to enter their defence to the charge and administered the standard allocution. Both accused persons elected to give evidence.

## The Case for the Defence

24     The main submission of the Defence was that the two accused persons did not cause any hurt to the Victim, let alone grievous hurt. The Victim was already injured when he arrived at San Jiang and any hurt that was caused to the Victim was done in self-defence.

### Evidence of the two accused persons

25     On 26 December 2017, the 1st and 2nd Accused persons were having lunch and chit-chatting at San Jiang with a friend, namely Lim.

26     They noticed a male Malay walking across the road from the back alley behind Muiz Coffeeshop, which was located across Lorong 12, opposite San Jiang. As the male Malay, who was later identified as the Victim, walked past San Jiang into the back alley behind San Jiang, the accused persons noticed that he had injuries or bruises on his face and looked a bit high.[^20]

27     A short while later, the Victim returned and walked towards where the two accused persons and Lim were sitting at San Jiang. The Victim stood in front of them and asked for the drug “ice”, and also asked them whether they sold “ice” or knew where to buy “ice”. The three of them then humoured the Victim and this caused him to become angry. He threw down the bag he was carrying and challenge them to a fight. According to both accused persons, the Victim told them that he had already been in a fight and did not mind fighting again.[^21]

28     At this moment, the Victim was standing directly in front of the 2nd Accused, Pereira, who was seated in one of San Jiang’s plastic chairs. According to the accused persons, the Victim threw his sling bag on the ground and then tried to unbuckle his belt. The 2nd Accused “instinctively” knew that that Victim was going to use it as a weapon and wanted to get up from his seated position to defend himself. However, the 1st Accused, Tan, who also thought that the Victim was turning aggressive and was going to use his belt (with the buckle) as a weapon[^22] rushed over and pushed the Victim to the ground. The Victim fell onto a plastic which broke into many pieces.

29     As he was seated on the floor, the Victim then picked up a very sharp piece of the broken chair in his right hand and said that he was going to stab the 1st and / or 2nd Accused.[^23] The 1st Accused therefore picked up one of the plastic chair, and held it in a defensive position in case the Victim attacked him with the sharp piece of broken chair. The Victim was swinging the sharp piece of the broken chair around and the 1st Accused was following the Victim’s hand movement his chair to prevent an attack as he was very close to him. The 1st Accused swung the chair at the Victim and shouted at him to put the sharp piece down. He wanted to prevent the Victim from using the sharp edge of the chair to “poke” him.[^24] The 2nd Accused also immediately took the chair next to him and used it as a shield to defend himself as he was afraid that the Victim would suddenly charge towards him and attack him. At one point, the Victim was swinging the chair more towards the 1st Accused, so the 2nd Accused put the chair he was holding down.

30     According to the accused persons, the Victim thereafter calmed down for a while. They then asked the Victim to throw away the piece of broken chair and leave, but he turned aggressive again suddenly. The Victim took another broken piece of chair with sharp edge and started swinging again.[^25] The 1st Accused became upset and frustrated with the Victim. He took a plastic chair and hit it onto the floor several times. He did it near the Victim so as to frighten him. He denied hitting the Victim with the chair[^26]. According to the 2nd Accused, the Victim seemed shocked by this action and he put down the piece of broken chair.

31     The accused persons then helped him up and pushed him onto the road and asked him to leave. As the Victim’s sling bag was still on the floor, the 1st Accused picked it up and threw it after him. Thereafter, the Victim crossed Lorong 12 in the direction of Mufiz Coffeeshop on the opposite side of the road and sat down on the kerb by the roadside. Meanwhile the 2nd Accused proceeded to clear up the debris. He took the broken pieces to the rubbish bin behind San Jiang to dispose of them as he did not want them to be used as weapons.

32     A few minutes later, the Victim returned to San Jiang and again asked the accused persons for “ice”. They then took the Victim by his shoulder and escorted him to the main road in order to grab a taxi. This was when they were questioned by some off duty police officers. The police officers subsequently made a police report that resulted in the 1st and 2nd Accused being arrested. Both accused persons were then brought to Bedok Police Division Headquarters where they remained in the lock up for a day.

### Evidence of DW3 and DW4

33     Mohammed Farhan Bin Jailani (“DW3”) and Ahmad Zaki Bin Mohamad Yunos (“DW4”) were patrons at Mufiz Coffeeshop, located opposite where the incident occurred. They witnessed what happened that day and are acquainted with 1st Accused.

34     On 26 December 2017, DW3 left his workplace on his motorcycle FBF6275D for lunch. He picked up DW4 and headed towards Geylang, with their eventual destination being Mufiz Coffeeshop. To reach his destination, he used a shortcut through a back alley leading from Lorong 10 to Lorong 12, a distance of about 40 metres.[^27] He then parked his motorcycle along Lorong 12, in front of Mufiz Coffeeshop.

35     DW3 had to ride slowly through the back alley between Lorong 10 and Lorong 12 as space was tight due to illegally parked vehicles. Whilst manoeuvring his motorcycle, DW3 and DW4 noticed a person, who they later identified as the Victim, sitting at the back alley. This was about mid-way between Lorong 10 and Lorong 12. He appeared to be injured. He had blood on the left his face from his temples to his cheekbones. He was holding his right arm and was checking himself for injuries and seemed to be in pain.[^28]

36     DW4 observed that there was cut near the Victim’s right elbow and blood on the left side of his face. He appeared to be tending to the wound near his elbow.[^29] DW3 pointed this out to DW4[^30]. They did not stop to provide any assistance because they did not want to be involved in someone else’s problems.

37     At Mufiz Coffeeshop, DW3 and DW4 proceeded with having their lunch. They first realised that something was happening across the road when he heard people shouting, asking a man to go away. DW3 saw a scuffle, and then one person, a Chinese guy, whom he identified as the 1st Accused, pick up a chair and hitting it on the floor, shouting for the man to go away several times[^31]. DW3 coud see the 1st Accused was some distance away from the Victim when he was doing this[^32]. However, DW3 could not see what the 2nd Accused was doing.[^33]The next thing he remembered seeing was the Victim walking out on to the road. DW4, on the other hand, was unable to see anything from where he was seated. He only saw a bag being thrown on the road and the Victim walking out of San Jiang.[^34]

38     After the incident, DW4 recognised Lim at San Jiang. He walked over to speak to Lim as he wanted to borrow a power bank. He then waited for Lim to retrieve a power bank to hand over to him. Upon the receipt of the power bank, he walked back to Mufiz Coffeeshop. They subsequently left Mufiz Coffeeshop on DW3’s motorcycle and return to their respective workplaces.

39     After this incident, the next time DW3 and DW4 saw the 1st Accused again was sometime in August or September 2020. That day, they were having supper at San Jiang. Upon seeing the 1st Accused, DW3 queried him about the incident that occurred on 26 December 2017 at San Jiang. This was when DW3 mentioned to the 1st Accused that he had witnessed the incident[^35]. The 1st Accused then told them that he was looking for witnesses for the upcoming trial. Both DW3 and DW4 informed the 1st Accused that they were willing to come forward as witnesses.

## Analysis of the Evidence

### Elements of a s 325 PC charge

40     Under s 322 of the PC,

> Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said “voluntarily to cause grievous hurt”

41     The Prosecution would therefore have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that[^36]:

> (a)     The accused persons caused grievous hurt to the victim;

> (b)     With intent or knowing it to be likely to cause grievous hurt to the victim

### The POLCAM Footage

42     I agreed with the Prosecution that the objective evidence of what actually happened on 26 December 2017 can be found in the POLCAM footage.[^37] The Defence had, in their closing submissions, submitted that the POLCAM was unclear, and that the Court should be slow in relying on the footage, bearing in mind that the Victim did not give evidence in Court. I disagreed with the Defence that the POLCAM footage was unclear. Having reviewed the POLCAM footage, I was of the view that the footage was sufficiently clear for the Court to objectively draw its conclusions on.

43     I therefore proceeded to analyse the POLCAM video footage. The footage is approximately five minutes and seven seconds long. It begins with the Victim emerging from the back alley behind Mufiz Coffeeshop and crossing Lorong 12 towards the opposite side of the road to where San Jiang is located. It ends with DW4 walking back from San Jiang to Mufiz Coffeeshop after borrowing a power bank from Lim.

### Whether the two accused persons intended to cause grievous hurt to the Victim

44     From the POLCAM footage, we can see that the actual altercation is slightly over a minute long. It begins at approximately 1:43, when the 1st Accused, Tan rushes from his seat and reaches the Victim and ends at approximately 2:49, when the Victim is pushed onto the road by the two accused persons.

45     The positions of the protagonists can be ascertained from the footage. Just before the 1st Accused reaches the Victim at 1:43[^38], the 1st Accused, Tan, is seated to the Victim’s right and is not visible in the footage because of the pillar. He is dressed in white. The Victim is standing in front of the 2nd Accused, Pereira, who is in black. The POLCAM view of the 2nd Accused is therefore partially obstructed by the Victim. A friend of the two accused persons, Lim is seated to the right of the Victim. He is also wearing black.

#### Timestamp 1:43 to 1:45 : the first contact

46     At approximately 1:43, the 1st Accused, Tan, in white emerges from behind a pillar on the Victim’s right and initiates the first physical act of aggression. The POLCAM footage shows him rushing towards the victim, and in my view, he punches the Victim with his right hand. The blow causes the Victim to fall to the floor. It is unclear from the footage whether the Victim fell onto a chair (and breaking it), before falling on the floor. At approximately 1:45, the 1st Accused can be seen administering a second punch in the direction of the Victim, is who already seated on the ground.

47     I did not accept the characterization of the 1st Accused’s action at 1:43 as being just a “push”[^39]. He had claimed that he did so because he thought that the Victim was about to remove his belt and use it as a weapon. In my view, the POLCAM footage is clear that the 1st Accused did not “push” the Victim. The movement of the 1st Accused’s body is not consistent with that of a “push”:

> (a)      Positioning of the arms. The POLCAM footage shows that the 1st Accused retracted his right arm back and forcefully brought it forward moments before he reached the Victim. There would be an unlikely retraction of the arm if the intention was simply to “push”. This action, in my view, is more consistent with a punching action, rather than a “pushing” action;

> (b)      The body movement. In addition to (a), we are also able to see the 1st Accused make a slight skip and arched his body slightly to the right before extending his right arm immediately before first contact with the Victim is achieved. This body movement, in my view, showed that he intended to exert the entirety of the force of this contact with his right arm alone. This is entirely consistent with that of a punching movement. The only reason for this would be an intention to cause hurt to the Victim. This, and the _downward_ movement, rather than a forward movement, of the right arm led me to conclude that this action was a punch and not a “push”;

> (c)      Momentum. The aim of a “push” would be to get the Victim _away_ from a position where he would pose a danger to the 1st Accused’s friends. In such a scenario, the momentum of the “pusher’s” actions would cause him to carry beyond where the person being pushed would be standing ie. the Victim. In this case, it does not appear to be so. There was no forward momentum of the 1st Accused beyond where the Victim was standing. The reason, in my view, is that it was because there was no intention to “push” the Victim, only to punch him. The intention was to exert the force at a particular point of contact;

> (d)      The second punch. The POLCAM footage showed the 1st Accused administered a second punch at 1:45, after the Victim was on the ground. From the POLCAM footage, we are able to see his elbow retract and then lunge forward. This is consistent with my analysis that the action of the 1st Accused at the point of first contact with the Victim was a punch and not a push. He intended to assault the Victim.

#### Timestamp 1:50 to 1:56: the use of chairs

48     At approximately 1:50, the 1st Accused, can be seen picking up a plastic chair and raises it over his head. He then swings in down in a forceful manner in the direction of the Victim, is still seated on the floor. The 1st Accused does this not once, but at least twice.

49     The 1st Accused’s explanation was that after he picked up the chair, he had warned the Victim to put down the broken piece of the chair and not to do anything rash[^40]. He was using the chair as a shield and was simply holding a defensive position and preventing the Victim from stabbing him[^41] with the broken piece of chair. He was following the motion of the Victim’s hand holding the broken piece.[^42] However, his actions in the POLCAM footage and his explanation are simply not consistent, and I was unable to accept this.

> (a)     I found it incredulous that he was intending to use the chair as a shield but yet, he lifted the chair high over his head not once, but twice, before bringing it down again forcefully. It is simple logic that one would be unable to use an object as a shield if that shield is not placed between oneself and danger that is being posed. The reason why the plastic chair was lifted high over the 1st Accused’s head is once again simple and obvious. The 1st Accused had never intended to use the plastic chair as shield. The manner in which the chair was lifted high above his head, and then brought down forcefully indicated to me that he intended to use it as a weapon. A weapon intended to cause hurt to the Victim. In addition, at no time does the POLCAM footage show that he was tracking the movement of the Victim’s hands as he claimed;

> (b)     The 1st Accused’s claim that he had warned the Victim is also simply not believable. At no time does the footage show the 1st Accused stop or even pause what he was doing to warn the Victim after he had picked up the chair. Instead, we see the 1st Accused pick up the plastic chair and swing in downward towards the Victim not once, but twice, in what is effectively a single continuous motion.

50     At approximately 1:53, the 2nd Accused can be seen picking up a plastic chair. Like the 1st Accused, he then swings in down in a forceful manner in the direction of the Victim. The 2nd Accused’s narrative is also that he was using the chair as a shield[^43]. However, at the same time, he concedes that the footage showed that he had the chair raised above his head before bringing it. The 2nd Accused described it as a “normal reaction” and the chair was lifted above his head to prevent the Victim from snatching it.[^44]. I also found his explanations incredulous.

> (a)     As I have explained, above, that for an object to be used as a shield, it would only be logical if that object was between the person holding the shield and the threat. Not above. Objectively, this is not a “normal reaction” for someone who is using a chair as a shield;

> (b)     I also fail to understand how the 2nd Accused would be put in peril should the Victim manage to snatch the chair. The Victim, who was sitting on the ground was in a disadvantageous position vis-à-vis the two accused persons who were standing. In essence, they held the high ground. The Victim was also outnumbered 3:1 (including Lim). If somehow, the Victim had managed to snatch the chair away from the 2nd Accused and thereby denying him his supposed shield, he, and the 1st Accused, could simply have moved away or overpower the Victim in order to regain possession of the chair. After all, in order to snatch the chair away, the Victim would have had to release his hold on the broken piece of chair to grab the chair from the 2nd Accused with as much strength as possible, logically with both hands. Once the chair was in the Victim’s hands, there would no longer be any danger from the broken piece of chair. Furthermore, it seemed illogical that a person sitting on the floor would want to get hold of a chair. It would be cumbersome and difficult for that person to make use of it. The only reason why a person in the Victim’s position would want to grab hold of a chair from someone standing over him, would be to stop the chair from causing hurt to him.

51     All considered, the POLCAM footage does not show any defensive efforts on the part of either accused person. At no time do they make use of the chair as a shield against the Victim. Instead, the POLCAM footage clearly showed both accused persons using the chair as a weapon. They each lifted the chair they were holding above their heads, and thereafter brought it down in what I adjudged to be in a forceful manner, towards the Victim who was on the floor.

#### Timestamp 1:56 to 2:03: the kicks

52     At approximately 1:56, the 2nd Accused placed the chair down to his right. Lim had adjusted his position slightly, allowing a better view of the 1st Accused. At this time, the Victim is still on the floor and both accused persons are still standing over him. Both accused persons can then be seen taking turns administering kicks in the direction of the Victim. Tan administers the first kick, followed by Pereira, Tan and then Pereira again. Each accused person appeared to have administered two kicks each[^45].

53     The 1st Accused denied that he kicked the Victim, and that it was just an action of wanting to “move” his leg[^46]. The 1st Accused’s explanation and description is disingenuous. The POLCAM footage clearly does not show that the 1st Accused merely “moving” his legs. It was a forceful kick in a forward direction, towards the Victim.

54     The 2nd Accused also denied kicking the Victim. He was also apparently “moving” his leg. However, the added explanation was that it was to sweep the broken chair pieces away from the Victim to prevent him from using them by kicking them away[^47]. I disbelieved his explanation.

> (a)     The POLCAM footage showed that the movement of the 2nd Accused’s leg and his body angle when the kicks were administered was not consistent with that of kicking away the broken chair pieces, let alone “sweeping” these pieces away. The direction of the kick was towards the Victim. If it were to “sweep” the debris aside, the movement of the legs would have been a side-to-side movement and not forward. Further, if one were to examine the footage carefully, we are able to discern that the kicks were not administered close to the ground, as would be the case if one were kicking away debris on the floor[^48];

> As highlighted by the Prosecution, the 2nd Accused’s version of the events as set out in the Case for the Defence (“CFD”)[^49] differed from the version given by him in Court. In the CFD, the explanation was that both the 2nd Accused and Tan, _“kicked Fauzil a few times to get him to drop the broken pieces of the plastic chair. Fauzil dropped the broken pieces of chair after some time”_[^50]. The 2nd Accused was unable to provide an adequate explanation why his position had changed. It would appear that, having admitted that they kicked the Victim, the 2nd Accused is now changing his evidence in order to fit the narrative that he is now putting forth. I therefore disbelieved the 2nd Accused’s evidence that he did not kick the Victim.

#### Timestamp 2:24 to 2:42 : the use of chairs again and more kicks

55     Between approximately 2:08 to 2:23, there appears to be a period of calm. The accused persons and Lim are seen still standing around the Victim, who is still on the floor. The 1st Accused is standing beside the Victim, with the 2nd Accused slightly further way. Lim is leaning against the railings which slightly obstructed the view of the 1st Accused. Nonetheless, at approximately 2:25, we can see the 1st Accused bring his leg up and then down again at the Victim in what appeared to be a stamping motion. Immediately after that, there appears to be a scuffle of sorts with the 2nd Accused now getting involved. We can see his body go low towards the Victim, but we are unable to determine exactly what occurred from the POLCAM footage.

56     However, at approximately 2:30, the 1st Accused picks up a plastic chair and swings it downwards at the Victim at least four times[^51]. The 2nd Accused can also be seen in the POLCAM footage kicking the Victim at least three times.[^52]

57     The 1st Accused explained that he was, by now, “pissed off and frustrated” with the Victim. He picked up a chair and swung it down on the floor beside the Victim to frighten him[^53]. I note that DW3 had also given evidence that he could see the 1st Accused hitting the chair on the floor[^54].

58     Having looked at the POLCAM footage, I was unable to accept the 1st Accused’s version of events. The 1st Accused’s movements are not consistent with the footage. In fact, it can be seen from the footage that the 1st Accused bring the chair down forcefully in the direction of the Victim whom we can see is clearly on the floor. We can see this because Lim has now moved slightly and is leaning against the railing.

59     With regard to DW3’s evidence, I treated it with great circumspect, in particular, his claim that he saw the 1st Accused hitting the plastic chair on the floor. We are able to see what happened from the POLCAM footage because the camera is located at a height while the incident was at ground level. DW3, on the other hand, was also at ground level. There were two cars parked in front of San Jiang in his direct line of slight, a red car and a gold car. Furthermore, this line of sight is further obstructed when a black car drives up beside the two parked cars at approximately 2:36, which would further obstruct DW3’s view.

60     It should be noted that DW3 claimed that he could see clearly what was happening because he stood up[^55], not because of some other reason like having a direct line of sight _between_ the two parked cars. This is extremely curious because the cars are about the height of a man. We can see this when DW4 walks between the two parked cars at approximately 4:18. It seems unlikely that even if he were to stand, the view would be any better. Furthermore, from where DW4 steps out of Mufiz Coffeeshop at approximately 4:01, it would seem that DW3’s observation is from within Mufix Coffeeshop, further casting doubt on his evidence that he could see what was happening clearly.

61     Even if one would accept that DW3 witnessed the 1st Accused the hitting of the chair on the floor, it is extremely curious that he, at the same time, claimed that he did not see the 2nd Accused kicking the victim when the victim was on the ground,[^56] just a step or two away. All considered, I did not believe DW3 that he saw this happen.

62     I also rejected the 2nd Accused’s evidence that the POLCAM footage did not show him kicking the Victim but again, sweeping away the debris of the broken chair[^57]. The POLCAM footage is clear that the kicks were directed at the Victim on the floor. The 2nd Accused’s leg movements were again in a forward direction. It was not a side-to-side movement which would be the case if he was indeed trying to sweep away the remains of the plastic chair on the floor. Having seen the 2nd Accused’s actions its entirety between 2:35 to 2:40, the only logical and obvious conclusion to be reached was that the 2nd Accused was administering kicks at the Victim.

#### Conclusion

63     Having carefully analysed the POLCAM video footage and the explanation of both accused persons as what happened during the altercation with the Victim, for the reasons already set out above, I had no hesitation in rejecting their version of events.

64     I found their respective explanations not only incredulous but also disingenuous. They were self-serving. It was a lame attempt to explain what the POLCAM footage clearly and objectively showed, namely that over a period of slightly more than one minute, the two accused persons not only repeatedly smashed plastic chairs against the Victim in a forceful, but they also administered numerous kicks and punches, even when the Victim was on the floor and posed no _immediate_ danger to them.

65     I am therefore in agreement with the Prosecution’s submission[^58] that the accused persons’ actions, as seen in the POLCAM footage, were self-explanatory. The intention to cause grievous hurt to the Victim was abundantly clear based on the level of aggression displayed, the choice of mechanism of assault (kicking and plastic chairs while the Victim was on the ground), and the persistence of the attacks (not once-off but carried out repeatedly by both accused persons).

66     I therefore adjudged that the two accused persons did indeed have the common intention to cause grievous hurt to the Victim at San Jiang, located at Lorong 12 Geylang, on 26 December 2017 at or about 1340 hrs.

### Whether grievous hurt was caused to the Victim by the accused persons

67     Having determined that the two accused persons did intend to cause grievous hurt to the Victim, I next proceeded to determine if the hurt caused to the Victim was “grievous”.

68     PW4, the attending doctor at RH A&E Department, has given evidence that, in addition to the various lacerations and abrasions that were visible, the Victim’s right forearm was also swollen. A subsequent x-ray revealed that the cause of this swelling was a right ulna mid-shaft fracture.

69     Under s 320(g) of the PC, a fracture or dislocation of a bone is a kind of hurt that is designated as “grievous”. Hence, I concluded that the hurt that was caused to the Victim by the two accused persons was “grievous”.

### The defences considered

70     I next considered the defences put forward by the two accused persons. In summary, they are as follows:

> (a)     That the Victim was already injured before he arrived at San Jiang Coffeeshop; and

> (b)     That they were acting in self-defence.

#### Whether the Victim was injured prior to his arrival at San Jiang Coffeeshop

71     The accused persons contend that the Victim was already injured when he confronted them at the San Jiang Coffeeshop. In this respect, I considered the evidence of DW3 and DW4 as well as what could be discerned from the POLCAM footage.

##### (1)   Evidence of DW3 and DW4

72     DW3 and DW4’s had seen the Victim as they were travelling through the back alley behind Mufiz Coffeeshop. They had seen the Victim sitting on a kerb in the back alley and he was examining his injuries.

73     From their description of events, the Victim would be to the right of DW3 and DW4 as they passed him ie. they would be approaching the Victim from his left. Therefore, the first injury they would have noticed, if at all, would have been the Victim’s injury on the left side of the head[^59]. DW4’s evidence was that, as they rode towards the Victim, he was looking “straight”[^60], which meant that he was looking straight across the back alley to the other side. Hence, it is extremely unlikely that the injury near the Victim’s _right_ elbow[^61] would have been visible to DW4 as the motorcycle approached him.

74     Furthermore, the length of time that DW3 and DW4 said that they had the Victim in their sight also left much to be desired. DW4’s ability to describe the Victim’s injuries so vividly would not be surprising if the Victim had indeed been in his sight for 30 to 40 seconds which he so claimed[^62].This is quite a considerable amount of time. However, this duration appears to be an over exaggeration. DW4 had estimated that the speed at which the motorcycle was travelling through the back alley was about 10 km/h. This, by itself, seemed reasonable. However, this would mean that at 10 km/h, the motorcycle would cover a distance of 10 metres in about 3.6 seconds. If DW4 only noticed the victim when he was about 5 metres away[^63], it would mean that the motorcycle would have gone past the Victim in under 2 seconds. This is nowhere near the 30 to 40 seconds that DW4 claims that he was looking at the Victim.

75     Furthermore, DW3 did not stop his motorcycle[^64] as he rode through the back alley. It is curious that he had managed to observe all of these injuries on the Victim despite the fact that:

> (a)     He had to concentrate on “manoeuvring” his motorcycle through the back alley that had illegally parked cars;

> (b)     He only managed to “glance” ie. take a quick look at the Victim. This glance could have only occurred as the motorcycle approached the Victim up to when it drew level with the Victim. As the rider, it is extremely unlikely that he could “glance” at the Victim after passing him.

76     I therefore had serious doubts as to whether DW3 and DW4 actually saw the Victim in the back alley as they claim. Even if they did see the Victim in the back alley, whether the Victim was actually already injured. In addition to the above, their evidence that the Victim was injured did not sit with the POLCAM footage. I therefore rejected their evidence.

##### (2)   The POLCAM footage

77     The POLCAM footage does not appear to corroborate the evidence of the two accused persons and that of DW3 and DW4 that the Victim was already injured prior to arriving at San Jiang.

78     As explained by PW4, someone who has suffered a right ulna mid-shaft fracture, like that suffered by the Victim, would experience a decrease in the complete range of movement in the pronation and supination of the forearm (ie. turning the palm up and down)[^65]. Even moving one’s forearm in any direction would be painful in a complete fracture of the sort experienced by the victim and the tendency would be to try and decrease movement of that injured limb.[^66] I therefore examined the Victim’s movements, especially that of his arm, as seen in the POLCAM footage _before_ the assault with the two accused persons, from 0:01 to 0:22 and from 0:40 to 1:42 and _after_ the assault, from 2:46 to 5:07.

79      Timestamp 0:01 to 0:22. The Victim is seen emerging from the back alley behind Mufiz Coffeeshop and walks purposefully across the Lorong 12, towards the back alley behind San Jiang from the left to right from the POLCAM camera’s perspective. We are therefore unable to see the left side of his head to determine whether there are (or not) any injuries. However, there appears to be no visible injuries near his _right_ elbow. We are also able to see him swinging his right arm without any apparent impediment or discomfort as he walks across the road.

80      Timestamp 0:40 to 1:42. The Victim comes into view again from the back alley behind San Jiang and walks towards where the two accused persons and Lim are seating. At 0:53, the Victim begins to remove his bag that is slung across his body. He does so by using both arms to lift the sling _above_ his head without any difficulty. In my view, he would have been unable to do this without difficulty if he was indeed suffering from a fracture of his forearm. Thereafter, as his confrontation with the two accused persons continues, we are still able to see the Victim’s right arm moving constantly, up and down, forward and backwards, again without any impediment or difficulty. In fact, at 1:04, the Victim can even be seen raising his right arm and pointing at something, again without any difficulty. These movements of the Victim’s right arm suggested that the Victim’s right arm was not injured prior to the 1st Accused throwing the first punch at him at 1:43.

81      Timestamp 2:46 to 5:07. This is after the assault. The Victim is seen being pushed onto the road by the two accused persons and he remains in view till the end of the footage. We are able to observe that now, the movement of the Victim’s right arm appears to be limited and it mostly stays at the side of his body. On the other hand, his left arm, is still moving freely. Further, at 3:22, 3:35, 4:08 (for about 10 seconds) and at 4:44, we can now see the Victim constantly looking at his right elbow, examining an injury. When we contrast this with the Victim’s actions prior to the assault, we note that the Victim did not even check his right arm even once. In my view, this simply showed that something had changed after the altercation. This was the injury that the two accused persons caused to the Victim’s right arm.

##### (3)   The Victim’s statement

82     Having admitted the Victim’s statement during the trial, I next considered the weight that should be placed on it. To summarise, the Victim was unable to remember anything much about the incident. However, he does recall that during the altercation, he “felt pain on his hand” and that he was uninjured prior to going to the coffeeshop (ie. San Jiang). The Defence urged the Court to place little or no weight on the statement. The Victim had been under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident and that there were numerous inconsistencies and inaccuracies in his statement[^67].

83     Although, PW1 had stated that the Victim could answer the questions posed to him, his answers, although not really inaccurate or inconsistent, as highlighted by the Defence, nonetheless left much to be desired. He was unable to recall much of the incident. This is not surprising. He had admitted to PW1 that he had consumed some unknown pills prior to being assaulted and PW4’s assessment when he examined the Victim after the assault, was that he was probably under the influence of some drugs[^68]. All considered, I placed very little weight on this statement. The conclusions I drew as to whether the Victim was, or was not injured were made without relying on the Statement.

##### (4)   Conclusion

84     At the end of the day, I rejected the Defence’s assertion that the Victim was already injured prior to arriving at San Jiang. In summary,

> (a)     I did not accept DW3 and DW4’s evidence that they had observed injuries on the Victim in the back alley behind Mufiz Coffeeshop;

> (b)     The POLCAM footage, in particular, the Victim’s arm movements, clearly showed that the Victim was uninjured prior to his arrival at San Jiang and that he was injured after he was assaulted by the two accused persons.

#### Whether the two accused persons were defending themselves

85     Both accused persons gave evidence that they were fearful of being assaulted by the Victim as he was getting aggressive. Any injuries that were caused to the Victim were made while they were defending themselves.

86     The 1st Accused claimed that the Victim grabbed his sling bag and threw it to the floor[^69]. It is clear that the 1st Accused was embellishing his evidence and his version does not gel with the POLCAM video footage[^70]. Instead, what the footage showed is the Victim taking off his sling bag and takes a few steps to his left and placed the sling bag at the base of a pillar nearby. There was, in my view, no aggressive move the part of the Victim. The footage showed that the Victim actions were normal.

87     Next, the 1st Accused claimed that after throwing his sling bag on to the floor, the Victim had opened his belt buckle and began to remove his belt[^71] to use as a weapon. The 2nd Accused claimed that he had a good view of the Victim’s belt buckle as it was at his eye level. He could see the Victim use both hands to open his belt buckle halfway and also had the impression that the Victim was about to use his belt as a weapon.[^72] As the 2nd Accused was about to stand up, the 1st Accused rushed across and pushed the Victim down.

88     The two accused’s version of events also do not gel with the POLCAM video footage.[^73] This portion of the footage covered a period of about 42 seconds. During the first 40 second, we are able to clearly see the Victim’s right arm (and hand) at his four o’clock. At no time does the Victim’s hand go towards his belt buckle. Whilst we cannot see fully his left arm (or hand), we can see the crook of his left elbow which sufficiently far back to conclude that his left hand is unlikely to be near the belt buckle. In the last two seconds of this particular footage, the Victim turns slightly to his left, but his right arm can still be seen. If the Victim was indeed attempting to unbuckle his belt, as alleged by the two accused persons, he would have to bring both hands towards his belt buckle. This would cause both his elbows to be bent slightly. I do not see this at all from the POLCAM footage. Hence, I adjudge that upon a close analysis of the footage, it showed that the Victim was, in fact, not unbuckling his belt at all.

89     Further, photograph P4, taken shortly after the police arrived, showed that the Victim’s belt was still in its place. It was not even half undone. I therefore rejected the evidence of the two accused persons that they thought the Victim was about to use his belt as a weapon.

90     For the remainder of the assault, the Victim seated was on the floor. The two accused persons claimed that their actions with the plastic chairs were purely defensive as the Victim was holding a sharp broken piece of plastic chair and threatening them. They were using the chairs as shields to protect themselves. As mentioned, this version is not consistent with the POLCAM footage. Their actions with the plastic chairs were not consistent with someone using a chair as defensive shield. The chairs were brought high above their heads and then brought down again with some force. In my view, these actions were consistent with someone using a chair as a weapon to hurt another. As also mentioned earlier in these grounds, they were in no danger. Their more advantageous position _viz_ the Victim meant they could easily walk away if the situation was indeed as dangerous as they claimed.

91     In my view, this defence was a bald attempt by the two accused persons to concoct a version of events to put themselves in a favourable light. I had no hesitation in rejecting it.

#### The evidence of DW3 and DW4 generally

92     The manner in which DW3 and DW4 came to give evidence on behalf of the accused persons appeared strange. One “Tee Jia Jun” and one “Mohammad Fatya Bin Hanifa” were originally the scheduled witnesses for the two accused persons. These two persons are not known to DW3 and DW4. It has not been explained what happened to “Tee Jia Jun” and “Mohammad Fatya Bin Hanifa and why they were not giving evidence.

93     More than two and a half years after the incident[^74], DW3, upon meeting the 1st Accused for the first time since 26 December 2017, would casually ask him about the fight. This seemed too much of a coincidence. DW3’s explanation was that he did so because he remembered the incident vividly as “_it’s not every day that we see a fight there_”[^75].

94     In contrast, when DW4 crossed the road on 26 December 2017 to borrow a power bank from Lim barely two minutes after the assault on the Victim, he walks causally across the road. He does not look at the Victim at all. From approximately 4:21 to 456, DW4 is at San Jiang. He simply waits for Lim to hand over the power bank. He hardly engages in any conversation. If the fight was really something out of the ordinary, I would have expected some form of conversation between DW4 and Lim, or maybe even Lim’s friends ie. the accused persons. Or perhaps even for DW3 to cross the road with DW4 to have a chat, since DW3 is acquainted with the 1st Accused and DW4 with Lim. None of these things happened.

95     All these gave me pause to consider whether DW3 actually saw the altercation or whether they had really seen the Victim in the back alley prior to what happened at San Jiang.

## Decision at the end of trial

96     In summary, I found that the Prosecution had proven their case against each of the two accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt. Contrary to the Defence’s submission that the POLCAM footage was unable to show what really happened that day, I was of the view that the POLCAM footage clearly showed that:

> (a)     the 1st Accused began the physical altercation by rushing over and punching the Victim, causing him to fall to the floor;

> (b)     whilst the Victim was on the floor, for the next minute or so, both the 1st and the 2nd Accused intended to cause him grievous hurt by assaulting him. They violently deliberately punching, kicking and hitting him with plastic chairs;

97     These acts of the 1st and 2nd Accused caused the injuries suffered by the Victim which are set out in Exhibit P3 which, amongst other injuries, included _a right ulna mid-shaft fracture_.

98     On the other hand, I did not find the defence of the two accused persons convincing. Their description of what happened that did was not consistent with the POLCAM footage. Their version was a failed attempt to give an alternative narrative as to what occurred that day. It was disingenuous. It was self-serving. It did not raise any reasonable doubt in my mind.

99     Accordingly, I both the accused persons guilty and convicted them of the charge under s 325 read with s 34 of the PC for furthering their common intention to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to Fauzil Bin Abd Rahim on 26 December 2017, at or about 1340 hours at San Jiang Eating House located at Lorong 12 Geylang, by smashing a plastic chair at him and kicking him, causing the Victim to suffer a right ulna mid-shaft fracture, a 3 cm left parietal scalp laceration, a 2 cm right elbow laceration, a 2 cm left wrist laceration, and a 2x2 cm abrasion on his forehead.

## Submissions on Sentence

100    Having convicted the accused, I next dealt with the issue of sentence.

### Antecedents

101    Both accused persons confirmed that their antecedents were correct.

### Prosecution’s submission

102    The Prosecution submitted[^76] that, based on the sentencing approach set out by the High Court in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“BDB”), a starting point of 10 months imprisonment was appropriate based on the harm caused to the Victim by the two accused persons.

103    For the second stage, it was submitted that a differentiated approach should be taken to account for the different culpability and conviction history of the 1st Accused, Tan, and the 2nd Accused, Pereira.

104    First, the Prosecution sought a _common_ uplift of five months’ imprisonment for both accused persons due to the following aggravating factions, namely, the manner and duration of the attack, the use of a weapon (ie. the plastic chairs), that it was a group assault (ie. two versus one) and lack of remorse (ie. claiming trial in the face of the objective evidence).

105    Second, it was submitted that the 1st Accused warranted a further uplift of three months’ imprisonment as he triggered the entire attack with his first act of aggression, by standing up, rushing around the table and throwing a punch at the victim causing the latter to fall to the ground. In addition, in 2011, he was convicted and sentenced to two days’ imprisonment and a fine of $6,000 for being a member of an unlawful assembly.

106    As there were no mitigating factors in this case. Therefore, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for the 1st Accused and 15 months’ imprisonment for the 2nd Accused.

### Defence’s submission / plea in mitigation

107    Unsurprisingly, the Defence sought a much lower sentence for the two accused persons.[^77] The Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence in the present case was 6 months’ imprisonment for the 1st Accused and 5 months’ imprisonment for the 2nd Accused.

108    The Defence further submitted that the proposed starting point of 10 months’ imprisonment, as submitted by the Prosecution, was manifestly excessive and inconsistent with precedent cases, including _Arumugam Selvaraj v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 199</span> (“_Arumugam_”) and _PP v Mohamed Razalli Bin Husin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 117</span> (“_Razali_”). However, no particular sentence was submitted by the Defence, only that the injury suffered by the Victim in the present case was one “ _…on the lower end of the seriousness indicator for grievous hurt ….”_[^78]_._

109    In terms of culpability, the Defence submitted that there was no deliberation or premeditation on their part, that the attack lasted for a very brief period (ie. one minute) compared to the duration of the attack in _Arumugam_ (ie. about two minutes).

110    With regards to the manner of the attack, the Defence submitted the following:

> (a)     that the POLCAM footage was unclear as to how many times the Victim had been kicked by the accused persons or had been hit with the plastic chair(s);

> (b)     that the Victim had acted “aggressively” and was not a vulnerable victim

> (c)     that the plastic chairs used were not dangerous when compared to other forms of weapons like a knife, hammer, a stool with metal legs (as used by the offender in _PP v Ng Shiuh Shao_ & Anor <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 128</span>); and

> (d)     as there were only two persons involved, this was different when a victim is assaulted by a larger number of persons.

## Decision on sentence

### Punishment prescribed by law

111    The punishment prescribed by law for a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the PC is a term of imprisonment which may extend imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

### Sentencing framework for an offence under s 325 of the PC

112    In _BDB_, the Court of Appeal laid down a sentencing framework for offences under s 325 of the PC. At \[55\], the Court held the following:

> _“(a_)     _First, because of the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing._

> (_b_)     _Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and presence of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.”_

### First step: assessing the seriousness of the injury suffered

113    The Victim in the present case suffered a right ulna mid-shaft fracture, a 3 cm left parietal scalp laceration, a 2 cm right elbow laceration, a 2 cm left wrist laceration, and a 2x2 cm abrasion on his forehead.

114    To determine where the indicative starting point was in relation to the seriousness of the injuries suffered by a victim, I reviewed several precedents in order to assist me. These were in addition to those cited by the Defence, namely, _Arumugam_ and _Razali_.

115    The other cases that I reviewed included _PP v. Zainudin Bin Hassan Mohamed_ (DAC-921823-2020_), PP v.

116    Accordingly, from my review of the above cases, I adjudged that the indicative starting sentencing _range_ for a single fracture (with or without other accompanying injuries like lacerations etc) was a sentence of between 6 to 10 months’ imprisonment.

117    In determining the appropriate starting point within this range, I was guided by the decision of the High Court in _Arumugam_, where the injuries inflicted on the victim were a fractured middle finger, bruising over his face and shoulder and suffered pain. The High Court at \[13\] held that the trial judge had correctly identified the degree of harm as being on the low end of the moderate range and that “ _… Six months’ imprisonment was an appropriate starting point bearing in mind the fracture suffered here, accompanied by extensive bruising…”._ The High Court, however, reduced the sentenced imposed on the offender from 9 months to 7 months’ imprisonment.

118    In the present case, I was of the view that fracture suffered by the Victim was more serious than that in _Arumugam_ and so were the accompanying injuries. I therefore assessed that the appropriate indicative sentence at this stage was a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment.

### Second Step: the appropriate uplift

119    The Prosecution sought a “common” uplift of five months’ imprisonment for both accused persons. Four main factors were highlighted. I will address each factor in turn:

> (a)      Manner and duration of attack. From the POLCAM footage, we are able to determine that the incident lasted for slightly over a minute. This compared favourably with the attacks in _Arumugam_ (two minutes) or _Lee Sin Hin_ (three minutes). I accepted the Prosecution’s characterization of the incident, namely that there were multiple kicks by both accused persons directed at the Victim on the ground, as well as relentless hits with plastic chairs. The Victim was defenceless. Furthermore, the attack, while not premeditated, was carried out with impunity in broad daylight, as if the accused persons thought they could get away with it;

> (b)      Weapon used. I accepted that there should be an uplift in cases where a weapon is used. The Prosecution characterized the use of plastic chairs as being “_force multipliers_” increasing the amount of pain and damage inflicted on the victim[^79]. In _BDB_ at \[67\], the Court held that “_regard should be had to the nature of the weapon and the way it was used, and how these aggravate the offender’s culpability_.” I note that the weapon used was a plastic chair. This was not a cutting or stabbing instrument weapon, neither was not a heavy or a solid instrument like a glass bottle. In fact, when compared cases where chairs were used to cause hurt (in _Lee Sin Hin_, for example, the chair weighed almost 4 kg), the plastic chair used in this case did not seem to be an instrument that warranted a _significant_ uplift;

> (c)      _Group assault_ . This was the smallest size that one could consider a “group”. In _Arumugam_, the “group” also consisted of two persons and the High Court was of the view at \[14\] that _“…. \[a\]n assault by two though is on the very edges of such meaning”_. Hence, while I accorded this factor some weight in determining an uplift, because there was more than one person assaulting the single Victim, this uplift would perhaps not be as high as what the Prosecution is urging this Court to place on it;

> (d)      Lack of Remorse. This Prosecution had cited the accused persons lack of remorse by “_claiming trial in the face of objective video footage of their attack_”.[^80] However, as highlighted by the Defence, an accused is entitled to claim trial and have the Prosecution prove their case against them. The mere fact of claiming trial is not an aggravating factor. As the trial was not unnecessarily prolonged, I agreed with the Defence that this was not an aggravating factor. Although, having been convicted after trial, the accused persons cannot expect a sentencing discount.

120    As such, I agreed that an uplift to the indicative starting sentence _per_ Step 2 of the _BDB_ sentencing framework was warranted. However, for the reasons above, I disagreed with the Prosecution that this should be in the region of five months’ imprisonment. The uplift should be less. For example, in _PP v Xie Binbin_ (DAC-907926-2021), the offender caused grievous hurt to the victim with a chopper with blade measuring 19cm to slash the victim on her head and neck. The Prosecution, in that case, had sought an uplift of three months’ imprisonment _per_ step 2 of the sentencing framework in _BDB_ which was inclusive of the weapon used in the attack and the harm that was caused to vulnerable parts of the victim’s body.

121    At \[5\] of the PSS, it was submitted that the injury caused to the Victim was _“ … not a relatively minor fracture like a nasal bone fracture or a finger fracture, but the fracture of a bone in the forearm_.” This suggested that a fractured forearm was more serious than a nasal bone fracture. I disagreed. In cases involving fractures on the face, eg. a nasal fracture, the Prosecution’s usual submissions were that these fractures were serious as they were on a vulnerable part of the body, like the face and neck. Therefore, in the present case, I adjudged that the present fracture of the right ulna, though perhaps was more serious than a finger fracture, was certainly not more serious than a nasal bone fracture.

122    For the above reasons, I disagreed that the appropriate uplift at Step 2 of the _BDB_ sentencing framework should be five months’ imprisonment. Instead, I assessed this uplift to be three months’ imprisonment.

#### Specific uplift for the 1st Accused

123    In addition to the “common” uplift for the 1st and 2nd Accused, the Prosecution sought an additional or “specific” three-month uplift for the 1st Accused specifically on the basis that he (i) triggered the entire attack with his first act of aggression and (ii) had an “_extremely similar antecedent of being a member of an unlawful_ assembly[^81]. The Defence appeared accept that there should be a differentiated approach to sentencing each accused except that the uplift should be limited to one months’ imprisonment.[^82] Therefore, the only issue would be in the extent of this “specific” uplift.

124    I am of the view that the Defence had sought to downplay the 1st Accused’s actions in starting the assault by characterizing it as an “_over reaction to the aggravation …_”[^83]. The inescapable fact was that the 1st Accused started the assault. However, I note that while this was so, the 2nd Accused’s entry into the assault was barely a few seconds later. Therefore, even though I would assess the 1st Accused’s culpability as being higher than the 2nd Accused, it was not by very much. At most, I assessed the uplift to be about two weeks’ imprisonment.

125    Every antecedent is considered an aggravating factor, the only issue would be the how much weight the court would be placed on that antecedent. This would be dependent on several factors, for example, how long ago was the antecedent, the nature of the antecedent and the nature of the antecedent _viz_ the present offence.

126    In 2011, the 1st Accused was convicted for an offence of unlawful assembly under s 143 of the PC. During submissions on sentencing, I was informed orally that this offence had been reduced from a more serious charge. However, I declined to go behind the conviction and considered this conviction at face value. In addition, some years had elapsed since the commission of the offence. Hence, I assessed the appropriate the uplift at about four weeks’ imprisonment.

127    In summary, I was of the view that the additional or “specific” uplift of three months’ imprisonment for the 1st Accused sought by the Prosecution was not warranted and was on the high side. Instead, I adjudged that an additional uplift of 1 month and two weeks’ imprisonment was however appropriate in the circumstances.

### Third step: mitigating factors considered

128    I agreed with the Prosecution that there were no mitigating factors present that would warrant a downward adjustment of the sentences for either accused person.

### Fourth step: the last look

129    Finally, I compared the final sentence that I have reached with the sentences that had been imposed by the courts in the precedent cases that I had reviewed for the first and second step of the _BDB_ sentencing framework. I was of the view that the final sentence in the present case was appropriate under the circumstances. There was no necessity to adjust the sentence any further.

## The Final Sentence Imposed

130    All considered, I imposed the following sentences on each of the two accused persons:

131    Both accused persons, being dissatisfied with their convictions and the sentence I have imposed on each of them, have now appealed against both conviction and sentence.

132    They are presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.
