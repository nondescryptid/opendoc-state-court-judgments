### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       The matter before me arose from a show cause hearing, which raised, amongst other things, the issue of whether a debt was “accruing due” where the due date for payment of the debt was in the future.

## Background facts

2       Prelim Construction Pte Ltd (“the Garnishee”) is a general contractor. Pursuant to a Letter of Award dated 7 September 2018 (“the LOA”), the Garnishee engaged the judgment debtor, Wah Cheng Pte Ltd (“the Judgment Debtor”), for the supply and installation of drain and wall works in connection with the construction of building and facilities for housing equipment at Tanah Merah East Coast Road and Aviation Park Road.

3       On 8 April 2019, Globalpoint Far East Pte Ltd (“the Applicant”) obtained an adjudication determination against the Judgment Debtor under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) for the sum of $71,036.23.

## Procedural history

4       On 18 June 2019, the Applicant obtained a provisional garnishee order to show cause (“PGO”) limited to the sum of $72,000 against the Garnishee. The PGO was served on the Garnishee on 21 June 2019.

5       At the show cause hearings held on 16 July 2019 and 27 September 2019, the Garnishee resisted the application. After hearing arguments from both parties, I decided for a trial to be ordered to determine whether a debt was due or accruing due by the Garnishee to the Judgment Debtor as of the date of service of the PGO.

6       As the Garnishee has now appealed against my decision, I set out below my grounds for decision in full.

## Parties’ case

7       The Applicant’s case was premised on Payment Response 11 (“PR 11”) issued by the Garnishee to the Judgment Debtor sometime around May 2019. As PR 11 had certified that a sum of $68,817.18 was owing to the Judgment Debtor by the Garnishee, the Applicant submitted that the court should make final the PGO.

8       The Garnishee contended that PR 11 was only a draft payment certificate and that another document, Payment Response 11R issued on 3 July 2019 (“PR 11R”), was instead the only authentic payment certificate. Pertinently, PR 11R had certified that no amount was payable to the Judgment Debtor, taking into account backcharges and liquidated damages.

9       The Garnishee disputed that the PGO should be made final and made three arguments:

> (a)     first, as a preliminary point, there was no attachable debt (“the Debt”) as there was no money due to the Judgment Debtor as at the time of service of the PGO because the due date for payment to the Judgment Debtor was after the date of service of the PGO;

> (b)     second and in any event, as certified in PR 11R, there was no debt due or accruing due to the Judgment Debtor; and

> (c)     third, it would be inequitable or unfair to make final the PGO.

10     I deal first with the preliminary point raised by the Garnishee.

## My analysis

#### Preliminary issue: whether the Debt was attachable

11     The parties’ submissions, both oral and written, were heavily focused on the preliminary issue. This issue was premised on the contractual obligations in the LOA, specifically cl 17 of the LOA which provided that the “due date for payment shall be 35 days from the date of the progress payment certificate”.

12     The parties disagreed as to whether PR 11 or PR 11R was the true progress payment certificate (“PPC”). But what was not in dispute was that the Judgment Debtor had issued the progress payment claim on 20 May 2019. Under cl 17.2 of the LOA, it was provided that the PPC shall be furnished by the Garnishee to the Judgment Debtor within 21 days upon receipt of the progress payment claim.

13     Based on the above, the Garnishee contended that taking the Applicant’s case at its highest (_ie_, assuming that the Garnishee was also able to issue the PPC on the same day of the progress payment claim on 20 May 2019), this would mean that the earliest possible due date for payment by the Garnishee would fall on 24 June 2019. As this due date falls after the date of service of the PGO, _ie_, 21 June 2019 (see \[4\] above), the Garnishee submitted that there could not be any attachable debt owed by the Garnishee as of that operative date.

14     In determining the above issue, I start with the relevant legislation in O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). That provision provides that the court has the power to order a garnishee to pay the judgment creditor “the amount of any debt due or **_accruing due_** to the judgment debtor from the garnishee” \[emphasis added\].

15     It was not disputed by the parties that the Debt was not yet “due” as of the date of the service of the PGO. As such, the preliminary issue turned on the question of whether the Debt was otherwise “accruing due” within the meaning of O 49 r 1(1) of the ROC. In other words, given that the Debt was to be paid 35 days after the PPC was issued, the question was whether the Debt qualified as a debt that was “accruing due”.

16     The Garnishee submitted that such a debt cannot be garnished because it is not actionable by the Judgment Debtor before the due date for payment is up, relying on the following observations made in _Singapore Civil Procedure 2019_ vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2019) at para 49/1/10):

> If the judgment debtor is entitled to be paid a sum of money at some point in the future, the garnishee procedure does not operate (see _Tye Chwee Hoon v. Cayman Commodities (M.) Sdn. Bhd. & Anor._ \[1990\] 2 M.L.J. 23; _Kedah Kelang Papan Sdn. Bhd. v. Hansol Sdn. Bhd._ \[1988\] 1 M.L.J. 434). The debt must be actionable: _Saw Swan Kee v. Sim Lim Finance (M.) Bhd._ \[1985\] 1 M.L.J. 221. …

17     I disagreed. In my judgment, the key difference between a debt which is “due” and a debt which is “accruing due” is that the former is payable forthwith, whereas the latter is payable only in the future (_ie_, a future debt) that is not predicated on any contingency. Therefore, where a debt is “accruing due”, the obligation to pay has crystallised with only the date of payment being deferred.

18     As noted by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 659</span>, the first port of call in statutory interpretation would be for the court to decipher the plain and ordinary meaning of the text of the legislative provision (at \[71\]). In this vein, _Black’s Law Dictionary Abridged_ (Bryan A. Garner, ed) (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2015) defines “accruing” as “com\[ing\] into existence as an enforceable claim or right; … aris\[ing\]” (at p 18; see also _Oxford: A Dictionary of Law_ (Jonathan Law) (Oxford University Press, 8th Ed, 2015) at p 10). Therefore, in the context of a “debt”, the ordinary meaning of “accruing” refers to a debt that is not yet due but one which would become due pursuant to an existing right. This is consistent with the language of O 49 r 1(1) of the ROC where a debt that is “due” is expressly distinguished from one that is “accruing due”.

19     The above interpretation is also supported by O 49 r 1(3) of the ROC which provides as follows:

> In this Order, “any debt due or accruing due” includes a current or deposit account with a bank or other financial institution, whether or not the deposit has matured and notwithstanding any restriction as to the mode of withdrawal.

20     The effect of the above provision is that even bank deposits that have yet to mature (_ie_, not immediately payable by the bank) fall within the ambit of “any debt due or accruing due”. This therefore puts to rest the Garnishee’s argument that only debts that are immediately payable are capable of being garnished.

21     It has also been noted in local case law, albeit _obiter_, that a debt that is presently existing but payable in the future comes within the ambit of a debt that is “accruing due” (see _eg_, _Lim Boon Kwee (trading as B K Lim & Co) v Impexital SRL (Sembawang Multiplex Joint Venture, garnishee_) <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 757</span> at \[16\]).

22     Indeed, in the English decision of _Tapp v Jones; Pooley, garnishee_ (1875) LR 10 QB 591 (“_Tapp_”), the court granted a garnishee order despite the fact that several instalments of the debt were not presently payable; the court made an order for payment of future instalments as and when they became payable. In doing so, Blackburn J held that “there is power to make an order against the garnishee for payment of his debts as and when they become payable, instead of making a fresh order as each falls due” (_Tapp_ at 593).

23     Debts which arise out of a present obligation with only payment being deferred can also be distinguished from the position in respect of retention monies in a construction contract and security deposits. In respect of the latter, the recent cases have held that these cannot be garnished (see, _eg_, _Malaysian International Trading Corp Sdn Bhd v RHB Bank Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 MLJ 457</span> at \[65\] and \[88\] and _Neale Douglas Bryant v Salvina Inez Indemini (Kwek Pong Hwee Paul and others, garnishees)_ \[2019\] SGMC 19 (“_Neale Douglas_”) at \[17\]). This is because, in such cases, there is invariably an express contractual right for the garnishee to set-off the sums against any debts that the judgment debtor might come to owe the garnishee in the future (see also _Tapp_ at 593 and _Neale Douglas_ at \[17\]–\[18\]). In the absence of such a contractual right and where only payment is deferred, my view is that the debt is capable of being garnished.

24     This was indeed the case before me. Under the terms of the LOA, once a PPC was issued, the Debt was unconditionally acknowledged with no right of set-off for the Garnishee. In other words, the Debt reflected by the PPC was unqualified.

25     I also draw support for the above principles from the following observations made by the High Court in _MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and others v Vintage Bullion DMCC (in its own capacity and as representative of the customers of the first plaintiff) and another matter_ \[2015\] 4 SLR 83128 (“_MF Global (HC)_”) at \[113\]–\[114\]):

> 113    In the context of garnishee proceedings, O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court provides that the court may “order the garnishee to pay the judgment creditor the amount of any debt due or _accruing due to_ the judgment debtor from the garnishee” \[emphasis added\]. Vintage cites the Malaysian case of _Cheong Heng Loong Goldsmiths (KL) Sdn Bhd v Capital Insurance Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 MLJ 353</span>, which in turn relied on the Indian case of _Shanti Prasad Jain v The Director of Enforcement, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act_ AIR 1962 SC 1764, to interpret **_the term “accrued debt” in this context to mean a debt payable in the future_**. In the latter case, Venkatarama Iyer J delivered the judgment on behalf of the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of India, stating:

>> A contingent debt is strictly speaking not a debt at all. In its ordinary as well as its legal sense, a debt is a sum of money payable under an existing obligation. It may be payable forthwith, _solvendum in praesenti_, then it is a debt ‘due’ or it may be payable at a future date, _solvendum future_; then it is a debt ‘accruing’. But in either case it is a debt. But a contingent debt has no present existence, because it is payable only when the contingency happens, and _ex hypothesi_ that may or may not happen.

> 114    The preceding analysis is also consistent with the position in England (see _Webb v Stenton_ <span class="citation">(1883) 11 QBD 518</span>) and in Singapore (see _Lim Boon Kwee v Impexital SRL_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 757</span> at \[15\]). Thus, **_in the context of garnishee proceedings, “accrued debts” are debts which arise out of a present obligation, but are payable only in the future (_****ie****_, future debts)._** …

> \[emphasis added; original emphasis omitted otherwise stated\]

26     On appeal, in _Vintage Bullion DMCC v Chay Fook Yuen and others and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1248</span> (“_MF Global (CA)_”), the Court of Appeal confirmed that sums were “accruing to” a receiver as long as the receiver had a present legal entitlement to the sum in question, _ie_, there are no competing claims or any other legal impediments to the customer’s legal right to the sum, regardless of whether the sum is payable at present or only in the future (see _MF Global (CA)_ at \[37\] and \[44\]–\[46\]).

27     At this point, it is useful to briefly recount the facts in _MF Global (HC)_. The plaintiff was a capital market services licence holder which offered a range of products. The defendants, who were the plaintiff’s customers, traded in these products on margin. The salient details of the trade can be stated as follows. After a customer entered into an initial trade, the trade was treated as remaining open until a final trade was entered into. While the customer had an open position, if the value of the transaction moved in the customer’s favour, the customer had unrealised profits. On the other hand, if the value of the transaction moved in the plaintiff’s favour, the customer had unrealised losses. After a final trade was entered into, the customer’s position was closed. The closure of the position at a profit to the customer gave rise to what is known as the forward value (“Forward Value”).

28     In the course of the plaintiff’s winding up proceedings, the defendants argued that the unrealised profits and Forward Value were their proprietary monies by way of statutory trusts arising under, amongst other things, the Commodity Trading Regulations 2001 (s 578/2001) (“the CTR”). Under reg 21(1)(_a_) of the CTR, the plaintiff was required to:

> treat and deal with all money, securities or property received by him from a customer to margin, guarantee or secure contracts in commodity trading or spot commodity trading, or **_accruing to_** a customer as a result of such trading, as belonging to that customer; … \[emphasis added\].

29     What is particularly relevant to the present discussion is the Court of Appeal’s analysis on the nature of the claims for the Forward Value. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff’s legal obligation to the customer had already “crystallised or been finalised” upon the _closure_ of the transaction. The defendants’ right to the Forward Value was “both clear and unquestionable” and “the only qualification” is that the defendants “have no right to withdraw the Forward Value until the Value Date has arrived” \[original emphasis omitted\]. In the premises, insofar as there are “no legal impediments which may put the customer’s legal right to the sum concerned (_eg_, the sum representing the Forward Value has not been eroded by crystallised losses, or the customer has not occasioned some breach of contract), … the sums that represent the Forward Value _can_ be said to have ‘_accrued to_’ … the customer concerned” (see _MF Global (CA)_ at \[46\]; \[emphasis in original\]). “Accrual” is therefore distinct from the concept of payment (at \[46\]).

30     Although the proceedings in question in _MF Global (HC)_ and _MF Global (CA)_ did not concern garnishee proceedings, the judgments of the Singapore High Court and the Court of Appeal are instructive in illuminating the distinction between a debt that is “due” on the one hand and a debt that is “accruing due” on the other hand. This is particularly so because, in interpreting the relevant provisions in the CTR, the High Court and the Court of Appeal made several references to the legal position under O 49 r 1 of the ROC and to the cases involving garnishee proceedings.

31     Drawing parallels with _MF Global (CA)_, it follows that once the PPC was issued, the only thing left for the Garnishee to do was to make payment on the Debt as acknowledged by the PPC. The Debt was therefore a debt that was “accruing due”, even though payment was only due 35 days later. In other words, the Garnishee was entitled to a contractual window period of 35 days to make payment under the Debt to the Judgment Debtor (see \[11\] above) even though the debt to the Judgment Debtor had already crystallised once the PPC was issued.

#### Whether any debt was due or accruing due

32     With the preliminary point decided, I then had to consider the Garnishee’s secondary contention that no debt was actually due or accruing due to the Judgment Debtor because of the imposition of backcharges and liquidated damages.

#### Applicable principles where the garnishee disputes the debt

33     Where a garnishee disputes the debt, O 49 r 5 of the ROC provides the following options to the court:

> Where on the further consideration of the matter the garnishee disputes liability to pay the debt due or claimed to be due from him to the judgment debtor, the Court may summarily determine the question at issue or order in Form 104 that any question necessary for determining the liability of the garnishee be tried in any manner in which any question or issue in an action may be tried.

34     In view of the Garnishee’s objections, I had to consider whether it was possible to summarily determine the issue of whether the Garnishee was liable to pay the Debt claimed to be due or accruing due to the Judgment Debtor.

35     In this regard, it is trite law that the Applicant bears the legal burden of proving that there is a debt “due or accruing due” from the Garnishee to the Judgment Debtor, notwithstanding the existence of the PGO (see _The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport-SDPR) v Westacre Investments Inc and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 372</span> at \[81\] and \[86\]).

36     I also found helpful the following observations made by Assistant Registrar Bryan Fang in _Telecom Credit Inc v Star Commerce Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCR 3</span> at \[4\] and \[5\]:

> … I have found it instructive to draw parallels between summary judgment proceedings and garnishee show cause proceedings because, in both contexts, the court is required to undertake an assessment of whether the issue of one party’s liability ought to be summarily determined on affidavit evidence alone or resolved at trial. …

> I think that a judgment creditor necessarily establishes the _prima facie_ existence of the debt sought to be garnished once he obtains a provisional garnishee order because such an order would plainly not have been granted if he could not even adduce sufficient evidence to cross this threshold in the first place. This places a tactical burden on the garnishee at the show cause hearing to challenge the judgment creditor’s _prima facie_ case by adducing contrary evidence to discredit it, advancing legal submissions to show that it is misconceived, or employing a combination of both. The judgment creditor may then do likewise to undermine whatever defence the garnishee has mustered. Ultimately, _the court must be satisfied based on all the evidence put before it that the garnishee has a defence that is at least arguable or, to put it another way, one that is not hopeless, before a trial may be ordered_. Such indeed was the observation made by the Court of Appeal in _Teleoptik_ at \[35\]–\[36\].

> \[emphasis added\]

37     In short, similar to an application for summary judgment, where a garnishee adduces a reasonable or fair probability of a _bona fide_ defence to the existence of the debt or even where the defence raised is not hopeless (see _Akfel Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 412</span> at \[41\]–\[43\], \[49\] and \[51\] for the applicable principles in respect of O 14 of the ROC), a trial may be ordered.

#### Application to the facts

38     With that background established, I turn now to the factual disputes that were before me.

39     First, the Applicant contended that PR 11 was the operative PPC and as PR 11 did not contain any claims of backcharges and liquidated damages, the court should make final the PGO for the sum certified in PR 11. The Garnishee, unsurprisingly, relied instead on PR 11R, which had deducted claims of backcharges and liquidated damages by way of set-off and certified that no sums were payable to the Judgment Debtor.

40     Pertinently, the Garnishee had explained that the earlier PR 11 was only a draft PPC and that it was not possible to obtain the information required to produce the final PPC at that point in time.[^1] I also note that while PR 11R was signed and contained a stamp from the Garnishee,[^2] PR 11 was unsigned.[^3]

41     In the premises, based on the affidavit evidence alone and without the benefit of cross-examination, it was nigh impossible to summarily determine the issue of which PPC (_ie_, PR 11 or PR 11R) was the governing one. Based on the evidence, all I could find was that the Garnishee had raised an arguable defence that PR 11 was not the operative PPC.

42     Second, the Garnishee submitted that there were backcharges incurred as early as March 2019 as well as liquidated damages that were imposed on the Judgment Debtor from the period of 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2019. Based on that, the Garnishee contended that it was entitled to set off these amounts against the Debt owed to the Judgment Debtor. There was uncontradicted documentary evidence that was adduced in support of this position,[^4] in particular there was evidence that the completion of the works was delayed.[^5] I therefore found that the Garnishee had done enough to raise an arguable defence to the existence of the Debt.

43     I also note in particular cl 7.3 of the LOA, which reads as follows:

> The Main Contractor shall be entitled to withhold or deduct such amount derived from Clause 7.2 from the progress payment **_as if_** _the liquidated damage has been imposed_, prior to the completion of the Works, and up to the issuance of the Final Account Statement for the Works. \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

44     In my judgment, the effect of cl 7.3 of the LOA is to create a legal fiction wherein once liquidated damages were imposed, regardless of when they were imposed, these damages were deemed to have kicked in even before the completion of works for which the progress payment claim was made. Therefore, the factual questions of whether completion of the works was delayed, the duration of the delay and the party at fault for the delay were important questions to the Garnishee’s defence of set-off, which had yet to be fully answered in the affidavits filed.

45     I was also unable to summarily determine whether the backcharges and liquidated damages were in fact incurred without the crucial evidence of the Judgment Debtor sub-contractor, who had not filed any affidavit in the show cause proceedings. As such, it seemed to me that the only way to proceed would be for a trial to be ordered on the issue of whether the Garnishee had a debt due or accruing due to the Judgment Debtor as at the time of service of the PGO.

46     Given the above conclusion, it was not necessary for me to deal with the final submission raised by the Garnishee that it would be inequitable or unfair to make final the PGO.

## Conclusion

47     For the above reasons, I ordered the matter to be tried in the terms as stated in Form 104 as follows:

> (a)     the Applicant and the Garnishee are to proceed to the trial of an issue where the Applicant shall be the plaintiff and the Garnishee shall be the defendant, and that the question to be tried shall be whether there was any debt due or accruing due in any and what amount from the Garnishee to the Judgment Debtor at the time the PGO was served; and

> (b)     the question of costs and all further questions be reserved to the Judge (or Registrar trying the same issue).
