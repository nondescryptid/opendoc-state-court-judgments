## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

11     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment. For the LT1 consumption charges (2nd and 9th charges), the learned DPP submitted that the accused faced a total of four LT1 consumption charges, and that in 2012, the accused had admitted and consented to have two LT1 consumption charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Moreover, the offence for the 9th charge was committed while the accused was court bail for the earlier arrest in September 2017. Furthermore, the accused had been sentenced to 6 years’ Corrective Training in October 2002 for drug consumption but he continued to re-offend. Hence, an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence was warranted.

12     In respect of the enhanced possession charge, the prosecution sought a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment as the accused faced a total six possession charges, pertaining to three different types of controlled drugs. Additionally, in August 2012, the accused had been sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment for possession of controlled drugs.

13     In respect of the 13th charge for permitting his premises for drug consumption, the learned DPP submitted for a 3 years’ imprisonment term as the offence was committed whilst he was on court bail and he permitted three persons to consume drugs in his home.

14     Further, the prosecution submitted for one of the LT1 charge (i.e. 6 years’ imprisonment), the enhanced possession charge (i.e. 3 years’ imprisonment), and the permitting premises for drug consumption charge (i.e. 3 years’ imprisonment) to run consecutively, making a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation

15     In mitigation, the learned counsel urged the court to impose the mandatory minimum sentence for each of the LT1 consumption charges, i.e. 5 years’ imprisonment. He further submitted that there was no need to impose an additional imprisonment term in lieu of the strokes that the accused would otherwise have received.

16     In respect of the enhanced drug possession charges, and the possession of utensils charge, his learned counsel submitted for a sentence no longer than 3 years’ imprisonment and 4 months’ imprisonment respectively for these charges.

17     Finally, in respect of the charge of permitting his premises to be used for drug consumption, his learned counsel submitted that it was an isolated incident involving adults and as there were no aggravating factors present, the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

18     Applying the principles laid down in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ \[2014\] 2 SGHC 34 (“_Mohamed Shouffee_”) to determine the global sentence, the learned counsel submitted for a global sentence of not more than 10 years imprisonment. This comprised of the sentences for one LT1 consumption charge from the first arrest (2nd charge – 5 years’ imprisonment), the enhanced possession charge from the second arrest (11th charge – 3 years’ imprisonment), and the charge of permitting premises for drug consumption (13th charge – 2 years’ imprisonment) to run consecutively. The learned counsel submitted that the accused is genuinely remorseful and has pleaded guilty, and that an aggregate sentence of not more than 10 years’ imprisonment would not be crushing or disproportionate to the nature of the offences committed.

## Reasons for the Sentence Imposed

19     In deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose, I gave credit to the accused for his plea of guilt. As highlighted by his learned counsel, the accused had intended to plead guilty to all the charges right from the onset, except for the initial charge of enhanced drug trafficking (DAC-944472-2017). When the prosecution informed the defence of the offer to reduce the said charge to one of enhanced possession and to apply for it to be taken into consideration for sentencing, the accused accepted the offer forthwith and pleaded guilty.

20     However, in respect of the LT1 consumption charges, I did not agree with the learned defence counsel’s submission to impose only the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. The learned counsel submitted a table of sentencing precedents (Table A) to illustrate cases where the court had ordered the mandatory minimum sentence for the accused persons’ LT1 or LT2 consumption charges. According to the learned counsel, these accused persons had re-offended whilst on bail, or whilst on the run from the authorities, and they faced relatively more serious charges and different types of drugs were involved.

21     Suffice for me to note, the antecedents and the respective sentences the accused persons received were quite different from that of the present case. Quite clearly, there were also cases where the court saw fit not to impose the mandatory minimum sentence where appropriate.

22     I was in agreement with the learned DPP that an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence was appropriate. In this respect, I considered the seriousness of the offences, the number of charges taken into consideration for sentencing, as well as the aggravating factors highlighted by the prosecution. In particular, the accused had committed the second set of offences in December 2017 whilst on court bail, barely 3 months after he was charged for the offences committed in September 2017, and released on bail.

23     Furthermore, I considered the accused’s long drug antecedents, in particular, his multiple admissions to DRC and drug supervision from 1977 to 2002. As pointed out the learned DPP, when the accused was sentenced for unauthorised possession of diamorphine and failure to report for urine test in August 2012, he had two other LT1 consumption charges (for morphine and methamphetamine) taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Whilst we do not have the benefit of the circumstances of these offences in 2012, I was of the view that the sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment that the accused received was rather lenient, and it clearly did not have a sufficient deterrent effect on the accused.

24     To that extent, I was of the view that it would be appropriate for the court to address the need to impose an adequate specific deterrent sentence against the accused. Accordingly, in respect of the two proceeded LT1 drug consumption charges, I sentenced the accused to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the 2nd charge (1st arrest), and 6 years’ imprisonment for the 9th charge (2nd arrest).

25     Likewise, in respect of the two proceeded enhanced drug possession charges, having regard to the nature of the Class A drugs, the weight of the drugs, and the four charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, I was similarly arrived at the view that an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment was appropriate. In any event, both the prosecution and defence did not seek the minimum sentence for these charges.

26     Accordingly, in respect of the two proceeded enhanced drug possession charges, I sentenced the accused to 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the 4th charge (1st arrest) and 3 years’ imprisonment for the 11th charge (2nd arrest).

27     In respect of the remaining 2 proceeded charges, I agreed with the defence’s submission to impose 4 months’ imprisonment for the possession of utensils charge (3rd charge), and the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the permitting premises for drug consumption charge (13th charge). I accepted the learned counsel’s submission that the use of the accused’s premises for consumption was an isolated incident, and the persons whom the accused permitted to consume drugs were all adults. Furthermore, this was the accused’s first conviction under section 11(a) of the MDA.

28     Finally, in deciding on the number of sentences to order to run consecutively, both the prosecution and defence were in agreement that having regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle, it would be appropriate to order the sentence of at least one charge from each separate arrest to run consecutively. Further, the sentence for the section 11(a) charge should also run consecutively, considering that it is a separate and distinct offence from the other offences of LT1 drug consumption and enhanced possession of controlled drugs.

29     Having carefully considered the respective submissions of both the prosecution and defence, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to order the sentence of one LT1 enhanced consumption charge (2nd charge – 1st arrest), one enhanced possession charge (11th charge – 2nd arrest), and the charge of permitting premises for drug consumption (13th charge) to run consecutively. The result is a global sentence of **10 years and 6 months’ imprisonment**.

30     In making the order, I considered that the proceeded charges took place over the course of two separate incidents and arrests within a short period of less than 3 months. The 2nd set of offences committed in December 2017 were committed whilst the accused was on court bail. Considering that the accused had previously served long imprisonment terms with caning, including a 6 years’ corrective training for drug-related offences, I did not consider the aggregate sentence to be crushing, or disproportionate to the nature of the offences committed by the accused.

31     In my view, the aggregate sentence was neither “substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved”, nor did it have the effect of imposing on the accused “a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects”. \[per _Mohamed Shouffee_ at paras. 54 and 57\]. I should add that the global sentence imposed on the accused exceeded the 10 years’ imprisonment submitted by his learned counsel by only 6 months; and lower than the 12 years’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution.

32     I further ordered that the sentence be backdated to the date of the accused’s remand on 5 December 2017 after his 2nd arrest.

33     The accused being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed has appealed against the sentence. At the time of writing my Grounds of Decision, the accused is serving his sentence.
