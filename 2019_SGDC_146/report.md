### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 45-year old male Singaporean, was a project manager of a company which provided electrical installations to building projects. In the course of the electrical installations, the company had to dispose of excess copper cables from the worksite. The accused was to sell the excess copper cables and use the sale proceeds for worksite or staff related expenses. However, he deposited the sale proceeds into his personal bank accounts and then used the money for his own purposes, including paying for a condominium, car, credit card bill and insurance policy. He was charged with 3 counts of criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) as a servant and 6 counts of using the benefits of his CBT offences. He was represented by counsel and claimed trial to charges. At the end of the trial, he was convicted of all 9 charges and sentenced to a total of 39 months’ imprisonment.

2       The accused is appealing against the conviction and sentence and is presently on bail pending the appeal.

3       The accused also has four other charges (1st to 4th) for corruption which were stood down at the start of the trial.[^1] He indicated that he intended to claim trial to these charges as well.

## Charges

4       The accused claimed trial to the following 9 charges:

> (i)     3 charges (5th to 7th) of CBT as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, Rev Ed 2008)(“Penal Code”); and

> (ii)     6 charges (8th to 13th) under s 47(1)(c) punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, Rev Ed 2000)(“CDSA”).

5       The CBT and CDSA charges are similarly framed and I will only set out one of each for reference as follows:

**CBT Charge (5th \- DAC 938405-2017)**

> You…are charged that you, between May 2012 and April 2013, in Singapore, being a servant, to wit, a Project Manager of RCS Engineering Pte Ltd and in such capacity being entrusted with dominion over property, to wit, a total sum of $111,000/- (one hundred and forty-one thousand dollars)[^2] from the sale of excess copper cables which belonged to the said RCS Engineering Pte Ltd, did convert to your own use the sum of $111,000 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 408 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

**CDSA Charge (8th - DAC 938408-2017)**

> You… are charged that you, on 18th day of March 2013, in Singapore, did use property, namely a sum of S$42,450/- which property in part, directly represents your benefits from criminal conduct, namely, being an agent, to wit, a Project Manager of M/s RCS Engineering Pte Ltd and in such capacity being entrusted with dominion over property, did convert the sum of S$30,000/- to your own use, which is an offence under Section 408 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 committed in Singapore, to wit, by using the said sum, as part of the payment for a condominium unit at 137 Pasir Ris Grove, #XXX, Singapore 518133, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 47(1)(c) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A and punishable under Section 47(6) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A.

## The Prosecution’s Case

### Agreed Statement of Facts[^3]

6       The parties agreed to certain facts which are summarised in the following paragraphs.

7       The accused was a project manager employed by RCS Engineering Pte Ltd (“RCS”) which is in the business of carrying out electrical and cabling works (“electrical works”) as a sub-contractor. The accused reported to Sia Ik Ting (“Sia”), who was the main witness for the prosecution.[^4]

8       RCS was engaged to install electrical works at two building projects. These electrical works included the installation of copper cables. When copper cables are laid on site, RCS would always lay the cables longer than required and then cut them to the required length. The short lengths of cables which have been cut off, ranging from a few centimeters and up to two meters (“wastage”), are of no use to RCS. The wastage has been provided for in RCS’s costing when tendering for the sub-contract and would have been paid for by the main contractor. RCS would usually add in a buffer of 3%-5% to provide for the wastage in its contracts with the main contractor.

9       Pursuant to the contract, it is RCS’s obligation to clear the wastage from the work site. RCS would leave it to its project managers (including the accused) to manage the disposal of the wastages. Project managers, in turn, may request RCS’s sub-contractors to dispose of the wastages. RCS’s sub-contractors would be more than happy to oblige because they can then sell them as scrap and keep the sale proceeds for themselves. Other project managers would dispose of the wastage by selling them as scrap and using the sale proceeds for site expenses and/or for personal usage and out of pocket expenses and incentives which may not be claimable under RCS’s petty cash. Examples of such site expenses/incentives include paying for taxi fares so that engineers and workers may come to work early or work late/overtime; to purchase food and drinks for site staff and workers or the main contractor’s hoisting/lift operators when RCS required them to work after office hours; or to replace missing test instruments and tools.

10     In respect of the present charges, the accused sold wastage in respect of two projects and deposited the sale proceeds into his bank accounts as follows:

11     In addition, the accused also deposited $40,000 (5th charge) on 10 April 2013 into another POSB bank account (no.XXX) which is a joint account held by the accused and his mother, one Tee Sai Noi (The accused disputed that this was sale proceeds claiming that this was his mother’s savings). These transactions (“9 deposits”) form the subject-matter of the 3 CBT charges. The bank statements in relation to the above accounts and deposits are annexed to the ASOF and admitted in evidence.[^5]

12     The accused withdrew the following sums of money for the purposes as stated:

13     These withdrawals form the subject-matter of the 6 CDSA charges.

### Prosecution’s Evidence

14     As mentioned earlier, the prosecution’s main witness was Sia. For all intent and purposes, Sia owned RCS and was the accused’s boss.[^6]

15     The prosecution’s case is that the 9 deposits made by the accused into the various accounts amounted to $214,000. Except for one deposit of $40,000 (which forms part of the amount in the 5th charge), it is not in dispute that the remaining deposits represented proceeds of the sale by the accused of wastage from the electrical works at the worksites in question. Although the ASOF utilised the term “wastage”, I note that the parties have also used the terms “scrap metal” or “excess copper cables” to refer to the same thing. As such, for the purposes of these grounds, I will use these terms interchangeably unless stated otherwise.

16     For ease of reference, I reproduce the prosecution’s table setting out the 9 deposits:[^7]

17     It is the prosecution’s case that the wastage belonged to RCS and that Sia had instructed the accused to use the money only for worksite or staff related expenses. In contravention of that instruction, the accused used only a fraction of the sale proceeds for such expenses but converted and used the majority of the proceeds for his personal benefit. It is not disputed that he used the sale proceeds (or at least a portion of it) for payments in respect of a condominium, car and insurance policy purchases and also to pay a credit card bill as tabulated in the ASOF.

18     Sia gave evidence regarding the growth of wastage in tandem with the growth of the company.[^9] In the early days when the company first started, the wastage from the projects was insignificant because the electrical works were small. However, as building projects became larger and more complex which in turn fuelled a greater demand for electrical power, the company’s electrical works business grew and the amount of wastage increased correspondingly. He was not aware that the sale proceeds from the wastage had become so large until he was told by the investigators. Sia accepted that the company did not have any “official policy” in relation to scrap metal.[^10] Nonetheless, his instructions to the project managers have always been to use the sale proceeds only for company or work related expenses.[^11]

19     The prosecution also relied on the accused’s statements which were recorded by SSI Yip Tat Zhun[^12] (“the recorder”) from the Corruption Practice Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”). These statements were admitted[^13]to prove, _inter alia_, that the disputed $40,000 deposit was also sale proceeds and not the accused’s mother’s savings. The defence did not object to the admission of these statements[^14]. The recorder testified that the accused had read the statements before he signed them and that the statements were accurately recorded.[^15]

20     The prosecution also called the executive director of Sim Lian Group Limited, Kuik Sin Pin (“Kuik”)[^16], to testify as to the disposal of waste[^17]. Sim Lian Group Limited owns about 50% of RCS. Kuik is also a director of RCS and he knew the accused as a project manager of RCS. Kuik testified that the project managers will usually dispose of the waste through recycling companies or other sub-contractors. If there are sale proceeds, the project managers will “use it for the expense of the project itself.”[^18] The sale proceeds is only to be used for the benefit of the project.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

21     At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for the defence made a submission that the accused had no case to answer. I did not agree with his submission. Suffice to say that I was satisfied that there was prima facie evidence to support the key elements of the charges at the close of the prosecution’s case. Accordingly, I called on the accused to give his defence to all the charges.

## The Defence

22     The accused elected to give evidence on oath. He was the only defence witness. I will summarise the accused’s defence as set out in the defence’s closing submission.[^19]

23     The accused has been a project manager at RCS “for a long time.”[^20] RCS supplies and installs copper cables at building projects. RCS was the sub-contractor for two projects which are material to the charges i.e. Asia Square Project and the Pioneer Walk Project (“the two projects”).[^21] He acknowledged the construction industry practice of cutting copper cables longer than required with the extra length of cables being termed as “waste”.[^22]

24     The excerpts of the contracts for the two projects were admitted in evidence.[^23] The defence relied on certain clauses in the contracts to show and prove that the excess copper cables was the property of the main contractor (or developer) and not RCS since the main contractor had paid for it pursuant to the contracts.[^24] The accused also testified that the excess copper cables belonged to the developer.[^25] The defence contended that “\[i\]t is an essential element of the (CBT) offence that the entrustor is the owner of the property.”[^26] Since RCS did not “own” the wastage, the company would not also “own” the sale proceeds. Therefore, there was no entrustment and the charges of CBT cannot be made out.

25     The defence also contended that there was no entrustment because Sia had not instructed the accused how to deal with the sale proceeds.[^27] Further, RCS did not have any specific policy as to scrap metal.[^28] It is the defence’s case that, therefore, Sia allowed the accused to use the sale proceeds for his personal expenses. The accused testified that:[^29]

> QYou said you spoke to Chris (Sia) about how you dealt with the sale proceeds. What did you tell him?

> AUh, I told Chris I use the sales proceed for some expenses to reward staff and give myself to spend, and he always say “Okay, good. Go ahead, spend it. Don’t keep.”

26     The defence also relied on a statement written by Sia and addressed to the accused.[^30] This statement was given by Sia at the request of the accused’s lawyers at the time when the accused was under investigations by CPIB. The statement explained how project managers generally deal with wastage. For convenience, I will refer to this document as “Sia’s letter to counsel”. The relevant portion of Sia’s letter to counsel already forms part of the ASOF i.e. that project managers sell the scrap and “keep the sale proceeds for site expenses and/or for personal usage…”

27     The defence further contended that the accused did not act in the capacity of a servant because he sold the wastage in his personal capacity and not in the capacity of a project manager.[^31]

28     Next, the defence argued that the accused cannot be said to have converted/used the sale proceeds when the sale proceeds were mixed with money that was already in the accounts.[^32] The defence argued that the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) accounting principle ought to be used to view the bank withdrawals and not the last–in, first-out (“LIFO”) principle that is used by the prosecution.

29     The defence argued that the accused did not act dishonestly because he sincerely believed that RCS did not own the excess copper cables and that no one wanted them.[^33]

30     Therefore, if the CBT charges cannot stand, the CDSA charges must also fail.

## The Court’s Findings and Decision

### The Issues

31     In respect of the CBT offences, the issues in dispute are essentially as follows:

> (A)     Whether the sums of money in relation to all the 9 deposits were sale proceeds;

> (B)     Whether there was ownership/entrustment of the wastage/sale proceeds;

> (C)     Whether the accused acted as a servant;

> (D)     Whether Sia permitted the accused to use the sale proceeds for his personal consumption or otherwise; and

> (E)     Whether the accused was dishonest.

32     In respect of the CDSA offences, there is no dispute that the accused withdrew the various sums of money to make payments in respect of a condominium, car, credit card bill and insurance policy. There is also no dispute that these payments are for the accused’s personal consumption. The only issue is whether the LIFO or FIFO principle ought to be employed in calculating the quantum of the benefits that were withdrawn.

### Findings on the Issues

##### CBT Charges

#### (A)   All 9 deposits were sale proceeds

33     The accused disputed that the amount of $40,000 that was deposited into the joint account with his mother on 10th April 2013 was sale proceeds. He claimed in his oral evidence that this $40,000 belonged to his mother which she has been keeping at home.[^34] For simplicity, I have referred to this sum of money earlier in these grounds as his mother’s savings. I reject this claim. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, a list of the deposits is set out in his statement (P20) at \[16\] which included the deposit of the said sum of money into the joint account. The deposits are cross-referenced against the relevant bank statements which are attached to the statement as “Annex CKH 04”. The accused then confirmed at \[17\] that:

> “I have now gone through the transactions one by one with recording officer with reference to Annex CKH 04 and I confirm that all these cash deposits were made to my bank accounts as stated above…These monies were proceeds from the sale of the scrap metal as mentioned in my previous statement.”

I also dismissed his excuse that he did not understand the recorder when he gave his statement.[^35] As clearly indicated and acknowledged by the accused in the portion of his statement highlighted above, the recorder went through the transactions “one by one” with him. There is no reason why he would not understand the recorder.

34     The accused claimed that he only realised that the money was his mother’s savings and not sale proceeds a year ago.[^36] The learned DPP thereafter confronted him with the fact that this crucial information was not stated in his Case for Defence (“CFD”) which was filed on 17th May 2018 or his Supplemental CFD filed on 5th July 2018. The accused was unable to give a credible explanation.[^37] I therefore draw an adverse inference against him on this issue of whether the $40,000 deposited into the joint account was sale proceeds. The adverse inference is further reinforced by the fact that the defence did not call the accused’s mother to corroborate the accused’s defence that the money indeed belonged to her.

35     I also considered and accord full weight to his further statement (P22) which he gave on 28th September 2016 in which he again confirmed at \[37\] that the said sum of money was sale proceeds:

> “For the $40,000 fund transfer, the monies were from POSB bank account XXX which is a joined \[sic\] account with my mother. I subsequently return \[sic\] $40,000 in cash and deposited the monies back into the joint account. This is again monies I had received from the sale of excess copper cables.”

36     In conclusion, I accept prosecution’s submission[^38] and I find that the accused deposited a total amount of $214,000 which were sale proceeds into his three bank accounts (including the joint account) between May 2012 and March 2015 as alleged in the CBT charges.

#### (B)   RCS owns the wastage/sale proceeds which were entrusted to the accused

## “Ownership”

37     A key aspect of the defence’s submission is that RCS did not own the wastage and therefore, could not have entrusted the wastage (and consequently the sale proceeds) to the accused. As stated above, the defence argued that an essential element of the offence of CBT is that the “entrustor” (RCS in this case) must be the owner of the property.[^39] The defence asserted that “\[i\]f the entrustor is not the owner of the property, he has no proprietary right over the property to confer it to the entrustee under a trust..”[^40]

38     This is fallacious and I do not agree with counsel’s submission. Counsel’s insistence[^41] that a conviction can only be made if RCS owned and retained ownership of the excess copper cables is flawed and legally untenable. In my view, the issue of ownership is nothing but a red herring. Counsel has confused or has erroneously conflated the concept of entrustment with that of ownership. Thus, s 405 of the Penal Code defines the offence of CBT (as far as relevant to the present charges) as follows:

> Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property…commits “criminal breach of trust”.

From a plain reading of the above definition, there is absolutely no mention of ownership of property and there is no requirement that the property must be owned by the person entrusting the property in order that an offence of CBT can be made out. The two key ingredients are entrustment of property and the dishonest conversion/misappropriation of the said property. Ownership is immaterial and irrelevant.

39     Illustration (f) to s 405 of the Penal Code, which provides an example of a situation of CBT, also does not make ownership a necessary ingredient of the offence:

> A, a carrier, is entrusted by Z with property to be carried by land or by water. A dishonestly misappropriates the property. A has committed criminal breach of trust.

Following the illustration, A would have committed CBT regardless of whether Z owns the property or not. Z may well be entrusting the property of another person to A for carriage. Likewise, if A is a transport company and entrusts its employee, B, to transport Z’s property, then if B dishonestly misappropriates the property, B would have committed CBT as a servant of the said property even though A (the entrustor) does not own the property.

40     As a general proposition, it is legally incorrect to assert that a person (A) cannot entrust property to another person (B) if A does not own the property. In the specific context of an offence of CBT, it would also fly in the face of the express provision in s 405 of the Penal Code to assert that in order for an offence of CBT to be committed, there must be both ownership and entrustment. Entrustment is not to be confused with ownership and ownership is not a pre-condition for entrustment.

41     Having said that, I am aware that the CBT charges as framed by the prosecution do, in fact, assert that the sale proceeds belong to RCS. Notwithstanding my view that ownership is not an essential ingredient to the offence, I find as a fact that RCS did own the excess copper cables.

42     I reject the accused’s defence that the excess copper cables belonged to the main developer and not RCS.[^42] The defence relied on the relevant clauses in the contracts pertaining to the purchase and installation of copper cables at the two projects. The said clauses are set out in the defence submission.[^43] Notwithstanding that there are a few of such clauses, the point that is being made by the defence is common to all the clauses. For ease of reference, I need only reproduce one of such clauses from the contracts for each project:

> Every rate shall include for the provision of all labour, materials, conveying, delivery, unloading, storing, getting out, cutting and waste on materials, hoisting, setting and fixing in position, use of all tools, plants and machinery, insurances, all duties and taxes where applicable, establishment charges and profit and everything else necessary for the due and proper completion of each item.[^44]

(emphasis by counsel)

> The Contractor must allow in the rates which he inserts against supply and waste items for all additional quantities that need to be ordered due to the method of measurement, wastage, cutting and forming edge and surface finishes, loss, provision of samples and to maintain a sufficient stock of consistent colour tone for rectification works during the Defects Notification Period.[^45]

(emphasis by counsel)

43     The contracts to install electrical works in respect of the two projects are entered into between the developer or main contractor and RCS. I will use the terms “developer” and “main contractor” interchangeably. Counsel’s point is that the developer, who has engaged RCS to undertake the installation of electrical works at the two project sites, would have contractually paid for all the materials, including the copper cables and any wastage. Therefore, having paid for the copper cables, the developer is _ipso facto_ the owner of the excess copper cables.

44     I do not agree with counsel’s interpretation of the relevant contractual clauses. In my view, these clauses do not and were not intended to spell out the proprietary rights of the parties in respect of the materials (specifically copper cables) to be used for the electrical works, much less the wastage as a result of the said works. In my judgment, these clauses merely stipulate the agreement between the parties as to what is to be included in the price to be paid by the developer. The purpose of the clauses is essentially to protect the developer and limit its liability from having to make additional payment for (i) the labour and all incidental costs for the electrical works; and (ii) any allowance or wastage of materials. In other words, the prices quoted are agreed to be all inclusive. The developer shall not be required to pay more. This would also mean that the developer cannot likewise ask for a discount for any wastage of materials. In short, the clauses do not represent and therefore do not address the parties’ intention (even assuming if there is one) as to the question of the “ownership” of wastage. Even though the accused insisted that the excess copper cables belong to the developer, he acknowledged in his testimony that the “developer do not want them.”[^46] This is no different from Sia’s evidence that “\[i\]t’s paid by the developer…They do not want the waste.”[^47] Therefore, I find that in fact (and in law), there was no contractual agreement as to the ownership of wastage.

45     I am fully aware that during cross-examination, Sia appeared to agree with counsel’s suggestion that the wastage belonged to the developer because contractually, the developer would have paid for all the copper cables including any excess copper cables.[^48] Therefore, Sia also appeared to agree that the consequential proceeds from the sale of the wastage would also, at least as a matter of logic, belong to the developer.[^49]

46     However, I am of the view that Sia’s apparent agreement with counsel’s suggestions carried little weight because this is a question of the interpretation of the legal meaning of the contractual clauses which is ultimately a question of law to be decided by the court. Sia’s understanding of the legal meaning of the contractual clauses (as erroneously put to him by counsel) is nothing more than that of a lay person’s perspective. Even then, I could see that Sia’s agreement to counsel’s suggestions was not without hesitation, reluctance, reservation and qualification. The following exchange between counsel and Sia will illustrate this:

> QBut let’s go back first, establish a point. It belonged to them but they don’t want it. I think that’s what you’re trying to say?

> AYah.

> QYes. Thank you very much. So, I repeat for the record purposes, you agreed that the waste belong to developer, not RCS but developer don’t want it, junk it. That’s the truth, right?

> AYes, **they don’t want it. They pay for it** but---

> QBecause---

> Athey---

> Qthey---

> Adon’t---

> Qpaid---

> Awant---

> Qfor---

> Ait.

> Qit, **it belong to them but they don’t want it?**

> A **They don’t want it, yes.**

> Q **And it belong to them? Correct?**

> A **They expect us to manage the waste for them.**

> Q **You are not answering my question.** Alright. Let’s start again.

> AOkay.

> QThey paid for it. Therefore, the waste do not belong to R---RCS. **The waste belong to the---the developer but developer junks it. Is that the truth?**

> AYah, **you can say that**.

(emphasis mine)

47     As may be seen, Sia was not so much agreeing with counsel but rather trying to bring across the point (against counsel’s barrage of questions) that the developer may have paid for the wastage but they do not want it. As a matter of legal interpretation, I find that the contractual clauses relied upon by counsel have no bearing on and do not determine the question of ownership of the wastage. In any event, I have already stated earlier that the question of ownership is irrelevant to the CBT charges. Further and for the sake of argument, even if it is accepted that the wastage belonged to the developer, I do not see how that conclusion would absolve the accused from any criminal liability because it is not in dispute that the developer had expressly permitted the accused to deal with the wastage or sale proceeds as his own. It is never the defence’s case that the accused had told the developer that he had gotten $214,000 from selling the wastage and that the developer told him to keep the money. Ultimately, whichever way the argument went, the accused has to account to either the developer or RCS for the sale proceeds.

## “Entrustment”

48     I further agree with prosecution’s submission[^50] that the accused was “entrusted with dominion over property” in that he was tasked to dispose of the wastage and to use the sale proceeds (if any), at his discretion, for payment of worksite related or staff welfare related expenses. I accept Sia’s evidence on this issue:

> …as an owner of the company, you always---you tell them take care of the company property, alright? If this, uh, purchase by company, if you can recover some, use it as a petty cash for staff benefit, for lunch, the staff can go for a meal with the safety officer, $50 on a hawker stall, they don’t have a receipt, they cannot claim, alright? So, I too they didn’t try to recover some and can cover some of our petty cash. Petty cash that means like site, in \[inaudible\] material, can be the metres points, buy some battery, safety shoe, you know, all this thing. And I---sometime taxi fare for the staff to go home at night.[^51]

49     Therefore, I find that the accused was entrusted with the control, and hence, dominion over the sale proceeds which is “company property”.

#### (C)   Accused acted as a servant

50     I also do not agree with and I reject counsel’s argument that the accused, in selling the wastage and keeping the sale proceeds, was acting in a personal capacity and not as an employee of RCS. This flows from my finding that the accused was tasked to dispose of the wastage and to manage the sale proceeds. It is very much part of the job scope of a project manager to dispose of all waste materials because RCS is under a contractual duty to clear the waste from the worksite. Thus, it is clearly stated in the contract for the Asia Square Project that:

> The Sub-Contractor shall clear and remove debris and waste materials to designated area on a daily basis. The completed structural floor shall be cleaned before handing over…[^52]

51     Sia’s statement to counsel (which is strenuously relied upon by the defence) confirmed as much that it is the duty of RCS to clear the excess copper cables from the worksite and that the company leaves it to the project managers to manage the disposal.[^53] In other words, the project managers, being responsible for and overseeing the electrical works installation at the worksite, must dispose of the excess materials on behalf of RCS. Therefore, it cannot lie ill in the defence’s mouth to assert that the accused was not acting as a servant when he sold the excess copper cables.

52     Seen in this context, the accused would only have come into possession of the excess copper cables in the course of his duties and in the capacity a project manager of RCS. This fact reinforces my finding that there was entrustment. As set out above, the offence of CBT involves the entrustment “_in any manner_” of property. It is an agreed fact that RCS is contractually obliged to remove the wastage from the worksite[^54]. The accused acknowledged this fact in his testimony that “RCS need to clear excess copper from site.”[^55] As the project manager, the accused was acting on behalf of RCS to dispose of the wastage. This is the manner in which the accused was entrusted with the wastage and the consequential sale proceeds, notwithstanding that there were no written company policies on the disposal of wastage. There is no question that he had to account to RCS for the proceeds of the sale of the excess copper cables.

53     I reject counsel’s submission that there must necessarily be some formal or express declaration of trust.[^56] This submission is misconceived as may be seen from the passage in Penal Law of India Vol 4 (11th Ed, 2011) at pp 3918 which was cited with approval by the High Court in _Wong Seng Kwan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 12</span> (“_Wong Seng_ Kwan”) at \[16\]:

> …the illustrations in Sec. 405 show equally clearly that the property comes into possession of the accused either by an express entrustment or by some process placing the accused in a position of trust...

(emphasis mine)

Therefore, the entrustment that is required in an offence of CBT can either be express or by way of a process (such as in the course of one’s employment) which places the person in a position of trust.

#### (D)   Sale proceeds not for personal use

54     I also dismiss the accused’s evidence and defence that Sia allowed him to spend the money as he wished.[^57] The accused has clearly interpreted Sia’s instructions (to spend the sale proceeds) too liberally to the extent of being dishonest. I find that the sale proceeds were meant only to be spent on staff welfare or worksite related purchases. In this regard, I repeat Sia’s evidence which I accept as follows:

> ..if you can recover some, use it as a petty cash for staff benefit, for lunch, the staff can go for a meal with the safety officer, $50 on a hawker stall, they don’t have a receipt, they cannot claim, alright? So, I too they didn’t try to recover some and can cover some of our petty cash. Petty cash that means like site, in \[inaudible\] material, can be the metres points, buy some battery, safety shoe, you know, all this thing. And I---sometime taxi fare for the staff to go home at night.[^58]

55     I also considered that this position is consistent with Kuik’s (executive director of parent company of RCS) evidence regarding the disposal of waste and use of sale proceeds.

56     No doubt the defence is relying on (by taking out of context) Sia’s letter to counsel[^59] which appeared to allow project managers to keep sale proceeds for, _inter alia_, “personal usage”. However, the phrase “personal usage” must be looked at in the context of the relevant portion as follows:

> Project managers who are diligent to dispose of the excess materials by selling them as scrap and keep the sale proceeds for site expenses and/or for personal usage and out of pockets expenses and incentives which may not be claimable under our petty cash. Examples of such site expenses/incentives are taxi fare for Site Engineers and Workers to come in earlier or work late/overtime, food and drinks for site staff and workers, main contractor hoisting/lift operators when we require them to work after hours, as we do not provide meal allowance, replacement of missing test instruments and tool.[^60]

57     The phrase “personal usage” clearly refers and is confined to minor expenses which may not strictly be claimable from the company. Such expenses must nonetheless be work or staff related. It does not mean and does not entitle the accused to keep the sale proceeds for purely personal and non-work related consumption. Most importantly, the phrase cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be read and understood to permit a project manager to deposit large sums of sale proceeds into his personal account and to subsequently use the proceeds to purchase a condominium, car, insurance policy or to settle a personal credit card bill.

58     I further considered, as pointed out by the prosecution[^61], that it was the accused who had prepared the first draft of Sia’s letter to counsel.[^62] Therefore, this letter is very much self-serving vis-à-vis the accused. Sia did candidly acknowledge that the phrase “and/or for personal usage” was inserted by Sia.[^63] However, Sia explained very clearly to counsel during cross-examination that one had to “read the whole paragraph” and that what he meant was that “personal usage” had to be “project related…Site expenses means project expenses and or anything that you think you need for your own use. You’ve got to read in totality. You cannot say personal usage is personal.”[^64] Sia maintained that it was not his intention to permit the accused to use the money for his personal expenses[^65]but that such expenses must be work related or which will improve the working environment of the staff.[^66]

59     Sia took pains to give examples of how the accused could have used the sale proceeds as “personal usage”:

> I just give the example. Bernard organise a trip to Phuket, I think with all the site staff. These are not site expenses. \[…\] Okay, these are more personal expenses – usage – personal use. Right? It’s – it’s like their incentive or just a moral booster among the staff but has nothing to do with the site expenses.[^67]

> I just support him as long as it goes to the welfare of the staff. I will – I will fully support him, yes. He know the staff better than me, he has 20 people under his care.”[^68]

60     Sia was absolutely clear in his testimony that the accused was never allowed to use the money to buy a condominium:[^69]

> QYes. What was---the company’s position on him using this money to buy a condo?

> AI authorised him to keep the money and use the money for project related expenses but I never telling to use the money to buy a condo. I only knew it when Mr. Yip mentioned this thing to me.

61     I find Sia to be completely objective and honest as a witness. Throughout this episode (from the time of the investigations and even, as may be seen later, at the stage of the accused’s mitigation), Sia spoke well of the accused as an employee and harboured no ill will against him. Far from trying to implicate or blame the accused, Sia even signed the statement that the accused had drafted (Sia’s statement to counsel) which the accused thought would assist him in the investigations and in his defence. Given Sia’s disposition towards wanting to help the accused as far as he is able to (without committing perjury or compromising the company’s financial position), I accept Sia’s testimony and explanation that such permitted “personal expenses” which are work or working environment related would have to come out of the petty cash so as to avoid the cumbersome process of getting three quotes just to purchase a small item for the staff.[^70] In other words, the sale proceeds were meant to be used as petty cash for company expenses.

#### (E)   Accused was dishonest

62     The _mens rea_ of “dishonesty” is defined in s 24 of the Penal Code as such:

> Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

The terms “wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss” are then defined in s 23 of the Penal Code as follows:

> ‘Wrongful gain’ is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled; ‘wrongful loss is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled.

63     The defence pointed out that the _mens rea_ of “dishonestly” has been omitted from the CBT charges.[^71] I agree with counsel’s submission that dishonesty is an essential element of the CBT charges but I find that this element is encapsulated in the phrase “converts to his own use” as stated in the charges.[^72] I further note that the prosecution does not disagree but accepts (and has proceeded on the basis) that dishonesty is an ingredient of the present CBT charges, notwithstanding that the word “dishonestly” is not mentioned.[^73] As rightly submitted by the prosecution with reference to _Wong Seng Kwan_ at \[46\], the act of conversion is a subset of criminal misappropriation which means that a person who has committed conversion would have also committed criminal misappropriation, and that unlike misappropriation, conversion requires the additional element of acting in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the true owner. In any event, the High Court, when hearing this appeal eventually, has the implied power under s 256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) to amend the CBT charges to insert the word “dishonestly” (see _Wong Seng Kwan_ at \[49\]). There would be no prejudice to the accused since both parties do not disagree and had conducted the trial on the premise that dishonesty is the requisite _mens rea_ in respect of the CBT charges.

64     Counsel submitted that the accused had acted honestly because he “sincerely believed” that he was entitled to the sale proceeds and could “do anything I liked”.[^74] This could not be further from the truth as evidenced by his statements to the CPIB where he repeatedly conceded that Sia would not have allowed him to keep the sales proceeds had he revealed to Sia the amounts involved. For example, in his statement P19, he said at \[11\] that:

> I wish to add that I had never informed Christopher Sia on how much monies I had received from the sale of these excess copper cables over these years. I know that if I had informed him of the amount I have been receiving for these excess copper cables, Christopher Sia will asked (sic) me to return these monies to the company.

The accused admitted further at page 7 of the statement when questions were asked as follows:

> Q2Did you inform Christopher Sia on the amount of the proceeds for the sale of the excess copper cables?

> A2No.

> Q3Why No?

> A3If I had told him that I had received so much money from the sales of excess copper cables, he would have asked me to return these monies to the company and I would not be able to keep these monies for myself.

> Q4Even though Christopher Sia had informed you that you can use proceeds of these excess copper cables to pay for miscellaneous expenses, you have actually kept 80% of these monies as personal keeping. Do you think Christopher Sia would have asked you to return these monies?

> A4Yes.

> Q5Why Yes?

> A5I know that his instructions were to use these monies for miscellaneous expenses spent at worksite and other recreational activities I would have paid for the RCS employees. If he knows that I still keep close to 80% of the monies, he would have asked me to return to the company as I am not supposed to keep these monies.

65     I give full weight to the admissions made by the accused in his statements as highlighted. I had no difficulty rejecting his excuse (when confronted with his statements by the learned DPP) that he “didn’t really understand the questions so much.”[^75] His disavowal of his admissions also fly in the face of his earlier confirmation in court that whatever he told the CPIB was the truth.[^76] These were clear and unambiguous admissions made by the accused on a straightforward but crucial fact. The admission is entirely consistent with Sia’s position that he was kept in the dark about the accused’s use of the sale proceeds:

> QYes. What was---the company’s position on him using this money to buy a condo?

> AI authorised him to keep the money and use the money for project related expenses but I never telling to use the money to buy a condo. I only knew it when Mr. Yip \[CPIB\] mentioned this thing to me.[^77]

In my view, it would be completely inconceivable that Sia would have allowed the accused to keep or spend more than $200,000 as his own money.

66     Accused was also not a credible witness. During cross-examination and out of the blue, he claimed that he informed Sia that he had used the sale proceeds towards the purchase of his condominium:[^78]

> QMr. Chong, did you tell Mr. Sia that you were using the money from the excess copper sales for the condominium?

> AYes.

> QYou told him?

> AYah---yah.

However, this crucial point was never put to Sia by counsel nor led in evidence during the accused examination-in-chief. This was a completely new and unfounded revelation by the accused, not to mention that it would be incongruous with his admissions in his statements (highlighted above) that he did not inform Sia of the quantum of the sale proceeds. It would also be inconsistent with his earlier evidence in court that Sia did not know how much the sale proceeds added up to.[^79] I accept Sia’s evidence that he did not know how the accused used the sale proceeds (which was not challenged by counsel) and I find that the accused clearly lied that he had informed Sia.

67     In summary, I find that the accused was dishonest when he deposited the sale proceeds in his various bank accounts. He knew that he was not permitted to do so and he kept Sia in the dark about the 9 deposits. He certainly did not inform Sia about the quantum of sale proceeds because he knew that Sia would have asked him to return the money to the company.

68     I am satisfied that the accused was not legally entitled to the sale proceeds and has caused wrongful loss to RCS and wrongful gain to himself by making the 9 deposits into his personal bank accounts. Therefore, I find that the _mens rea_ of dishonesty in respect of the CBT charges has been satisfied.

##### CDSA Charges

#### Co-mingling of funds

69     I agree with the prosecution’s submission that when “tainted funds” (sale proceeds in this case) are deposited into a bank account, it becomes mixed with and indistinguishable from the clean funds i.e. the entire pool of funds become tainted[^80]. The prosecution also referred to the lower court’s decision in _PP v Abdul Ghani Bin Tahir_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 161</span> (“_Abdul Ghani_”)[^81] where the court took the view at \[46\] that it is difficult to pinpoint which funds were illicit and which were not when the funds have been co-mingled. The court also stated at \[50\] that there are “_strong public policy reasons why funds that were withdrawn from a co-mingled pool of clean and tainted funds should be construed to contain tainted funds in part or in whole. To hold otherwise would render the CDSA otiose_”. I would respectfully agree with these views. As such, the defence’s submission[^82] that the prosecution must also prove that the accused had intended, _specifically_, to use the sale proceeds portion of the co-mingled funds, would be artificial and therefore cannot be accepted. In any case, I am satisfied and I do find that the accused had such an intention, as I will elaborate hereon.

#### LIFO principle to be used

70     In respect of the 8th\-10th charges, it is not in dispute and I find that the accused made three payments towards the purchase of his condominium on 18 March, 12 April and 17 May 2013 respectively totalling $249,300. I accept prosecution’s submission[^83] and I find that the accused made 3 deposits of $30,000 (16 March 2013), $29,500 (4 April 2013) and $40,000 (10 April 2013) respectively of sale proceeds into his bank account which totalled $99,500. The accused also admitted in his CPIB statements that the said deposits were meant for his condominium payments. The prosecution has provided the relevant references in the accused’s statements in its submission which I need not set out.[^84]

71     I agree with the prosecution’s observation that before he made the first payment, he only had about $17,000 in his bank account and that after the condominium payments, he had about $6,000 left in his bank account. I agree with the prosecution’s reasoning that if not for fact that the accused had deposited the sale proceeds, he would not have been able to afford the condominium payments. Therefore, I agree with the prosecution that the entire sum of the sale proceeds that was deposited ought to be regarded as benefits of his criminal conduct which he applied to make the condominium payments.

72     In respect of the disputed $40,000 deposit, the accused first transferred a sum of $40,000 (clean money) from his joint account with his mother on 30th March 2013 to the condominium transaction account, but he subsequently returned this money by depositing the $40,000 sale proceeds back into the said joint account on 10th April 2013. He admitted at \[40\] of his statement (P22) that the sale proceeds were to be used for the condominium payments. Therefore, I agree that this sum of money ought also to be regarded as benefits of his criminal conduct which was applied for the condominium payments, even though it was deposited into the joint account after the condominium payments were made.

73     In respect of the 11th charge, I accept prosecution’s submission[^85] and I find that the accused paid his credit card charges of $9,428.91 in March 2014 with the sale proceeds of $9,000 that he had deposited into his bank account earlier. Before the said deposit, he only had $2,571.62 in his bank account which was insufficient to pay off his credit card charges. After depositing the sale proceeds and then settling his credit card bill, the balance in his account was $2,126.21. I accept prosecution’s reasoning that if not for the sale proceeds, he would not have been able to pay his credit card bill in full. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution[^86], the accused admitted in his statement (P22) at \[42-43\] that the $9,000 was meant to pay his credit card bill. The accused also agreed, when he was cross-examined, that he would not have been able to fully pay his credit card bill if not for the said deposit.[^87] Therefore, I find that the entire sum of the $9,000 sale proceeds ought to be taken into account in the CDSA charge as benefits of his criminal conduct.

74     In respect of the 12th charge, the accused made a partial payment of $25,300 on 17 November 2014 for a car. He had deposited $29,000 into his bank account two days earlier which only had a balance of about $500. After making the car payment, he had less than $4,000 left in the account. He admitted in his statement (P22) at \[44\] that the said deposit was meant to pay for his car. The accused also admitted this fact during cross-examination.[^88] I therefore agree with the prosecution’s submission[^89] and I find that the accused had utilised $25,300 (out of the $29,000 sale proceeds) which represented his benefits from his criminal conduct to partially pay for his car.

75     Finally, in respect of the 13th charge, the accused paid Prudential more than $54,000 for a term insurance on 27 March 2015. About 5 days before that, he had deposited $20,000 of sale proceeds into his bank account which had a balance of about $37,000. He clearly required the addition of the $20,000 sale proceeds to his balance in order to make the subsequent payment to Prudential. The accused also admitted in his statement (P22) at \[45\], and also during cross-examination[^90], that the said deposit was meant to pay Prudential. I agree with the prosecution’s submission[^91] and I find that the accused had utilised the $20,000 which represented his benefits from his criminal conduct in paying for the insurance policy.

#### No overlap between CBT and CDSA offences

76     Finally, I reject counsel’s submission that there was an overlap in this case between the predicate offence (CBT) and the CDSA offence.[^92] In my view, there was no overlap because the CBT offences were completed when the accused dishonestly made the 9 deposits of the sale proceeds into his various personal accounts. His subsequent withdrawals to pay for the condominium, car, credit card bill and insurance policy then constituted the CDSA offences.

### Conclusion - Verdict

77     In conclusion, I find that the accused sold the excess copper cables in respect of the two projects in his capacity as an employee of RCS and he then dishonestly converted the sale proceeds for his own use by depositing the proceeds into his personal accounts.

78     I reject the accused’s defence that Sia permitted or instructed him to use the sale proceeds for purely personal expenses in the sense that he could spend it as his own money.

79     I find that the accused was not authorised to use the sale proceeds, which represented his direct benefits from his criminal conduct of CBT, to make the payments that he did in respect of the condominium, car, credit card and insurance policy.

80     I am satisfied and I find that the prosecution has proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused was convicted of all the CBT and CDSA charges.

## The Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

81     The punishment prescribed for the offence of CBT as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term up to 15 years and a liability to a fine.

82     The punishment prescribed for the CDSA offence is an imprisonment term up to 7 years or a fine up to $500,000.

### Sentence

83     Having considered the prosecution’s sentencing submission and the mitigation plea[^93] tendered by counsel for the accused, I sentenced the accused to the following individual and aggregate sentences:

### Reasons for Sentence

#### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

84     In her oral submission on sentence, the learned prosecutor submitted for custodial sentences in respect of all charges and for three sentences to run consecutively, making a global sentence of at least 40 months’ imprisonment.[^94] The DPP tendered a list of sentencing precedents in respect of both CBT and CDSA offences.[^95] The learned DPP further pointed out that the accused has made no restitution and also showed no remorse by claiming trial to the charges. The prosecution submitted that the sentences given in the sentencing precedents would have been discounted sentences because these were all ‘plead guilty’ cases and therefore, there must be an appropriate uplift to the sentences when applied to the present accused.

85     In respect of the CBT charges, the learned DPP relied, in particular, on the case of _PP v Wan Kam Lan_[^96]. In that case, the accused was an accounts executive whose responsibilities included the oversight of petty cash, preparing payment vouchers and company cheques that were pre-signed. The accused then made out the cheques to herself. She pleaded guilty to a number of charges including 2 CBT charges in respect of $125,000 and $404,000. For the $125,000 CBT charge (which amount is nearer to but still higher than the present 5th charge of $111,000), the sentence imposed in that case was 14 months’ imprisonment. Therefore, with an appropriate uplift, the prosecution submitted for 21 months’ imprisonment for the present 5th charge. On that basis, for the 6th charge ($54,000) and 7th charge ($49,000), the prosecution submitted for a sentence of about 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

86     In respect of the CDSA charges, the prosecution referred to her table of CDSA precedents and pointed out that for an amount of criminal benefits up to about $30,000, the sentence imposed was around 3 months’ imprisonment e.g. _PP v Jurelah Joy Credo Mendoza[^97]_ (which is also a CBT precedent). For larger amounts above $30,000, the sentence imposed was 6 months’ imprisonment and higher e.g. _PP v Koh Chek Seng._[^98] In the present case, the amounts of benefits range from $9,000 to $42,000.

87     I accept the prosecution’s sentencing submission. The individual and global sentences proposed are well within the normal range of sentences for CBT and CDSA offences in respect of the individual and global amounts involved in the present charges. The proposed sentences are also consistent with the precedents cited by the prosecution. Notwithstanding that these were unreported cases, they do serve as useful reference points. In any event, counsel for the accused did not seek to distinguish any of the precedents.

#### Mitigation

88     Counsel did not make any particular submission on sentence except that he asked for a non-custodial sentence.[^99] No particular reasons were offered to justify a non-custodial sentence. No sentencing precedents were cited either. In his very brief mitigation, counsel provided the accused’s personal and family circumstances, including the fact that his father has prostate cancer. In summary, counsel mitigated that the accused’s family will suffer financially and emotionally if the accused was imprisoned. Counsel also tendered a testimonial written no less by Sia who spoke well of the accused, as an outstanding employee, despite the offences. Counsel also urged the court to consider this as a private matter between RCS and the accused.

89     I considered the personal and family circumstances of the accused but these did not constitute mitigating factors and certainly not to the extent as to justify a non-custodial sentence. I also did not agree with counsel that this was a private matter between RCS and the accused, considering that the State had instituted criminal proceedings against the accused culminating in the present conviction. It would also be counter-intuitive and perverse to regard Sia’s kindness as a boss to be a mitigating factor to reduce the accused’s culpability when the accused had taken advantage of that kindness in committing the offences.

90     I also do not agree that no loss was occasioned. The accused did not make any restitution. He has maintained all along and even after his conviction that RCS did not own the excess copper cables. The accused’s defence (which I have rejected) is that the wastage belonged, instead, to the developer. Even on that assumption (which I have found to be wrong), the excess copper cables did not belong to the accused and he would still have to account to RCS (and ultimately to the developer) for the sale proceeds because it was RCS’ responsibility to dispose of the wastage for the developer. If the accused were to inform the developer that the excess copper cables belonged to them and have been sold for some $214,000, I am quite certain that the developer would have wanted the accused to hand over the money. At the end of the day, I find no legal basis or justification to impose a non-custodial sentence.

### Conclusion - Sentence

91     In summary, I accept the prosecution’s submission as to the appropriate individual and global sentences, which were consistent with the sentencing precedents. The personal and family circumstances canvassed did not amount to mitigating factors and would not warrant any substantial reduction in the sentences.

92     In my judgment, a fine would have been manifestly inadequate as a punishment with absolutely no deterrent effect on the accused who remains unrepentant and unremorseful, having contested his charges and not having made any restitution whatsoever.

93     Having weighed and balanced the accused’s mitigation plea against the sentencing factors and my findings as outlined above, and having regard to the all facts and circumstances of this case, the accused was sentenced to a global sentence of 39 months’ imprisonment.

94     In conclusion, I am of the view that the length of imprisonment sentence is justified and also sufficiently deterrent, appropriate and proportionate to the facts and circumstances of the case.
