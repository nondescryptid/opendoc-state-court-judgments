Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Immigration Act, Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9429/2020/01.\]

11 June 2020

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       After her Student’s Pass (STP) expired, the Accused, for reasons best known to her, remained in Singapore without reasonable cause for a period of 2 years, 10 months and 27 days. The Accused pleaded guilty to a single offence under s 15(1) punishable under s 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (IA). The Prosecution did not submit on the appropriate sentence and the Accused’s mitigation was unremarkable. I sentenced the Accused to 14 weeks’ imprisonment and fined her $2,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. She paid the fine and is currently serving the sentence of imprisonment. I now set out my reasons.

## Charge

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 15(1) punishable under s 15(3)(b) of the IA. The charge is as follows:

> You, MONICA RACHELLE VINCA ROSEA, are charged that you, FROM **06.07.2017** to **01.06.2020**, did contravene the provisions of Section 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), to wit, that without reasonable cause, you did remain in Singapore for a period of **2 years, 10 months and 27 days (1062 days)** after the expiry of the **Student’s Pass (STP)** issued to you on **29.02.2016** permitting you to remain in Singapore till **05.07.2017** and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 15(1), punishable under Section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act.

## Facts

3       The Accused is Monica Rachelle Vinca Rosea, a 23-year-old female Indonesian. The Accused was issued with an STP on 29 February 2016 for her to remain in Singapore for her studies. The STP was valid until 5 July 2017. Upon the expiry of the STP, the Accused neither left Singapore nor applied for an extension of stay. The Immigration and Checkpoint Authority’s (ICA) Data Processing Branch confirmed that they had not granted the Accused an extension of stay.

4       The Accused then remained in Singapore from 6 July 2017 until her arrest on 1 June 2020, a period of 2 years, 10 months and 27 days or 1062 days.

## Issue to be determined

5       The only issue to be determined was whether the sentence imposed was appropriate.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

6       Offences under s 15(1) are punishable under s 15(3)(b) IA if the Accused remains unlawfully in Singapore for a period exceeding 90 days and, in such a case, the Accused shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment not exceeding six months and with caning of not less than three strokes. As the Accused cannot be punished with caning pursuant to s 325(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) she shall also be punished with a fine not exceeding $6,000.

### Antecedents

7       The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

8       The Prosecution did not submit on the sentence.

### Mitigation

9       The Accused expressed remorse for the offence and asked for leniency and the “lightest of sentences”. She did not provide an explanation for why she had remained unlawfully in Singapore for almost three years or what she had done in Singapore during that time.

### Precedents

10     Neither the Prosecution nor the Accused relied on any sentencing precedents.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration for an offence of overstaying under s 15(1) p/u s 15(3)(b) IA

11     The relevant legislative provisions of the Immigration Act are as follows:

> **15.** —(1)    A person shall not remain in Singapore after the cancellation of any permit or certificate, or after the making of a declaration under section 14(4) or after the expiration or notification to him, in such manner as may be prescribed, or the cancellation of any pass relating to or issued to him unless he is otherwise entitle or authorised to remain in Singapore under the provisions of this Act or the regulations.

> **…**

> (3)    Any person who contravenes, without reasonable cause, this section shall be guilty of an offence and –

>> (a)    in the case where he remains unlawfully for a period not exceeding 90 days, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both;

>> (b)    In the case where he remains unlawfully for a period exceeding 90 days, shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and shall also, subject to section 325(1) and 330(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, be punished with caning with not less than 3 strokes, or where by virtue of that section he is not punishable with caning, he shall, in lieu of caning, be punished with a fine not exceeding $6,000.

12     In 1989, Parliament enacted amendments to the Immigration Act to address the rising tide of immigration offenders overstaying in excess of three months and to address the rising numbers of overstayers amongst the prison population. The penalty for overstaying in excess of 90 days was amended from an imprisonment term of between six months and two years and a fine of up to $6,000 to an imprisonment terms between three months and two years and caning of not less than three strokes. In explaining the need for the amendment the then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Dr Lee Boon Yang stated during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (26 January 1989), vol 52 at col 595):

> Long term overstayers not only blatantly break our immigration and employment laws but they also pose a threat to our society. By circumventing work permit rules to work here illegally, overstayers are not subject to stringent checks carried out by the Work Permit Department to weed out known criminals. They are also subjected to medical clearance imposed by the Work Permit Department. These overstayers threaten our law and order and may carry infectious diseases. Left undetected for too long, they may attempt to sink roots here, with even more serious long-term consequences to the society.

> We cannot afford to take a casual attitude towards this problem. If we do not take effective measures now, others will find it more attractive to enter or to stay illegally to work here or to seek their fortunes here. We are not against people coming to Singapore to work or even to seek their fortunes here. But they must do so lawfully.

> …

> Finally, Sir, the Bill seeks to introduce mandatory caning of at least three strokes and at least three months’ imprisonment for those who overstay 90 days or more or enter Singapore illegally. Our experience has shown that the present jail sentence of at least six month is not a sufficient deterrent. There is no point in wasting our valuable resources, both financial and manpower, by jailing and feeding immigration offenders for long periods of time. With the introduction of caning, the mandatory imprisonment for these overstayers and illegal immigrants will be reduced to three months and, at the same time, the penalty will become a more effective deterrent.

13     In 1989, Parliament further amended the punishment provisions for an offence of overstaying beyond 90 days. Parliament removed the mandatory minimum sentence of three months’ imprisonment reduced the maximum sentence from two years’ to six months’ imprisonment. The reasons for the amendment were articulated by the then Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (1 November 1995), vol 65 at col 78 to 79):

> Mr Speaker, Sir, clauses 3 and 5 of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill seek to amend section 6(3)(a) and section 15(3)(b) respectively to deal with immigration offenders. … Under section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act, the penalty for overstaying beyond 90 days is an imprisonment term of between three months and two years, and a minimum of three strokes of the cane. There is no fine. Clauses 3 and 5 of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill seek to amend section 6(3) and 15(3)(b) to remove the mandatory minimum sentence of three months’ jail term and to cap the maximum imprisonment term for illegal entry and overstaying at six months. There are two reasons for this. First, we do not want these foreigners to clog up our jails. As at 30th September this year, our prison capacity was exceeded by more than 36%. Immigration offenders constituted more than half, ie, 67.4% to be exact, or the 2,787 foreign prisoners. Secondly, by freeing up the jails, we will be able to prosecute more immigration offenders who may otherwise be let off the hook due to the prisons’ limited capacity. The mandatory caning provision will remain unchanged as caning has proved to be very effective; hardly any immigration offender who has been caned returns to Singapore. For persons who are not liable to be caned under our laws, that is, women and men above 50 years old, we have provided for them to be fined up to $6,000 instead.

14     Singapore’s economic success provides an incentive to foreigners to come to Singapore to seek employment. However, foreigners who come to Singapore illegally to seek their fortunes can bring a host of social, economic and security problems. To address these problems, Parliament enacted stiff punishments for the offence of overstaying in order to deter foreigners from illegally overstaying in Singapore.

15     It is a fact that the severity of the sentence of imprisonment for overstaying offences has decreased from a maximum of two years’ imprisonment to the current sentence of six months’ imprisonment and there is no longer a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment. However, it was apparent to me that the reason for the reduction was not because Parliament felt that deterrence was no longer the primary consideration but rather due to pressures associated with an increasing prison population. It was emphasised in 1989 that the imposition of mandatory caning was to enhance the deterrent aspect of the sentence and, in 1995, the effectiveness of caning as a deterrent was highlighted.

16     Foreigners have to be discouraged from illegal overstaying in Singapore. Such overstayers pose significant problems to our manpower situation as the overstayers may seek illegal employment. As stated at paragraph 14 above, overstayers can give rise to a host of social, economic and security concerns. In extreme cases, where the overstayers are unable to obtain a steady income from legitimate sources they may resort to committing crimes. Overstaying can also give rise to potential exploitation of these workers, because there are no safeguards as to their working conditions or with regard to the salary that employers can pay them. There is no overview over where they reside. Finally, these offences are hard to detect. For these reasons I found that general deterrence was the key sentencing consideration for offences under section 15(1) p/u s 15(3)(b) IA.

#### Sentencing principles

17     In _PP v Nomana Intekhab Hadi_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 342</span>, the District Judge stated at \[15\] that the “main factors for sentencing of overstayers are the length of time of the illegal stay and the purpose of the overstaying”. I am in agreement with the District Judge’s findings.

18     In the present case, the Accused had overstayed for 2 years, 10 months and 27 days or 1062 days. I found that this was a considerable period. Unfortunately, the Statement of Facts was bereft of details, as there was no indication as to what the Accused had done in Singapore after her STP had expired. The Accused also did not elaborate on either what she had done in Singapore or her reasons for remaining in Singapore. Therefore, the only factor that I relied on in deciding the appropriate sentence was the length of the Accused’s overstaying. I found that the length of the sentence should be commensurate with the length of overstaying, in that the longer the overstaying the more severe the sentence.

#### Precedent cases

19     The following precedent cases are instructive on the range of sentences that are imposed for s 15(1) p/u 15(3)(b) offences:

> (a)      _PP v Nicole Louise Sobotker_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 75</span>: the Accused had overstayed for a period of 208 days. The District Judge held at \[15\] that the sentencing principle for offences under s 15(1) p/u s 15(3)(b) IA was deterrence to ensure that Singapore’s immigration policies were strictly adhered to. The District Judge did not accept the Accused’s explanation that she committed the offence because of wrong advice. Based on sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, the District Judge held that the sentencing trend for periods of overstaying between four to six months was a sentence of four to six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine in the region of $2,000. The District Judge sentenced the Accused, who had pleaded guilty, to five weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 in default eight days’ imprisonment. I found that as the current Accused overstayed for a longer period her sentence should be more severe.

> (b)      _PP v Ly Van Phuc_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 278</span>: the Accused had overstayed for 349 days. The Accused’s employer had cancelled his work permit as he had left his employment without informing his employer. The District Judge noted at \[10\] that based on the Prosecution’s table of precedents a sentence of six weeks imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was the norm for an overstaying period of 349 days. The District Judge did not accept that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. She sentenced the Accused to eight weeks’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. I found that as the current Accused overstayed for a longer period her sentence should be more severe.

> (c)      _PP v Qiu Xiaoyan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 133</span>: the Accused had overstayed for 365 days. The Prosecution had not submitted on sentence. The District Judge took into account at \[12\] that the Accused had overstayed for a substantial period, that she had managed to evade detection and that she had not pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. She further noted at \[13\] that the “norm for such offenders would be an imprisonment term of two months’ imprisonment and a fine in the region of $1,500 to $2,000”. The District Judge sentenced the Accused to six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,500. I found that as the current Accused overstayed for a longer period her sentence should be more severe.

> (d)      _Nomana Intekhab Hadi_: the Accused had overstayed for a period of 942 days. The District Judge took into account the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution and he held, at \[15\], that “an overstaying period in excess of 2 years would attract sentences from 3 to 4 months and caning of 3 to 4 strokes. The Accused claimed she overstayed because the process of applying for a Student Visa to the US was tedious and when she realised that she had overstayed she panicked and decided not to surrender. The District Judge appeared to have given little weight to the Accused’s explanation. He sentenced her to four months’ imprisonment and a fine of $4,000. I found that this case, in terms of the length of overstaying, bore similarities to the current case.

> (e)      _PP v Kong Pui Ching_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 46</span>: the Accused had overstayed for 139 days. The Accused claimed that she had been misled into believing that she was residing in Singapore legally. The District Judge held that the case was unexceptional and he imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,500. I found that as the current Accused overstayed for a longer period her sentence should be more severe.

20     I found that it was apparent from the above cases that there was a correlation between the period of overstaying and the length of the sentence. I found that based on the current Accused’s period of overstaying a sentence of between three to four months and a fine of $2000 to $3000 would be appropriate. The period of overstaying in the present case was similar to the period in _Nomana Intekhab Hadi_ and, in view of the sentence imposed in that case, I concluded that the starting point of the sentence that I arrived at was reasonable.

#### Mitigation

21     I accepted that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and that this was indicative of her remorse. However, apart from this, there were no other factors that would warrant a sentencing discount.

## Conclusion

22     Taking into account that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity I imposed a sentence of 14 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. I am of the opinion that in view of the length of the Accused’s overstaying the sentence was appropriate. I backdated the sentence to commence on 2 June 2020, the start date of the Accused’s remand.
