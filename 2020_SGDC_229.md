### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## Introduction

1       This case, which is the progenitor of three separate appeals, concerns the dealings of the accused; Mr Lim Kuan Ngee (“Mr Lim”) who faced 24 charges under Section 47(3) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) for repeated dealings with large quantities of stolen _Fuji Xerox_ printer toners, which were filled cartridges intended for use in heavy duty printers installed in companies and institutions which required such industrial capacity machines. The toners were cylindrically shaped and filled with powdered toner dye. These came in sets packed with the said powdered toner in the four colours of cyan (blue), yellow, magenta (red) and black. The assessment of whether the toner cartridges were new (and their remaining capacity if they were not), could be determined by weighing the cartridges, with lightened cartridges being the tell-tale indicia of their prior use. The toner cartridges were also equipped with a microchip which indicated that the toner was empty.

2       The proceeded charges arose from Mr Lim’s purchase at least 40 such toners on 24 separate occasions. Mr Lim had acquired substantial quantities of toners from three individuals, Muhammad Shahrin Bin Kasamen (“Mr Shahrin”), Redzuan Bin Margono (“Mr Redzuan”) and Mohammad Azwan bin Ahmad (“Mr Azwan”), who were employees of _Fuji Xerox_ Singapore (“_Fuji Xerox_”). The problem with this series of acquisitions was the fact that all of the toner cartridges had been purloined items, obtained from _Fuji Xerox_ as part of a deeply premeditated conspiracy by the three men. The fundamental question in this case thus was **_whether_**, **_how_** and **_when_** Mr Lim (who had dealt directly only with Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan) would have been aware of the dubious _provenance_ of the printer toners.

### Background facts

3       The prosecution contends (and the defence does not disagree) that the toners Mr Lim acquired were benefits from criminal conduct, as Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan had been entrusted with these toners by their employer, Fuji Xerox Singapore (“_Fuji Xerox_”) while they were assigned to service corporate clients which included BNP Paribas. In this regard, Mr Shahrin, Mr Redzuan and Mr Azwan have readily confirmed that the toners sold to Mr Lim were misappropriated from _Fuji Xerox_.

4       The criminal activity had been possible because of exploitable gaps in _Fuji Xerox’_ work system. These areas of vulnerability were duly exploited by Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan, who had ordered extraneous quantities of toners, which were well above the operational needs to service their corporate clients, to facilitate their acts of criminal misappropriation. Both Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan have pleaded guilty and been sentenced for their respective offences, and Mr Redzuan disciplined by _Fuji Xerox_.

5       Where there are no issues of the fact of Mr Lim’s purchase of the toners from Mr Redzuan (as well as his familiarity with Mr Shahrin), and their identity as benefits from criminal conduct, the remaining issues would include the quantity of the tones, and whether they conformed to the charge that at least forty separate toners had been purchased on each occasion. It should be noted that the toners came in sets with one set of toners containing four toner cartridges of different colours – black, cyan, magenta and yellow. The charges do not purport to state the exact quantity of the stolen printer toners supplied, with the prosecution’s charges stated the minimum quantities supplied over certain regular intervals.

6       As this genre of CDSA offences involve the **_‘downstream’_** activities of processing and handling of proceeds of crime, the inevitable question in issue would be the nature and extent of the accused person’s knowledge of the predicate offence. Hence, the principal question connected to criminal culpability is whether Mr Lim had reasonable grounds to believe that the toners he purchased from Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan were benefits from criminal conduct.

7       Mr Lim’s case is essentially that he had no intent to deal in stolen goods, and he had been lulled by his belief that Mr Redzuan (who had fronted the transactions for the group of errant _Fuji Xerox_ employees) had been a deliveryman who had come across the toners in the course of his work, and been permitted to collect them to dispose of the items at his own discretion. It is not disputed that Mr Shahrin, who had often accompanied Mr Redzuan, had remained in the background, and not made any representations to the accused

8       It is a relevant aspect of this case, especially in deriving an appropriate tariff against Mr Lim’s manner of offending, that two of the three implicated men; Mr Azwan and Mr Shahrin, had also supplied toners to **_another_** individual **_Mr Sahirudin Bin Ibrahim[^1]_**. In certain aspects, Mr Sahirudin seemed more complicit, as he had, from his admissions in the Statement of Facts, actually gone to _Fuji Xerox’s_ premises and provided logistical support in collecting the purloined printer toners.

### The appeals

9       I had acquitted Mr Lim for the first charge; DAC-921691-2017, where Mr Lim stood accused of acquiring 40 printer toners despite reasonable grounds to believe that these toners had been the benefits of criminal conduct on a **_“first occasion”_** of a period which spanned 2014 to 2015 I was not convinced that Mr Lim’s _mens rea_ had been proven beyond reasonable doubt in respect of his receipt of toners on this first occasion, which was also first physical encounter with a co-offender; Mr Redzuan Bin Margono. This formed the basis of the prosecution’s appeal against acquittal in **MA-9177-2020-01**. The next appeal; **MA-9524-2020-01**, had been filed by the accused in respect of his convictions, and the sentences meted, for the remaining 23 charges. The third appeal; **MA-9524-2020-02**, had been lodged by the prosecution against the same sentences imposed for the said 23 charges.

### The charges

10     The twenty-four charges were framed similarly. The first charge as set down below should serve as a representative reference to the other twenty-three, which of course ran _in seriatim_ to reflect the twenty-four instances where Mr Lim had transacted with the Mr Shahrin to obtain at least the specified quantity of printer toners despite having a reasonable basis to believe that these were benefits from criminal conduct. The first charge[^2], preferred in its original form against Mr Lim on 16 April 2018 charges the accused, a Singaporean, then aged 51 was as follows:

> (_Mr Lim is_) charged that (_he_), on a 1st occasion sometime between 2014 and 2015, in Singapore, having reasonable grounds to believe that certain property was another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, acquired that property, _to wit_, (that he) purchased at least 40 printer toners from Muhammed Shahrin Bin Kasamen, and (_he has_) thereby committed an offence under section 47(3) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed), punishable under section 47(6)(a) of the same Act.

11     At the close of prosecution’s case, the Public Prosecutor applied to amend the charge[^3] to also reflect “_Redzuan Bin Margono_”, when it became evident in the course of proceedings that Mr Redzuan was a contributor to the pool of toners received by the accused, albeit his taking from _Fuji Xerox_ was on a smaller scale than Mr Shahrin’s misappropriations.

### The Law

12     The applicable provisions would be sections 47(3) and 47(6) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”). Section 47(3) of the CDSA states:

> (3)    Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, acquires that property, or has possession of or uses such property, shall be guilty of an offence.

13     Section 47(6) of the CDSA provides the following punishments:

> (6)    Any person who commits an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction —

>> (a)    if the person is an individual, to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both;

>> or (b) if the person is not an individual, to a fine not exceeding $1 million.

### The parties

14     The following witnesses were called in the course of the trial:

> (a)     PW1 SSI Colin Joseph

>> (_Investigation officer_)

> (b)     PW2 Lai Toh Meng

>> (_Fuji Xerox Operations Manager_)

> (c)     PW3 Stephanie Yoong Sook Fah

>> (_Fuji Xerox Senior Manager_)

> (d)     PW4 Ryan Goh Ming Hai

>> _(Fuji Xerox Customer Service Manager)_

> (e)     PW5 Muhammad Shahrin Bin Kasamen

>> _(Offender in predicate offence_)

> (f)     PW6 Redzuan Bin Margono

>> _(Unprosecuted person implicated in predicate offence)_

> (g)     PW7 Muhammad Azwan Bin Ahmad

>> (_Offender in predicate offence_)

> (h)     DW1 Lim Kuan Ngee

>> (_Accused_)

> (i)     DW2 Nur Liyana Binte Johal

>> (_Employee of Accused’s firm)_

### Connected parties

15     There were in actuality four individuals connected to the pillage of toners from _Fuji Xerox_; Mr Shahrin, Mr Azwan, Mr Redzuan, and a fourth individual; Ismail Bin Jaffar. The scope of their duties included the monitoring of usage of the site they had been assigned to, and re-stocking by the ordering of printer toners to replace the depleted cartridges. Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan were assigned to service _Fuji Xerox_ printers in BNP Paribas Bank[^4], Mr Redzuan at ANZ Bank, with Mr Ismail assigned to Republic Polytechnic. Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan had supplied the toners to the accused; Mr Lim, while Mr Azwan had been Mr Sahirudin’s source. Mr Sahirudin had, in turn, supplied toners to a certain Neo Teck Heng, at a profit.

16     As indicated above, there is no dispute whatsoever that the toners Mr Lim acquired were benefits from criminal conduct. All parties agreed to the position of Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan having been entrusted with these toners by their employer, _Fuji Xerox_ while they were assigned to service corporate clients such as BNP Paribas and ANZ Bank. By the same taken, Mr Shahrin, Mr Redzuan and Mr Azwan have been equally explicit that the toners sold to Mr Lim were misappropriated from _Fuji Xerox_, using exploitable gaps in Fuji Xerox’ work system, to order enormous quantities of toners to facilitate their acts of criminal misappropriation.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

### Evidence of PW1 SSI Colin Joseph

17     SSI Joseph had been assigned to the case upon receipt, on 26 February 2016, of the first information report from _Fuji Xerox_ HR Manager Stephanie Yoong that four staff members had taken _Fuji Xerox_ toners for reselling. The first information report also stated that one had admitted to the criminal acts and been allowed to leave but the other three were still in _Fuji Xerox_ premises. After Mr Lim had been implicated by the errant Fuji Xerox staff members, SSI Joseph had called Mr Lim to attend at Central police Division on 27 February 2016, where the first of three statements had been recorded. The contents of these statements will be stated and analysed later in these grounds. The investigating officer informed that Mr Lim had attended on his own accord, after requesting a deferment of several hours to attend to business exigencies.

## ACCOUNTS OF FUJI XEROX OFFICERS

### Evidence of PW2 Lai Toh Meng

18     Mr Lai was a Service Director at _Fuji Xerox_, having worked in the organisation since 1996. His testimony afforded valuable contextual information on aspects of _Fuji Xerox’s_ work processes. _Fuji Xerox_ supplied “multi-functional devices” to their clients who entered into service contracts for the machines to be installed into their corporate premises to support their business operations. The multi-functional devices had copier, fax machine, printer, and scanner functionalities[^5]. For ease of reference, I will refer to the machines as “copiers”, despite their ubiquitous “multi-functional” qualities. The copiers operated on an industrial scale, with a single toner cartridge capable of printing 15 000 pages.

### Work process for replacement of used toners

19     Mr Toh led teams of engineers and technicians, whose primary functions were to ensure that the machines were adequately maintained and serviced. For corporate or institutional customers who had signed service contracts for a large number of machines (BNP Paribas for example had 69 machines in three sites and required two on-site technicians), a cadre of Document Management Service (DMS) technicians from _Fuji Xerox_ would administer and fulfil customers’ needs on areas _on site_ at their business premises. Their duties included checking, cleaning, servicing (such as paper-jam resolution), as well as the replenishment of toner cartridges when they ran low. DMS technicians could make requests for toner replenishment by contacting their Kuala Lumpur Customer Service Centre (KLCSC) in Malaysia, by indicating the serial number of the machine, and stating how many toners they needed.[^6] The request would be relayed electronically by agents there to locally based Singapore Asian Logistics Centre (ALC) where the toners were stored. The ALC would, in turn, print the deliver order with the customer company’s name, address and requestor’s particulars, and arrange for the toners to be sent by an operations crew to the specific site from where the request had emanated, to be picked by the on-site DMS technicians.

### Anomalies observed in usage patterns

20     Mr Toh had noted anomalous consumption patterns in certain institutions which had leased _Fuji Xerox_ machines. These were ANZ Bank, BNP Paribas Bank and Republic Polytechnic. He became concerned when replenishment requests had come in from these sites for toners which had printed just 2000-3000 copies, rather than run out at a level closer to their designed 15 000 copy capacity. The other anomaly in usage pattern other than the orders for replacement was after very few copies were created, was the fact that all the four colours appeared to be being **_uniformly_** consumed, where he would have expected the black toner to bear the brunt of use when the machines were utilized in financial institutions, such as ANZ Bank. Mr Toh explained that the converse would occur for machines in a book printing company, where the Magenta, Yellow and Cyan toners would run out faster than the black toner, as the company would principally engage in full colour printing.

### Price of Fuji Xerox toners for customers who were not under a service contract

21     Mr Toh indicated that the toners would be supplied free as part of a service contract while the machine was leased to a corporate customer. Former customers who were no longer under a service contract who still retained _Fuji Xerox_ printers could purchase the toner sets at $520.53 for (comprising four toners of cyan, yellow, magenta and black cartridges). The black cartridge was priced at $61.28, while the cyan and yellow priced at $153.07 and the magenta cartridge costing $153.11.[^7]

### Evidence of PW3 Stephanie Yoong Sook Fah

22     Ms Stephanie Yoong worked as a Senior Manager in the areas of Human Resource Management (HR), Business Partnering and Rewards under the Human Capital and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Department at _Fuji Xerox_. Within the context of the present proceedings, she oversaw industrial relations and employee discipline. Ms Yoong had been a HR manager for three years[^8]. In this capacity, Ms Yoong had notified police on 26 February 2016 with the contents documented in a police report[^9] after she had had been made aware of the misconduct of four _Fuji Xerox_ officers, which had been uncovered when a significant toner discrepancy had been noted. This discrepancy had been uncovered when the industrial copiers registered vast differences between the number of copies printed and the number of toners ordered[^10]. _Fuji Xerox’s_ Service and Technical Operations had identified the four staff members involved, and Messrs Redzuan, Azwan, Shahrin and Ismail had been interviewed. Ms Yoong had separately interviewed Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan, while other staff members had interviewed Mr Redzuan and Mr Ismail.[^11]

### Admissions by errant Fuji Xerox staff

23     Initially only Redzuan had admitted to misappropriating the printer toners, and the other three had denied any wrongdoing. Mr Redzuan had been dismissed, and police intervention had been sought at that juncture. Mr Ismail and Mr Shahrin had eventually conceded later and admitted to the systematic toner misappropriations. Mr Shahrin had later also admitted to acting in concert with Mr Azwan. After the call to the police, Mr Shahrin’s stance had softened, and he had penned a confession and tendered this to Ms Yoong at 1.30 pm in the afternoon of 26 February 2016.

24     Mr Shahrin’s admission states as follows:

> I admitted selling the toners at $140 per set. 40 sets per month. Share with my colleague Azwan. Sell it to Azwan’s friend. I don’t have his contact number.

> (Cancellation)

> Previously to a printing company One Copier at $130 per set to Mr Mike in 2014.

> Estimated $140 800, was shared between me and Azwan.

Muhammad Shahrin

> 1.20 pm

> 26.2.16

> I undertake to pay the company (Fuji Xerox Sg Pte Ltd) the amount of $70 400 by instalment when I find a job.

25     Mr Azwan had taken longer to acknowledge his wrongdoing. He had been suspended by Fuji Xerox upon suspicion of his complicity in the toner misappropriations. Mr Azwan had, days later, recanted. Ms Yoong understood that Mr Azwan had “_confessed at the police station_” the day after his arrest by police[^12]. Mr Azwan had returned to _Fuji Xerox_ to come clean and had confessed to Ms Yoong that “_he took the toners for reselling_”[^13], and had also penned what she termed as “_a confession statement_.”

26     Mr Azwan’s admission[^14] states

> Firstly, I would like to apologise for my wrong doings. SORRY to let everyone down, I really regretted for what I have done.

> I have already confessed to the Police on 27 February 2018 when I was brought back for interrogation at Cantonment Complex. I spoke to the investigation officer, Colin Joseph that I have to report there again on 11 March 2016 to assist with the investigations.

> Lastly, I really hope that the FX management will withdraw the charges against me. In order for me to move on and look for a job. I am guilty and pleading for leniency. I hope my good service for FX and BNP will be looked into.

> I have sold the toners twice a month but not consistent. At times we didn’t sell it at all. Each time it is about 40-60 sets selling at $35 per cartridge, $140 per set. I can’t recall how much in total I have sold the cartridge. We started doing in in late 2014. Per month, we sell it once or twice and sometimes none. Estimate amount is $119 000. I sold to Mike and Din. I don’t have the contacts for Mike.

> I’m willing to pay back by instalment once I get a new job.

> I will inform FX.

( _Signed_)

### Availability of printers and toners in the open market

27     The availability of _Fuji Xerox_ printers and toners in the open market, and their operation out of _Fuji Xerox’s_ supply chain was relevant in the proceedings against Mr Lim as they would tie in with his reasons for handling the illicitly obtained printer toners, and whether (and when) he might have been aware that these were stolen goods. At cross-examination, Ms Yoong agreed with defence counsel’s suggestion that while _Fuji Xerox_ ordinarily placed the copier machines on leasing agreements, they might become available as outright purchases. In such outright purchases, the owner was not obliged to enter any agreement for _Fuji Xerox_ to supply printer toners and was thus free to purchase those in the open market. She also agreed with defence counsel that these multifunctional printer machines could also find their way into the open market when finance companies paid off on the full leased period, or upon default by the user of these machines in the servicing of the instalments[^15]. She also agreed with counsel’s suggestion that _Fuji Xerox_ was in no position to dictate to the finance company what it should do with such machine as the finance company had effectively “_paid for the machine_”.[^16] Ms Yoong did not have any particular knowledge of how such machines, which were no longer managed by _Fuji Xerox_, changed hands among used goods dealers. She was also not aware if _Fuji Xerox_ printers could be sourced from parallel imports.

28     On the subject of the printer toners, Ms Yoong was not aware of any instance where finance companies had taken unused toners upon the repossession of _Fuji Xerox_ printers under a lease agreement.[^17] Ms Yoong was also unaware of any after-market trade in used or partially used toners, after counsel suggested that there was active trading by “_dealers in second-hand toners_” who “_charge very much lower prices than the price quoted by_ (Fuji Xerox”.

### Evidence of PW4 Ryan Goh Ming Hai

29     Mr Goh, who had been a Customer Service Officer in _Fuji Xerox_ Singapore, for ten years, indicated that large corporations and institutions would enter into leading contracts with _Fuji Xerox_, and might require 20-30 machines to fulfil their printing needs. A cadre of document management service (DMS) personnel were stationed on site to fulfil the needs of these clients. Among other maintenance responsibilities, DMS personnel would be responsible for re-ordering printer toners. Leases were usually for a term of five years. When the lease came to term, and where there was no re-contract, it was the practice for _Fuji Xerox’s_ sales and the DMS personnel to arrange the machine to “_be pulled back to the warehouse_.”[^18]Some of these machines would be refurbished, and sold to customers. Other machines which were deemed past their useful lives would be scrapped for parts.

30     Mr Goh indicated that a process existed for the toners to be dealt with when machines were removed from the site of their deployment. Used toners would be disposed of by a cadre of DMS personnel, whom he re. Unused toners recovered from the deployment site which had never been opened would be collected and aggregated for a “_quality check_”. Such unopened toners which were still within their” shelf life span” of not more than two years from the date of manufacture would be “_reissued”_ to existing customers[^19].

31     Mr Goh stated that _Fuji Xerox_ did supply toners in restricted circumstances. Printer toners were supplied to customers that has previously leased, and subsequently bought over the machines from _Fuji Xerox_. Customers could purchase the machines after leasing for five years. Upon the expiration of this contract, customers could opt not to re-contract. These customers could opt to retain the machines by a direct purchase, as these machines were “_still working well_”. These customers could “_request to buy toner_” from _Fuji Xerox_[^20] at prices set by their Japanese headquarters, Mr Goh indicated that the supply of toners in this manner was only done with former lessees and purchasers who were in their customer database. There were no other avenues for direct dealings with printer toners, as these toners were **_not_** separately sold in the open market by _Fuji Xerox_. In this regard, Mr Goh was categorical in stating:[^21].

> Q    How about customers who have not leased from you or brought machines from you previously?

> A    If the customer database is not in our system, we will not sell the toner to them.

> Q    Do you know if Fuji Xerox Singapore sell toners in the marketplace?

> A    No, we don’t sell toner in the marketplace.

## EVIDENCE OF CO-OFFENDING PERSONS

### Conviction and sentencing of Azwan and Shahrin

32     The Public Prosecutor had secured pleas of guilt from both Mr Azwan and Mr Shahrin. The Joint Statement of Facts for _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Azwan Bin Ahmad & Muhammad Shahrin Bin Kasamen[^22]_ sets out the facts admitted by the two men in respect of the precursor offence of misappropriation, and offers essential contextual information of the prosecution’s case.

> JOINT STATEMENT OF FACTS

> 1.    The complainant is Lai Toh Meng, (_particulars_) a director for the Service department of Fuji Xerox Singapore Pte Ltd (“Fuji Xerox”), located at (_address_) Fuji Xerox Tower, Singapore. Fuji Xerox provides document services to its clients. This involves, among other things, providing photocopying machines to their clients and providing printer toners for these machines to their clients.

> 2.    The accused persons are:

>> a.    Muhammad Azwan Bin Ahmad (“Azwan”), male, 37 years old,

>> b.    Muhammed Shahrin Bin Kasamen (“Shahrin”), male, 39 years old,

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 3.    On 26 February 2016 at around 12.40p.m., the complainant made a phone call to the police, informing them that Shahrin and Azwan had ordered excessive printer toners and when confronted, had admitted to have sold them to third parties for cash.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-921720-2017 & DAC-921718-2017**

> 4.    Between 2014 and 2016, Azwan and Shahrin were employed by Fuji Xerox as document management services officers and on-site representatives for Fuji Xerox attached to BNP Paribas Pte Ltd (“BNP”), Singapore. Their duties involved changing the printer toners for BNP’s photocopying machines when the need arose. They were also required to order more printer toners from Fuji Xerox. These printer toners would be used to service BNP’s photocopying machines. After receiving orders from Shahrin or Azwan by phone calls, Fuji Xerox would deliver the toners to Shahrin or Azwan. Both of them were supposed to store the printer toners in a cabinet at BNP’s Singapore office. The printer toners were to be used only for servicing BNP’s photocopying machines. In their capacity as employees of Fuji Xerox, Shahrin and Azwan were entrusted with dominion over the printer toners they had ordered from their employer, Fuji Xerox.

> 5.    Sometime between 2014 and 2016, Shahrin and Azwan engaged in a conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust of the printer toners by ordering an excess number of printer toners and subsequently misappropriating them by selling them to third parties without their employer’s knowledge. Shahrin and Azwan claimed they shared the earnings from selling the printer toners equally.

> 6.     _Pursuant to the conspiracy, between 2014 and 2015, having been entrusted with dominion over at least 960 printer toners ordered from Fuji Xerox by Azwan and Shahrin, Azwan and Shahrin dishonestly misappropriated them when_ **_Shahrin sold the toners to one Lim Kuan Ngee, on 24 separate occasions_**. A set includes a black toner, cyan toner, magenta toner and yellow toner. After receiving the toners from Fuji Xerox, **_Shahrin would bring the toners to Lim’s shop. These toners would be sold to Lim for at least S$110 per set. The amount earned from the sale of these 960 toners was at least S$26,400._**

> 7.    According to a sample quotation dated May 2016 (at Annex A), the retail price of a black toner is S$61.28 and the retail price of colour toners is around S$153. Based on this sample quotation, the total retail value of the 960 printer toners misappropriated is at least S$58,828.80.

> 8.    The cost price of a black toner is about S$22 and the cost price of colour toners is about S$56. The total cost price of the 960 printer toners misappropriated is at least S$21,120.

> 9.    By virtue of the foregoing, Azwan and Shahrin have committed an offence punishable under Section 408 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

> 10.    Investigations revealed that between 2015 and 2016, on four separate occasions, **_Azwan and Shahrin also misappropriated at least 160 additional printer toners by selling them to one Sahirudin bin Ibrahim, (“Sahirudin”) at S$35 per toner._**

> 11.    Therefore, Azwan and Shahrin misappropriated at least 1,120 printer toners between 2014 and 2016. Based on the sample quotation in Annex A, the total retail value of these 1,120 printer toners would be at least S$68,633.60. The total cost price of the 1,120 printer toners misappropriated is at least S$24,640. The total amount earned by Azwan and Shahrin from selling these 1,120 printer toners was at least S$32,000. No restitution has been made by both of them to date.

> \[Emphasis added\]

33     It should be noted that the Joint Statement of Facts references not just Mr Lim, but also the other recipient; Sahirudin bin Ibrahim. Essentially the two co-offenders admitted to the supply of the misappropriated toners to just these two individuals, with Mr Sahirudin receiving just 160 toners, and Mr Lim receiving, by far, the lion’s share of the haul, stated here to be 1120 separate toners.

## Testimonial evidence of co-accused persons at trial

### Evidence of PW 5 Shahrin Bin Kasamen

34     Aside from the explicit admissions in the Joint Statement of Facts the prosecution sought to establish Mr Lim’s purchase of at least 40 printer toners from each of his encounters with Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan on 24 occasions between 2014 and 2015 from their court testimonies.

### Initiation of relationship between co-accused and accused

35     At trial, Mr Shahrin testified Mr Redzuan had instigated him to order excess toners for the purpose of misappropriating and selling these excess toners. The two would work as a team to misappropriate the printer toners from _Fuji Xerox_ and source for buyers from 2014 to 2016, when Mr Shahrin serviced the machines at BNP Paribas Bank. Mr Shahrin had sought out buyers for the misappropriated toners and had used the Google search to find Mr Lim’s sole proprietorship establishment; One Copier and Office Supplies (“_One Copier_”)[^23]. When had had called the number indicated on the website of Mr Lim’s business, Mr Lim (whom Mr Shahrin referred to as “_Mr. Mike_” had pick up the call. Mr Redzuan and Mr Lim had then engaged in a discussion where he had quoted a price which Mr Shahrin found to be “_quite reasonable for us_”[^24], as the agreed quantum had been higher than the price that had been quoted by a previous buyer. The agreement was thus for each supplied set (of four toners) to change hands at a sum of $140. This was considerably higher than the “less than $100” they had obtained from Mr Redzuan’s former buyer.

36     Mr Shahrin estimated his supply to the accused to be some 20 **_sets_** of toners each time at S$140 per set at intervals of about twice a month from 2014 to 2015. Which somewhat taciturn and concise in speech, his evidence was clear and specific, as can be seen in the reproduced passage[^25]:

> Q     **_How often do you sell toners to Mike in a month?_**

> A     **_Twice a month._**

> Q    Was it always twice a month?

> A    Sometime, uh, 3 times, it depends.

> Q     **_Okay. And how many toners each time?_**

> A     **_Uh_** _(clears throat)_, **_20 sets each._**

> Q    And you mentioned each set contains 4 toners?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Of different colours?

> A    Yes.

> \[Emphasis added\]

37     The deliveries were on occasion made with the assistance of Mr Redzuan’s friend whom he knew as “_Bong_”. According to Mr Shahrin, Mr Redzuan would usually be one who dealt with Mr Lim, but Mr Shahrin would himself step in to front the transaction at Mr Lim’s office if the former were not free. Mr Shahrin indicated that their usual arrangement was to place a call to Mr Lim to state that they had toners to sell. Mr Redzuan would check with Mr Shahrin if he also had his own batch of misappropriated toners to deliver. If both men had toners to dispose of, they would go together.

### Idiosyncratic mode of delivery and payment

38     The presentation, inspection and payment, as described by Mr Shahrin appeared somewhat idiosyncratic in the level of wariness displayed by the accused, and, in my view, relevant in the evaluation of the case, and hence will be described in these grounds, Mr Shahrin recalled that Mr Lim’s business premises were on the fifth floor, and they would take a cargo lift, and upon reaching the premises, announce their presence at the intercom. The receptionist would be expecting Redzuan, and she would open the door. The men would then push the toners in and go to Mr Lim’s office, where they would proceed to unload the toners in a storage area where he kept his stock of toners.

39     Mr Lim would first inspect the toners, and according to Mr Shahrin[^26]:

> (A)fter he see the goods, then he will go inside his office, then we have to wait for a while then he will call us. We go inside his office and he will give me the cash.

40     Mr Shahrin recalled that the cash would be in $50 notes, and Mr Lim had would bind the stack in a rubber band or place the sum in a plastic bag. He recalled that this was a considerable sum, agreeing with the DPP that the transactions of 20 sets of toners at the agreed price of $140, would net a sum of $2,800, which was actually considerably in excess of the $1400 to $1600 he drew as his monthly salary from _Fuji Xerox_. Mr Shahrin indicated that he never bothered to **count** the sum of monies proffered in Mr Lim’s presence, as he assumed the sum would be correct, _per_ their agreed rate, and because he regarded the monies received from the toners to simply be unearned fruits of his criminal activity, and thus did not see the need to be niggardly or calculative about what he was paid.

### Waning and cessation of dealings

41     Mr Shahrin indicated that this lucrative arrangement came to an end after the parties came at loggerheads over the price of the printers, upon Mr Lim unilaterally reducing his price to $110 per set contending that “_the market is not good_”[^27].

### Cross examination of Shahrin Bin Kasamen

42     Mr Shahrin conceded that he and Mr Redzuan had never revealed to Mr Lim that they worked at _Fuji Xerox_, much less that the two men were trafficking in “_stolen property_”[^28]. He also agreed with counsel’s suggestion that the fact that Mr Lim had inquired on his ability to supply Canon toners pointed to the accused’s ignorance that he worked at _Fuji Xerox_. After these concessions, the cross-examination took a markedly less genteel tone as counsel sought to question the accuracy of Mr Shahrin’s recall on the frequency of the trips to Mr Lim’s office and the quantity of toners brought during these excursions.

### Whether the toners were invariably delivered and sold to accused on an at least fortnightly basis

43     In a bid to cast doubt on the prosecution’s case that the toner transactions had occurred on (at least) fortnightly intervals, defence counsel queried Mr Shahrin’s response in a statement recorded by investigation officer SIO Colin Joseph on 24 September 2018 where he had indicated that “_The toners were sold mostly at an average of twice a month but there were months that no toners were sold to Mike_ (i.e. Mr Lim)”[^29]. Mr Shahrin clarified that he had meant “_The months that I never sell to him was the end of the year which he already decrease_ (sic) _the price that I refuse to sell to him_.”[^30]

44     A closer reading of Mr Shahrin’s entire answer in the statement shows that his explanation is consistent with the witness’ response in his court testimony. The statemen, as recorded by SIO Colin, showed Mr Shahrin to be prone to stream-of-consciousness replies which tended to obfuscate what he intended to convey (which also added considerably to the prolixity of the document). The meaning, nevertheless, seems clear that the supply was curtailed **_only_** upon the souring of the relationship and the co-offenders’ finding of a new “customer” offering better terms. This **_immediate_** reference to their disaffection with Mr Lim’s unilateral price reduction in the next sentence showed this to be the case, rather than counsel’s suggestion that their visits and supply were intermittent and irregular while their trading relationship was extant, and based on the original set price of $140 per set of toners:

> 10    (Mr Lim) doesn’t need to make the order from me for the toners. I had gone to (Mr Lim’s) shop at (business address) together with (Mr Redzuan), I never spoke to (Mr Lim) unless I went to his shop alone, Probably because (Mr Redzuan) could not make it to the shop. (Mr Lim) never gave me any receipt for the toners that he bought from me. The last time I sent the toners is sometime in May or June 2015. The toners were sold mostly at an average of twice a month but there were months that no toners were sold to (Mr Lim) **_The pricing with_** (Mr Lim) **_also started to drop_** and I always needed to wait for (Mr Redzuan) as (he) would assist to bring the toners to (Mr Lim) when he is going to (Mr Lim’s) office to sell his own toners. **_As such Azwan and I needed to change our buyer_** and then Azwan found his friend known as Din to buy the toners and we stop selling the toners to (Mr Lim). I stopped

> \[Emphasis added\]

45     When counsel persisted that the passage must have meant that there had been some months during the continuance of their relationship where **_no_** toners had been supplied, Mr Shahrin stood his ground and indicated that he might have misspoken as he had been very tired at the time. He could thus not recall ever having made such a statement, empathically stressing that “_I don’t remember saying that, “There’s no toners were sold to Mike_ (i.e. Mr Lim).”[^31]. Upon being further pressed, Mr Shahrin also ventured that the investigation officer might have recorded this in error as SIO Colin Joseph might have been “_confused_”.[^32]

46     Mr Shahrin displayed considerable certitude in his responses, and appeared piqued by counsel’s repeated questioning of his ability to recall the frequency of his trips to Mr Lim’s office. He explained the basis for his recall was because he remembered that he needed to make frequent excursions to raise money to supplement what he considered to be meagre wages[^33] :

> Witness:    Yes, it’s true, but when something you---how to explain it? …when you want to earn money, I think you can remember what---I don’t how to say like…my salary is small and I really need the money, so **_I will always try my best to weekly, weekly try to sell. So, the thing is very clear that_**, …**_I sell him twice a month_**, and after I cannot sell to him, I will find another supplier, you know? It will be a loss to me if I never sell the toner I have and then just leave it there.

> \[Emphasis added\]

> \[Repeated words and stuttering have also been filtered from the quote for ease of reading\]

47     On the quantities of printer toners supplied, Mr Shahrin was certain that the quantum delivered on each trip exceeded 20 sets, as Mr Lim had offered his “_higher price_” of $140 per set only of “_more than 20 sets_” were brought to him[^34]. To meet this quota, Mr Shahrin would pool his toners ordered for BNP Paribas use, with Mr Redzuan, whose store of over ordered toners had been meant for use by ANZ Bank. Upon accumulating a haul which equalled or exceeded Mr Lim’s ‘quota’, Mr Redzuan’s associate; “Bong” would separately collect the toners from the two men and perform the delivery with Mr Redzuan, If Shahrin did not accompany them, he would arrange to collect his payment the next day at an agreed location. While he could not vouch for Mr Redzuan’s toners. Mr Shahrin was emphatic that all the toners he supplied were “_brand new_”. [^35]

### Evidence of PW 6 Redzuan Bin Margono

48     While Mr Redzuan, unlike Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan, was never prosecuted, his evidence is especially cogent given that he was the individual who was acknowledged as the “frontman’ of the operation in all dealings with the accused, stating that “_mostly I’m the one who contact_ (Mr Lim)”[^36]. Mr Redzuan’s involvement stated from the beginning, when he and Shahrin had contrived a plan to source for buyers, and after Mr Lim’s business; _One Copier_, had been selected. Like Mr Shahrin, Mr Redzuan was in dire financial straits, describing himself as being beset by “_a lot_” of debt, and having even consorted with loan sharks. Mr Shahrin had asked Mr Redzuan to make the call and talk to Mr Lim, to elicit his interest in the misappropriated _Fuji Xerox_ toners. According to him, Mr Redzuan had never mentioned his identity as a _Fuji Xerox_ employee to Mr Lim during their initial tele-conversation. In Mr Redzuan’s own words, the initial exchange had been as follows[^37]:

> I never mentioned that I’m from Fuji Xerox to him, I just, uh, delivery guy and he asked me, **_“Where do I get these?” I say, “From someone, from a friend_**.” And, okay, so, we negotiate the price and also he asked me to bring down, lah, the toners, some toners. I think, I bring down to his office**_, I think about less than 5 set of toners._** Yah.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The first occasion only involved “less than” five sets of toners

49     Mr Redzuan’s testimony from the passage above is notable not just in his attempt to obfuscate his identity as an employee of _Fuji Xerox_, but also to mask the illicit provenance of the toners by stating rather coyly that these were sourced from “_a friend_”. Also noteworthy is his testimony that he had brought down “_less than five_ **_sets_** _of toners_” in their initial transaction, which, of course, would amount to **_under 20 separate_** toner cartridges, and thus **_fewer_** than the “_at least_” 40 separate toners enumerated in the first charge[^38] covering the “_1st occasion_” (where an acquittal was granted).

### Initial meeting with accused

50     In respect of this first meeting, Mr Redzuan stated that he had, at this instance explicitly claimed that he was **_not_** from _Fuji Xerox_, and had instead told Mr Lim that he and the persons with him were “_just a_ (sic) _delivery drivers_”[^39]. Mr Lim had asked if the toners were new or used. Mr Redzuan had stated that these were new, and Mr Lim had, after an inspection and count of the goods proffered, accepted the toners **_without asking any further questions_**[^40], and paid for the toners in cash, of a denomination that he could not recall. No receipt was issued.

### Subsequent transactions

51     Mr Redzuan stated that he would call Mr Lim once he and Mr Shahrin had accumulated a sufficient number of toner sets. After toting their aggregated pile of toners, the men would call Mr Lim to inform him of their toner set count, before bringing the stolen goods to Mr Lim’s establishment. For these subsequent deliveries, Mr Redzuan was the minor contributor to the pool of toners, as ANZ Bank, where he had worked, had fewer _Fuji Xerox_ copier machines than Mr Shahrin’s place of assignment, which was BNP Paribas bank. Mr Redzuan could thus only credibly over-order a relatively smaller number of printers without arousing suspicion. He thus normally took **_under_** ten sets of toners from his end, while Mr Shahrin was consistently able to produce **_over_** ten sets to meet the quantity requested by Mr Lim[^41]. Mr Redzuan indicated that Mr Lim would invariably pay in cash and not issue a receipt.[^42]

52     In his court testimony, Mr Redzuan noted that Mr Lim was meticulous in checking the toners proffered, opening the packaging[^43], and carrying and feeling the object in an apparent attempt to assess whether the toner had been used. Mr Redzuan added that the toner packages at the time were not sealed to guarantee that the items had never been removed from the packaging, and thus feeling the theft of a toner allowed a quick gauge as to whether the toner had been used. At their workplace, it was customary to mark a used toner with an “X” to its packaging to distinguish it from a new or unused toner[^44]. Like Mr Shahrin, Mr Redzuan recalled providing only new toners to Mr Lim[^45], stating with a repeated affirmation that they were “_new toners, haven’t been used_”. Mr Redzuan indicated that his frequency of attendance at Mr Lim’s officer to deliver toners was two to three times a month[^46], which cohered with Mr Shahrin’s account. Mr Redzuan indicated that while he was the one involved in discussions with Mr Lim, Mr Shahrin would, nevertheless, often be with him when deliveries were undertaken[^47]. He also indicated that only he and Mr Shahrin would be directly involved in bringing the toners into the business premises, with his friend only providing transport, and unaware of the nature of their transactions.

### Cross-examination of Redzuan Bin Margono

53     At cross-examination, Mr Redzuan confirmed that he had told Mr Lim that he was a delivery driver. He was, however, unable to respond to counsel’s contention that delivery men were at liberty to dispose of unused toner cartridges that they had encountered in the course of their work, after they had removed photocopier machines from a customer’s premises at the end of a leasing period[^48]. This was because Mr Redzuan was a DMS or “_DocuCare_” technician at _Fuji Xerox_ and had no experience in the delivery and removal operations of the company. He thus had no idea if delivery staff were allowed to retain or dispose of toners at their own discretion. Mr Redzuan was also unaware if “_karang guni”_ operators, who collected scrap and second-hand goods were involved in dealings with unused toner cartridges. Mr Redzuan also emphasized that he had merely mentioned that he was a delivery driver helping a friend to dispose of the toners, and had **_not_** represented that he had collected the toners himself[^49] in his discussions with Mr Lim. He had thus never offered any ‘back-story’ or other background information to Mr Lim on the _provenance_ of the toners.

### Accused’s demand for discounts and replacements suggests an expectation of stable supply of the same type of goods

54     On counsel’s queries _per_ client’s instructions that Mr Lim had received some apparently used toners[^50], Mr Redzuan emphasized that there had been two checks done. The first check was performed when the toners were delivered to his place of work where he would assess the toner’s full capacity by its estimated weight, and the second, after the toners had been segregated and secreted for delivery to Mr Lim, when he would perform a “_double-check_” to ensure that the toners were new. He nevertheless conceded to the possibility of having inadvertently packed partially used toners. He was unable to comment how this might have happened and insisted that this was a rare occurrence.

55     Mr Redzuan indicated that Mr Lim had sought a recompense even for these exceptional deficits, responding “_But---yah_, (Mr Lim) _asked me for a discount. Then at other times, I do replace_.”[^51] What was of interest, and salient to the proceedings before me, was the revelation that **_Mr Lim demanded replacements or discounts when he encountered these used toners._** This certainly pointed to Mr Lim imposing exacting standards in each of these batches that the toners be new, or as good as new. This, in turn, pointed to a more structured relationship where the good supplied were expected to conform to precise specifications.

56     I found this turn of testimonial evidence significant, as counsel had, from the tenor of his questions, hitherto sought to characterize the relationship between Mr Lim and the suppliers of the illicitly obtained _Fuji Xerox_ toners to be a far more **_informal_** one, where his client had simply bought goods from a person whom he believed to be a delivery driver, ostensibly seeking to monetise quantities of discarded printer toners that the driver (or a ‘friend’) had fortuitously come across in the course of his work. Such a relationship would thus be not far removed from one that might be formed with a ‘_karang guni’_ dealer whose collection pattern would be opportunistic, situational, and even random. Given this, a ‘_karang guni’_ man would necessarily have little ability to **_predict_** when a specific good or item supplied on one day might again become available on another day.

57     The situation described by Mr Redzuan would certainly be a far departure from such informal trading relationships with ‘_karang guni_’ men and ‘lucky’ delivery drivers, who could, at best, be expected to offer _ad hoc_ agglomerations of goods on an ‘_as is_’ basis. It would be rational to expect that such dealers, who had encountered the goods they proffered for sale by sheer chance, would be in no position to offer any warranty on their condition, ‘newness’, merchantability or fitness for use. The fact that Mr Lim perceived himself to be in a position to demand replacements meant that he **_knew and expected_** that supplies of the same item were **_constant_** and a replacement of **_exactly the same_** item, which was a very specific type of printer toner, in a brand new condition, could be sourced and produced to him in a later date.

### No representations that toners were surplus from old or used photocopiers

58     Mr Redzuan also denied counsel’s contention that he had discussions with the accused, where he had allegedly told Mr Lim that the toner cartridges supplied were “_extra toner from used photocopier_” or that his friend had sourced the toners from used photocopiers as “_extra toner_”, strenuously maintaining that he had merely “_told him about it’s from a friend_.” [^52]. Mr Redzuan was candid that he had initially used his cover as a “delivery driver” to obfuscate his identity as an employee of _Fuji Xerox_ but noted that Mr Lim had been generally incurious about him or the _provenance_ of the toners after their initial meeting[^53]:

>   
| 

Counsel

 | 

So what did you do to make him not suspect that they are stolen toners?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So far, he never ask me anything.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

Yah?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah. Only the first time that we met and just the early part, that’s all. Then, after so long then never ask.

 |

  
  

59     Defence counsel next questioned Mr Redzuan if there had been a particular instance where he had offered Mr Lim three times as many toners and had asked for a higher price, and Mr Lim had declined to buy. Counsel asserted that, according to his instructions, when this had occurred, Mr Lim had become suspicious on account of the massive quantities preferred, and had thereafter eschewed from any further dealings with Mr Redzuan. The witness had responded by denying any instance where he had made such an offer and indicated that it was; rather, Mr Lim who had continually goaded him and Mr Shahrin to bring more toner sets using the promise of a “_good price_” as incentive. Mr Redzuan’s response is as follows[^54].

> Witness: I don’t think that he suspect because **_he asked me and Shahrin also, if let’s say we have a lot of toners, can bring to him and maybe he will give me---give us a good price._** That’s all. How come that he can suspicious that thing?

> \[Emphasis added\]

60     Despite this incentivization, Mr Redzuan indicated that the two men generally kept to their baseline of 20 sets of toners, which were delivered twice to thrice a month to Mr Lim’s office, They might, on occasion, exceed this quantum, when **_more_** than 20 sets would be delivered, but these instances would not occur more than once a month,[^55]. On the mode of delivery, Mr Redzuan stated that “Bong’ would drive a van, while he would use a cab to effect deliveries if ‘Bong” was unavailable. When asked if he delivered his toners in a big box, which was bore an insignia of a tiger’s face, Mr Redzuan stated that he had no recollection of such a box, and that the boxes used would be their usual toner carton boxes from _Fuji Xerox_, where they would load the printer cartridge colours by a sequential combination of colour printing component pigments cyan, magenta, yellow and black[^56]. He also did **_not_** recall “Bong” ever using a box with a tiger-faced insignia.

### Evidence of PW 7 Muhammad Azwan Bin Ahmad

Mr Azwan had worked with Mr Shahrin at BNP Paribas Bank at the material time, also as a Document Management Service officer. The two had worked as a team in both their official work and their illicit misappropriation of printer toners. He had joined _Fuji Xerox_ in May 2013, until the _denouement_ on 26 February 2016, after their course of misconduct had been uncovered. Following his admission of complicity with Mr Shahrin, Mr Azwan had been sentenced to 19 months’ imprisonment. He had completed his term at the time he gave his oral testimony.

61     Mr Azwan indicated that Mr Shahrin had proposed the notion of misappropriating the toners in 2014 as he was in need of “_extra money_”, and he had agreed to participate in this undertaking. Mr Shahrin had later revealed that he was selling the toners to Mr Lim. Mr Azwan himself had no direct dealings with Mr Lim as Mr Shahrin assumed all delivery duties, but he would assist in covering for Shahrin in DMS work responsibilities while he was away, and packing the toners, for which he received an equal share of the proceeds. Given Azwan’s deep complicity, he would have been expected to be _au fait_ with the critical aspect of Mr Shahrin’s duties, despite there being no face-to-face contact. In this regard Mr Azwan says[^57]:

> Q     **_How often did you and Shahrin sell toners to Mike in a month from 2014 to 2016?_**

> A     **_If I can remember correctly_**, it’s, uh, **_twice a month_**.

> Q     **_And each time, how many toners?_**

> A     **_About 20 sets_**.

> Q    Why did you and Shahrin stop selling to Mike?

> A    Um, because, uh, he lower down the price.

> Q    So what price did you and Shahrin sell the toners to Mike for? Initially and afterwards when you reduced it.

> A    Uh, I can’t really remember. Uh, it’s around, I think 110 to 140 range.

> Q    And that is per set?

> A    Yes, per set.

62     Mr Azwan’s evidence was congruent with Mr Shahrin’s account that the deliveries had been regular, with the stated quantities being provided while the price remained at the $140-per-set level. The cosy relationship between Mr Lim and the illicit suppliers had taken a turn after Mr Lim’s unilateral slashing of the price to $110. He recalled that the arrangement had started in 2014, and lasted to a point in 2015, after which a decision had been made to divert their supplies to Mr Sahirudin[^58]. He stated that the toners supplied were “_brand new_”[^59] and were invariably encased in their original packaging. He was also aware that Mr Lim paid in cash, and never supplied any documentation as proof-of-purchase.

### Explanation for discrepancies between court testimony and admission note

63     In the examination-in-chief, Mr Azwan sought to reconcile his court testimony of Mr Lim receiving regular batches at a stable quantity of 20 toner sets with a handwritten statement[^60] he had made earlier to PW3; _Fuji Xerox_ Senior Manager Stephanie Yoong, in the wake of the discovery of the misappropriations. For ease of reference, In the relevant part of the passage, Mr Azwan had stated:

> **_I have sold the toners twice a month but not consistent. At times we didn’t sell it at all. Each time it is about 40-60 sets_** selling at $35 per cartridge, $140 per set**_. I can’t recall how much in total I have sold the cartridge. We started doing in in late 2014. Per month, we sell it once or twice and sometimes none. Estimate amount is $119 000._** I sold to \[_Mr Lim_\] and \[_Mr Sahirudin_\]. I don’t have the contacts for \[_Mr Lim_\].

> \[Emphasis added\]

64     Mr Azwan explained that when he had written the letter on 3 March 2016, his main intent had been to apologise to _Fuji Xerox_ for his misdeeds and described himself as “_very nervous_” and “_scared_” at the point of time[^61]. Mr Azwan admitted that he couldn’t “_really think properly_”, and candidly admitted to having a self-preservatory motive to minimise the extent of his transgressions in his statement even where a full exculpation was impossible.

65     Mr Azwan’s motive of **_damage control_**, in the sense of (avoiding prosecution and obtaining what he had earnestly hoped would be another “_chance_”) is quite patent in his testimony, where he states[^62]:

>   
| 

Witness:

 | 

And then, yah, I was thinking that if I say all this it might---I mean, **_Fuji Xerox will let me off and give me chance_**.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What do you mean by that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Thinking that---I mean, at that point of time, I was nervous. So, I was like trying to tell them that, “Oh, I didn’t sell as much as what it is”…

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

> And also[^63]

>> Witness: Yah, same thing. **_Because I thought that if I say it’s a smaller amount_**, **_hoping that Fuji Xerox will_**, um, **_give me a chance and_** not, uh---**_and withdraw the case against me_**.

66     Mr Azwan seemed true to his claim that he was not quite himself when he wrote out the statement in 3 March 2016, as he even made a mistake of stating that he sold “40-60 **_sets_**” rather than 40-60 individual toner **_cartridges_** (with four cartridges constituting a set) . He clarified that this should have been read as ten to 15 **_sets_** of toners, with all his takings coming from BNP Paribas, where he worked, and all “sold” to either Mr Lim or Mr Sahirudin, who were his only “customers”.

### Cross examination of PW 7 Azwan Bin Ahmad

67     At cross-examination, Mr Azwan again re-iterated that he had never dealt with Mr Lim, whom he had not ever even seen until they met at Cantonment Police Complex after the misappropriations had been uncovered[^64]. He firmly maintained his contention that there had been “_about_” two consignments of toners each month, and insisted that this level of incidence was _“rigid” with “no fluctuation_”, despite counsel’s challenge that Mr Shahrin had testified to a greater degree of variance. Mr Azwan explained that their misappropriations had been predicated on their financial _extremis_, that as he and Shahrin were in such a dire situation that and he and Mr Shahrin needed a constant flow of funds, which could only be accomplished by selling the toners on a regular basis, and calibrated by their resupply schedule. In his own words: “_So, we make it a point that it’s twice a month that we get that am---the same amount every month_.” Mr Azwan conceded to counsel’s suggestion that he had, in his confession note been “_dishonest with_ (his) _employer”_ when he had written in the message that there had been periods when no toners had been supplied to Mr Lim.[^65] Essentially, Mr Azwan’s evidence amounted to a denial that deliveries would have been **_less_** than twice a month. Incidentally, Mr Azwan also did not recall deliveries ever **_exceeding_** twice a month.

### Azwan’s recall is inevitably less reliable than Shahrin’s or Redzuan’s

68     While there seems an incongruity between the accounts of Mr Azwan and Mr Shahrin, I was mindful that the two men performed quite different roles, where Mr Shahrin performed the **_actual_** deliveries to Mr Lim, while Mr Awzan was more workplace-bound. Mr Azwan’s comparatively passive role had involved his sequestration and squirreling off the excess toners and also helping to pack the items for delivery. Beyond that, all information he received had been second-hand from Mr Shahrin when the latter disbursed the former his _pari-passu_ share of the proceeds. In my view, Mr Shahrin’s and Mr Redzuan’s recollection would inevitably be more reliable, as they would have planned the specific trips, and having arrived at the delivery point, participated in a process where Mr Lim would count the toner sets supplied, in an exacting examination which included his rejection of toners which he suspected to be used or defective. The latter two men would thus be expected to have a better ingrained recall of what had actually transpired.

### Amendment of charges and closure of prosecution’s case

69     After Mr Azwan’s testimony, the investigation officer was recalled briefly to address queries that had arisen in the recording of Mr Shahrin’s statement while he was in custody at Tanah Merah Prison. SSI Colin Joseph indicated that he had brought a mobile printer and had allowed Mr Shahrin to make amendments in pen after the statement had been printed. Aside from some minor changes, Mr Shahrin had indicated his wish to insert “_May or June_“ rather than “_December_” in 2014 as the time he had started his transactional relationship with Mr Lim, which lasted for one year (to May-June 2015).

70     The prosecution communicated their intention to amend the charges to include Mr Redzuan. This was in my view. entirely apposite as the Mr Redzuan’s testimony was that he had provided his own “_haul_” of stolen toners from his own workplace; ANZ Bank, which were quite distinct from the toners secreted and packed by Mr Azwan and co-delivered by Mr Shahrin to Mr Lim’s place of work. The charges should accurately reflect the two “streams” of stolen toners from BNP Paribas Bank and ANZ Bank pilfered by Messrs Shahrin and Azwan and Mr Redzuan, respectively. The amended charges are marked C1B to C24B.

## SUBMISSION OF NO CASE

### Election not to recall prosecution witnesses

71     Counsel made a submission of no case to answer upon the amendments. He was, as would be proper in the ordinary course, offered the option of the presented witnesses being recalled to be examined on aspects salient to the amendment, but eschewed this option[^66].

### Submission of no case

72     Defence counsel’s submissions centred on the prosecution’s case attributing only Mr Shahrin as the author of the criminal conduct in the predicate offence (of criminal misappropriation) and not initially referencing any benefits obtained from the criminal conduct of Mr Redzuan. Counsel pointed to “_the benefits were from the criminal conduct of_ **_three_** _persons_”[^67]. As mentioned above, I was of the view that the toners came from **_two_** distinct streams; from BNP Paribas Bank (where Mr Shahrin and Mr Aswan worked) and ANZ Bank (where Mr Redzuan worked). As Mr Azwan worked in concert with Mr Shahrin at BNP Paribas Bank, and had never met Mr Lim, there was **_no need_** for a separate attribution to Mr Azwan, who never even met Mr Lim in the course of his transactional relationship with Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin, and was not known to the accused. Mr Azwan thus need not have been named in the charges. The remaining question was thus whether the earlier omission of Mr Redzuan as the perpetrator of the criminal conduct where the benefits were handled by the accused was fatal to the prosecution’s case.

73     DPP Eric Hu expressed his view that counsel’s objections did not cohere with relevant case law as well as the implicit intent of CDSA legislation. The learned DPP contended that the case of _Ang Jeanette_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span>; <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 100</span> (“_Ang Jeanette_”) had made it clear that in proving a case under the CDSA, the prosecution was not bound to bear the heavy burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that all the elements of a specific predicate offence existed. All the Prosecution was required to do in respect of proving this predicate offense was to adduce some evidence the property in question with an act that might constitute one or the other of the scheduled offences in the CDSA.

74     I agreed with the prosecution that the prosecution’s case had not been fatally flawed merely because they had not linked Mr Redzuan in the initial charges, The law did not require such an exacting level of specificity or granularity in describing the manner of commission of the predicate offence (of misappropriation), In _Ang Jeanette_, the appellant, who had assisted in remitting large sums overseas in suspicious circumstances at the behest of her brother, had similarly made a no-case submission on the basis of the prosecution not satisfying the requirement to produce a foreign certificate in order to prove that a foreign serious offence, from which the moneys were derived, had occurred. VK Rajah had expounded on the prosecution’s burden of proof in the following terms at \[58\] of the judgment:

> 58    …There is nothing in (_section 44(1)(a) CDSA_) that requires or points to any need to impose on the Prosecution the heavy and impractical burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the crime or class of crime that may constitute the predicate offence. Further, given the mischief this section is intended to address, a court should be slow in reading in such a requirement. On the other hand, the Prosecution has to adduce particulars of the commission of a predicate offence or a class thereof. Such a construction provides sufficient flexibility to the Prosecution in proving the predicate criminal conduct under the myriad factual circumstances in which money laundering offences can be committed, and does so without undermining the careful course that Parliament has steered between requiring the Prosecution to prove the commission of a _specific predicate criminal offence_ and allowing the Prosecution to make _wholly unparticularised allegations of criminal conduct_. … **_Equally, circumstances could well arise where the only logical inference to any reasonable person is that the moneys involved in the arrangement are criminal property, and that the other person engages in, or has engaged in, or has benefited from, criminal conduct…. It will all depend upon the facts._**

> \[Emphasis in italics in the original, emphasis in bold italics added\]

75     The learned DPP has also pointed out that the statutory alignment with this principle _vide_ section 47A (1) of the CDSA (which was enacted _vide_ Act 21 of 2014), which provides that it would not be “_necessary for the prosecution to prove the particulars of any offence constituted by the… criminal conduct_”. Given this I would agree with their contention that as long as the prosecution was able to prove the particulars of a predicate offense, there would be no need to specify specifically to whom the benefits from criminal conduct belonged to. _Ang Jeanette_ had held it as impractical, and inimical to the goals of the legislation, to impose such a burden.

76     In particular I am persuaded by DPP Hu’s submission that “_the definition of criminal conduct in the CDSA shows that Parliament would have contemplated a situation where the benefits thereof could be linked to a variety of persons_.”[^68] Indeed, going a step further, cases have also been premised on benefits of criminal conduct from ‘**_unknown persons’_**. In the seminal case of _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 269</span>, from which the High Court laid a sentencing framework for CDSA offences, the charge which passed muster upon appellate scrutiny had involved the offender being involved while having “_reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, the control of_ **_an unknown person’s_** _benefits of criminal conduct was facilitated and having reasonable grounds to believe that the said_ **_unknown person_** _was engaged in criminal conduct_”

77     The above would fortify the proposition that there would be no requirement, imposed by statute or case law, for the prosecution to specify if the benefits from criminal conduct were Shahrin’s or Redzuan’s. I noted that amendment to the charges relate squarely to conform to the ongoing oral testimony in the prosecution’s case when it became increasingly evident from whose stock Mr Lim had acquired the toners sets from.

78     Ultimately, it is quite evident that the prosecution had merely made the amendment to include Mr Redzuan’s name with a view to appropriately reflecting the witness’ own testimony in relation to his continued contributions to the stockpile of toners to meet Mr Lim’s baseline demand of at least 20 toner sets, upon which Mr Lim’s agreement to pay $140 per set was premised upon. The evidence also showed that Mr Lim had been the **_sole_** recipient of toners of the pilfered stock from the two men while his offer of the higher amount was extant, with a diversion to Mr Sahiruddin only after his unilateral revision of the terms. Given this, there was an absence of any ambiguity in the 24 amended charges, or any other aspect which would have affected his ability to respond to the said charges.

79     In light of the above, I was of the view that the prosecution had established a _prima facie_ case, and administered the usual allocution. Mr Lim indicated his choice to give evidence on his own behalf, and also call witnesses for his defence case.

## DEFENCE CASE

### Evidence of DW1 Lim Kuan Ngee

80     Mr Lim indicated that he was better known in his industry as “Mike”, and operated the sole proprietor business of One Copier and Office Supplies, which he had run since 2006, from his business premises at Genting Lane. Mr Lim’s business dealt with an assortment of services linked to second-hand photocopiers, including sales, rentals, servicing and repair of such photocopiers. Mr Lim’s business also handled new photocopiers, albeit on a much smaller scale, as he dealt principally with second-hand machines.[^69] At the material time he had “_about 15 employees_”.[^70] Mr Lim professed to have had considerable knowledge in the industry, having started as a copier technician in 1991, and working in that capacity for some eight year, before he had branched out to start his own business[^71].

### Mode of acquisition of used photocopiers

81     Mr Lim acquired his used machines from finance companies, which came into his hands by way of a sale from such finance companies upon the expiry of a leasing contract or the breach of such a contract, after the ownership of these machines had vested in the finance companies. A leasing agreement would typically span a five-year period. Finance companies would dispose of these machines by a bidding process, with the highest bidder typically securing the machine. The used photocopier would then be collected by the successful bidder directly from business premises where they had spent the term of their leasing contracts. The procedure was the same in cases where the lease contract had been terminated upon the lessee company’s or business’ inability to meet the stipulated lease instalment payments. Upon securing a machine by tendering the highest bid, Mr Lim would send his own ‘transport guy’ to the lessee’s premises to collect the machine.

82     Mr Lim also bought used photocopiers from _karang guni_ dealers, who had in turn, either picked up disposed machines, or acquired used machines from customers who directly owned their machines. These were invariably cheaper as there was no competitive bidding process to surmount, and _karang guni_ dealers were content to make a quick profit, for even paltry margins of $50-$100.[^72] Mr Lim would generally procure new photocopiers from parallel importers.

### Acquisition of printing toner cartridges

83     Given Mr Lim’s business dealings in acquiring and servicing photocopier machines, he found himself in constant need of toners to “_support the machines_”.[^73] He would usually buy such toners from parallel importers. Mr Lim was also approached by a self-classified category of “**_third party people_**” who would seek to sell toners to him. In his own words, Mr Lim declared “_(a)nd sometime, uh, there is some so-called third party people like karung guni…the copier salesman and the deliveryman come approach me, they say that they have some toner, want to sell me_.” [^74] He had never purchased toners from _Fuji Xerox_ in Singapore, as he perceived their prices to be “_high_’. When stocks ran low, Mr Lim would also resort to parallel importers.

### Supply of toners by ‘karang guni’ men and delivery men

84     Mr Lim asserted that _karang guni_ dealers would also sell used printers with toners that had been collected at the time the machines had been picked up by the dealers. They would sell the machine, along with the toner cartridges to the accused. On other occasions, the _karang guni_ men would just sell the toners on a ‘stand-alone’ basis to Mr Lim, and he surmised that the collected machine would be sold to other parties. Mr Lim’s response had a notable level of tentative pauses and hesitancy as can be seen here[^75]:

> A    Okay, uh, sometime, uh, did---this is, uh, what I mentioned, it is---uh---uh, just now, sometime they collect the machine, maybe, the machine they sell to someone and then they---they have this toner maybe this---the---this toner they sell back to---they sell to me.

85     Mr Lim was unaware of any impropriety on the part of the _karang guni_ in their acquisition of these toner cartridges. He asserted that he had made the purchases from them on the premise that they had been given the toners by their former owners who had no further use for the toners. Mr Lim understood that copier salesmen would buy the used toners at about $50 per set. He also stated that toner cartridges would also come into the hands of deliverymen.

86     In this regard, delivery men came into the scene when they were engaged by the concerned finance company to remove a copier machine. He understood that delivery men would, upon the premise that the customer would not need the toners as he was surrendering the machine, ask permission from the customer to take the toners. According to Mr Lim, “_normally the customer will just give to the salesman_” free of any charge, for a modest sum of “_maybe $50 or what_”.[^76] The toners so collected would usually be a mix of old and new cartridges. Mr Lim cited an example of two sets collected, which would consists of eight individual cartridges, he might find two used pieces, with the remaining six in apparently new condition[^77]. Mr Lim would weigh the toners, and discard near-empty toners, and require a discount when he found that the toner cartridge had been partially used. Mr Lim had also encountered instances where a microchip embedded with the cartridge was defective. He had the requisite technical skills to replace the chip but would exact a discount in such an instance.

### Purchase of toners from parallel importers

87     Mr Lim indicated that there was a considerable difference between the price he paid for the _ad hoc_ offerings from _karang guni_ dealers and delivery men, and what he would expect to pay for new toner cartridges. For the former, _karang guni_ dealers might ask for $80 to $130. He believed that the ceiling for their quotes would be $200 and below, and the final agreed figure would depend on how well he negotiated. The lowest prices of $80 could be attained when the _karang guni_ dealer was unaware of the market value of the toner set. It was the _karang guni_ dealers who “_normally_” made the first overture, and approached him when they came upon available stock, as he was a known dealer in second hand copiers[^78]. Mr Lim was not aware of how the dealers obtained his contact number, and believed that these persons had resorted to _Google_ searches.

88     Mr Lim’s evidence was sourcing toner sets from parallel importers would cost considerably more. To establish that he had indeed made purchases of the same make (model DCC 2270 toner cartridge) of _Fuji Xerox_ toners from parallel importers, Mr Lim produced an invoice[^79] dated 13 July 2016, where he had purchased 54 toner sets from _CoMac Corporation Pte Ltd_, a parallel import company[^80] at the price of **$235** per set of four toners, and costing an aggregate sum of $14 284.50. He also produced another invoice[^81] from _TopOne Resources Pte Ltd_ where he had ordered _inter alia_, 38 sets of DCC 2270 toner cartridges at **$238** per set, amounting in all to $9 044. Mr Lim had subsequently made another[^82] order with _TopOne Resources Pte Ltd_ for 33 sets, again at **$238** per set, costing $7 854 in all.

### Accused’s dealings with Redzuan and Shahrin

89     Mr Lim recalled that his dealings with Mr Redzuan had started with an email from a party who was then not known to him. The mail alluded to the availability of printing toner cartridges for sale. Mr Lim had responded by quoting a buying price. He had later received a call from a person who called himself “Wan”, who had told him “_I have, uh, some Fuji Xerox toner_”[^83] for sale and queried his interest. After Mr Lim had responded in the affirmative, he and “Wan” had agreed on a price of $130. (This of course differed from the recollections of Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan that the price had been set at $140) Mr Redzuan had acted swiftly after the conclusion of these negotiations, as he had delivered toner sets on the very next day to Mr Lim’s office.

90     In relation the critical series of questions of how Mr Redzuan had presented himself, and the capacity he had held out for himself in relation to his role in the procurement and production of the toners, Mr Lim again reverted to a pronounced stutter, with a curious wavering as to whether Mr Redzuan was selling or simply delivering the toners to him[^84].

### Statements by accused to investigation officer

91     Mr Lim gave two statements to the investigation officer SI Colin Joseph on 27 February 2016, and again on 2 November 2016. The salient portions of the what Mr Lim stated which are relevant to the proceedings from the first statement[^85] is set out below:

>   
| 

Q1

 | 

Do you know anyone by the name of **_Shahrin_**?

 |
| 

A1

 | 

Yes, this fellow had sold me some Fuji Xerox toners. He contacted me in 2014 and told me that he had some toners which were unused. As such, they were supposed to be thrown away. **_I then asked about the pricing and we agreed on SGD $130 per set continuing_** (_sic_) **_all the 4 colours. He then brought the toners to my office_** and handed over the toners and I paid for the toners. I wish to state that I bought these toners because I would give them free of charge to my customers when we rent out our photocopier.

 |
| 

I wish to state that I would normally buy parallel imported toner and also local supplier. Since he wanted to sell, I bought the toners. However, he did not give me and (_sic_) invoice. **_I wish to state that during 2014 he came over to my company almost every month about two times with about 10 toners set each trip. He normally comes alone._** I would purchase the toners from him and he leaves.

 |
| 

Q2.

 | 

How much such toner would cost you should you but from a supplier who is operating a genuine business?

 |
| 

A2

 | 

It would be SGD $220 to SGD $240.

 |
| 

Q3

 | 

Would you not consider that Selling at SGD $130 is considered lower than the usual price?

 |
| 

A3

 | 

Yes it is low. I bought because it low because (_sic_).

 |
| 

Q4

 | 

How was the packaging of the toners?

 |
| 

A4

 | 

**_The packaging were_** (sic) **_actually new_**.

 |
| 

Q5

 | 

Did **_Shahrin_** tell you where he got the toners from?

 |
| 

A5:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q6

 | 

Did you ask **_Shahrin_** to tell you where he got the toners from?

 |
| 

A6

 | 

**_I did ask but he said it was extra toner from used photocopier._**

 |
| 

A7

 | 

No, I did not know. If I knew it was stolen I would not have bought them. I just felt it was a good deal and decided to buy them.

 |
| 

Q8

 | 

Do you have any more of the toners that **_Shahrin_** had sold to you?

 |
| 

A8

 | 

No I have given them all out.

 |
| 

Q9

 | 

Do you have anything to add?

 |
| 

A10

 | 

I am unaware that the toners were stolen. I just thought it was extra toners not needed from old photo copier. I would be more careful in future. **_Anyway, I did suspect and I stop buying the toners from him._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

92     SSI Colin Joseph next recorded a statement some ten months later, on 2 November 2016. The salient parts of the latter statement[^86] are set out:

>   
| 

Q2

 | 

Can you please explain how did you order and collect the toner from **_Mohammed Shahrin_**?

 |
| 

A2

 | 

I **_wish to state that I do not know Shahrin and have never dealt with him before. I do not know how he got my number. Maybe he could have gotten my number from my advertisement. I do not make any orders. The first time I ever spoke to him, he called me_**. I recall him stating that he had toners to sell. He also told me how many toner he wanted to sell. I then told him to bring the toners to my shop. When he comes to my shop with the toners, **_I would inspect the toners and pay him after discussing the price_**. Thereafter he would leave my shop.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q5

 | 

Can you describe the packaging and quality of the toners you received from **_Shahrin_**?

 |
| 

A5

 | 

The toners will be in their box. I would then remove the toner from their box and inspect them. Sometimes the toners were used and sometimes the toners are new. When the toner are used I would ask **_Shahrin_** for a discount. Most of the toners are new. The used toners are maybe one or two.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q8

 | 

Given that a toner would be USD $240 from a supplier and you had bought from **_Shahrin_** at SGD $130, did you have any suspicions about how the toners were procured?

 |
| 

A8

 | 

**_I did have my suspicion and I did ask Shahrin where he got the toners from. He told me that he was from the delivery team and sometime_** (_sic_) **_he would collect toners from customers whereby the machine had already been returned to the company and the toner were just left unused_**. So there is no need for the toners. When he told me this. I accepted his explanation.

 |
| 

Q9

 | 

You mentioned in your previous statement dated 24 June 2016 that you had purchased about 20 sets of toners per month from **_Shahrin_**. Please confirm how many months did you make similar purchases from Shahrin?

 |
| 

A9

 | 

**_I would say he came every month twice for about 12 months and each month he came and sold about 20 sets of toners in total_** meaning one set have 4 colours.

 |
| 

Q10

 | 

**_Would that mean that Shahrin has come to your shop to sell the toners a total of 24 times and each time sold about 10 sets of toners to you?_**

 |
| 

A10

 | 

**_Yes._**

 |
| 

…

 |

  
  

### Statement recorded on 24 June 2016

93     In between the above two statements, which were admitted as prosecution exhibits, Mr Lim also made a statement in the period between the two exhibited statement. It was defence counsel who sought the admission of this other statement which was also recorded by SSI Colin Joseph, and which states[^87]:

> Q1:    would you be able to provide details as to the number and value of toners purchased from **_Muhammed Shahrin_**?

> A1:    I bought the toners at SGD 130 per toner which contained all the need colours. He came to my office about twice a month for the year of 2014. **_Each time he came, he sold me 10 sets of toners._** I am not able to provide the exact number and value of the toners purchased.

> Q2:    would you be able to provide the police with any corresponding documentary record relating to the purchase or sale of the toners sold to you by **_Muhammad Shahrin_**?

> A2:    I do not have any documentary evidence to provide.

> Q3:    why didn’t you provide any receipt when buying toners from **_Muhammad Shahrin_**?

> A3:    I just felt I was using them to give out freely to my customers and that since I was told they were extra toners, there was no need to issue any receipt.

> …

### Observations on the accused’s statements

94     What is notable in **_all three_** reports is that Mr Lim did not see fit to **_correct_** SIO Joseph that that his references to Mr **_Shahrin_** as the main contact person were incorrect, as he (Mr Lim) had been speaking almost exclusively to Mr **_Redzuan_** all the while in both pre-meeting talks as well as on-site discussions at his office, rather than the more passive Mr Shahrin. This was not as if Mr Lim did not know the difference as his testimony at the examination-in-chief alluded to Mr Redzuan having introduced Mr Shahrin to him, and referring to the latter by name in the following manner[^88]:

> Q    Okay. Now, did Wan ever mention the name Shahrin to you?

> A    At some point, uh, he---he did introduce Shahrin to me.

> Q    Alright. How---can you just tell us the situation?

> A    Okay. One day, he---he delivered the toner to me, I don’t know when. And he delivered the toner to me and **_then he bring a Malay guy and he introduced, uh, “this---this is Shahrin”. So, I know it’s Shahrin._**

95     Counsel attempted to elicit an explanation on why Mr Lim had led SSI Colin Joseph up the proverbial garden path by stating that all his dealings were with Shahrin, when he was fully aware that Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin to be two different individuals, and why he had not mentioned Redzuan in his statement. Mr Lim’s only rather baffling response was his belief that the two were _“together”[^89]_ without explaining why Mr Redzuan had been completely omitted in his statements.

96     Mr Lim’s account in his three statements that he would meet “Shahrin” alone also differed from Mr Shahrin’s and Redzuan’s accounts in the sense that **_both_** men recalled being usually present during the deliveries, with or without their driver “Bong”. This seemed more plausible as the deliveries involved the conveyance of no fewer than at least 40 fairly bulky elongated items that ten toner sets would entail (and even more so if the **_20 sets_** claimed by Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin were delivered I each instance).

### Discrepancy on when the price was agreed between the two recorded statements Exhibit P4 and Exhibit P5

97     Perhaps the most telling discrepancy is the difference in the accounts in the two police statements with the account in the first statement asserting that the price for the toners had been agreed **_before[^90]_** the meet-up, and the version in the second statement that “(Mr Lim) _would inspect the toners and pay_ (Mr “Shahrin”, who was actually Mr Redzuan) **_after_** _discussing the price”[^91]_ Mr Lim stated that for subsequent transactions, “ I purchased from (Redzuan) _all the time”_ and that Mr Redzuan would communicate by _WhatsApp_ that toners were available

### Accused’s wavering over the number of toners taken

98     Despite his stipulation that he had received ten toner sets twice a month from “Shahrin” (actually Mr Redzuan) in all three recorded statements, Mr Lim recanted when he gave his testimony when he reiterated that he only took “_5-10 set_(s)”[^92] on each occasion. This, of course, differed starkly from the 20 sets recalled by Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan, save. of course, for the **_first_** instance where Mr Redzuan had presented himself at Mr Lim’s office with what he (Mr Redzuan) recalled to be “_I think about less than five sets of toners_”.[^93]

### Comparison of police statements and court testimony on account of encounters with co-accused persons

99     As set out earlier in these grounds, Mr Lim’s court testimony was more consistent with his account in Exhibit P4; which was his first police report dated 27 February 2016, rather than his later report. His court testimony more fully fleshed out the negotiation process, with Mr Lim’s testifying that he had received an email in 2014, eliciting his interest in purchasing toners, which he had responded to by quoting a price. He had then received a call from someone called “_Wan_” (i.e. Mr Redzuan) who stated that he had “_some Fuji Xerox toner_”[^94] that he had desired to sell.

100    Mr Lim had signalled his interest, which triggered a round of negotiations where the price of $130 was agreed, with the exchange occurring the next day. This version is thus irreconcilable with the sequence described in his further statement on 2 November 2016 (Exhibit P5) where Mr Lim does not describe any email interactions, affects bewilderment as to how “Shahrin” (actually Mr Redzuan) could have obtained his phone number. In this instance, no price negotiations are described, merely an oral communication that the caller had toners to sell, and “_how many toner he wanted to sell_”. Mr Lim had simply told him to bring the toners to his shop. Upon the caller’s attendance, Mr Lim “_would inspect the toners and pay him_ **_after discussing the price_**_._”

### Pricing and mode of payment of karang guni dealers and deliverymen

101    In the course of Mr Lim’s initial interactions with Mr Redzuan, who had come alone, and which he described as a casual “_chit chat_”, he learnt that Mr Redzuan “_work for delivery_” as a “_deliveryman_” for “_a so-called…logistic_ (sic) _company_”[^95]. He categorically denied being aware that Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin worked for _Fuji Xerox_. As stated above, Mr Lim’s case is principally premised on his contention that he had no intent to deal in stolen goods, but been lulled by his belief that Mr Redzuan had been a deliveryman who had come across the toners in the course of his work, and been given licence to collect them to dispose of the items at his own discretion.[^96] He also claimed to have obtained toners from _karang guni_ dealers who sold their toners at prices as low as $80.

102    For the transactions which are the subject matter of the charges, Mr Lim indicated that while he had stated the price of the toner sets to be pegged at $130, he could not remember, with any precision, the amount he had actually paid, and did not dispute Mr Redzuan’s account that the toners had been exchanged at the agreed price at $140 per set. The accused purported to not be able to remember clearly as he was approached by “_a lot of people_”[^97] for such transactions. Mr Lim explained the manner of payment for purchases of toners from _karung guni_ dealers and deliverymen would be usually in cash, and he would pay in cash, which he drew from an ATM, using his corporate ATM card, and he would inform his accounts section that he drawn out this cash as “_business expenses_”.[^98] Mr Lim did not expect _karung guni_ dealers or deliveryman to issue invoices, cryptically stating that “_if they issue it should be a bonus_”.[^99] He did not expect invoices to be issued, as _karung guni_ dealers and their ilk were in his parlance “_come and go_” traders, in the sense that they would sell the goods they found, collect sums of cash from him, and then “_they go_”.[^100] Mr Lim asserted that he had maintained the same course of dealing from the time he had commenced his business to the material time.

### Cross-examination of accused

103    Mr Lim confirmed that he was the sole-proprietor of One Copier and Office Supplies, which was principally a “_photocopier business_” despite its activities being described in its filing with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)[^101] as “_manufacturer of office machinery and equipment_” along with “_repair and maintenance of office machinery and equipment_”. The latter was the more appropriate description of his business activities. Mr Lim was also listed as a partner in G1 Digital Coper and Suppliers. Within the partnership, he supplied and maintained copier machines.[^102] He had begun purchasing toner cartridges in 2006.

### Accused’s contention that deliveries were for irregular quantities of five to ten toner sets

104    In relation to his dealings with the co-accused persons involved in the predicate offences at the material time, Mr Lim reiterated that he had not invariably purchased ten sets of toners, but had taken more irregular quantities of between five to ten toner sets set from Mr Redzuan. Responding to DPP Gregory Gan, he indicated that the quantities he received were not “necessarily” ten sets “_but sometimes it’s less than 10 set_(s)” and that “_I only can remember, um, from this range of 5 to 10 set. So, sometime 8, sometime 9, sometime in loose, sometime not enough set_(s)_._”[^103] Mr Lim did not make any strenuous effort to explain the downscaling of the number of toners to “_five to ten sets_”, from his statements to SSI Colin Joseph, save to say that he had mentioned “**_about_** _10 sets_” and thus could not be held to any notion that be meant **_precisely_** ten sets of toner cartridges being delivered to him.[^104]

105    Mr Lim’s account was, of course, very much at odds with the versions of events from Messrs Shahrin, Redzuan and Azwan, who had explained that their motive was to settle liabilities (including debts to illegal moneylenders for one) and the impetus was to raise and maintain a flow of funds that could only be met by the **_fortnightly_** deliveries of at least **_twenty_** sets of toners taken from BNP Paribas and ANZ Banks. Juxtaposing Mr Lim’s assertion that there was “_sometimes not enough set_(s)”, their evidence was that there had never been any “_shortage_” as the three had worked in tandem to combine the takings from the two banks to make up the 20 sets of toners.

### No reference to dealings with karang guni men in prior statements

106    At cross examination, Mr Lim was not able to offer an explanation as to why he had not mentioned his course of dealings with _karang guni_ merchants in any of his police statements, even as his asserted interactions with them had begun to form a major thrust in his assertion that he had dealt with Messrs Redzuan and Shahrin in good faith, in the innocent belief that the toner had been somehow scavenged by the two men in the same manner that _karang guni_ dealers sourced items of interest to sell him.

107    Indeed the learned DPP was able to point out that this was not mentioned these interactions with _karang guni_ dealers in his _cautioned_ statements recorded pursuant to section 23 of the CPC[^105], the first of which was recorded significantly later than the statements above; on 23 June 2017. In that cautioned statement, despite having gone into considerable biographical detail, and a chronology of his business activities in the statement, Mr Lim had merely put forth a generic denial that “_I really got no intention to do any offence against the law. Hence I hope to plead for lighter sentence_”. A further set of cautioned statements was taken from Mr Lim when the previously preferred single charge under section 413 of the Penal Code for the alleged criminal conduct of habitually dealing in stolen property was amended to the present iteration of 24 counts under the CDSA in March 2018. DPP Gregory Gan pointed out[^106] that Mr had not taken the opportunity to state his interactions with _karang guni_ as a foundation of his belief that he was dealing in good faith. Rather, he had struck an obdurate stance causing SSI Colin Joseph to annotate that “_The accused requested not to sign on the charge. He also refused to make any comment on the charge read to him_”[^107].

### Accused’s blatant disregard of his own accounting system

108    Perhaps one of the more surprising aspects of Mr Lim’s evidence was the fact that he had from the time of inception of his business in 2006, put in place a system of **_documenting_** transactions, which he had somehow chosen to **_disregard_** no fewer than 24 times in the entire period of his dealings with the co-accused persons in the predicate offences. The accused acknowledged that _One Copier_ had issued payment vouchers to document payments made, after he had been presented with invoices from parallel importers when he purchased toners from them. While he reiterated that his business was too small to have a separate finance department, Mr Lim indicated that he had, among his 15 staff at the time, an account assistant who would take care of these details. This account assistant’s role was to deal in accounts[^108]. When goods, such as toners were delivered from a parallel importer, he would pass the accompanying invoice to his account assistant, who would then issue the payment voucher. It was the account assistant’s job to ensure that there were “_written records_”[^109] to show that the transacting party had received his cheque. The accounts assistant would also be responsible for preparing the general ledger and other documents to fulfil reporting obligations for business accounts.

### Accused’s prevarication as to whether an inventory record was maintained for toners

109    When asked by the DPP whether any individual in _One Copier_ maintained an inventory record of stocks of items such as purchases of toners from parallel importers, Mr Lim indicated that his administrative assistant; a certain “_Ms Liyana_”[^110] was the one who would “_normally_”[^111] keep such a record. Mr Lim then **_backtracked_** and stated that he did not know whether Ms Liyana did in fact maintain such as record, as he “_seldom check_(ed) _with her_”. Mr Lim then concluded the series of questions by conceding that Liyana’s role was essentially that of a receptionist, to connect inquiring parties to the appropriate personnel in the company. What was perplexing was the fact that Mr Lim, as an employer of Ms Liyana in a sole proprietorship business, **_was unable to definitively state his own administrative assistant’s scope of duties or functions that he had delegated to her_**, and remained unsure if she had indeed maintained an inventory to record and monitor stocks of toners purchased. To obtain a full flavour of Mr Lim’s puzzlingly avoidant and non-specific responses on whether Mr Liyana did in fact maintain an inventory of toners, and indeed even what her exact role was in the accused’s business, I have set out the relevant extract from the transcript[^112]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

So, let say One Copier buys all these goods from the parallel importer, will the---will there be someone in the company who will keep a record of how many goods your business has bought from the parallel importer?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Normal---normally, it should be, uh, the record should be keep by the admin assistant, uh, Liyana_**. So, I **_don’t know whether he_**\[sic\] **_keep or not_**, uh, **_I’m not sure because I---I---I seldom check with her._** So, each time when the technician come and draw parts, they will draw to, uh, my, uh---uh, admin assistant, Liyana. So, there is, uh---uh, DO, uh, to show that they draw the---the toner.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, you mentioned Liyana. Okay, correct me if I’m wrong. Would I be right to say that it is her role to keep the invoices that you received from the parallel importers?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Just now I already mentioned, the invoice go to the account assistant (breathing).

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Then, **_what is Liyana’s role_** in your company? I mean in your business.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. **_Liyana, uh, is like a receptionist_**. She receive the incoming call. If the sales call, it will go to the sales person. If the account call, if someone asking for payment or someone want to pay---want to make payment it will go to the account assistant. If com---if customer complaining about our machine have problem, then he---she is the one who will assign a technician to go down to repair the machine, or someone who, uh---um, our customer call for a toner, so, he will---she will assign---he will---she will issue toner and ask the---uh---e---ask the technician to deliver.

### The accused’s belief that Redzuan and Shahrin were actual delivery men was premised on a “tiger-face” insignia logo on the boxes the toners were delivered in

110    At cross examination, the DPP posed a series of questions querying why Mr Lim would believe that Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin were delivery personnel despite the background circumstances which should have raised suspicions. In this regard, DPP Gregory Gan listed the fact that the toners were new, supplied in large quantities, and sold at the low price of $140 per set (or the even lower $130 as Mr Lim had contended) where parallel importers were charging $240 per set. The fact remained that the two men were complete strangers who had initiated contact with Mr Lim[^113]. The prosecution observed that Mr Lim had never even **_asked_** for Redzuan’s full name and the company that he had worked for. Mr Lim in response, asserted his basis for believing that Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin were delivery men as the toners had been packed into distinctive box with a tiger faced insignia. Mr Lim took an image of a truck bearing the same tiger-visaged insignia and bearing the legend “_Asian Tigers Mobility_”[^114]. The following exchange, while lengthy, is nevertheless significant as it encapsulates the premises relied on by the defence that the accused had a basis to believe that the two men were delivery men despite Mr Lim never making any direct inquiries of their identity or place of work[^115].

>   
| 

(DPP) Q:

 | 

And so, this stranger came to you offering to sell toners for the first time and you never asked him questions about the source of the toners.

 |
| 

(Accused)A:

 | 

The answer---the, uh, they already gave me, they are from delivery team. That is what I answered just now to you.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. They are from delivery team. **_Did you ask them which delivery team?_**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Never._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Never. **_You never asked them about source of toners, you never asked them about delivery team. Actually, even before you bought the toners from Mr. Redzuan for the first time, did you make a record of his particulars, his contact number_**?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Uh, I---we have WhatsApp. I got, uh, one handphone number._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**_Okay. What about full name, which company he’s working for? Did you ask him?_**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_No, I don’t have his full detail and I don’t know his full name._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, this stranger came up to you, offered you printer toners and you bought the toners from him on several occasions from 2014 to 2015. Am I correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And not once did you ask him for his full particulars?

 |
| 

A

 | 

They are not necessary.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**_They are not necessary. Not once did you ask him to confirm that he was really a deliveryman?_**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_No, I believe him_**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And I suppose did---I mean **_Redzuan or Shahrin_**, they **_never gave you any proof_** that they were actually deliverymen, would I be right to say that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, **_I believe him because when I received the goods, I have sometime received the box where it says that outside the box have a logo tigers_**. So, I believe that is the company he work for. So, many---many occasion I received that box. So, it has made me sure that the---he work for this company. It’s so-called as---uh, it’s a logistic company.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But **_you never asked him to confirm that he worked for the logistic company_**? Is that your evidence?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, **_I never asked him but it’s---I thought he is really from this logistics company. Because many occasion, I received this box and it’s a brand new. Brand new box_**.

### Evidence of DW 2 Nur Liyana Binte Johal

111    Ms Nur Liyana Binte Johal (Ms Liyana) had worked as a receptionist and administrative assistant at _One Copier_ since July 2014. Ms Liyana confirmed that the business did a substantial trade in toners, along with its other business activities. Ms Liyana was able to name several suppliers of the toners. Ms Liyana named a number of parallel importers which included Co-Mac Corporation Private Limited, and TopOne Resources Pte Ltd from which the defence exhibits showing parallel imports of Fuji Xerox toners had been obtained. Other companies named included Sinotron Pte Ltd, Magnathon Pte Ltd and PN-Data Pte Ltd. Ms Liyana added that Mr Lim had other suppliers of toners to the business, whom she referred to as her “_boss’ friends_”[^116] who were individuals he would directly buy toner cartridges from. These individuals included a Chinese man named “_Mr. James_”, as well as a Chinese couple. The third person was a man named “_Wan_”, who was of course Mr Redzuan. She stated that ‘_Mr James’_ who supplied toners never produced any invoices for the toners he supplied, and was paid directly by Mr Lim. She noted that “Mr James” brought in “_only a few_”[^117] “_loose boxes_[^118]” with each visit, which he would carry by hand. The boxes were similar to the container for Fuji Xerox toners tendered to court[^119]. The Chinese couple used a trolley to deliver the toners they sought to sell.

### Redzuan’s use of a “big box” with a tiger-face logo

112    Like the Chinese couple Mr Redzuan also came with a trolley. Ms Liyana recalled that Mr Redzuan would attend at Mr Lim’s office with the boxed toner cartridges contained within a big box that had a Tiger-faced logo. Ms Liyana had also previously seen the insignia at the void deck of her apartment block and had been told by her husband that that logo belonged to a company of movers. By sheer coincidence, Ms Liyana had seen the tiger-faced insignia the very day she was giving evidence, at the premises of the State Courts itself. She had seen the logo on a truck and also observed persons who were apparently from the company, clad in yellow uniforms[^120]. (Note: A unit of the Asian Tigers’ Mobility Group; a logistics company, had been contracted to facilitate the State Courts’ move from the legacy State Courts “Octagon” building to the new building, and DW2 appeared to be alluding to the personnel and their equipment).

### Visitation patterns of, and quantities carried by, Redzuan

113    Ms Liyana’s testimony of the frequency of Redzuan’s visits differed in some respects from her employer’s account. She had initially stated that Mr Redzuan would cone once or twice a month, but then corrected herself that “_some months he didn’t come_.”[^121] Ms Liyana indicated that Mr Lim would generally deal directly with Mr Redzuan when he attended at the office. When Mr Lim was out of office, he would ask her to help by counting the toners. Somewhat surprisingly her count was “_maybe 20 to 30 pieces_” of **_individual toner cartridges_** (which would compute to five to seven-and-a-half **_toner sets_**), This would be at the **_low_** end of Mr Lim’s own count in his testimony. To recap, Mr Lim had had specified at cross-examination that it would only be “_sometimes”_ that _“less than 10 set_(s)” were produced. In these occasional situations, he could remember the usual deficit to entail a small shortfall resulting “_sometime 8, sometime 9”_ sets being delivered[^122]_._ Rather more surprising, she had never encountered, much less dealt with, Mr Shahrin in the course of her work[^123], despite being as the firm’s receptionist, and this the first point of contact for visitors to the premises at Genting Lane.

### Cross-examination of DW2

114    At cross examination, Ms Liyana backtracked a little to DPP Eric Hu’s question as to whether Mr Redzuan would “_often come with another Malay guy_” by stating that Mr Redzuan would come alone “_most of the time_”, but she allowed that she had seen “_another Malay guy …only like one or two time, not most of the time_”,[^124] which was the exact reverse of Mr Redzuan’s and Mr Shahrin’s accounts that the two almost invariably went together, unless prevented by an exigency which allowed only one to make the trip to Genting Lane. Ms Liyana stated that neither men wore uniforms, unlike the _Asian Tigers_ delivery workers she had seen at the State Courts.

115    Ms Liyana agreed that a supplier would typically bring an invoice, and she was expected to check the invoice order to tally the description of the goods before signing on the invoice. The work process would them call for a copy of the invoice to be signed and stamped by her before the copy of the invoice was sent to the finance section. The accounts executive would then issue a payment voucher to the supplier. She confirmed that neither Mr Redzuan, nor the other “_Malay guy_” had ever brought in an invoice for this purpose[^125]. She was also sure that no invoice had ever been tendered by Mr James when he brought in the toners. She believed that the Chinese couple had invoiced _One Copier_ but could not substantiate this. It was, in my view significant that that her impression of Mr Redzuan was so **_faint_** that she could not identify his image from a set of four photographed individuals. Ms Liyana similarly had no impression of the other “_Malay guy_” (i.e. Mr Shahrin).[^126]

116    On the DPPs questions on how the operations were run at _One Copier_, Ms Lilyana agreed with the learned DPP’s characterisation of Mr Lim as the “_only boss_” of _One Copier_ who made the decisions of the company and singly handled its operations. When Mr Lim left the office, there were no delegated personnel to make decisions on his behalf, and the standing order for staff was to wait for his return.[^127]

## ANALYSIS

### Findings from analysis of the factual matrix

117    The following are a series of findings which, in my judgment, are substantiable from the body of documentary and testimonial evidence adduced from the prosecution’s and defence’s respective cases. The headings in bold italics state the conclusion I have drawn upon analysis, and the body of the text explain the basis for the findings.

### The actual number of printer toners taken by Shahrin, Azwan and Redzuan, and supplied to the accused was in excess of the 40 individual toner cartridges that the prosecution had specified in each charge for the 2nd to 24th charges.

118     _Fuji Xerox_ did not appear to have a means to definitively tabulate what the three men connected to Mr Lim’s case had taken. There is no doubt that vast quantities were misappropriated given the rampant over-ordering and abnormal consumption patterns observed by PW2 Lai Toh Meng. In their Joint Statement of Facts, the two men categorically admitted to the supply of **_960_** separate toner cartridges to Mr Lim, spaced over 24 occasions, on a fortnightly basis. The primary source for what had been taken would come from the statements taken from the accused persons, along with their oral testimony in court. In respect of the latter, the men had explained that the frequency of their trips was due to financial stress.

119    To recapitulate, Mr Redzuan at ANZ Bank, had indicated that he and the two-man team of Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan at BNP Paribas Bank had combined their hauls of misappropriated toners to generally keep to a level that did not fall below the baseline of at least 20 sets of toners (which would amount, in all, to 80 toners, and which was actually **_double_** the number stipulated in each of the proceeded charges). Mr Redzuan has indicated that these which were delivered twice to thrice a month to Mr Lim’s office, They might, on occasion, exceed this quantum, when more than 20 sets would be delivered, but these instances would not occur more than once a month,. Mr Azwan had corroborated this version except that he recalled the schedule being always on a fortnightly basis.

120    Mr Lim’s evidence seemed to be an attempt to shift **_downward_** the numbers of toners presented, from a regular influx of ten sets per fortnight in his three police statements to state the toners _“sometimes_” falling below ten sets, to just “_five to ten sets_”. To recap:

> (a)     In P4, he notes “Shahrin” coming to his place of business “_almost every month about two times with about 10 toners set each trip_.''

> (b)     In P5, Mr Lim states that “Shahrin" came to his shop a total of 24 times and on each occasion sold “_about 10 sets of toners_” to him.

> (c)     In D1: Mr Lim states with certitude _''He came to my office about twice in the month for the year of 2014. Each time he came, he sold me 10 set of tonners.''_

121    In his court testimony, Mr Lim would conversely claim of instances where there were “_sometimes not enough sets_” with the consequential shortfall resulting in the co-accused men bringing over just eight to nine toner sets to his office. This equivocation, which was a departure from the police statements exhibited above of there almost always being ten toner sets presented, appears to be an attempt to make the toner supply seem more **_uncertain and intermittent._** This; along with his reference to the toners being _“sometime_(s) _in loose”_ sets seem a contrivance to bolster the basis of his defence that he believed himself to be dealing with deliverymen bringing in haphazard agglomerations of “unwanted” toners that had become sporadically available in the course of their collection of lease-expired copier machines.

### The actual number of printer toners brought in by Redzuan, on the first occasion was fewer than 40 toner cartridges that the prosecution had specified in the first charge

122    There is only **_one_** instance of near convergence between the accounts of Mr Lim and the co-offenders in the predicate offence in relation to the number of toners exchanged for cash. This would be none other than the first instance where Mr Lim’s lowest end estimate of taking five sets[^128] of toners coheres with Mr Redzuan’s testimonial account that he had brought down “_less than five sets of toners_” in their initial transaction. Although unstated, it seems a practical move to bring fewer toner sets to this first meeting to _test the waters_ of their nascent and untried relationship. What is also significant is that Mr Redzuan is the only co-offender in the predicate offence to give a specific account of the first meeting (which is unsurprising, given his assumed role as liaison or ‘_point person_’ among the co-offenders for external dealings with their then sole buyer; Mr Lim). Mr Redzuan’s account, which was unchallenged in this regard, **_would necessarily mean that the first charge is_** **_not_** **_made out_**. If he had “_less than five sets of toners”_, he would have had fewer than 20 separate toner cartridges, and thus received considerably fewer than the “_at least_” 40 separate toners alleged in the first charge.

### The probable number of toners actually sold to the accused

123    As mentioned above, it would be a challenge to arrive at a definitive conclusion on the precise number of toners misappropriated, save for a _‘ball park’_ approximation extrapolating from the accounts of the co-accused individuals in the predicate offence. What must be clear is that the takings must have been on a very extensive scale for the criminal activity to be picked up and investigated with the level of expedition described by the witnesses from _Fuji Xerox_.

124    While the prosecution has understandably used the lower number of ten toner sets on 24 occasions, _per_ Mr Lim’s statements, to derive their figure of **_960_** toner cartridges (as specified in the Joint Statement of Facts admitted by Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan) being 40 toner cartridges being sold to the accused in each of the 24 instances, their own evidence presented at trial shows that the figure is, as stated above, too **_high_** for the first charge, but rather on the **_low_** side for the 23 remaining charges.

125    A more accurate tabulation of the number of toners sold to Mr Lim can be derived by deeming Mr Redzuan’s first personal encounter with the accused to involve the exchange of **_16_** individual toner cartridges (i.e. “_less than five sets_”), together with Mr Azwan’s evidence of subsequent transactions constituting a steady stream of 20 sets of toners supplied at each of the remaining 23 occasions. Incidentally, Mr Azwan’s count would yield the **_lowest_** number among the three co-accused persons’ accounts, as this excludes the occasional third trip each month to Mr Lim’s office described by Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin.

126    The computation for the latter 23 charges would thus sum up to 80 individual cartridges multiplied 23 times, amounting to 1840 toner cartridges. Adding the projected 16 individual toners for the first charge, Mr Lim would have received, from the accounts of the three prosecution witness, **_no fewer than 1856 individual toner cartridges_** from _Fuji Xerox_ stocks pillaged by these three co-accused person in the course of their trading relationship, which ran its course in approximately just a year.

### The evidence of PW 5 Shahrin, PW 6 Redzuan and PW7 Azwan, were corroborative and internally and externally consistent

127    The learned DPPs have characterised the evidence of the co-accused in the predicate offence in the following terms[^129]:

> 11    Apart from **_corroborating each other on material points_**, the testimonies of Redzuan, Azwan, and Shahrin were also **_internally consistent, and free from material contradictions_** during cross-examination**_._** As for any minor discrepancies in their evidence or their inability to recall facts fully, these are only to be expected, given that the witnesses were testifying about events that took place three to four years before their court testimony. Courts have recognised that adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection (_PP_ v _Singh Kalpanath_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 158</span> at \[60\])12 and these discrepancies do not detract from Redzuan’s, Azwan’s and Shahrin’s

> \[Emphasis added\]

128    I would agree with the DPPs on their assessment of the quality and overall coherence of the evidence offered by the three men. Turning first to the issue of **_apparent_** discrepancies, it was clear that there were differences between the testimonies of the three men. The most glaring would be Mr Redzuan’s and Mr Shahrin’s testimonies of there being occasionally **_three_** trips to deliver toners each month as against Mr Azwan’s stolid insistence that the expeditions to Mr Lim’s office were unvaryingly on a fortnightly basis.

129    As alluded to earlier, Mr Azwan never embarked on these trips as he remained ensconced at BNP Paribas site overseeing work operations, while the other two men undertook the forays. Hence, I would prefer the version given by Messrs Redzuan and Azwan given their better imprinted memories of events that they had personally experienced. The two would have a clearer recollection of the timings of their deliveries each month, as these events would have taken considerable co-ordination and planning (since the two men had to pool their ‘takings’ and sometimes arrange transport with “_Bong_”) as well as direct interactions with Mr Lim, in Mr Redzuan’s case.

130    The appropriate treatment of seeming discrepancies was elucidated in _Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 922</span>; <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 77</span>, where Yong Pung How CJ held (at \[34\]):

> 34    …**_In weighing the evidence of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection will be recognised by the court_**: see _Chean Siong Guat_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span>. **_The question for the court in each case is whether the alleged discrepancies are sufficient to destroy the credibility of the witnesses_**, and I found that they were not in the present case. In my judgment, counsel for the appellant failed to achieved anything by such hair-splitting and microscopic dissection of the evidence.

### PW 5, PW6 and PW7 are independent witnesses and would not have borne any grudge against the accused

131    In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that all three men could be properly deemed to be entirely independent witnesses who had, at most, conducted arms-length, albeit criminal, “business” dealings with Mr Lim. Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan had served out their imprisonment terms at the time of their testimonies, and Mr Redzuan had been dismissed from Fuji Xerox but never prosecuted. There should be **_no_** issue of any of the three men harbouring any **_ill-will_** or **_grudge_** against Mr Lim, as he had played no direct role in their incarceration or other travails. As can be seen by the testimonies of _Fuji Xerox_ executives PW2; Toh Lai Meng and PW 3; Stephanie Yoong, the discovery of their misappropriations had been solely been through the assiduous forensic and investigative efforts of _Fuji Xerox_ technical personnel, who were seeking to uncover the basis for the irregular toner usage patterns at the sites where the three men had worked.

132    All in all, Mr Lim’s relationship with the co-offenders in the predicate offences had been mutually beneficial while it lasted. There also had been no discernible souring of ties after Mr Lim had unilaterally lowered his price to $110 per toner set. The three men had adroitly disengaged from dealings with him, and, in quick order, found an alternate buyer in Mr Sahirudin.

### DW2 was an inobservant witness who never enquired into the affairs and dealings at her place of work

133    I would certainly not disregard the evidence of DW2; Ms Liyana, simply because she was still in the employ of Mr Lim at the time she gave her evidence. My concern with her testimony lies with her very faint impression of the events and persons involved. As mentioned earlier in these grounds, Ms Liyana could not even pick out the image of Mr Redzuan, a man who had attended at the Genting Lane office where she had worked as a receptionist, on close to 24 occasions, from a field of just four photographed men. She also could not pick out Mr Shahrin[^130].Equally curious would be her initial failure to recall Mr Shahrin being there at the examination-in-chief of her testimony,[^131] only to state at cross-examination that she had seen another Malay man “_only like one or two time, not most of the time_”.

134    I found Ms Liyana’s account of **_only_** Mr Redzuan making the deliveries to be inherently externally inconsistent, not just because they conflicted with the accounts of the other scene witnesses in the prosecution’s case, but by the simple fact that the carriage of the large number of toners (40 individual cartridges according to Mr Lim, and **_at least_** 80 separate toners according to the three prosecution witnesses) was essentially a **_two-man_** job. It was not disputed that Mr Lim’s office was on the fifth floor of an industrial building and required travel through a cargo lift, with a degree of navigation through corridors to reach the entrance, where the receptionist; Ms Liyana, would be alerted of their presence. The fact that she failed to apprehend the presence of the second person on most of these visits did not speak well of Ms Liyana’s powers of observation.

135    At cross-examination, Ms Liyana also seemed tentative about the number of sets that Mr Redzuan had brought at each instance, asserting first that he brought only “_20 pieces_”[^132] of toners, before admitting that’s she was “_not sure_”[^133] as to the quantity of toners brought when the DPP sought to square her response with Mr Lim’s police statements. This was despite her evidence that she had been delegated with the responsibility of **_counting_** the toners whenever Mr Lim was not around when Mr Redzuan attended at their office.

136    Ms Liyana was candid that she did not know much the goings-on in her place of work despite being the sole admin assistant engaged by Mr Lim, and despite having worked there for five years. She did not disagree with the DPP’s suggestion that Mr Lim had a penchant to “_keep things to himself_”[^134] and admitted to not even knowing his full name aside from “Mr Mike Lim” or his preferred workplace moniker of “Mr Mike”. Given the workplace culture, she had also kept to herself and not seen fit to question Mr Lim why Mr Redzuan had never been asked to produce an invoice[^135]. Ultimately, it seemed incongruous that the only aspect of her evidence that Ms Liyana seemed clear about was that Mr Redzuan carried the toners in a large box with an _Asian Tigers_ logo. This appeared to be the principal _raison d’etre_ for her to be called as a defence witness.

## BASIS FOR ACQUITTAL OF ONE CHARGE AND CONVICTIONS FOR THE REMAINDER

137    The central question relevant to criminal culpability is of course whether Mr Lim had **_reasonable grounds_** to believe that the toners he purchased from Mr Shahrin and Mr Redzuan were benefits from criminal conduct. Before I embark on a synthesis of the presented evidence to juxtapose with what can be established about Mr Lim’s actual knowledge and believed, and what he can be presumed to have known of the commission of the predicate offences that he is accused of partaking of the fruits from, it would be apposite to consider the law in this area.

### The test in Ang Jeanette v Public Prosecutor

138    In _Ang Jeanette_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span> (“_Ang Jeanette_”), V K Rajah JA held at \[70\] that:

> 70    Before going into the facts revealed in the Appellant’s statements to the CAD that show that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the moneys she was dealing with were derived from criminal conduct, it would perhaps be useful, at this juncture, to reiterate briefly the local case law on the meaning of “reasonable grounds to believe”. In _Ow Yew Beng_ v _PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 536</span>, **_the High Court held_** (at \[10\]) **_that having “reason to believe” involved a “lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation”. In applying the test, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (ie, including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (ie, infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man_** (see _Koh Hak Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 733</span> at \[13\] and _PP v Wang Ziyi Able_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 61</span> at \[87\]).

139    Put simply, _Ang Jeanette_ reaffirmed prior appellate authority that _''reason to believe_'' would be a state of knowledge or cognition which involves a _'lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation'_. An important caveat in applying the test would be for the court to be mindful to “_assume the position of the actual individual involved (including his knowledge and experience) but reason from the perspective of an objective reasonable man_.

### The accused’s presumptive knowledge and experience

140    Mr Lim had run his sole proprietor business of One Copier and Office Supplies since 2006 with a sufficient level of proficiency as to be able to sustain the employment of 15 staff, at the material time. Mr Lim’s trade knowledge in that industry would be even more extensive, as he had started as a copier technician in 1991, and working in that capacity for some eight years, before starting his first forays to running his own business .

141    From his own evidence Mr Lim was acutely aware of the practices in his chosen industry. In the area of multi-function copiers, Mr Lim’s business dealt with an assortment of services linked to second-hand photocopiers, including sales, rentals, servicing and repair of such devices. Mr Lim would thus be expected to have considerable technical know-how of the devices. More importantly, he was _au fait_ with leasing arrangements for these photocopiers, the pricing of toner cartridges as well as the avenues for sourcing them. To recap, Mr Lim’s expressed motivation was that he had found _Fuji Xerox’s_ pricing $520.53 for a toner set (comprising four toners of cyan, yellow, magenta and black cartridges) sold to customers who were not under a service contract to be too expensive, and thus sought recourse from other less costly avenues.

### No evidence of parallel imports pre-dating the arrest of co-accused persons

142    To recap, Mr Lim’s evidence was that he had resorted to _ad hoc_ purchases of toners from individuals who had come into his office, upon being made aware of his interest in these items. Mr Lim had also claimed to have purchased from parallel importers but has not exhibited invoices or vouchers pre-dating the **_relevant_** period in 2014 to 2015. The invoices and vouchers exhibited[^136] were in June, July and September 2016, several months **_after_** the net closed on the co-accused persons in the predicate offence in late-February 2016. Mr Lim claimed to have an accounts clerk managing, and presumably archiving his trade and financial documents, and should have had no difficulty producing documents of purchases from parallel importers if he had indeed been importing _Fuji Xerox_ printer toner cartridges from these sources at the material time. Curiously, none ever were.

### Applying Ang Jeanette’s ‘objective reasonable man’ test to the instant case

143    In relation to the 24 impugned transactions where Mr Lim purchased “_under five sets_” of toners in the first, and at least 20 sets of toners in the subsequent 23 courses of dealing, the essential question _per Ang Jeanette_ was whether an individual with Mr Lim's background and experience, from the standpoint of an objective reasonable man, would have been put on guard in relation to these regular influxes of brand new toners, and assessed for himself the possibility that the goods being proffered were actually another person's (or persons’) benefits from criminal conduct.

144    In this regard, I would start my analysis with Mr Lim’s initial response to SSI Joseph on 27 February 2016, which was recorded very shortly after the arrest of Mr Azwan and Mr Shahrin. Mr Lim had then stated that “Shahrin” (actually Mr Redzuan) had not volunteered where he had sourced the toners from. When he had asked, “Shahrin” had responded that “it _was extra toner from used photocopier_”[^137] The account of ‘Shahrin” sourcing as member of a delivery team only came about in his third statement in November 2016. In this statement, it is telling that Mr Lim articulated some “_suspicion_” about the _provenance_ of the toners. For ease of reference, the relevant passage[^138] states:

> Q8    Given that a toner would be USD $240 from a supplier and you had bought from **_Shahrin_** at SGD $130, did you have any suspicions about how the toners were procured?

> A8     **_I did have my suspicion and I did ask Shahrin where he got the toners from. He told me that he was from the delivery team and sometime_** (_sic_) **_he would collect toners from customers whereby the machine had already been returned to the company and the toner were just left unused_**. So there is no need for the toners. When he told me this. I accepted his explanation.

145    Mr Redzuan’s version was different, as he denied having had any discussions with the accused, where he had allegedly told Mr Lim that the toner cartridges supplied were extra toner left over after the repossession of photocopier machines. Mr Redzuan, who was the only one who liaised on a regular basis with the accused, had maintained that he merely told Mr Lim that the toners were “_from a friend_.”. Mr Redzuan had indeed stated that he was a “_delivery driver_”, but explained that he used this cover only to obfuscate his identity as an employee of _Fuji Xerox_ and had never made any specific representations to the toners being a by-product of delivery collections of copier machines. Mr Redzuan had indeed noted that Mr Lim had been generally incurious about him or the _provenance_ of the toners after their initial meeting.

## BASIS FOR ACQUITTAL FOR THE FIRST CHARGE

146    In either version, I did **_not_** find implausible or especially incongruous that Mr Lim, despite never having met Mr Ridzuan before he showed up at the Genting Lane office with the first sets of toners, would have unhesitatingly accepted either that Mr Redzuan; describing himself as a delivery driver, was selling toners either for himself (_per_ Mr Lim’s account), or on behalf of an unseen and unidentified friend (_per_ Mr Redzuan’s account). This is because Mr Lim might well have been **_habituated_** to persons attending and offering _ad hoc_ items for sale, with Ms Liyana mentioning other parties who had come in from time to time; “_Mr James_” and a Chinese couple. “_Mr James_” was described as an individual given to hand-carrying a few boxes of items to sell to the accused at each visit. If Mr Redzuan had indeed turned up with just “_under five sets of toners_” as Mr Redzuan had claimed to have brought, his offering would not, in my judgment, have spiked the index of suspicion to any higher level than “_Mr James’_” sporadic forays to Mr Lim’s office with his few boxes of unspecified items would have generated.

147    Mr Redzuan did not specify what he meant by “_under five sets of toners_”. The maximum number would be 16 toners in four **_complete_** sets, or possibly up to 19 **_loose_** individual toners, although the former seems more likely, as the evidence shows quantities always being expressed in complete sets of the four constituent colours. Whether one accepts Mr Lim’s account that Mr Redzuan’s told him that these toner were his pickings while moving copier machines, Mr Redzuan’s version that he was a delivery driver who was disposing of certain items on behalf of a friend, the fact of either explanation, with the proffering of a relatively **_small_** quantity of toners would **_not_** have, in my view, given Mr Lim reasonable grounds to believe that the toners he purchased in **_that first instance_** to be benefits from criminal conduct. This conclusion is, of course, separate and distinct from the fact that the first charge is technically not made out, where the prosecution’s principal witness states in his court testimony that the quantity of toners he carried fall far short of the “_at least 40 toners_” specified in the first charge.

## BASIS FOR CONVICTION FOR THE REMAINING 23 CHARGES

### The increased quantities and continued availability should have raised the index of suspicion in the subsequent deliveries of toners

148    There is no dispute that Mr Lim made no further enquiries regarding the toners with Mr Redzuan, or indeed Mr Shahrin in relation to the toners after the first transaction. This aspect is enormously significant when Mr Redzuan returned just a fortnight later with more than **_four times_** the number of toners. While it would not be abnormal for Mr Lim to regard Mr Redzuan’s previous batch of “_less than five sets_” to have been a “**_windfall_**” acquisition on his, or his or his “friend’s”, part, where the delivery person at the scene had implicitly, if not by explicit permission, been given a licence to retain the toners, it was quite a different thing for Mr Redzuan to return with no fewer than 20 sets, translating to a total of **_80 individual toners_**.

149    On the facts, from the **_second_** charge onward, Mr Lim would now be purchasing a **_very_** substantial quantity of unopened and apparently new toners from persons who were still not known to him. Mr Lim never even took the trouble to find out Redzuan’s real name, and merely referred to him as “_Wan_”. Mr Lim's own evidence is that the toners came in their individual packaging in sealed cartons. _Per Ang Jeanette_, Mr Lim’s knowledge and experience comes to play here. Mr Lim, as a veteran in the photocopier industry since 1991, and the owner of _One Copier_ since 2006, would be aware that the toners (stated to have changed hands at $140 per set by the co-accused men, and $130 by Mr Lim) were also **_substantially lower priced_** than the cost $220 to $240 he could expect to pay from a parallel import supplier, let alone the $520.53 per set of toners that Fuji Xerox sold to customers without a service contract with Fuji Xerox.

### Absence of documentation suggests an intention of subterfuge to obscure payments for illicitly obtained goods

150    Mr Lim who ran an SME employing a staff of 15, stated that he had an account executive to document his business transactions. While there was an aspect of spontaneity in Mr Redzuan showing up in his office in the **_first_** instance after a brief tele-conversation, which might have militated against the preparation of documentation there and then as he seized the opportunity to make a quick profit, it is inexplicable that the **_subsequent_** 23 transactions remained undocumented, and the court as finder of fact, must enquire if Mr Lim had a motive keeping the transactions figuratively _“below the radar_”. Specifically, whether he knew, or at least harboured his own suspicions that these huge quantities of toner sets were illicitly obtained by the men, whom he barely knew, but who were calling on him every two weeks.

151    The fact remains that the payments were undocumented, with Mr Lim never being billed with an invoice or Mr Redzuan acknowledging receipt of monies on a payment voucher. Mr Lim seemed prepared to pay enormous sums of cash. In this regard, Mr Lim claimed to have drawn the cash from his corporate ATM card,[^139].and indicated that the amount of money drawn up it would be reflected into his bank statement. Mr Lim would also notify his account executive to note that the cash drawn in such transaction should be treated as his “_business expenses_”. Notwithstanding this contention, Mr Lim has not exhibited any accounts from _One Copier_ documenting the specific payments for Mr Redzuan’s deliveries of _Fuji Xerox_ toners, in the course of the proceedings.

152    The production of contemporaneous and traceable records reflecting these payments would have helped Mr Lim substantiate his belief that he was entering into a series of **_legitimate_** business transactions with Mr Redzuan, which was the central thrust of his defence. Without these, we are left with strange scenario of a seasoned businessman handing over cash of between $2600-$2800 (assuming the purchase of 20 toner sets) fortnightly to a man with whom he had such a loose association that he never learnt his name and only knew him as “_Din_”, with the self-same “_Din_” never issuing a receipt to acknowledge the payment.

153    The absence of a document trial is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the prosecution was not availed a definitive records of exactly how **_many_** toners Mr Lim had purchased from Mr Redzuan and Mr Shahrin, leading to a situation where they have relied on Mr Lim’s own estimate of two deliveries of **_ten_** sets a month to frame the charges, even while the three men who misappropriated the toners had articulated slightly discrepant accounts of far higher quantities, They have generally been _at idem_ that there were at least **_twenty_** toners taken on the journeys spaced in fortnightly intervals. On the other hand, the absence of records pertaining to Mr Lim’s purchases of the misappropriated toners, when juxtaposed by the fact that he **_did_** issue payment vouchers[^140] for parallel imports of the same type of _Fuji Xerox_ toners for purchases made in mid-late 2016 would make it concomitantly difficult for Mr Lim to avoid the impression that he was simply avoiding the creation of a paper trail, the better to maintain a plausible deniability of his role in receiving toners that he had reason to suspect to have been illicitly procured.

154    Mr Lim’s contention that he had made purchases from _karung guni_ (or second-hand goods) dealers has never been proven, and he had failed to mention ever having made such purchases in his police statements, including his cautioned statements[^141] which would have warned of the adverse consequences of failing to mention facts helpful to his case. In a similar vein, Mr Lim’s documented dealings with parallel importers had only been of purchases made **_after_** the arrest of the co-accused persons in late-February 2016, with no tangible documentary proof that he had bought toners from parallel importers in any period **_before_** the misappropriations were uncovered.

155    Even allowing that Mr Lim **_might_** have dealt with _karang guni_ dealers and persons who had sought to sell items to him, these were occasional affairs where relatively small quantities of goods were parlayed. Mr Lim had, in the context of explaining why he had resorted to ordering from parallel importers, revealed that the offerings of _karang guni_ men were relatively paltry, in his words “_And karung guni sometime bring very little, sometime 2 set, 5 set._”[^142]

156    In this case, the sheer scale and regularity of Redzuan’s provision should have put a reasonable businessman in very considerable doubt as to the _provenance_ of the goods. Mr Lim placed considerable emphasis in his case that he had nevertheless trusted Mr Redzuan, as he often carried a box with an _Asian Tigers_ logo, which convinced him that Mr Redzuan was from that logistics company. In relation to the number of instances that Mr Redzuan had represented to him that he was from a delivery team in a logistics company, Mr Lim wavered substantially in this regard, all in the course of a single sequence in cross-examination[^143]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

But you never asked him to confirm that he worked for the logistic company (i_.e. Asian Tigers_)? Is that your evidence?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, **_I never asked him_** but it’s---I thought he is really from this logistics company. Because many occasion, I received this box and it’s a brand new. Brand new box.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, just now I told you the---the big box who store the toner is a brand new box, big box and where the tiger face logo, um, outside the box.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But …are you saying that you assume that Redzuan and Shahrin were deliverymen working for a logistic company?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_I’m sure that---because every time he deliver the toner to me, he always said, “Ah, I---I’m just a deliveryman._** So, my life very tough.” Just like that. He always mention to me but maybe he is tricked or I don’t know. That I’ve been conned by him or I don’t know.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**_So, is it your evidence now that every time he deliver the toners to you, he would say he’s a deliveryman_**?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Not every time. Uh---uh, most of the time, most of the time._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**_Because just a few seconds ago you said “Every time”, now you say “Most of the time.”_** So, what is your evidence?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_Most of the time_**, sorry.

 |

  
  

157    Mr Lim’s narrative inexplicably entails his _never_ asking if Mr Redzuan was a deliveryman who worked for _Asian Tigers_, but nevertheless with Mr Redzuan somehow “_always_” volunteering information that he was a deliveryman “_every time_” he delivered the goods. As the DPP’s questioning continued, these unsolicited revelations were modified by Mr Lim to “_most of the time_”, likely when the accused caught onto how irrational and peculiar this would have seemed. It should be noted that there is no dispute that neither Mr Redzuan nor Mr Shahrin were ever garbed in a manner as to suggest that they were delivery personnel, or otherwise employees of _Asian Tigers_. I had noted that Mr Lim sometimes seemed to falter in expressing himself and had asked for the Mandarin Interpreter to stand by even as he spoke in English (which was his preference).

### The accused’s demand for replacement toners showed an awareness that Redzuan had continuing access to stocks of exactly the same type of toner

158    As mentioned earlier in these grounds, the trading relationship described by Mr Redzuan would certainly be a far departure from such informal trading relationships with _‘karang guni’_ men and delivery drivers, who had what might colloquially described as a _“lucky break’_. These were individual who could, at best, be expected to offer _ad hoc_ agglomerations of goods on an ‘_as is_’ basis. This was necessarily because these dealers and fortunate deliverymen would have chanced upon the goods they offered for sale and thus would be in no position to offer any warranty on their condition, ‘newness’, merchantability or fitness for use. I reiterate again that the fact that Mr Lim perceived himself to be in a position to demand replacements meant that he knew and expected that supplies of the same item were constant and a replacement of exactly the same item, which was a very specific type of printer toner, in a brand new condition, could be sourced and produced to him in a later date. The trading relationship where Mr Lim had an expectation that all toner sets were in brand new condition, is a world apart from ‘_karang guni’_ dealer whose collection pattern would be opportunistic, situational, and even random. These ‘_karang guni’_ dealers would never be in a position to forecast when a specific good or item supplied on one day might again become available on another day.

159    Returning momentarily to the first charge, there is no email or other documentary trial that Mr Redzuan had proposed to form a continuing trading relationship to supply consistent number _of Fuji Xerox_ toner cartridges to _One Copier_ before or around the time of their first meeting. I might well have decided differently if any such evidence had been available. Applying the test elucidated in _Ang Jeanette_, I would accept that an objective reasonable man **_might_** be deceived in the first instance that Mr Ridzuan and Mr Shahrin were seeking to monetise a windfall of retrieved toners obtained in the course of their daily operations. With these premises, I found it appropriate to grant Mr Lim a discharge amounting to an acquittal for the first charge The same reasonable man, however, possessing Mr Lim’s accumulated experience of over two decades in that field (as he had in 2014), would **_not_** expect the persons to return with successive loads of 20 or more sets of brand-new toners cartridges in unopened packages, and not be put to grave suspicion that these were illicitly obtained.

160    Thus, while I was prepared to give Mr Lim the benefit of the doubt for the first charge, it would be impossible to assign any benign explanation to his unquestioning acceptance of the subsequent fortnightly loads of printer toners which turned up in his office door. I would also add that as far as having the requisite _mens rea_ for an offence under section 47(3) of the CDSA , this would have been amply fulfilled from the time of the **_second_** delivery with his acceptance of the twenty sets of toners brought in by Mr Redzuan, If he did indeed reflect on the nature and extent of his involvement through the course of his dealings, Mr Lim’s level of awareness that he was deeply complicit in a course of criminal activity could also increase with **_each successive_** delivery, with the “_reasonable grounds to believe_” level of cognition sufficient to found a conviction under the CDSA likely to eventually evolve to virtual knowledge that he was receiving and processing stolen goods. After the final (24th) delivery, it seems inconceivable that Mr Lim could have entertained a _scintilla_ of belief that the two delivery men he had dealt with could have had a total of **_1840_** unused Fuji Xerox toners; each worth more than $60, come **_honestly_** into their hands, in the course of just a year.

161    I thus found that in respect of the subsequent 23 charges, the prosecution had been proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and found Mr Lim to be guilty as charged, convicting him on the offences specified on the proceeded charges.

## BASIS FOR SENTENCES IMPOSED

### Antecedents and Mitigation

162    Mr Lim had no criminal record. In a short oral mitigation address, counsel stressed Mr Lim’s humble beginnings, where he had started out as a photocopier technician, who by dint of hard work had created a business _One Copier_ which he had run since 2006. Mr Lim was a married father of three daughters, aged 23, 21, and 18 years. His wife was a homemaker, and she as well as two of his daughters are entirely dependent on him. Counsel stressed that One Copier had been in dire straits as a result of the “_crippling effect” of the COVID-19 pandemic”_, and Mr Lim was trying to service an outstanding bank loan of $600,000. He indicated that “_In the absence of the accused, the continued sustainability of the business would be in doubt_.” He stressed that Mr Lim had not sought out the co-accused persons, but they had found him through a Google search. Aside from this, the remainder of counsel’s address focused on his client’s ignorance that he was dealing with proceeds of criminal activity. To be clear, there was nothing of exceptional mitigatory value in the oral plea rendered by counsel.

### Sentencing submissions

163    The prosecution and defence took diametrically opposed positions on the question of an appropriate tariff for Mr Lim’s offences, with the prosecution recommending a global 12-month sentence, and Mr Lim’s counsel advocating a fine. The prosecution’s stand was premised on the fact that Mr Lim would be sentenced on 23 separate charges for acquiring ten sets of misappropriated toners, with the market value of the toners worth an aggregate sum of $56 377.60. The DPPs contended that “_Given the retail value of the goods acquired, the lack of restitution made, and the sentencing precedents, sentences of at least 4 months; imprisonment are appropriate. Further sentences for 3 charges should run consecutively to result in a global sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment_” [^144]. Defence counsel’s reasons for a fine to be imposed included his submission that Mr Lim had not gained anything from the transactions because he could have purchased toners from other deliverymen for smaller sums[^145], that the offence involved a “_low level of harm caused and a low level of culpability_”[^146] and because various subsections of section 47 CDSA allowed for a fine to be imposed[^147]. Suffice to say, I was unpersuaded that Mr Lim’s offending had not crossed the custodial threshold, given the sheer scale and nature of his offending.

### Co-accused’s person’s sentences

164    In their written _Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence_, the DPPs set out the sentences meted out to the co-accused persons, at \[16\]-\[17\]:

> 16    For completeness, the sentences meted out on the co-accused persons are reproduced. Shahrin and Azwan misappropriated (_Fuji Xerox_) toners to sell to the Accused and another buyer by the name of Sahirudin. **_Both Shahrin and Azwan were sentenced to a global sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment._**

> 17     **_Sahirudin_** faced 4 charges under Section 47(3) CDSA and **_was sentenced to a global sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment_**. His charges involved a total loss of $9, 804.80 to (_Fuji Xerox_).

165    In sentencing, I was mindful of the sentences imposed against Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan, for their misappropriated of the _Fuji Xerox_ toners to sell to the accused were necessarily in respect of a distinctly different offence: section 408 Penal Code; which concerned criminal breach of trust (CBT) by employees, and which was a highly aggravated type of CBT carrying a maximum imprisonment term of 15 years, as against the maximum punishment of seven years’ imprisonment for the _simpliciter_ form of CBT. Of far greater significance was the sentence imposed against another buyer of misappropriated toner: Mr Sahirudin, who had taken a smaller quantity of toners from the two aforementioned men.

### Use of precedent section 411 Penal Code cases with similar market value as reference point in sentencing

166    The prosecution tendered a number of precedent cases for sentences imposed for offences contrary to section 411 of the Penal Code to show that custodial sentences of similar duration, to their proposed sentences, had been imposed for cases with which involved the receipt for stolen and misappropriated goods of an equivalent market value using the retail price of the goods.

167    The DPPs cited the case of _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ \[2016\] 4 SLR 1120 (“_Luciana Lim_”) for the proposition that the **_value of the goods_** was a convenient proxy of the level of harm caused from the victim’s perspective, and where it was held that “_in most cases, the retail price was generally a good gauge of the loss suffered by the victim_”[^148]

168     _Luciana Lim_ was a relationship manager at a company dealing in wine and spirits. Over a period of 18 months, she placed a large number of fraudulent orders for expensive alcohol on credit under the names of fictitious clients. She sold the alcohol, which had a retail value of approximately $6.4 million, and retained the proceeds. An issue in contention in _Luciana Lim_ was whether the value of the goods that formed the subject matter of a criminal offence should be assessed by reference to its **_retail price_** or to the **_cost of replacement_**. The appellant there had contended that the district judge had erred in using the retail price ($6.4 million), rather than the replacement cost ($4.5 million), of the alcohol as a measure of its value and had thereby imposed a sentence which was manifestly excessive.

169    The significance between the two in the instant case is the fact that the listed retail price for black toner was **$61.28** while its cost of manufacture was just slightly above _one-third_ of the retail price, at just **$22**. It is important to note that the determination required a close examination of the factual matrix of the specific case in hand, with the general principle being that that loss, which required “_case-specific judgment”_, must always be measured “_within the factual circumstances presented_”[^149].

170    See Kee Oon J in _Luciana Lim_ set out a set of general _indicia[^150]_ to assist in this determination, which have been helpfully summarised by the DPPs in their _Sentencing Submissions[^151]._

> a)      **_Where the goods in question were possessed by the victim for his own use_** and enjoyment, rather than for sale, the replacement cost of the item is generally a good measure of the loss. An example of such an item is a mobile phone;

> b)      **_Where the goods were intended to be sold in the ordinary course of business_**, the sale price of the item should generally be used as the measure of the loss. This reflects the fact that the loss of the victim consists largely of the fact that he is no longer able to sell the item – the opportunity cost of the misappropriation

171    Taking the above criteria in mind, this case does not lend itself to straightforward ‘_pigeon-holing’_ into either category as an expression of harm caused to the victim, namely: _Fuji Xerox_. This is because the printer toners were in fact **_proprietary_** printer toner cartridges from _Fuji Xerox_ itself, and _Fuji Xerox_ would then have full control on the production and supply of the toners. As can be discerned from the evidence of _Fuji Xerox_ personnel, the toners were taken from stocks meant for the servicing of corporate clients who had entered into a service contract. The service contract would entail the provision and replenishment of toner **_free of charge_** for as long as the leasing contract for the copiers remained in force.

### The huge gap between the posted “retail price” and parallel imports of Fuji Xerox toners is difficult to reconcile

172    The sale of toner sets by _Fuji Xerox_ would only occur upon requests made by former service contract customers who had continued to retain _Fuji Xerox_ copiers after the lease had run out. PW3 Ryan Goh’s evidence was that Fuji Xerox did **_not_** sell toners in the **_open market_**, and only supplied toners to former lease customers who were still listed in their register of clients or former clients.

173     _Fuji Xerox_ had provided a price list which had indicated a retail price of **$520.53** for the set of toners printers comprising four toners of cyan, yellow, magenta, and black cartridges. The black cartridge was priced at $61.28, while the cyan and yellow toners were both priced at $153.07, with the magenta cartridge being priced at $153.11. The prosecution had taken the **_lowest price_** of **$61.28**, which was only for **_black_** toner cartridges and used this as the **_uniform_** price in calculating the value of every toner in the sets stipulated in the charges, regardless of their actual colour. Thus, the ten sets specified in each charge would be calculated as 40 toners multiplied by $61.28. I would understand the intent by the prosecution to **_moderate_** the price of the toner sets, but this appeared to be an artificial contrivance which was contrary to the evidence of their own prosecution witness from _Fuji Xerox_ and the price list: Exhibit P3, which was of course a prosecution exhibit, which had specified the levels of differential pricing for the various colours.

174    The situation was unfortunately made even murkier by the fact of the defence being able to show that Mr Lim was able to order large quantities of toner cartridges from parallel importers for **_under_** **$240** a set[^152], which was effectively less than half of _Fuji Xerox’s_ “_official_” posted retail price.

175    The question must arise why _Fuji Xerox_ would set their toners at such an artificially **_uncompetitive_** price (as they would be unlikely to be unaware of the prices quoted by parallel importers) and risk being severely undercut in their market share if customers could buy two sets of parallel-imported toner cartridges for the “_official_” price set for one at _Fuji Xerox_. I would pause to wonder if the pricing (which also imposes an added $80 delivery charge) is simply set so that the supply of these toners was an additional “courtesy” service for former customers to be assured of available stock, while their primary business model remained the provision of a full _suite_ of services under copier leasing contracts and billing on the number of documents printed, where the toners were provided **_without any additional charge_**. The toners stored at BNP Paribas Bank and ANZ Bank would then arguably be, under the _Luciana Lim_ dichotomy, “_goods possessed by the victim for their own use_” where the cost of production would be considered the proper reference point.

176    PW3 Ryan Goh had stated that _Fuji Xerox_ would bill from the monthly print volume tally from each machine that had been placed on lease, and their revenue had been derived from billable charges calculated by print volume. Ultimately, it was important to remember that the items in question were not mass-market consumer-use printer toners, but custom toners used in specialised devices for industrial level printing operations, which would make deriving their market value rather more challenging.

### Difficulty in using the posted retail price for black toners to index against valuations of stolen or misappropriated goods in cited precedent cases

177    The goods in question in the precedent cases for the section 411 Penal Code offences cited in the Prosecution’s Address on Sentence appear to have been specific items stolen (e.g. mobile phones and jewellery) or stock (tiles) sourced from third parties, which would lend to a more readily ascertainable monetary value. In view of the above, I would be cautious to accept the putative “_retail_” price quoted (920 individual toners valued at $61.23 amounting to an aggregate “loss” of $56 377.60) as a reliable indicator of harm for this case. This is especially so if the purpose of such an exercise is to index the derived figure to precedent cases where similar amounts of monetary loss was involved, for the purpose of advocating a custodial term similar to that imposed in the precedent case.

### Deriving a sentencing position from an artificially computed “retail value” is problematic

178    I was not comfortable with the prosecution “**_deeming_**” all toners to have a retail value of $61.28, (which was the posted price for only **_black_** toners) irrespective of their actual colour, as this was against the plain testimony of their own witnesses, and indeed the pricing list admitted as a prosecution exhibit. Stated simply, I had reservations over the propriety of using an artificially contrived value to set up a basis for sentencing in a set of criminal proceedings. This being particularly so when this artifice was to back up a recommendation for a lengthy custodial sentence, which was for a global imprisonment term of 12 months in this case.

### Where production cost would be a more accurate measure than retail price

179    Considering the _Luciana Lim_ dichotomy, I would find it quite legitimate to apply the **_retail or market price_** as a measure of loss where the goods taken were purchased from third parties with valuable consideration, and where the victim had an expectation of reward by reselling these goods in a market or other retail setting. I would see a difference in circumstances where the toners were _Fuji Xerox’s_ **_own_** product to manufacture at will (since the _Fuji Xerox_ had full control by way of intellectual property rights, and other wherewithal to produce **_any_** quantities they deemed fit.) This would apply _a fortiori_ if _Fuji Xerox’s_ principal business model were to use the toners in leasing agreements to generate revenue by billing on print volumes, rather than by the outright sale of the toners.

180    Within these premises, it might then be more appropriate to consider **_production cost_** as the reference point for valuation. I would hasten to state that I am not suggesting that there was no loss to _Fuji Xerox_ over and above the production cost of $22 for each toner. The pillaging of the toners at the scale done would have imposed logistical costs on the supply chain from the need to continually replenish stocks which were artificially depleted by the thefts. By the same token, I have no doubt that the accused stood to gain from his taking the toners at $140 per set, which was close to $100 lower than parallel imported _Fuji Xerox_ toners. Nevertheless, using production cost as a reference point avoids the pitfalls of creating artificial retail prices which do not comport at all with their ‘real world’ price.

### Basis for juxtaposing Mr Lim’s offending against Mr Sahirudin’s in assessment of sentence

181    Notwithstanding the above, I was of the view that the figures of 920 toners with the stated retail value of $56 377.60 for the presumptive value of these toners, were **_still_** relevant reference points in the context of **_comparing the scale_** of Mr Lim’s offending against the acts of Mr Sahirudin, who had also been charged with the receipt of “_no fewer than 40 toners_” in each instance, albeit for a different period of time. Mr Sahirudin had also faced fewer counts of offences under section 47(3) CDSA, where he had pleaded guilty to three charges and consented to the fourth being taken into consideration.

182    To recap, Mr Sahirudin had, metaphorically speaking, stepped into Mr Lim’s shoes after he ceased dealings with Mr Redzuan amd Mr Shahrin. Their offences, while otherwise similar, do not coincide in time, but are consecutive to each other, with the two men being the only known individuals to traffick with the co-accused persons in the predicate offences. Given this level of proximity and connection in offending, it would be apt to ensure an appropriate level of **_parity in sentencing_** between the two offenders.

### Considering parity in sentencing

183    In looking at the issue of parity in sentencing, an appropriate point of reference would be the case of _Chong Han Rui_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> (“_Chong Han Rui_”), where Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon states at \[1\] of the judgment:

> Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system. This is rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law (_Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span> (“_Ng Sae Kiat_”) at \[76\], citing _Green v R_ (2011) 283 ALR 1 at \[30\]). **_The principle of parity in sentencing between co-offenders urges that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. To put it simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished_**. \[Emphasis added\]

184    In _Chong Han Rui_, the appellant had contested his being given a reformative training sentence, while a co-accused person was given a sentence of probation for jointly committed criminal acts, which included moneylender harassment offences. On appeal, the offender’s reformative training sentence was set aside, and a term of probation substituted. In the penultimate paragraph of _Chong Han Rui_, the High Court stressed the importance of considering **_all_** the circumstances of each case and being alive to the possibility of there being differential levels of culpability between co-accused persons to ensure a fair and consistent result for connected offenders[^153]:

> I emphasise however that the parity principle is not to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. **_Rather, it is an important aid to the sentencing court to ensure that sentencing of co-offenders is done in a manner that is broadly consistent and fair._** But ultimately, what is consistent and fair depends on the facts of the case at hand. Thus, in _Public Prosecutor_ v _Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 623</span>, I declined to apply the principle of parity as between the giver and the receiver in a corruption case, highlighting that the parity principle must yield to the particular circumstances presented (see at \[45\]). **_Similarly, I make the point here that it is not the law that every co-offender in a common criminal enterprise must be identically charged or sentenced. Rather, the court will have to consider all the circumstances of each case before arriving at the appropriate sentence_**…

### Statement of Facts for Sahirudin’s case

185    To allow a proper juxtaposition between the manner of Mr Sahirudin’s offending and the instant case, the Statement of Facts for the case against Mr Sahrudin is set out in its entirety:

> 1.    The complainant is Lai Toh Meng, male, 50 years old. He is the director for the Service department of Fuji Xerox Pte Ltd (“Fuji Xerox”), located at 80 Anson Road, Fuji Xerox Tower, Singapore. Fuji Xerox provides document services to its clients. This involves, among other things, providing photocopying machines to their clients and providing printer toners for these machines to their clients.

> 2.    The accused is Sahirudin Bin Ibrahim, male, 38 years old,

> 3.    The co-accused persons are:

>> Muhammed Shahrin Bin Kasamen (“Shahrin”), male, 37 years old.

>> Muhammad Azwan Bin Ahmad (“Azwan”), male, 35 years old.

> 4.    On 26 February 2016 at around 12.40p.m., the complainant made a phone call to the police, informing them that Shahrin and Azwan had ordered excessive printer toners and when confronted, had admitted to having sold them to third parties for cash.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD CHARGES (DAC –921715 – 2017, DAC – 909130 – 2017 & DAC – 909131 – 2018)

> 5.    Between 2014 and 2016, Shahrin and Azwan were employed as document management services officers by Fuji Xerox. They were deployed to work at the Singapore office of BNP Paribas bank (“BNP”), Fuji Xerox’s client at the material time. Their duties involved changing the printer toners for BNP’s photocopying machines when the need arose. They were also required to order more printer toners from Fuji Xerox. These printer toners would be used to service BNP’s photocopying machines. After receiving orders from Shahrin or Azwan by phone calls, Fuji Xerox would deliver the toners to Shahrin or Azwan. Both of them were supposed to store the printer toners in a cabinet at BNP’s Singapore office. The printer toners were to be used only for servicing BNP’s photocopying machines. Thus, Shahrin and Azwan were entrusted with dominion over the printer toners they had ordered from their employer, Fuji Xerox.

> 6.    Sometime between 2014 and 2016, Shahrin and Azwan engaged in a conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust of the printer toners by ordering an excess number of printer toners and selling them for extra money. Pursuant to the conspiracy, at least 160 printer toners were dishonestly misappropriated by both of them between 2015 and 2016. These 160 printer toners are therefore another person’s benefits from criminal conduct under s 408 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), a serious offence listed in the Second Schedule of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”).

> 7.    The accused, on three occasions sometime between 2015 and 2016, purchased the printer toners referred to in paragraph 6 from Azwan. **_On these occasions, the accused would be informed by Azwan via a phone call that Azwan had printer toners to sell. The accused would then drive his Honda car to the basement of BNP’s Singapore office to collect the toners from Azwan. Azwan would push the toners in a trolley to the basement and these boxes of printer toners would be loaded into the accused’s car._** Some of these toners were newly packaged while others had their packaging opened. After collecting these toners, the accused sold them to another person known as Neo Teck Heng (“Neo”) (making a net profit of $10 a toner)

> 8.    According to a sample quotation dated May 2016 (at Annex A), the retail price of a black toner is S$61.28 and the retail price of colour toners is about S$153. Based on the sample quotation, the total retail value of the 40 toners (per charge/occasion) is about S$2,451.20. The total retail value of the 120 printer toners (for the 3 proceeded charges) is about S$7,353.60.

> 9.    The accused admitted that he suspected the toners were stolen but he did not bother as he wanted to earn some money for himself. Thus, the accused had reasonable grounds to believe that these toners were, in whole, directly represents Azwan’s benefits from criminal conduct.

> 10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused, has committed three offences punishable under Section 47(3) p/u Section 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”).

> OTHER INFORMATION

> 11.    In total, the accused acquired at least 160 printer toners from Azwan on four occasions at S$35 per toner. He paid at least S$5,600 in total for these toners. He sold all these toners to Neo at S$45 per toner. The proceeds from these sales amounted to at least S$7,200. Based on the sample quotation, the total retail value of 160 printer toners would have been about $9,804.80.

> \[Emphasis added\]

186    In their _Further Submissions on Sentence_[^154] the prosecution indicated their sentencing position, as well as the eventual sentence which was imposed against Mr Sahirudin. The relevant passage is set out as follows:

> 3…    In this case, while Sahirudin and the accused were not co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise, the toners came from the same source (Fuji Xerox Singapore (“FXS”)), and the accused’s individual charge comprises the same number of toners and value as Sahirudin.

> 4    To recount briefly, Sahirudin faced 4 charges under s 47(3) CDSA for acquiring a total of 160 toners from FXS from Shahrin and Azwan. Each charge involved the acquisition of at least 40 printer toners and the retail price for a black toner was S$61.28. Sahirudin pleaded guilty to 3 out of 4 charges.

> 5     **_The Prosecution submitted for 1.5 to 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of 3 to 4 weeks’ imprisonment_**. On the other hand, the Defence submitted for a total fine of S$15,000, or in the alternative, a global sentence of not more than 9 days’ imprisonment.

> 6     **_Sahirudin was eventually sentenced to 1 week’s imprisonment per charge, with a global sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment._**

### Comparison of the factual matrices of Sahirudin’s case and the instant circumstances

187    As can be seen, Mr Sahirudin received a global **_two-week_** sentence on three proceeded charges. On a “_per-charge_” basis, Mr Sahirudin and Mr Lim had taken **_similar_** quantities of toners _per_ transaction. The difference lay in the fact that Mr Sahirudin had faced four charges and pleaded guilty to three charges with the remaining charge taken into consideration. For these four charges, the total value of the toners would have been computed to amount to $9804.80 (valued at about S$2,451.20 per charge) as against the $58 828.80 in the 24 proceeded charges in the instant case. For the 23 charges, Mr Lim was convicted on, the putative retail value would have computed to be $56 377.60. Calculated from the stated value of the toners taken, the magnitude of Mr Lim's offending was slightly **_under six times_** greater (or precisely 5.75 times) than Mr Sahirudin’s.

### Sahirudin’s restitution and plea of guilt at the doorstep of trial

188    There are other differences, of course. Mr Sahirudin had made a full **_restitution_** amounting to the full value of the toners he received from Mr Shahrin and Mr Azwan. Mr Sahirudin had also **_pleaded guilty_**, albeit not at an early stage. Counterbalancing the above, Mr Sahirudin was arguably more complicit in his commission of the offences he was charged for, in the sense that he had actually **_collected_** the toners directly from one of the two errant employees; Mr Azwan. There was considerable coordination in the execution of these expeditions. Mr Sahirudin would be notified by Mr Azwan by phone that he (Mr Azwan) had printer toners to “**_sell_**”**.** Mr Sahirudin would then drive his vehicle; a Honda car to the basement of BNP Paribas Bank’s Singapore office to collect the toners from Mr Azwan. Mr Azwan would act in synchronicity with Mr Sahirudin’s impending arrival by pushing the toners in a trolley to the basement in the premises and then proceeding to load the boxes of toners into Mr Sahirudin’s vehicle after he had arrived.

189    While Mr Sahirudin’s plea of guilt should be lauded and duly acknowledged, it remains a fact that he had a rather less **_defensible_** case, given his intrusion into BNP Paribas Bank’s basement to collect the purloined toner set, which would have left a conspicuous evidential trial that he would have had great difficulty in explaining away, had Mr Sahirudin chosen to claim continue to trial. I would also note that Mr Sahirudin’s plea of guilt came at a fairly late stage, coming on 21 August 2018 after the matter had been scheduled to proceed for a joint trial with Mr Lim.

### Unlike Sahirudin, the accused did not render active assistance in collecting the misappropriated toners

190    Mr Lim’s role was rather more passive than Mr Sahirudin’s **_direct_** assistance and complicity, which had included trespassing into BNP Paribas Bank’s premises. Mr Lim had, on the other hand, been solicited by Mr Redzuan, and having expressed in interest in purchasing toners, passively waited for Mr Redzuan (and possibly Mr Shahrin) to present themselves at his office. The development of the criminal intent between the two men is also different. Mr Sahirudin had been an enthusiastic accomplice in the criminal enterprise (in the manner described above) from day one. My analysis, as stated earlier in these grounds, was that Mr Lim might well have treated the first purchase (with “_under five sets_” brought as a legitimate transaction with a person who purported to be a delivery driver. My analysis from the earlier part of these grounds was that Mr Lim would only have been alive to the fact that he was receiving stolen goods after the two men attended at his establishment with an exponentially higher quantity of goods again two weeks after the time of the initial charge. Mr Lim's _mens rea_, was in my judgment, confirmed by his acceptance of these good where it would have been hopelessly improbable that mere movers would be able to return two weeks later with the same goods to sell. It is of course an aggravating aspect of Mr Lim's offending that he continued to accept for another 22 further occasions, where it would be increasingly obvious that he was accepting batches of stolen goods with each succeeding fortnightly tranche.

191    In my judgment, while there are aggravating aspects, Mr Lim's offending should generally be **_directly indexed_** with Mr Sahirudin's sentence (with an **_proportionate uplift_** to the scale of his offending) given the parallels in the factual matrices and the identical quantities of “_not less than 40 toners_” stated in the charges, with an appropriate upscaling for the amount involved, the fact that there was no restitution, and no notional discount for any plea of guilt.

### The accused would not have known about the actual nature of the predicate offence

192    Mr Azwan and Mr Shahrin, the two errant _Fuji Xerox_ employees each received 19 months' imprisonment on the proceeded charge under section 408 of the Penal Code. The amalgamated charges faced by both men cited the value of the toners at S$58,828.80 and total cost price of S$21,120 to _Fuji Xerox_. My view is that Mr Lim's sentencing should not be pitched at a level as if he had been **_aware_** that the two men were committing aggravated breaches of criminal misappropriation as servants of Fuji Xerox, especially where the men had taken pains to maintain a certain anonymity in respect of their actual place of employment. Unlike Mr Sahirudin, who had made no fewer than **_four_** audacious collection to Mr Azwan’s workplace at BNP Paribas Bank, Mr Lim seemed entirely oblivious as to where the toners had come from. While he can be said to have turned the proverbial blind eye to the obviously illicit nature of the toners, he would not have known of the exact aggravated nature of offending by Mr Azwan, Mr Shahrin, and the never-prosecuted Mr Redzuan.

### The disproportion between the sentence recommendations for Sahirudin and the accused

193    The prosecution had made a recommendation of a sentence of “_1.5 to 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of 3 to 4 weeks’ imprisonment_” for Mr Sahirudin, as compared to the individual sentences of four months, and a global sentence of 12 months for Mr Lim. The **_four-month_** imprisonment recommendation, in my judgment. seems disproportionate in comparison with the recommendation of one-and-a-half to two weeks’ imprisonment for Mr Sahirudin, being a sentence **_eight to 12_** times higher as recommended (1.5 to 2 weeks against 16 weeks), and a full **_16_** times higher than the individual one-week sentences that were actually imposed.

194    In relation to the global sentence, the prosecution's submission of a 12-month global sentence of imprisonment (from three consecutive sentences of four months imprisonment per charge) was even more extreme, given that this was recommended when the prosecution was already aware that Mr Sahirudin had received a global sentence of two weeks imprisonment. An aggregate 12-month sentence imposed against Mr Lim would be no less **_24 times_** higher than Mr Sahirudin’s two-week global sentence. This is, with respect, grossly disparate when the **_ratios_** of toners taken is considered. Mr Sahirudin was responsible for taking **_four_** sets of “_not less than 40”_ individual toners, while Mr Lim was convicted for receiving **_23_** sets. As indicated above, a division of 23 over 4 would work out to **5.75**. Hence Mr Lim took **5.75** times more toners than Mr Sahirudin. This could not, in my view, have justified a sentence **_24 times_** heavier than that meted to Mr Sahirudin.

195    In their _Further Sentencing Submissions[^155]_, the prosecution had stated:

> 9     **_All considered, the accused’s individual sentences ought to be higher than the sentences imposed in Sahirudin’s case._** In this connection, the individual sentence of at least 4 months’ imprisonment per charge is justified by High Court precedent cases, e.g. _Richard Tan_ v _PP_, _Chan Kiak Huat_ v _PP_.

> 10    The individual sentences are also justified in light of _Anne Gan_, where CJ Menon observed at \[20\] that the totality principle has a boosting effect on individual sentences where they would otherwise result in a manifestly inadequate overall sentence. CJ Menon further stated (at \[22\]) that, in the context of a financial crime where an offender faces multiple charges for having committed multiple iterations of the same offence, the sentencing judge first reaches a provisional view of the individual sentence of each offence, before considering whether the existence of cumulative aggravating factors such as the total amount of dishonest gain justifies calibrating the individual sentences upwards and running those calibrated sentences consecutively.

> 11     **_Turning to the present case, even if 1 week imprisonment is taken as a starting point, following Anne Gan, the 1 week imprisonment term ought to be boosted to take into account the totality of the accused’s criminal conduct, i.e. the total value of the toners acquired, and the accused’s persistence in re-offending over at least 23 occasions._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

196    The impetus to seek individual sentences of four months imprisonment, and a global sentence of 12 months is, as discerned from above, predicated on what seems to be a sense that Mr Lim’s offending is especially egregious. Other than the reference to section 411 Penal Code precedents, which I would not feel to be applicable as the sentencing tariffs in the precedent cases were closely linked to the very tangible and ascertainable retail values of the goods and valuables received by the offenders there. Unlike those case, I have also underscored the fact that there was a level of amorphousness in the pricing of the toners, which made pegging a **“**_retail value_” rather difficult and unreliable, to the point that the prosecution had to depart from _Fuji Xerox’s_ exhibited price list to propose an artificial price, listed for black toners, to be applied to all toners. The appropriateness of deriving a retail price for these particular sets of toners was also dubious, as _Fuji Xerox_ had distributed the toners free of charge to their clients, and sought to bill on a usage basis, calculated from logs of the number of copies printed out.

### The accused, despite receiving the lion’s share of the toners, is less involved and complicit than Sahirudin

197    All in all, I sense that the pegging of a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment also appears to be an attempt to align the ‘**_downstream_**’ punishment of the person who received the **_lion’s share_** of the misappropriated toners with the 19 months’ imprisonment that the **_‘upstream’_** offenders received for the predicate offence (which would include a TIC charge for the $9804.20 in toners supplied to Mr Sahirudin). I would find the pegging of Mr Lim’s sentence with the predicate offence to be likely to yield an unduly harsh sentence as Mr Lim, despite receiving the lion’s share of the toners would have had **_no idea_** that the aggravated offense of criminal breach of trust by an employee was being committed to enable the toners to be brought to him. .

### A more nuanced and all-inclusive examination of the relative levels of culpability of Sahirudin and the accused is merited in this case

198    The irony in this would be that it would be Mr Sahirudin, who would be in a position to have **_actual knowledge_** that the supply of the toners was facilitated by acts of criminal breach of trust by an employee. Mr Sahirudin had, after all, directly aided and abetted in the four instances where he had driven his car directly to BNP Paribas Bank’s basement to receive the toners. He would have no illusions that Mr Azwan, who had emerged to receive him with at least 40 toners, must have been engaged in a form of serious criminal activity given his access to the building, production of the toners, and the surreptitious delivery and hand-over process.

199    Mr Lim, on the other hand, had been ‘**_cold-called’_** by Mr Redzuan to elicit his interest in buying toner cartridges. As set out and analysed in detail earlier in these grounds, the first meeting had seemed innocuous, and I had ruled that there had been reasonable doubt on Mr Lim possessing the _mens rea_ to commit an offence under section 47(3) CDSA in that instance, when he paid for the toners. I am satisfied that Mr Lim came to be realization that he was dealing with illicitly obtained goods after the two men had returned a fortnight later with an even larger quantity of toners. The gravamen of his offending is thus to **_continue_** to deal with these goods from the second charge onwards, despite this realization. Unlike Mr Sahirudin, Mr Lim had thus never actively assisted in secreting the toners off the co-accused’s work premises or conveying them to his own premises. The toners had always been brought to him.

200    Despite being implicated in a majority of the transactions, Mr Lim had already eschewed from dealing with Mr Redzuan by the time of his arrest in February 2016, albeit that this was the result of his unilateral decision in 2015 to reduce his offer price by $30 to $110 per set. To be clear I do not accept Mr Lim’s claim to have disengaged from dealings because of his own belated suspicions upon Mr Redzuan offering an increased number of toner sets. Mr Sahirudin’s offending has been expressed to cover 2015 to 2016, and there was no indication of any cessation in dealings before the errant parties were arrested.

201    There is nothing on record in relation to the circumstances behind Mr Sahirudin’s restitution, and I would agree that this unequivocally counts in his favour. Mr Sahirudin’s plea of guilt, however, deserves a more nuanced and contextualised understanding. Mr Sahirudin, who had been charged in June 2017, had been scheduled to stand trial jointly with Mr Azwan, Mr Shahrin and Mr Lim on 20 August 2018. The former three men had decided to take a certain course at the day of trial. The point is that Mr Sahirudin was not, by any means, an early penitent, and had only resolved to plead guilty at, or about, the same time as the co-accused persons in the predicate offence. More significantly, the described circumstances of Mr Sahirudin’s manner of offending do show his close (and very conspicuous) collusion with the co-accused persons, particularly Mr Azwan, in the collection of the toners from Mr Azwan’s workplace. Given this, he would have been hard put to maintain any deniability where the co-accused persons were taking an alternative course, and thus no longer aligned with him in defending against their respective charges. Simply put, Mr Sahirudin pleaded guilty at a very late stage when he was fully aware that his options for a viable defence were very limited.

### Offender specific considerations

202    As mentioned above, Mr Lim’s mitigation plea disclosed no exceptional or especially compelling circumstances to justify any amelioration of the term of his sentence. It is trite law that personal hardship, absent exceptional circumstances, would generally carry little or no mitigatory weight; _Lai Oei Mui Jenny_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span>; <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGHC 157</span>. In his case, there was no especial identified need for **_specific_** deterrence given that this was a single, albeit prolonged, course of offending of an individual who had an erstwhile clean record. None of this, of course, detracts from the considerations of **_general_** deterrence to dissuade like-minded individuals who might otherwise be lulled by the lure of easy money to embark on collusive acts with property offenders to receive and handle the fruit of their criminal activity.

203    I was mindful of that Mr Lim faced no fewer than **_23_** charges and hence applied the two-step process described in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span>; <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (“Gan Chai Bee”)_, where Sundaresh Menon CJ provides valuable guidance on the manner of approaching sentencing in cases involving multiple offences that could be considered to form “_a single course of criminal conduct_”. In _Gan Chai Bee_, the accused was in cahoots with an associate to submit 154 inflated invoices, which contained impermissible expenses which the colluding associate have nevertheless sought to claim.

204    In _Gan Chai Bee_ Menon CJ had underscored the importance of rigorously and sequentially following two distinct steps of sentencing analysis for cases of that nature. The first step required the court to determine the appropriate sentence for **_each_** charge, and the second entailed the court’s contemplation of the **_overall_** sentence to be imposed.[^156] This second step concerned not only the issue of how the sentences ought to be run, but also whether the **_totality_** of the offender’s conduct justified an adjustment in the individual sentences decided at the first step.

205    In _Gan Chai Bee_, the precedents showed that it would have been difficult at the **_first_** step to justify a custodial sentence for each of the appellant’s charges because the amount of unauthorised claim involved in each charge was small, and the unauthorised claim was intended to accrue to the associate’s rather than the accused’s benefit. There, the High Court noted that most of the charges the appellant faced, taken individually, would likely have merited only a **_fine_**. Whether the **_custodial threshold_** had been crossed in this case was therefore a matter that had to be decided at the second step[^157]. Ultimately, notwithstanding that individual charges, taken singly, would have been punishable with a fine, the High Court imposed a global term of five weeks’ imprisonment to reflect a sentence which responded to the totality of her offending conduct.

### Applying the principles enunciated in Gan Chai Bee

206    Given the premises above, I would be inclined to state that solely on a **_per-charge_** basis, I would have found a **_general equivalency_** in the offending between the accused and Mr Sahirudin, with Mr Sahirudin’s payment of a restitution and plea of guilt (made under the straitened circumstances mentioned above) sum counterbalanced by his much more active role in driving to BNP Paribas Bank to receive the misappropriated toners, where Mr Lim had passively transacted and trafficked in items brought to his business premises. Applying the principle in _Gan Chai Bee_ referenced above to balance out the increased number of 23 proceeded charges as against the three proceeded and one TIC charge in Sahirudin’s case, I would find it appropriate to impose individual terms of **_one month’s_** imprisonment, where Mr Sahirudin had received **_a week_** per charge. Further, given the sheer number of charges faced by Mr Lim, I would be inclined to order three sentences to run consecutively, and thus impose a global term of **_three months’_** imprisonment, as against the two weeks’ imprisonment Mr Sahirudin received.

### Sentences imposed

207    Accordingly, I imposed terms of one month's imprisonment per charge, with the sentences in three charges,that is DAC 9106-2018, DAC 9111-2018 and DAC 9128-2018 to run consecutively to yield a global sentence of three months' imprisonment.

208    In my view, the global sentence of three months, which is **_six times_** the sentence Mr Sahirudin received for receiving an aggregate sum which was **_5.7 times_** higher would be a condign punishment.

209    This is in my view proportionate given Mr Sahirudin's greater involvement in the criminal activity as against Mr Lim's absence of restitution and there being no discount for this case which would ensue where there has been a plea of guilt at an early stage.

### Bail pending appeal granted

210    Mr Lim has been granted bail, pending the conclusion of the appeals.
