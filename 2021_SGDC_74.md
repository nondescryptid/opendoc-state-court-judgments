### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       It is not uncommon for victims of road traffic accidents to claim damages for depression arising from the accident. However, where the depression is not a direct result of the accident but was instead triggered by subsequent _surveillance_ conducted by private investigators, can the injured person still recover damages for depression? Among other things, this appears to be a novel legal issue in the present case.

2       The plaintiff’s claim arises out of a road traffic accident (“the Accident”) that occurred on 8 August 2014, when the defendant’s motorcar accelerated and ran over plaintiff’s left foot while the plaintiff was in the midst of getting into the defendant’s motorcar. The plaintiff was the defendant’s employee at the material time.

3       Interlocutory judgment in the plaintiff’s favour was entered by consent on 29 June 2016 with the issue of damages to be assessed and costs and interests to be reserved to the registrar hearing the assessment (“the AD Hearing”).

## Overview

4       I conducted the AD Hearing over seven tranches on 4 September 2019 where the following witnesses gave their evidence:

> (a)     the plaintiff;

> (b)     Ms Linda Tong – the plaintiff’s wife;

> (c)     Ms Tan Suling, Melissa (“Ms Tan”) – the plaintiff’s occupational therapist;

> (d)     Ms Laura Rebecca Jonathan (“Ms Laura”) – the plaintiff’s clinical therapist;

> (e)     Dr Lim Yin Chin (“Dr Lim”) – the defendant’s medical psychiatrist expert;

> (f)     the defendant; and

> (g)     Mr Goh Seow Kiat – the defendant’s private investigator (“PI”).

5       The parties agreed to dispense with the attendance of **nine** medical experts (of whom, eight experts were appointed by the plaintiff and one by the defendant), whose reports were therefore admitted into evidence without any challenge. This decision by the parties, and especially the defendant, left much to be desired in the fact-gathering exercise. As would be apparent from my reasons that follow, several of the arguments made by the defendant in his closing submissions are plainly untenable in the light of his decision not to cross-examine and challenge the medical evidence and/or put his case to the relevant witnesses, bearing in mind the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ \[1894\] 6 R 67 (see also _Seet Melvin v Law Society of Singapore_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 186</span> at \[37\] and _Tan Kok Yong Steve v Itochu Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 85</span> at \[44\]).

6       The effect of the defendant’s decision therefore left me with only a single expert in most of the disputed issues. This is pertinent. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _Saeng-Un Udom v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 1</span> at \[26\] (“_Saeng-Un Udom_”), quoting from the _Halsbury’s Law of Singapore_ vol 10 (Butterworths, 2000) at para 120.257:

>     …The court should not, when confronted with expert evidence which is unopposed and appears not to be obviously lacking in defensibility, reject it nevertheless and prefer to draw its own inferences. While the court is not obliged to accept expert evidence by reason only that it is unchallenged, _if the court finds that the evidence is based on sound grounds and supported by the basic facts, it can do little else than to accept the evidence_. \[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics\]

7       More recently, the Court of Appeal reiterated this point in _Armstrong, Carol Ann (executrix of the estate of Peter Traynor, deceased, and on behalf of the dependents of Peter Traynor, deceased) v Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 133</span> (“_Armstrong_”) at \[90\]:

>     …

>     As this court had observed in _Saeng-Un Udom_, a court is not bound to accept an expert’s opinion merely because it is uncontroverted. However, a court may find that it should accept uncontroverted expert evidence _if the opinion was grounded on a sound basis_. Hence, it appears to us that the question of whether to accept or reject an expert’s evidence is ultimately not a question of whether and how the evidence is controverted, but whether any eventual view arrived at is supportable in logic and evidence. The court’s determination as to whether it should accept parts of an expert’s evidence (and if so which parts) is guided by considerations of consistency, logic and coherence (see _Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 983</span> at \[75\]–\[76\]). This requires a scrutiny of the expert’s methodology and the _objective facts_ he had based his opinion upon (see the High Court decision of _PP v Choo Peng Kuen_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 230</span> at \[64\]). \[emphasis in original\]

8       With these preliminary remarks in mind, I turn now to deal with the plaintiff’s claims.

## Parties’ submissions on quantum

9       Before me, the plaintiff claims the following damages in the AD Hearing:

> (a)     General damages:

>> (i)       Pain and suffering for orthopaedic injuries: $30,000;

>> (ii)       Pain and suffering for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (“CRPS”) Type I: $30,000;

>> (iii)       Pain and suffering for depression: $15,000;

>> (iv)       Future medical expenses: $80,706.32; and

>> (v)       Loss of earning capacity: $80,000.

> (b)     Special damages:

>> (i)       Medical expenses: $5,023.07;

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $3,060; and

>> (iii)       Pre-trial loss of earnings: $18,273.63 (agreed).

10     In contrast, the defendant submits as follows:

> (a)     General damages:

>> (i)       Pain and suffering for orthopaedic injuries and CRPS Type I: $20,000;

>> (ii)       Pain and suffering for Depression: NIL (no causation);

>> (iii)       Future medical expenses: NIL or $1800 in the alternative for recurring pain medication; and

>> (iv)       Loss of earning capacity: NIL or $2,000 in the alternative.

> (b)     Special damages:

>> (i)       Medical expenses: $2,930.87 or $5,023.07 (if claim for depression is allowed);

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $840; and

>> (iii)       Pre-trial loss of earnings: $18,273.63 (agreed).

## General damages

### Pain and suffering for orthopaedic injuries and CRPS

11     For the pain and suffering for his left foot orthopaedic injuries, the plaintiff submits for $30,000.[^1] The defendant submits instead that a global award should be made for both the plaintiff’s left foot injuries and CRPS condition, primarily contending that the plaintiff’s left foot fracture has healed and the residual disabilities in respect of the plaintiff’s left foot is largely attributed to the plaintiff’s CRPS condition.[^2]

#### Whether global award is appropriate

12     I start with the general proposition stated by Yong Pung How CJ in _Seah Yit Chen v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 1 SLR(R) 490</span> (“_Seah Yit Chen_”) at \[5\] as follows:

>     … When the injuries sustained are related to same part or function of the body, there should only be one award of damages, without any risk of overlapping: where the injuries sustained are to different parts of the body and affect different functions, … it would be appropriate to make a separate award for each head of damage. …

13     Therefore, as a starting point, a global award is appropriate where the injuries affect the same part or function of the body. However, as the plaintiff points out,[^3] this is an issue of science that had to be put to the relevant expert witnesses for their medical opinion. As the defendant had elected to dispense with the relevant expert witnesses, there is no leg for the defendant’s argument to stand on and it accordingly fails _in limine_.

14     To the contrary, it appears from the legal characterisation of CRPS in Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) that CRPS is a psychiatric condition (as opposed to an orthopaedic injury) and is therefore unlikely to be affecting the same _function_ even if the underlying injury stems from the same body part. Here, I also draw support from the decision in _Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (“_Pamela Jane_”) where the Court of Appeal noted that CRPS arises as a “result of damage to, or malfunction of, the central or peripheral _nervous system_” \[emphasis added\] (at \[81\]). In noting so, the Court of Appeal in _Pamela Jane_ went on to disagree with the High Court and awarded a distinct award for the CRPS injury (at \[101\]).

15     The defendant attempts to distinguish _Pamela Jane_ on the basis that the CRPS condition was only diagnosed 6 months after the accident in that case and the appellant had complained of pain not only in her initial injury spot but also other parts of her body.[^4] I am not convinced by this argument because in the present case, the plaintiff had also been diagnosed with CRPS about nine months after the Accident (and not immediately after the Accident)[^5] and there is unchallenged medical evidence that the pain extended to areas beyond his initial orthopaedic injuries.[^6] In any event, it is not readily apparent from the decision in _Pamela Jane_ (nor was the argument appears to have been made in that case) that the reason why a distinct award was made for the CRPS injury was because of pain experienced by that appellant in other parts of the body. I therefore decline to award a global award for the plaintiff’s pain and suffering for his left foot orthopaedic injuries and CRPS and proceed to assess them separately.

#### Left foot injuries

16     The plaintiff claims for the following orthopaedic injuries to his left foot:

> (a)     left foot and ankle crush injuries with closed undisplaced fracture of the left talar neck and closed fracture of the left calcaneum inferior trabecular;

> (b)     permanent sensory hypersensitivity over the left foot;

> (c)     soft tissue swelling and contusion over the left foot; and

> (d)     superficial abrasions over the left foot.

17     The above injuries are all documented in the objective medical evidence in the form of medical and radiology reports[^7] except the abrasions over the left foot. The latter injury appears to have been recorded for the first time by Dr Kannan Kaliyaperumal (“Dr Kannan”) in his specialist medical report dated 10 April 2016.[^8] Here, I agree with the defendant’s submission that this injury ought not to be considered because it was not recorded by any of the initial treating doctors from Changi General Hospital (“CGH”).[^9] Unlike the other parts of the defendant’s case, this is an instance where failing to cross-examine Dr Kannan is not fatal to his case because the fact that the plaintiff had suffered from superficial abrasions is not Dr Kannan’s medical opinion. Instead, Dr Kannan had merely recorded this injury as a matter of _fact_ under the heading entitled “Recorded Injuries” – in doing so, Dr Kannan did not state that these were the injuries he had observed through medical examination, refer to any other document or provide any other basis for this record (see \[7\] above). By way of comparison, it is also noteworthy that the defendant’s appointed medical specialist, Dr Yegappan M (“Dr Yegappan”) did not record the abrasion injury under a similar heading entitled “Injuries Recorded”.[^10] I accordingly find that this injury, if any, did not arise from the Accident.

18     That leaves us with the other three injuries. In assessing the quantum for the left foot injuries, I take reference from the Guidelines and reproduce the extracts of the relevant ranges below (at p 54):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="74.76%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description (Severity of Injury)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(c) Very severe</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Such cases include severe crushing injuries of the foot or a partial amputation either of the forefoot or the heel such that the injured person will have much difficulty walking without a walking aid.

19     Here, it is important to note that after the Accident, the plaintiff was placed on a cast, which was only removed more than a month later on 30 September 2014[^11] and he had to ambulate on a wheelchair thereafter[^12] – notably, CGH had certified the use of wheelchair for the plaintiff.[^13] In total, the plaintiff was given 223 days of medical leave and was placed on light duty leave for 60 days.[^14] Further, it is the unchallenged medical evidence of Dr Kannan that the plaintiff “needs assistance in mobility and transferring”.[^15] The evidence of the PI is also instructive here as he confirmed during the AD Hearing that the plaintiff always had a walking stick with him throughout his observation.[^16]

20     The defendant contends that the residual disabilities arising from the left foot injuries can largely be attributed to the plaintiff’s CRPS.[^17] I disagree. Dr Kannan noted that the plaintiff had “sustained left foot injuries, which have … affected his lower limb biomechanics to the extent he is unable to perform normal gait, his daily activities and this disability is permanent.”[^18] Here, this opinion (by Dr Kannan) does not appear to be based on the plaintiff’s condition of CRPS. Dr Kannan further opined that as a result of the plaintiff’s immobility, his probability of development of midfoot or ankle stiffness is almost 100%.[^19] In other words, the Accident has left the plaintiff with permanent residual disabilities, which are over and above that caused by the CRPS.

21     In any event, if there were any doubts with Dr Kannan’s opinion above, it was incumbent on the defendant to cross-examine Dr Kannan on his opinion. Having failed to do so and given that there is a sound basis to Dr Kannan’s opinion, I am unable to see how the court is able to make a finding of fact that the plaintiff’s residual disabilities largely arise from his CRPS condition and not his initial left foot injuries.

22     For the above reasons, I assess the plaintiff’s pain and suffering for his left foot injuries to fall between the “Severe” and “Serious” categories and accordingly award the plaintiff $30,000 as claimed, further bearing in mind the dated age of the Guidelines.

#### CRPS Type I

23     Here, again, it is not disputed that the plaintiff suffers from CRPS of Type I condition. Assoc Prof Yoong Chee Seng (“A/P Yoong”) from CGH opined that the plaintiff’s CRPS causes “persistent left foot, ankle and leg pain” and that it is likely that the plaintiff “will continue to have residual pain and moderate physical impairment for the rest of his life”.[^20] This opinion is likewise shared by Dr Kannan when he opined that the plaintiff has likely suffered from “permanent sensory hypersensitivity over the left foot”.[^21] It is also unchallenged evidence that until the date of the assessment, the plaintiff had been attending consultations with the pain management clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”).[^22]

24     Notably, the defendant’s appointed medical specialist, Dr Yegappan, also agrees that the plaintiff suffers from CRPS and even agrees that further treatment is necessary to treat this condition.[^23]

25     In assessing the quantum for the CRPS condition, I note the Court of Appeal’s observation in _Pamela Jane_ at \[102\] that there are very few precedents on this injury. As for the Guidelines (also referred in _Pamela Jane_ at \[105\]), it provides for the following indicative ranges of awards (at p 30):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="74.76%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description (Severity of Injury)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(a) Severe</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$25,000 to $50,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(b) Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$12,000 to $25,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(c) Mild</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000 to $12,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

26     Here, the plaintiff submits for a sum of $30,000, contending that the plaintiff’s condition falls within the lower end of the “Severe” category.[^24] The defendant in turn contends that the plaintiff’s CRPS is not as “serious and debilitating” as the plaintiff makes out to be and submits as follows:[^25]

> (a)     the plaintiff did not obtain any updated specialist medical reports on his present CRPS condition;

> (b)     the physical work evaluation done on 29 September 2017 by Ms Tan is not an accurate assessment;

> (c)     the plaintiff’s purported reliance on his walking stick is questionable; and

> (d)     the reduced frequency of medical treatment sought by the plaintiff.

27     Before I turn to the evidence before me, it is worth reproducing the guidance issued by the Court of Appeal in _Pamela Jane_ as follows (at \[84\]):

>     Although it may not be easy to feign the existence of CRPS given that the diagnostic tests require certain physical symptoms to be present, the _court must guard against the possibility that the extent of the disability brought about by this condition may be exaggerated_. This does not, however mean that the court should indiscriminately doubt every assertion made by a plaintiff. Instead, what the court should do when assessing a CRPS claim is to carefully consider and weigh the evidence, including the medical opinions of doctors and other objective evidence that may shed light on the plaintiff’s lifestyle and his ability to function and work after the accident (_eg_, surveillance footage), before coming to a view on the severity and the extent of the disability brought about by CRPS. \[emphasis added\]

28     In _Pamela Jane_, the Court of Appeal partially agreed with the High Court’s finding that the appellant had exaggerated her symptoms, primarily based on the surveillance footages showing that she could continue leading a relatively normal life (at \[85\]–\[86\]). The Court of Appeal nonetheless awarded the appellant a claim for CRPS as there was objective medical evidence supporting her claim for CRPS. There, the Court of Appeal considered that her CRPS was at a moderate level and awarded her a sum of $30,000. However, this sum of $30,000 was for both the pain and suffering for the CRPS **as well as** damages for the loss of amenities that the appellant suffered as a result of the condition (at \[110\]). This distinction is crucial as the Court of Appeal in _Pamela Jane_ specifically recognised the case for awarding the appellant damages for loss of amenities on account of the fact that she was an avid motor car racer prior to her accident and was even the only female to have completed the 15,000km car rally from Peking to Paris (at \[101\]). No such special facts exist here. Neither is there a claim made by the plaintiff for loss of amenities.

29     In the present case, my review of the objective evidence is particularly hampered by the defendant’s failure to cross-examine the relevant experts, something which had been extensively done by counsel in _Pamela Jane_. Nevertheless, based on the evidence before, I find that the plaintiff’s CRPS falls within the moderate range with an award of $20,000 and that the plaintiff had marginally exaggerated the extent of his disabilities for the following reasons:

> (a)     Here, I find that the plaintiff had adduced sufficiently updated medical evidence showing that he requires continued treatment for his CRPS condition. At the time of assessment, it has been about six years since the Accident and about five years since the CRPS diagnosis and the plaintiff still has symptoms of CRPS and is still purchasing painkillers.[^26] There is clear evidence before me that he has been consistently seeking treatment for his CRPS condition by attending consultations and therapy sessions at TTSH.[^27] I also find the plaintiff’s explanation for not seeking treatment for his CRPS earlier to be believable on account of his recount of the fire drill incident in 2019 (“the fire drill incident”) as follows:[^28]

>> _Initially, I wasn’t \[sic\] for any kind of surgery_. I tried to tell myself to bear with everything I was going through. But when I was at the NTUC Trade Union House, there was an announcement that there was a fire in progress \[_sic_\] and all occupants were required to walk down the steps. So I did what all my classmates did too and I walked down the steps. Holding the rail and taking one step at a time. And on reaching the ground floor, I told the ground staff that I do not see any smoke at all. They told me it was just a fire drill. After a few minutes, my foot started to ache. I did not have any Panadol with me at the time. So I just had to bear with the pain. And my examination on using Excel Sheet was the next day. I was trying to gain this knowledge to boost my employability. The very night, I visited MedLife Clinic, a clinic which is very near my residence. I told the doctor about my pain, Dr Joel I think. I told him I needed a MC to excuse myself from the examination next day. The pain was unbearable. He also gave a memo to me to hand it over to the pain specialist. That was my purpose of visiting him. I was given two days MC and I was given this memo. On that particular day, I took a lot of painkillers and managed not to go to A&E (I was thinking of going to A&E but I told myself what’s the point). **_It was at that point that I decided to do something other than simply take medication_**. So I wrote in to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the Head of Neurology, National University Hospital, Singapore General Hospital – no replies. I also wrote to a few other private clinics. One of them referred me to Dr Chua … \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

> (b)     The defendant is also not completely correct to state that there is no medical evidence to suggest that the plaintiff would have to rely on a walking stick for the rest of his life.[^29] Dr Cheow Xunqi (“Dr Cheow”) of CGH had noted that the plaintiff likely requires “_permanent_ need for assistance” for two out of six activities of daily living, _ie_, mobility and transferring. \[emphasis added\][^30] Again, in falling to call Dr Cheow for cross-examination, her opinion had not been disputed by the defendant. Further, as noted above at \[19\], the PI expert also confirmed that the plaintiff always had a walking stick with him throughout his observation of him.[^31] However, I also note Dr Yeggapan’s opinion (whose attendance was dispensed with by the plaintiff and therefore not challenged), that based on the PI videos, the plaintiff “does not seem to be too dependent on \[the walking stick\]”.[^32]

> (c)     As for the plaintiff’s Physical Work Performance Evaluation in the ErgoScience Report dated 29 September 2017 commissioned by Ms Tan (“the ErgoScience Report”), Ms Tan had noted that the plaintiff was still experiencing pain in his foot and was unable to complete simple tasks. However, as the defendant’s cross-examination revealed, there are some clinical inconsistencies that Ms Tan had identified in the ErgoScience Report as follows:[^33]

>> Q:    At page 36, you referred to clinical inconsistencies. Can you explain that?

>> A:    For the entire ErgoScience evaluation, some tasks are rated to be easier than another task. For instance, the scores for walking task should be better than a ladder-climbing task. For this clinical inconsistency, his scores for the lift to floor waist carry was better than the bilateral carry task and the lift floor to waist carry was better than the maximum dynamic pulling task. \[Normally\], the client should have actually performed better on bilateral carry and maximum dynamic pulling task than lift to floor waist carry. But here, there is an inconsistency. This could be for any reason.

>> Q:    This could be due to malingering?

>> A:    Yes.

>> Q:    So in plainer English \[_sic_\], for a task that is simple, he showed difficulties in performing it while for tasks that are more difficult, he was able to perform it better.

>> A:    Yes.

> From the above, I find that the plaintiff has exaggerated the severity of his symptoms to some extent.

> (d)     The parties have highlighted some precedents on the quantum of awards for a CRPS injury. The most similar case appears to be that of _Khek Ching Ching v SBS Transit Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 220</span> (“_Khek Ching Ching_”), where the court gave a separate award for CRPS in the sum of $30,000 and explained that this was “purely on a rough and ready basis” (at \[116\]). However, I must highlight that in _Khek Ching Ching_, there was undisputed evidence that the plaintiff already had three amputated toes in the right foot (unrelated to the accident) affecting her mobility and overall physical condition. Such facts are not present here. Nevertheless, as the defendant points out,[^34] in arriving at the $30,000 award and citing the award of $100,000 made in _Mei Yue Lan Margaret v Raffles City (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 740</span> (“_Margaret Mei_”) as a precedent, the court in _Khek Ching Ching_ appears to have overlooked that the award of $100,000 made in _Margaret Mei_ was a _global_ award for pain and suffering, both physical (where the physical injuries were serious) and mental, as well as for loss of amenities (at \[60\]).

> (e)     Coming now to the quantum, I am guided by A/P Yoong’s assessment that the plaintiff’s CRPS is “moderate, but improving”[^35] and my assessment of the PI videos which shows that the plaintiff is able to go about his activities of daily life such as driving, albeit with a walking stick. For these reasons, I find that a sum of $20,000 is reasonable compensation for the plaintiff’s CRPS Type I condition. In doing so, I emphasise that the award of $30,000 made in _Pamela Jane_ was on account of both pain and suffering for CRPS and loss of amenities (see \[28\] above) and where there was likewise a finding that the plaintiff had exaggerated her symptoms to some extent.

### Pain and suffering for depression

30     For the condition of depression, the primary contested issue between the parties is whether the Accident had caused the plaintiff’s depression. In this regard, it is not disputed that the plaintiff has had a history of depression since 19 February 2008.[^36] The plaintiff’s depression thereafter resurfaced after the Accident when he revisited IMH on 12 November 2014.

#### Whether the Accident caused the depression

31     The legal principles on causation in the context of personal injuries claim are easy to state. As noted by the High Court in _Tan Hun Hoe v Harte Dennis Mathew_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 414</span> at \[47\]:

>     …\[T\]he plaintiff must always establish that the act/omission of the defendant is the cause, or a cause, of the injuries. Causation must be proved on the balance of probabilities. In a case where it is proved that there were several causes, then the court is bound to determine the extent to which each cause contributed to the injuries.

32     Further, it was held in the High Court decision of _Chew Swee Hiang v Attorney-General and another_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 215</span> that “\[w\]here a number of different factors could have caused the injury, there can be no presumption that one factor rather than the other factors caused the injury” (at \[37\], citing _Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authorit_y <span class="citation">\[1988\] AC 1074</span> at 1084).

33     This is precisely the case here. It is not disputed by parties that five different stressors (as stated in the report by Dr Natarajan Karthivel (“Dr Natarajan”)) had contributed to the plaintiff’s depression:[^37]

> (a)     the Accident in August 2014;

> (b)     only part of the plaintiff’s hospitalisation bills was paid by his company;

> (c)     the plaintiff has problems with his sister who is an alcoholic and has had a fall due to excessive drinking which worried him;

> (d)     the plaintiff’s ex-wife had contested his maintenance allowance to her and this had affected his mental state; and

> (e)     possible drop in income.

34     The plaintiff argues that several of these stressors arose as a result of the Accident, possibly factors (a), (b) and (e). However, the other two factors, namely (c) and (d), clearly did not arise from the Accident. The question is therefore whether the plaintiff is able to prove on a balance of probabilities the extent to which each distinct cause had contributed to his depression. In my judgment, the plaintiff is unable to do so. Dr Natarajan’s report fails to specify which of the above stressors is the primary or material contributing cause of the depression. Ms Laura is also likewise unable to confirm that the Accident is the “main and only” cause of the plaintiff’s relapse.[^38] The same is also noted by Dr Lim as follows: “\[f\]rom the narrative obtained, the plaintiff’s depression emerging directly from the \[Accident\] injuries was elicited on 12.11.2014 but even on that occasion the stressors of the injury was one out of five components”.[^39]

35     For completeness, in relation to the plaintiff’s attempt to highlight the inaccuracies in Dr Natarajan’s report, I am not prepared to accept the explanation given that no amended report by Dr Natarajan has been adduced in the AD Hearing.

36     Subsequently, after more than two years, the plaintiff revisited IMH again on 28 March 2017. Here, the timeline is crucial because this visit was _after_ the plaintiff had learnt that he was being tailed by the PI – the PI report was disclosed to the plaintiff’s solicitors in or around 25 January 2017.

37     Based on the foregoing, Dr Lim is of the opinion that “\[the plaintiff’s\] two subsequent contact \[_sic_\] with IMH \[is\] related to his anger and feeling of injustice towards his ex-employer.”[^40] I find that Dr Lim’s opinion is sufficiently grounded on the facts that are before me, especially given the long period that had passed since the Accident (and the initial relapse in 2014) and the subsequent relapse in 2017. Dr Lim’s opinion is also consistent with the plaintiff’s own evidence in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”)[^41] as well as on the stand before me as to how much he was aggrieved by the intrusion of privacy by the PI videos.[^42]

38     I accordingly find that the episodes of depression faced by the plaintiff in 2017 primarily stemmed from his feelings of anger and resentment towards the PI videos.

#### Whether the loss is reasonably foreseeable

39     From my finding above, the consequent legal issue is whether the damage suffered by the plaintiff in 2017 from the PI videos could still be attributed to the defendant’s negligence during the Accident. As the initial submissions did not directly address the issue, I had directed for further submissions on the same. Despite their best attempts, the parties were however unable to find any direct case authority on point and I therefore resort to first principles in my assessment.

40     First, I agree with the defendant that the allegation that the plaintiff’s depression had been caused by the PI videos is an allegation that had to be pleaded in the Statement of Claim. The plaintiff unsurprisingly did not plead this allegation because their case is premised on the Accident being the direct cause of the depression; and not the commission of the PI videos.

41     Second and in any event, I am not convinced that the damage suffered by the plaintiff can be legally attributed to the defendant’s negligence. The relevant legal principles were stated by V K Rajah JA in _Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ <span class="citation"></span><span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 782</span> at \[64\] as follows:

>     For the determination of whether a defendant's wrongful conduct is a cause in fact of the damage to a claimant, the test, which has almost universal acceptance, is the so-called "but for" test. .... \[I\]n order to determine whether an act or omission was a cause of the loss, \[one should\] eliminate the act or omission mentally and consider whether or not the loss would still have occurred. If the loss would not have occurred when the act or omission is eliminated, the act or omission is a _condicio sine qua non_ for the loss. If the loss would still have occurred, even when the act or omission in question is disregarded, the loss has not been caused by this act or omission. ... However, even if the test yields a positive answer, _ie_, the loss would not have occurred but for the defendant's act or omission, it merely qualifies the act or omission as a possible, though by no means necessarily, sufficient cause for legal purposes. .... _\[T\]his act or omission must then be regarded as the cause in law and then pass an additional test of remoteness_. In other words, "but for" is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of legal responsibility. \[emphasis added\]

42     In my judgment, even if it can be said that the Accident is the “but for” cause of the depression (_ie_, without the Accident, there would be no PI surveillance and hence no depression), I find that the loss suffered by the plaintiff is too remote to attract legal responsibility.

43     As astutely observed by the learned authors in _Clerk & Lindsell on Torts_ (Sweet & Maxwell (21st Edition, 2014) (“_Clerk & Lindsell_”) at para 2-136:

>     The possible consequences of any human conduct are potentially endless. The defendant’s wrongdoing may trigger a series of events stretching well beyond one’s normal expectations of possible consequences. _The law does not, however, impose indefinite liability_. A line must be drawn to confine the responsibility of the defendant to those consequences of his wrongdoing which is proper for him to shoulder. Thus even when it is quite clear that the defendant’s wrong caused the damage, it may be said that _the damage was too remote if it is not of the same type as would be normally anticipated in similar circumstances, or if it occurred in an unusual way_. Remoteness of damage places limits on the defendant’s responsibility … \[emphasis added\]

44     The test for remoteness of damage is the test of reasonable foreseeability established by the House of Lords in _Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)_ <span class="citation">\[1961\] AC 388</span> (“_The Wagon Mound_”). The Court of Appeal reaffirmed the application of this test in Singapore in _Ho Soo Fong and another v Standard Chartered Bank_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 181</span> and observed at \[39\] that _The Wagon Mound_ principle required the court to assess whether a reasonable man would foresee a “real risk” of the damage occurring. In this regard, there would be a “real risk” if it is one that would occur to the mind of a reasonable man in the position of the defendant and which would not be brushed aside as being far-fetched (see _Tan Juay Mui (by his next friend Chew Chwee Kim) v Sher Kuan Hock and another (Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd, co-defendant; Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd and another, third parties)_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 496</span> at \[45\]).

45     The question is therefore whether a reasonable man in the position of the defendant would foresee at the time of the Accident that he would need to hire a PI **_and_** that the PI could then cause the plaintiff passenger depression through the conduct of his surveillance. In my judgment and in the absence of any direct case precedents highlighted by the parties, the answer has to be no. The sequence of events is simply too remote for a reasonable man to consider as the possible consequences of his initial negligence. Borrowing the words of the learned authors in _Clerk & Lindsell_, the plaintiff’s depression is therefore a damage that “has occurred in such an unusual or unexpected way” and is “of a type different from that which the claimant ought reasonably to have foreseen as part and parcel of being held to be in breach of duty” (at para 2-144).

46     However, if the question instead is whether by causing the Accident, it would be reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that the plaintiff could suffer depression – the answer is well settled. In _Page v Smith_ \[1996\] 1 AC 156, the House of Lords held that once it is established that the defendant had breached its duty of care in causing personal injury to the plaintiff, “it matters not whether the injury in fact sustained is physical, psychiatric or both” and it sufficed to “ask whether the defendant should have reasonably foreseen that the plaintiff might suffer personal injury as a result of the defendant’s negligence” (at 190). However, as apparent from my findings above, this is not what had happened in this case – the plaintiff’s second relapse of depression in 2017 had not been triggered by the Accident but rather through the PI surveillance.

47     I find it fitting to conclude the analysis on the plaintiff’s depression with the following observations made the Court of Appeal in _Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh and another v Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (now known as QBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd) and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 735</span> at \[57\]:

>     The rule in relation to remoteness of damage acts as the final line of defence, so to speak, against an excessively wide scope of liability. It is, as V K Rajah JA stated in _Sunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ <span class="citation"></span><span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 782</span>, the line that marks out the boundary at which the law distinguishes claims giving rise to ‘full reparation for the loss suffered’ (at \[56\]) from those that would impose an ‘excessive burden … on human activity’ (_ibid_) if the wrongdoer were to be bear all the consequences of his default. The point where this line is to be drawn is informed by ‘legal policy and accepted value judgment’ (_ibid_). …

48     For the above reasons, I decline to award any damages on account of the plaintiff’s condition of depression that resurfaced both in 2014 and 2017.

### Loss of earning capacity

49     I turn now to the claim in general damages for the loss of earning capacity (“LEC”). The following facts are not in dispute:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s age at the time of the AD Hearing was 61 years old;

> (b)     the plaintiff has been working in the signage industry for over 25 years, for which the nature of the job is physically demanding and not desk-bound in nature;

> (c)     the plaintiff resigned from his pre-accident job with Lin Keong Projects Pte Ltd (“LKP”), the defendant’s company, on 2 April 2015[^43] – he had worked at LKP since 12 April 2012 with a total salary of $3,800 per month with additional commission; and

> (d)     although the plaintiff was employed at the time of the AD Hearing, he subsequently became unemployed on 7 January 2020.[^44]

50     For LEC, the plaintiff submits for a sum of $80,000 while the defendant submits that no award should be made as there is no evidence of any risk of job loss or in the alternative a nominal award of $2,000 should be made on account of his age.[^45]

51     In my judgment, the defendant appears to have misconstrued the relevant legal principles in arguing that there is no evidence of any risk of job loss in the case before me. This is not the relevant legal test. The applicable legal test where the plaintiff has changed his pre-accident employment was clarified by me in _Pawel Gajewski v Lee Tong Lynn_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 153</span> (“_Pawel_”) where I noted that “the sole requirement that has to be met is whether the plaintiff ‘has been prevented from competing in the market for his pre-accident job’” (at \[46\], citing _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> at \[50\]; see also the decision of DJ Thian Yee Sze in _Muhammad Saifuddin Bin Hannabi v Kok Chee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 212</span> at \[50\] where the decision in _Pawel_ was cited with approval and applied).

52     The above does not however mean that the plaintiff’s ability to work in other jobs is not a relevant consideration in assessing the quantum to be awarded for LEC – it is just that the fact the plaintiff is able to do other jobs is not a bar to claiming for LEC. As clarified by the Court of Appeal in _Pamela Jane_ at \[141\], in assessing the quantum for LEC, the court takes into account all relevant factors such as “the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work as well.”

53     In my judgment, based on the available evidence before me, I am convinced that the plaintiff has proven on a balance of probabilities that he is not able to compete in the market for his pre-accident job as a marketing manager in the signage industry for the following reasons:

> (a)     Although the plaintiff had voluntarily resigned from LKP, this appears to be a direct result of the plaintiff’s inability to return to his usual work after the Accident and being made to do menial tasks – this is something that the defendant had agreed to under cross-examination by plaintiff’s counsel.[^46]

> (b)     While the plaintiff has not adduced medical evidence in support of each resignation, I find that there is sufficient evidence showing that the plaintiff does in fact suffer from significant pain and impairment in his left foot on account of both his orthopaedic injuries and CRPS, which affects his ability to work in the same line of work. This has been documented numerous times across the various medical reports, as well as noted in the ErgoScience Report. For instance, Dr Kannan had given his opinion that the plaintiff’s injuries have “affected his work”[^47] – this opinion is again unchallenged.

> (c)     It further appears that the defendant has failed to appreciate that the plaintiff’s pre-Accident job was not deskbound in nature and was physically demanding as he was required to travel outdoors and carry bulky signage samples for sales.[^48] This clearly ought to come as no surprise to the defendant, as the plaintiff’s former employer.

54     For the quantum of LEC, it is helpful to refer to past precedents to “ensure that the amounts assessed are broadly consistent and in line with previous awards made for similarly-situated plaintiffs” (see _P_r_actitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at para 4-27). Here, on a consideration of the relevant precedents highlighted by the parties, I agree with the defendant’s submission that primarily on account of the plaintiff’s age of 61 years at the time of assessment, the submission of $80,000 for LEC is manifestly unprincipled.

55     By way of comparison, I highlight the following two cases:

> (a)     First, the Court of Appeal in _Pamela Jane_ granted the appellant, who was above 50 years old at the time of assessment, $25,000 for LEC. In _Pamela Jane_, there was evidence that the appellant was able to command a salary of $5,130 as a lecturer after the accident but the Court of Appeal recognised that the appellant “may not be able to work at the same intensity or level as before due to the bouts of pain and discomfort that she may suffer as a result of her CRPS” (at \[135\] and \[142\]). Here, the plaintiff is significantly older than the appellant in _Pamela Jane_ and commands a much lower income as well. I also take into consideration the lack of medical evidence that the plaintiff is not able to engage in other clerical or desk-bound jobs and the lack of evidence adduced as of the typical salaries for such jobs.

> (b)     Second, in _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 47</span> (“_Lee Mui Yeng_”), Kannan Ramesh JC (as his Honour then was) awarded LEC of $2,000 to a plaintiff who was 60 years old at the time of assessment and was earning an average of $1,965 per month after the accident. In that case, the plaintiff was noted to have adduced little evidence of her present salary and the risk of job loss but the court nonetheless recognised that there was a risk (at \[103\]). Here, the plaintiff is slightly older and was able to command a similar salary range[^49] as the plaintiff in _Lee Mui Yeng_ after the Accident. But taking into account the fact that the plaintiff had earned almost double the income before the Accident, an income he is unlikely to command again on account of his unchallenged residual disabilities, I find that a sum of $10,000 for LEC is appropriate in this case.

## Future medical expenses

56     I turn now to the claim for future medical expenses. In determining whether a particular medical expense is reasonable, the court will consider a range of circumstances including, among other things, whether or not the particular treatment in question is necessary and whether or not it was taken pursuant to a doctor’s advice (see _Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 1003</span> at \[63\], citing UK Law Commission, _Damages for Personal Injury: Medical, Nursing and Other Expenses; Collateral Benefits_ (Law Com No 262, 1999) (Chairman: Robert Carnwath) at para 2.2).

57     The plaintiff claims for the following heads of future medical expenses:

> (a)     treatment for CRPS;

> (b)     therapy and treatment (counselling sessions and medication) for depression;

> (c)     treatment for the chronic injury to his left foot (on this final head of claim, I note that the plaintiff has agreed in his reply submissions to drop his claim for compression stockings).[^50]

58     As for the future medical expenses claimed in connection with the condition of depression, it follows from my decision on the causation of the plaintiff’s depression above that the costs of this treatment cannot be awarded to the plaintiff.

59     All the other aspects of the claim have been recommended by the various medical experts and therefore the only remaining issue for me to consider is whether they are necessary to treat the plaintiff’s injuries arising from the Accident.

#### Treatment for CRPS

##### (1)   Ganglionic nerve block procedure

60     This surgery is recommended by Dr Kannan as a possible surgical intervention.[^51] However, the defendant’s expert, Dr Yegappan, opined that only “\[a\] small percentage of patients may require regional ganglion nerve blocks to help treat CRPS”.[^52] As the plaintiff elected to dispense with Dr Yegappan’s attendance, the question of whether the plaintiff belongs to this “small percentage of patients” remains unclarified. As such, I find that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proof that this surgical intervention is necessary to treat the plaintiff’s CRPS condition.

##### (2)   Spinal Cord Stimulator surgery

61     The defendant submits that the plaintiff should not be awarded the claim for spinal cord stimulator surgery for three main reasons: first, the medical evidence does not support the finding that the plaintiff would require this treatment; second, the plaintiff is not suited for such a treatment; and third, the plaintiff has no intention to undergo such treatment at all.[^53]

62     In making the above arguments, the defendant particularly highlights that CGH had refused to offer this treatment for the plaintiff. However, the defendant appears to not appreciate why the plaintiff had consulted the National Neuroscience Institute (“NNI”) instead of seeking continued treatment at CGH.

63     As noted by A/P Yoong in his report dated 5 July 2016:[^54]

>     Various interventional procedures can be offered for the treatment of CRPS and its associated pain symptoms, of which the most expensive is spinal cord stimulation. _We do not offer this treatment in CGH_, but I estimate its cost to be at least $50,000 to $75,000 (cost of procedure and other recurring costs during the lifetime of the spinal cord stimulation. \[emphasis added\]

64     As I understand, the NNI is one of the few restructured hospitals in Singapore that offers spinal cord stimulation surgery. In this regard, after examining the plaintiff, Dr Ng Wai Hoe (“Dr Ng”) had stated as follows in his report dated 6 March 2019:[^55]

>     Trial of spinal cord stimulation is suggested for him in view of the severity of the pain. The trial is successful in ~50% to 60% of the time and a permanent implant will be inserted. The estimated cost is $51,430.

65     The defendant’s submission that Dr Ng’s recommendation should not be considered because he only saw the plaintiff once[^56] is highly suspect given that Dr Yegappan had also likewise only seen the plaintiff once before giving his assessment.

66     I also do not find that it is true that the plaintiff has no intention to go for such treatment. As explained by the plaintiff during the AD Hearing, he wanted to keep surgery as a last resort because of the associated risks involved and the impact on his work.[^57] He had also initially thought that he could get by with pain medication until the fire drill incident as described above at \[29(a)\].

67     Overall, in granting the plaintiff the costs of this treatment, I keep in mind the following reminder by Yong CJ in _Seah Yit Chen_ at \[9\]:

>     … What is also a fact in this case is that, since the accident …, the plaintiff has been continually complaining of pain. So far, she appears to have borne this pain almost stoically, but it need hardly be said that parties defending claims for injuries inflicted by them should not expect to be absolved from liability for damages by _relying on their victims having a high threshold of pain_. In my judgment, she should not be deprived of the reasonable opportunity for at least some relief from pain which spinal fusion surgery may afford her in the future. As damages are awarded once and for all, she should be awarded now the agreed cost of future spinal surgery. … \[emphasis added\]

68     I accordingly award the plaintiff the costs of the spinal cord stimulation surgery for $51,430.

##### (3)   Psychotherapy for CRPS

69     The plaintiff claims for psychotherapy at the rate of $150 per month for 24 sessions based on A/P Yoong’s estimate.[^58]

70     The defendant submits that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim for psychotherapy as he has not been undergoing psychotherapy sessions since 2017 and the plaintiff has not obtained any updated medical opinion in relation to the medical treatment the plaintiff will require in future for his CRPS.[^59]

71     However, this submission ignores the fact that all three doctors (including Dr Yegappan) are of the opinion that the plaintiff may require psychological counselling for CRPS. In particular, I note Dr Kannan’s strong language in his report as follows:[^60]

>     In summary, the probability of \[the plaintiff\] requiring the above\[-\]mentioned future treatment (physiotherapy, medications and medical visits) for this permanent incapacity is **100%** as the injury sustained is permanent and irreversible. \[emphasis added\]

Dr Kannan was not cross-examined on this opinion in relation to non-surgical intervention.

72     The defendant further contends that A/P Yoong’s report only indicated that psychotherapy sessions “_may_” be needed for the plaintiff such that there is no definite conclusion that the plaintiff would require such future treatment.[^61] Again, as before, if there were any ambiguities in this report with the use of the word “may”, it was incumbent on the defendant to have clarified with A/P Yoong, especially in the light of Dr Kannan’s strong recommendation.

73     In the circumstances, I award the future medical expenses claimed for psychotherapy for the sum of $3,600.

#### Treatment for chronic left foot injury

74     The following future medical expenses were primarily recommended in Dr Kannan’s report dated 10 April 2016.

##### (1)   Medication from CGH (painkillers)

75     For painkiller medication, the plaintiff submits for a multiplicand of $915.40 per year and adopts ten years as the multiplier.

76     The defendant contends that there is no medical evidence to support a claim for lifelong chronic pain medication.[^62] This is clearly erroneous.

77     Dr Kannan had given his medical opinion as follows:[^63]

>     Medications (neuro modulators and painkillers) on a monthly basis would be in the region of $500 to $600 a month. The requirement for such medication _may be lifelong_. \[emphasis added\]

78     If there was any ambiguity in his opinion, it was again incumbent on the defendant to clarify with Dr Kannan but this had not been done. Further, on the defendant’s own case,[^64] it is clear that the plaintiff has been purchasing painkillers since 2016 to date (including purchases made after the AD Hearing). As for the appropriate multiplicand, based on the table of figures that has been produced by the defendant,[^65] I find that $600 per annum would be an appropriate sum.

79     As for the multiplier, the parties did not refer to the _Actuarial Tables With Explanatory Notes for use in Personal Injury and Death Claims_ (Academy Publishing of the Singapore Academy of Law, 2021) (“_Actuarial Tables_”) and rightly so as the relevant Practice Direction to refer to the _Actuarial Tables_ only came into effect after the closing, reply and further submissions were tendered.

80     The defendant submits that the appropriate multiplier should be six years because of the plaintiff’s pre-existing health conditions.[^66] In response, the plaintiff contends that there is no medical evidence showing that the plaintiff’s pre-existing conditions will reduce his lifespan.[^67] I agree. If a submission is sought to be made that the plaintiff’s pre-existing medical conditions is likely to reduce his lifespan, this is something that the defendant should have put to the relevant medical experts for their medical opinion on the extent to which his lifespan would be reduced or at the very least tender relevant medical literature to that effect. In the absence of that, I am only guided by the average life expectancy of a male in Singapore (which was 81.4 as of 2019)[^68] and the figures stated in the _Actuarial Tables_. Based on these two yardsticks, I find that the plaintiff’s proposed figure of ten years as the multiplier is more than reasonable (in fact, it errs more on the conservative side).

81     I therefore accordingly award the plaintiff $6,000 ($600 x ten years) for the recurring painkiller expenses.

##### (2)   Physiotherapy treatment

82     For future physiotherapy expenses, the plaintiff initially claimed for $14,400[^69] but has since revised his claim to $4,020 (based on $33.50 per session x 12 months x ten years).[^70]

83     The defendant submits that the plaintiff should not be entitled to this head of claim as the plaintiff had only attended five physiotherapy sessions from August 2014 to April 2015 and it is unlikely that he will continue to attend physiotherapy treatments in future.[^71]

84     I agree with the defendant on this point. Unlike the plaintiff’s election to defer the spinal cord stimulator surgery on account of the risks involved and the potential impact on the plaintiff’s job at that time (see \[66\] above), I agree that there is no good reason for the plaintiff to not have went for the physiotherapy sessions as recommended by his doctors. I accordingly find that it is unlikely that he would go for the same in the future and decline to make an award for the same.

85     As for the follow-up medical consultations,[^72] since this claim is tagged to the physiotherapy treatment, I likewise disallow this head of claim.

##### (3)   Manual therapy

86     Lastly, for the manual therapy treatment, the costs of one therapy was estimated to be between $200 to $250.[^73] Here, the plaintiff submits for a sum of $2,700, presumably based on one session (average costs of $225) per month for a year.

87     This treatment is recommended by Dr Kannan and is not refuted by Dr Yegappan. As the defendant had elected to not call Dr Kannan, I allow this head of claim.

88     However, since Dr Kannan did not explain on the lifelong need for this therapy or any other particular recommended duration for this treatment, I only allow the recommended two sessions of manual therapy for one for a total sum of $550.

89     I turn now to the special damages claimed by the plaintiff.

## Special damages

### Pre-trial loss of earnings

90     For the pre-trial loss of earnings claim, after the AD Hearing had commenced and on the last tranche of the AD Hearing, the parties informed me that they have reached an agreement on this head of the claim at $18,273.63. As the agreement is supported by the relevant evidence,[^74] I accordingly award as agreed.

### Medical expenses

91     For medical expenses, while the plaintiff initially submitted for $7,024.66,[^75] after learning of the disputes raised by the defendant in his closing submissions, the plaintiff has now agreed to reduce his claim to a sum of $5,023.07 instead.[^76]

92     As the defendant does not dispute the expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with his orthopaedic and CRPS injuries, the only remaining dispute is whether the medical expenses concerning the plaintiff’s depression for a total sum of $2,092.20 should be awarded.

93     Here, it follows from my finding above at \[48\] that since the plaintiff’s condition of depression cannot be attributed to the defendant’s negligence on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiff ought not to be entitled to claim for these medical expenses.

94     I therefore award a total sum of $2,930.87 for the medical expenses incurred by the plaintiff in relation to his orthopaedic and CRPS injuries.

### Transport expenses

95     For the transport expenses, the plaintiff claims for a total sum of $3,060 with an estimated sum of $30 per round trip.[^77] The defendant submits for $840 based on a conservative estimate of $10 per round trip, even though the defendant acknowledges that a total of 102 trips were made to seek medical treatment.[^78] In submitting for $840, the defendant also highlights the plaintiff’s averment in his AEIC affirmed on 30 November 2016.[^79]

96     In my judgment, the approaches taken by both parties are unsatisfactory in calculating the transport expenses. First, I note that the defendant has omitted to reference the updated transport expenses claimed by the plaintiff in his second supplementary AEIC affirmed on 19 September 2018, where the plaintiff sought to claim for $1,380 based on a total of 46 trips and $30 per round trip.[^80] The plaintiff was not cross-examined by the defendant on this aspect of his claim during the AD Hearing.

97     Second, I note that no transport receipts were retained by the plaintiff. However, it is trite law that this is not a bar to a claim in transport expenses. In the High Court decision of _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span>, the High Court adopted a conservative estimate of $20 per round trip in the absence of any documentary evidence (at \[147\]).

98     On the facts of the case, while there is evidence that the plaintiff had made about 102 trips, about 34 of these trips were in the context of seeking treatment for his condition of depression,[^81] which ought not to be considered for the same reasons I have provided above for the medical expenses (see \[93\] above). I therefore am prepared to award $20 as a conservative estimate for 68 round trips for a total sum of $1360. Incidentally, this sum is just $20 shy of the updated figure provided by the plaintiff in his second supplementary AEIC (see \[96\] above) such that the plaintiff’s failure to file any further updated supplementary AEIC did not pose a hindrance to granting this award.

## Conclusion

99     For the above reasons, I assess the damages in the case as follows (Total: $144,144.50):

> (a)     General damages (Total: $121,580):

>> (i)       Pain and suffering for orthopaedic injuries: $30,000;

>> (ii)       Pain and suffering for CRPS Type I: $20,000;

>> (iii)       Pain and suffering for depression: no award;

>> (iv)       Future medical expenses: $61,580; and

>> (v)       Loss of earning capacity: $10,000.

> (b)     Special damages (Total: $22,564.50):

>> (i)       Medical expenses: $2,930.87;

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $1,360; and

>> (iii)       Pre-trial loss of earnings: $18,273.63 (agreed).

100    I finally thank parties for their comprehensive and detailed submissions in the matter and will hear parties on costs and interest at the appropriate juncture.
