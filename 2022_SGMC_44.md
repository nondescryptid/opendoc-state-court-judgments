\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9129/2022/01.\]

12 August 2022

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The Appellant had been charged with two counts for insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). In each charge, he was alleged to have sent to the Victim, a video of a male subject stroking his penis, including one with a photo of the Victim in the background, accompanied with words that were insulting to the victim. The two charges were eventually withdrawn by the Prosecution and the Court granted the Appellant a discharge amounting to an acquittal (“DATA”).

2       The Appellant eventually sought compensation from the Prosecution under s 359(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). On 28 June 2022, I dismissed his application for compensation. The Appellant, being dissatisfied with my order of dismissal, now appeals against my decision.

## The relevant provision

4       The Appellant sought compensation under s 359(3) of the CPC. The provision is set out below:

> “(3)  If an accused is acquitted of any charge for any offence, and if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious, the court may order the prosecution or the complainant or the person on whose information the prosecution was instituted to pay as compensation to the accused a sum not exceeding $10,000.”

5       This provision was discussed by the High Court in _Parti Liyani v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 860</span> (“_Parti Liyani_”). In _Parti Liyani_, the applicant had brought a claim against the Prosecution under s 359(3) of the CPC after she had been acquitted on appeal by the High Court.

6       The High Court in _Parti Liyani_ set out two possible limbs that an applicant may establish “frivolous and vexatious” prosecutions under s 359(3) of the CPC. These are, at \[116\], namely (a) evidential insufficiency; or, at \[127\] - \[128\], namely (b) improper motive.

7       In _Parti Liyani_, the High Court, at \[128\] – \[129\], also held that it was the applicant who had the burden of showing this on the balance of probabilities.

## The Appellant’s case

8       I had directed the Appellant to file an affidavit to support his claim for compensation. The Appellant eventually filed three “affidavits”. These were, in fact, not affidavits, or statement of fact made under oath. However, as the Appellant was in person, I proceeded to accept them as such as a statement setting out his claim. The Prosecution did not raise any objection.

9       These affidavits appear to set out what had happened to the Appellant before and after he was charged in court. Although the Appellant used the words “frivolous”, “vexatious” and “malice” in these affidavits, it was difficult to discern what they actually were. I had to determine what were these “frivolous”, “vexatious” and “malicious” acts of the Prosecution that were being asserted.

10     The following are what appears to be the Appellant’s assertions regarding the Prosecution’s conduct:

> (a)     that the charges were “false”. The Prosecution knew very well that the videos and pictures sent to the Victim were leaked as per what he had said in his statement;[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> (b)     that the Prosecution had “maliciously” planned to exert pressure to make him plead guilty because:

>> (i)       he originally faced one charge under s 292 of the PC but this was later “upgrade” to two charge under s 509 of the PC because he had refused to accept a stern warning;[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

>> (ii)       his case was deliberately “drag on” so that he would change his mind;[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

>> (iii)       the Prosecution offered to proceed only on one charge should the Appellant chose to plead guilty and to proceed on both charges should he claim trial.

> (c)     that the charges were “frivolous” because the Prosecution had charged him without sufficient evidence, and this could be seen when they eventually withdrew the charges at the “eleventh hour” despite numerous “reviews”.

11     As a result of the Prosecution’s actions, the Appellant claimed the “maximum payout” for the following losses:

> (a)     “cost thrown away” and “depreciation of \[his\] properties”;

> (b)     Damage to his reputation and dignity;

> (c)     Cost of travelling to and from court;

> (d)     Loss of use of his phone, which was seized. It was asserted that his phone could have been used to generate “additional” income.

## Whether the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious

### Evidential insufficiency

12     This essentially relates to the Appellant’s assertions at \[10(a)\] and \[10(c)\], above.

13     In _Parti Liyani_, at \[116\], the High Court considered the question that the court would ask itself, namely, that “_…. based on the evidence that the Prosecution had at the relevant time, whether_ **_an objective reasonable Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) would have considered that there was sufficient evidence to render the case fit to be tried_** ….”. At \[117\], the High Court went on to highlight that, even where an offender is acquitted, “… _this may not necessarily suffice to make out a case of frivolous prosecution …_ ”.

14     The Appellant seemed to suggest that the Prosecution’s withdrawal of the charges against him _per se_ meant that there was evidential insufficiency. I disagreed. Under Article 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore vests the Attorney-General with the discretion to institute, conduct, or discontinue any proceedings for any offence. Hence, the subsequent withdrawal of any charge against any accused person does not infer evidential insufficiency, unless the Appellant showed that, on the evidence, that the case was never fit to be tried in the first place.

15     In _Parti Liyani_, offender was convicted in a district court. However, the conviction was overturned on appeal in the High Court. Hence, whatever evidence that was presented could be assessed by the courts (both in the district court and High Court). In the present case, the factual matrix is different. The charges against the accused were withdrawn _before trial_, about seven and a half months after the Appellant was first charged. The evidence was therefore not before this court. In my view, the degree of evidential insufficiency on the part of the Prosecution that the Appellant would have to show at this stage is an extremely high one.

16     It is clear from the Appellant’s affidavits that he has not shown an iota of evidence. The Appellant’s contention is simply that he has asserted his innocence to the Prosecution on numerous occasions and therefore, the Prosecution “knew very well” that he was innocent. This argument is a non-starter. The fact that an offender assert’s his innocence does not imply that there is insufficient evidence for the case to be tried.

17     In fact, unusually in this instant, the Prosecution did inform the Appellant why he had been charged for the offences, although they were not required to do so. This was via an e-mail addressed to the Appellant and dated 22 December 2020, in response, to what I gather, was a series of correspondence between the two parties. This letter is annexed to the Prosecution’s submissions. The Appellant was informed that, amongst other reasons, he had been charged because:

> (a)     One of the videos sent to the Victim captured his face and that the background of the video matched the tiled wall of his toilet at home;

> (b)     That he admitted having previously taken a video of his own private parts with his mobile phone in his toilet;

> (c)     He gave two different accounts of what happened. In June 2018, during a police interview, he claimed that he had lost his phone sometime in in 2017 and that someone might have used the phone to disseminate the video. In November 2019, after being served with the two charges under s 23 of the CPC, he claimed that that in 2015 or earlier, the pictures from his phone had bene leaked to an unknown person who was now “blackmailing” him;

> (d)     Police forensic investigations did not support the Appellant’s claim that an unknown person sent the videos. The IP addresses from which the videos were sent from were traced back to the Appellant’s father’s coffeeshop and his home.

18     The Appellant did not address these points in his affidavits nor his submissions.

19     All considered, I found that the Appellant has not shown that there was any evidential insufficiency on the part of the Prosecution when this case was commenced against him.

### Improper motive

20     This essentially relates to the Appellant’s assertions at \[10(b)\], above.

21     The High Court held in _Parti Liyani_ at \[126\] that, even if the court was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for a case be fit to be tried, the “ _…. existence of malice, dishonesty or improper motives may well render the prosecution vexatious …”._

22     The Appellant has asserted that his charges were “increased” because of his refusal to accept a stern warning for an offence under s 292 of the PC. As far as the court could see, there was no evidence of this. The court records in the Integrated Case Management System (“ICMS”) showed that, on 26 November 2019, the Appellant was charged with two counts under s 509 of the PC. These were the two charges he faced until they were withdrawn by the Prosecution on 7 July 2020.

23     The Appellant has also asserted that the Prosecution had delayed the conduct of this matter hoping that he would eventually plead guilty. There is no evidential basis for this. The ICMS records showed the following:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="27.26%"><col width="72.74%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Date</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Event</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">26 Nov 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Court 23.

The trial is rescheduled to 22 – 23 July 2020 as the Victim is unavailable on 21 Jul 2020</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

24     In addition, I should add that, between 7 April 2020 – 1 June 2020, Singapore experienced its circuit breaker measures to response to the COVID-19 pandemic which only urgent trials were scheduled. Hence, there is nothing to show that the Prosecution had sought to deliberately delay the trial.

25     At \[10(b)(iii)\], the Appellant suggested that the Prosecution’s plead guilty (“PG”) offer was a form of exerting pressure. As highlighted by the Prosecution, it is trite and accepted practice for the Prosecution to make such offers to an offender. It allows the offender to be sentenced to fewer and / or less serious charges should the offender accept this PG offer. There is no basis to infer malice or improper motive simply because a PG offer is made to the Appellant.

26     The Appellant asserts malice on the part of the Prosecution without producing any evidence. In fact, in his Third Affidavit, the Appellant conceded that he was unable to prove bad faith on any single DPP because of the number of DPPs involved in the case. The Appellant did not point out to any hostility or a vendetta that a particular DPP had with him. He seemed to suggest that there was malice simply because the Prosecution had persisted in the charges against him despite his protestations of innocence and his eventual vindication when the charges were withdrawn. The Appellant’s argument that there was malice on the part of the Prosecution is a flawed one. Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Appellant’s assertion has no merit.

## Conclusion

27     The Appellant had sought a claim for compensation from the Prosecution under s 359(3) of the CPC. In doing so, he was required to show, on the balance of probabilities, that the prosecution against him was frivolous or vexatious. He had not done so. No specific evidence has been tendered to show that the Prosecution’s actions were frivolous, vexatious or malicious. The mere fact that the charges against the Appellant were evidence eventually withdrawn is insufficient.

28     His main (and perhaps only) argument appears to be that because he had protested to the police that he was innocent, and that he was eventually acquitted when the charges against him were withdrawn, it meant that the prosecution was frivolous, vexatious or malicious. This was a fallacious argument, or as put by the Prosecution, _post hoc ergo propter hoc_.

29     For the aforesaid reasons, I found that the Appellant’s application had no merit and dismissed it. He is dissatisfied with my decision and now appeals against my order of dismissal.
