Criminal Law - Penal Code Offences - Using Criminal Force on a Public Servant

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9046/2019/01.\]

24 June 2019

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       It is common for friends to go out together for drinks and some merrymaking. What happens when one becomes irresponsible with the amount of alcohol he consumes in the midst of enjoyment and hurts someone? Is getting drunk a reasonable excuse for someone to cause harm? Can someone say that “I was drunk and therefore I could not have known what I was doing”? Should he have gotten himself this drunk in the first place? How often have we heard someone saying “This was a one-off aberration. If I was not drunk, I would not have done what I did”? Should we condone such an impetuous behaviour or pardon such a foolhardy action?

2       Unfortunately, in this case, what was supposed to have been a joyous 25th birthday celebration for the accused turned out to be a more sobering moment for him at the end of the day. In fact, the accused admitted that he did behaved badly that early morning on 12 March 2016.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

### The charges

3       The accused was charged for using criminal force on a policeman by pushing him repeatedly with intent to deter the said public servant from discharging his duty on 12 March 2016 between 5.53am and 6.08am in the vicinity of the bus stop at Delfi Orchard. This was pursuant to section 353 of the Penal Code \[Cap 224\] (“PC”). Additionally, he was charged for using abusive words towards a public servant pursuant to section 6(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”) and behaving in a disorderly manner in a public place pursuant to section 20 of Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act \[“MO(PON)A”\] for the same incident that day.

4       In view of the incident on 12 March 2016, the Prosecution decided to also charge him for an earlier unrelated incident on 18 January 2015, which he was initially given a conditional warning for.

5       A schedule of offences tendered by the Prosecution was as follows:

6       On the first day of trial before me on 17 January 2018, the parties’ positions were as follows:

7       As the accused had agreed to plead guilty to the 2nd and 3rd charges, I agreed with both parties to stand down the 2nd to 5th charges and to deal with them after the conclusion of the trial for the 1st charge.

8       After a 10-day trial, I convicted the accused in respect of the 1st charge on 25 January 2019. Prior to sentencing the accused for the 1st charge, the Prosecution made a revised Plead Guilty (PG) offer in relation to the 2nd to 5th charges. The accused accepted the Prosecution’s revised PG offer. Accordingly, on 15 February 2019, I sentenced the accused to the five charges as follows:

9       Originally, the accused had sought for a deferment to commence sentence on 4 March 2019. Being dissatisfied, the accused has since appealed against the conviction and sentence for the first charge only. He paid the fines for the 2nd and 3rd charges in full on 18 February2019 and is currently on bail pending appeal.

### The trial - First Charge

10     The first charge read as follows:

You, MANFRED WU JING JIE, are charged that you, on 12 March 2016, sometime between 5.53am and 6.08am, at the vicinity of the bus stop near No. 402 Orchard Road, Delfi Orchard, Singapore, did used criminal force on Police Sergeant Muhammad Afiq Bin Saiful Bahry, a public servant, _to wit_, by pushing him repeatedly with intent to deter the said public servant from discharging his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

11     In essence, the accused’s defence against the 1st charge was that:

(a)     The elements of the charge were not made out by the Prosecution because any physical contact made by the accused against Sgt Afiq was not occasioned to deter Sgt Afiq from discharging his duty as a public servant or at all. The arrest of the accused was as a result of a grudge by Cpl Muhamin against the accused which arose from their initial interaction; and further or in the alternative,

(b)     The accused did not possess the requisite _mens rea_ to commit to said offence against Sgt Afiq because he was so drunk or intoxicated at the material time that he could not have known what he was doing. There was a reasonable excuse for his behaviour as such.

12     At the trial, the accused did not challenge the voluntariness of the statements made by him (P15 and P19 –P21) but only as to the weight to be placed on the content of the long statement (P15). This was because the accused was so intoxicated at the material time when the statement was recorded that he was suffering from alcohol amnesia.

13     The accused further did not challenge the facts as stated in the Statement of Facts which he had pleaded guilty to without qualification in respect of the 2nd and 3rd charges:

2.    The complainant and victim is Sergeant Muhd Afiq Bin Saiful Bahry (“Sgt. Afiq”), a male police officer attached to Toa Payoh Neighbourhood Police Centre. He was performing standby duties with Cpl Ahmad Muhaimin (“Cpl. Muhaimin”) at the time of the incident.

3.    The witness is Cpl Muhaimin, a police officer attached to Toa Payoh Neighbourhood Police Centre. He was performing standby duties with Sgt. Afiq at the time of the incident.

4.    On the 12 March 2016, at about 05.57 am, Cpl.Muhaimin created a police message and informed, “E2P1C arresting one male subject for disorderly behaviour, criminal force against public servant and abusive language against public servant.” The incident location given was at No. 442 Orchard Road, Orchard Hotel Singapore 238879.

Facts leading to the 2nd and 3rd Charges: MAC 902974-5/2016

5.    Investigations revealed that on 12th March 2016, at about 03.30 a.m., Sgt. Afiq and his partner Cpl. Muhaimin were performing standby duties outside Club Sonar, at the vicinity of the bus stop near No. 402 Orchard Road, Delfi Orchard, Singapore.

6.    Sometime between 5.15 a.m. and 6.00am, the police officers spotted the accused behaving in a disorderly manner by gesturing and raising his voice. He was also seen using vulgarities towards members of the public, shouting and gesticulating wildly. The accused was warned several times by Sgt. Afiq and Cpl. Muhaimin, and told to go home.

7.    Sgt. Afiq and Cpl. Ahmad gave multiple warnings given to the accused to keep the peace, but he carried on his behaviour. At about 06.01 a.m., Sgt. Afiq and Cpl. Ahmad decided to move in to arrest the accused.

8.    On the 12th March 2016, at about 06.02 a.m., Sgt. Afiq and his partner Cpl. Ahmad were effecting arrest on the accused. During the arrest, the accused was uncooperative and resisted the arrest. The accused shouted in a mixture of Hokkien dialect (in italics) and the English language the words “Chee Bye, Fuck you” which means “Cunt, Fuck you” in the English language to Sgt. Afiq, who was executing his duty as a public servant at the said time.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

14     In the course of the trial, the Prosecution called upon seven witnesses to testify. They were:

(i)     PW1 – Sergeant Muhd Afiq Bin Saiful Bahry (Victim – “Sgt Afiq”);

(ii)     PW2 – Deputy Team Leader (DTL) Tan Eng Thiam Amos (Inspector of Police);

(iii)     PW3 – Dr Kenneth Heng Wei Jian (Tan Tock Seng Hospital \[TTSH\]: Accident and Emergency Department- “Dr Heng”);

(iv)     PW4 – Dr Yao Yi Ju (Laboratory and Division Director of the Analytical Toxicology Division, Health Sciences Authority \[HSA\]);

(v)     PW5 – Dr Guo Song (Psychiatrist at Institution of Mental Health \[IMH\]);

(vi)     PW6 – Corporal Ahmad Muhaimin Amzar Bin Mohd Yusof (“Cpl Muhaimin” – Colleague of Sgt Afiq and on duty with the victim at the material time); and

(vii)     PW7 – Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Lionel Chee Zhen Liang (Investigation Officer \[“IO”\]).

15     Essentially, the evidence from the various witnesses dealt with the events which unfolded during the material night in question leading up to the arrest of the accused, the events subsequent to the arrest of the accused and the medical evidence pertaining to the level of intoxication of the accused and his mental state of mind during the incident.

16     In respect of the incident itself, Prosecution was of the view that there were 3 occasions that early morning where the accused had come into physical contact with Sgt Afiq by pushing him and this amounted to criminal force against Sgt Afiq. The first contact was prior to the arrest. The second contact culminated to the arrest of the accused by the policemen whilst the third contact was post-arrest.

### Events leading up to the arrest of the accused

17     The key Prosecution witnesses were the victim as stated in the 1st charge, Sgt Afiq, and Cpl Muhaimin, who were on duty together at the material time.

18     It was undisputed that at the material time, Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin were on duty as public servants as they were patrolling the streets along Orchard Road to ensure public peace and safety. In addition, it was undisputed that the accused was behaving in a disorderly manner that day. He could be seen shouting, gesticulating and using vulgarities, thereby disturbing public peace. He was warned several times to go home. The entire incident between Sgt Afiq and the accused at the scene of the incident was captured in the body worn camera of Cpl Muhaimin,

#### PW 6 - Corporal Ahmad Muhaimin Amzar Bin Mohd Yusof

19     At the time of the incident, Cpl Muhaimin was attached to the Tanglin Division police station. At about 6am on 12 March 2016, Cpl Muhaimin lodged the first information report (FIR) and requested for backup to render assistance at the scene to arrest a “male subject for disorderly behaviour, criminal force against public servant and abusive language against public servant” at Orchard Hotel Galleria along Orchard Road (P16). Club Sonar was stated as the location remarks as it is located in Orchard Delfi itself, which is the building just behind the bus stop of the scene of incident where the arrest of the accused took place.

20     In his evidence before the court, Cpl Muhaimin recalled that on 11 March 2016, he was on an 8-hour shift from 8pm to 8am. On that day, he was assigned patrol duty along Orchard Road to maintain peace and order. His assigned partner was Sgt Afiq. During their patrol duty, both of them wore body worn cameras. The video footage of the incident involving the accused along Orchard Road (P1) starting from about 5.15am that early morning was from Cpl Muhaimin’s body worn camera.

21     As for the observations stated in the table of events based on the video footage (P2) prepared by IO Chee, Cpl Muhaimin was in agreement with them. He added that inputs were sought from him and Sgt Afiq before P2 was finalised.

22     In relation to the events between 5.15am to about 6.02am which lead to the arrest of the accused, the background facts included the facts stated in paragraphs 5 to 8 of the Statement of Facts for the 2nd and 3rd charges. When Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq first saw the commotion involving the accused and his friends at the scene, they were in the police car. As such, at about 5.15am, they decided to alight from the police car and approached the group to check out the reason for the commotion. They could also hear shouting coming from the group.

23     When they first approached the group, the accused was seen behaving aggressively, shouting vulgarities at people and creating trouble. They asked the group to settle matters amicably amongst themselves and return home. The accused’s friends assured them that they would manage the accused and send him home.

24     After 5 to 10 minutes later, a second commotion occurred. The accused was swearing vulgarities, even at the police officers, and his friends sought to cover his mouth. The accused’s friends apologised profusely and reassured the police officers that they would be able to handle the accused. This time round, the accused was able to approach the 2 police officers unaided, spoke to them and asked them where they were from. When Cpl Muhaimin was asked during examination-in-chief on the second commotion, he said the accused could even tell his friends that the police officers were just doing their job:

QOkay, during this incident at the period of time from 5:26:3 hours, right? Right after when we stopped at 5:28:01. He informs the---his friends---that you are all just doing your job, right?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QCould you recognise his friends?

AYes, Ma’am.

QWas he calling some of them by name?

AUh, yah.

QHe was, right?

AYes.

QSo he’s able to walk unaided, he’s able to speak to you all, right?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QAnd ask where you all are from, that you’re just doing your job and he was able to recognise his friends?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QNow at that point of time, were you of the view that he was very highly intoxicated?

AUh, no.

QBut you felt the he was intoxicated?

AYes, not highly, yah.

QYou didn’t feel he was highly intoxicated?

ANo---no, Ma’am.

QAnd why is that?

AHe---he’s able to walk straight and without any---friend support, yah.---

QAnything else that you observed?

ACall it---call his friends’ names. He replied to all questions.

QSo he could communicate with you all?

AYes---yes, Ma’am.

25     After the accused assured them that he would be going and even shook their hands, they left the accused and his friends alone. Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq decided to keep an eye on the group from a distance.

26     At about 5.47am, a third commotion occurred. Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq had to approach the accused and his group again as they had yet to leave. This time, Cpl Muhaimin could hear the accused shouting and hurling vulgarities, including towards the accused’s girlfriend. At one point, the accused was hurling vulgarities at Cpl Muhaimin directly. Once again, the accused’s friends apologised to them for the accused’s action. They asked the friends to bring the accused home again in a car or taxi.

27     Cpl Muhaimin elaborated that during that time, there were ample opportunities for them to arrest the accused, including disorderly behaviour and using abusive language towards a public servant. However, they refrained from doing so and gave him plenty of chances. This included asking the accused’s friends repeatedly to bring him home and advising him to calm down.

28     At about 5.50am, the accused was seen quarrelling with his friend called Chris. Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq approached the accused again and spoke to him. Sgt Afiq separated the accused and Chris to defuse the situation. According to Cpl Muhaimin, the accused appeared to be looking the nametag of Sgt Afiq. However, the accused subsequently pushed Sgt Afiq on the left shoulder area.

29     Despite that, Cpl Muhaimin said the duo tried to calm the accused down. They gave him a final warning and once again asked him to go home. Otherwise, they would have no alternative but to arrest him back to the police station. Unfortunately, the accused became emboldened by putting his hands out and challenging the police officers to arrest him:

QHe asked you to arrest him, right?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QAnd you all didn’t arrest him?

AI did not.

QWhy?

ABecause we just want the matter to rest then---we just---

Qwanna resolve it?

AYah. Correct. Just by asking him to go back.

QAnd when you said, “you did nothing wrong” what do you mean? Because you’ve already seen him push your partner, right?

ABecause we---we push ourselves to the limit. We really tried our best to just let him go back home safety. To resolve the matter.

QOkay. But you knew that he had committed an offence when he pushed your partner?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QBecause you said the words “criminal force”.

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QThat was your words, right---in the footage.

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QSo you were just trying to get him to go back still--at this point?

AYes, Ma’am.

QAnd when you heard him talk to you, was he able to talk clearly---

AAh, yes---

Qat this point?

Ayes, Ma’am.

QWhen he said, “I’m not sorry” ---he could---still communicates with you all.

ACorrect, Ma’am.

\---

QWell you saw him walking. How was he walking? How was his walk?

ALike a normal person. Like---

QWas he staggering around? Could---he walk in a straight line?

Astraight line, Ma’am.

QSo he didn’t need a help at this point?

ANo.

30     Cpl Muhaimin added that as it was a weekend (Saturday early morning), patrol duty was busier along Orchard Road with more revellers. Notwithstanding that they kept having to attend to the accused, time and again, they encouraged him to go home. This included telling him that he “did nothing wrong” when they could have arrested him earlier but did not. In fact, Cpl Muhaimin told the accused’s friends at the scene that he had already committed an offence:

QWhat did you say to---these are his 2 friends, is it?

AAh, correct, Ma’am.

QAnd what did you say to them?

AUh, just give---resolve the matter ASAP amicably. Uh, he did an offence already of criminal force and disorderly---

QBehaviour.

AYah. Correct.

QSo you already told them that---that he’s committed 2 offences.

ACorrect, Ma’am.

Yet, the accused and his friends were still at the scene after 45 minutes. The accused simply refused to go home. His behaviour did not improve. He took off his shirt and was topless. He hurled vulgarities and showing the middle finger to the police officers.

31     The final straw came when the accused started to have a heated quarrel with his girlfriend near to the bus stop. This was about 6.02am. The accused remained aggressive and foul-mouthed. He was talking loudly. Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq decided to approach the accused one more time to arrest him. Cpl Muhaimin said when asked for the reason for the arrest:

Q45 minutes, right? Now, why did you all finally decide to arrest him? What was the trigger finally?

AHe was still aggressive and (clears throat) behaving rowdily.

QOkay. And why did you have to step in at the last point at 6:02? What was happening?

A\---uh, he wants to \[inaudible\] against the---the girlfriend.

QYah.

ASo we have to intervene to make sure everyone is safe.

QOkay. So there was a dispute going on between him and the girlfriend?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

32     The accused resisted the arrest by swearing at the policemen and Cpl Muhaimin saw the accused push Sgt Afiq on the shoulder.

33     After the arrest, the accused continued to use vulgarities. He informed the police officers that “no unnecessary force was used”. The accused knew that he was at the bus stop. He could explain to them that he was waiting for a taxi to go home. He even told his friends whom he recognised, like Melvin, to “go back” and he would not resist.

34     Prior to being brought to the police car at about 6.10am, he head-butted Sgt Afiq on the chest and demanded to know his name. At this point, he was already surrounded by a group of police officers. Still, Cpl Muhaimin said the accused persisted to be aggressive and continued to utter vulgarities. He even demanded to go home by bus.

35     When he finally knew that he was going to be brought back to the police station in the police car, the accused requested to walk into the car by himself and assured the police officers around him that he would no longer resist his arrest.

36     The accused was brought back from the scene to the police station lock-up before being sent to the hospital for a medical check-up. Sgt Afiq went to the hospital with the accused whilst Cpl Muhaimin stayed behind at the lock-up room to complete the arrest report at about 7.08am on the same day (P17). The name of the accused was spelt wrongly in P17 because Cpl Muhaimin said he had obtained the details from DTL Amos from a handwritten note. He had merely copied it over to P17.

#### PW 1 - Sergeant Muhd Afiq Bin Saiful Bahry

37     Sgt Afiq generally corroborated Cpl Muhaimin’s evidence as regards the events which happened that day during the incident since they were performing patrolling duty together. He further agreed with P2 prepared by IO Chee based on the video footage P1.

38     The focus of Sgt Afiq’s evidence was on the three physical contacts made by the accused on him.

#### (i)    The first physical contact

39     This occurred at about 5.53am during a third commotion caused by the accused and his group. When asked during examination-in-chief what happened between Sgt Afiq and the accused which led to the first physical contact made by the accused:

QWhat was happening here?

AHe took a look at my nametag, Ma’am.

QWho took a look at your---

AThe accused took a look at my nametag.

QNametag?

AYes, correct.

QAlright. And did you provide him your name?

AYes, correct, Ma’am, I provide him my name.

QOkay---

**(Video started at 3:28:34pm)**

**(Video stopped at 3:28:41pm)**

QOkay, could you tell us what happened here?

AThe accused pushed me on my chest area, Ma’am.

40     In fact, the accused was talking loudly about going for reservist on Monday with the Police Force after looking at Sgt Afiq’s nametag when Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin approached him to intervene. They had asked him to leave or they would arrest him. The accused then challenged them, approached Sgt Afiq closely, pushed him on the chest and thereafter warned Sgt Afiq not to touch him.

#### (ii)    The second physical contract

41     This was at about 6.02am when Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin decided to effect the arrest about 45 minutes later since the first commotion caused by the accused. By this time, the accused was topless. During the trial, when asked what happened, Sgt Afiq replied:

QNow, at this point of time, could you tell us what happened?

ABefore we effect the arrest, I was pushed on the shoulder area by the accused. So as such---we affected the arrest.

QOkay, how many times did he push you during the arrest?

A\---during the arrest, once.

42     It was Sgt Afiq’s evidence that the accused had deliberately pushed him on the chest near to the shoulder area just as they were about to effect the arrest. The arrest occurred at the bus stop. Prior to the arrest, the accused was having a heated quarrel with his girlfriend. Similar to Cpl Muhaimin’s evidence, Sgt Afiq indicated that the accused continued to be aggressive. This included shouting vulgarities at the police officers. That led to the arrest.

#### (iii)    The third physical contact

43     This happened at about 6.07am after the accused was arrested. Backup was called by Sgt Afiq because the accused remained aggressive and foul-mouthed after the arrest. When asked what the accused did:

QCould you tell us what happened at this point?

ASo while---while I was trying to send a message through the set, he used his head to push onto my chest area.

**(Video started at 3:42:20pm)**

**(Video stopped at 3:43:01pm)**

QNow, at this point of time, more officers have arrived.

ACorrect, Ma’am, more officers have arrived.

QAnd the reason for that was because?

ABecause the accused was aggressive.

QOkay, so what did you all do since he was so aggressive?

ASo we asked him to sit down at the seat area first while waiting for more officers to arrive.

QDid you all call for backup?

ABackup, correct.

44     In essence, Sgt Afiq testified that he had been trying to keep the accused in his custody and at the same time send a message to the Police HQ. It was during this time that he was hit at the chest by the accused’s head.

45     Finally, when asked to confirm in evidence the number of times the accused had pushed him during the entire incident, Sgt Afiq replied:

QOkay. Now during this entire incident, how many times did the accused push you?

AIt was three times, Ma’am.

#### Video footage, table of events and location of the incident

46     Following from his investigations into the incident involving the accused and Sgt Afiq on 12 March 2016, IO Chee tendered the video footage (P1) of the incident (including post-incident events) as well as the table of events (P2) prepared by him from his observations of the video footage as well as confirmation given by Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin. A map of the incident location (P3) taken from OneMap.sg was further tendered by him. Besides demarcating the area of the incident on P3, the location of the bus stop where the accused had pushed Sgt Afiq for the second and third time was also indicated by an arrow.

47     As for the video footage, the first three portions of it depicting the incident itself was from the body worn camera of Cpl Muhaimin. The last portion of it depicting the post-arrest event at the lock-up was from the body worn camera of Sgt Afiq. The video footage was provided to IO Chee by the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC). IO Chee was informed by NPC that any unavailable footage was either due to corruption in the data recorded or the body worn camera had run out of battery.

### Events subsequent to the arrest of the accused

48     After the accused was arrested, he was brought from the scene of the incident to the police station of Tanglin Division by the police officers.

49     At the lock-up, besides Sgt Afiq, Inspector Amos Tan (Insp Tan) was also present.

50     Sgt Afiq recollected that the accused was able to give his particulars to the police except that the alphabet of the NRIC no. was incorrect. He replied:

QWhat is this number that he is giving to the police officer?

AHe provided his NRIC verbally to us.

QOkay. Are you aware whether the NRIC was correct---or incorrect?

AAt that point of time, I was not aware, Ma’am.

QYou’re not aware?

AYah.

QAre you aware now?

AYes, Ma’am. I was aware.

QOkay. What is---is the number that he gave correct or incorrect, NRIC number?

AThe number is correct, except for the alphabet at the end. It was wrong.

QSo the number he provided, the NRIC number, how many times?

ATwice, Ma’am.

QTwice?

AYes.

QAnd the both times, it was correct?

ACorrect. Both times---

QExcept for the alphabet?

AExcept for the alphabet, it was---

QAlright.

**(Video started at 3:56:31pm)**

**(Video stopped at 3:56:53pm)**

QOkay. At this point, the footage ends but you were present at that point of time?

AYes, Ma’am.

QWas he able to provide his full name, spell it out?

AYes, Ma’am. He provided his full name and also, he spelled it out.

QAnd was it spelled---was it given correctly, his name---

ACorrect, Ma’am.

Q\---and spelling?

AHe---the name and the spelling is given correctly.

QDo you know why the footage ended at this point?

AThe battery on the BWC it---it ran out of battery.

QRan out of battery?

ACorrect.

#### PW 2 – Deputy Team Leader (DTL) Tan Eng Thiam Amos (Inspector of Police)

51     Insp Tan was in charge of obtaining the personal particulars of the accused from him and complete the medical form for complaint of violence etc. (P4). What had transpired at the lock-up between the accused and Insp Tan at about 6.30am that morning was recorded on the body worn camera of Sgt Afiq (P1) as confirmed by Sgt Afiq before it ran out of battery.

52     Insp Tan testified in court that the accused was able to provide him with his name (including the correct spelling of his name), NRIC (without the prefix “S”) and telephone numbers as well as his address. The rest of page 1 of P4 was completed by Insp Tan. At that time, Insp Tan observed that whilst the accused was intoxicated and smelt of alcohol, he was aware of his surroundings:

QOkay. Now, you were present when he was brought to the police station. From your observation, did he appear intoxicated?

AYes, Madam. He appeared intoxicated.

QNow, from your observation of the accused, did he appear to know that you and your colleagues were police officers and they\[sic\] were speaking to police officers at that point of time?

AYes, Madam.

QAnd why do you say that?

AIt is because, earlier on, when I first step into the report lodging room, he was actually quite agitated. Then I actually introduced myself, ask him cool down. And he complied because he saw that I’m their supervisor. And subsequently, he allowed my officers to, actually, put on the grip restrain on him.

QOkay. So, from your observation, you thought that he was aware of his surroundings?

AYes, Madam.

53     From the lock-up of the police station, the accused was thereafter brought to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for a medical examination by Sgt Afiq and two other police officers. Insp Tan explained that even though no visible injuries might have been found on the accused at that time, it was a police protocol that the accused should be medically examined for any injuries (as stated in P4) if necessary force had been used to effect the arrest of a person. Sgt Afiq recalled that the accused could have sustained some bleeding on in his lips during the incident.

54     At or about near to 7am, the accused arrived at the Accident and Emergency (A & E) Department of TTSH for a medical examination by Dr Heng (PW3).

#### PW 3 – Dr Kenneth Heng (A & E Department of TTSH)

55     In the medical form (P4), Dr Heng was requested to examine the accused for alcohol intoxication/drug and any injuries as the accused was arrested for an offence of “disorderly behaviour, criminal force against public servant and using abusive language against public servant”. Physical examination of the accused revealed “no injuries”.

56     As for alcohol intoxication, Dr Heng recorded that the accused had a steady gait and was able to do a normal straight line walking. His eyes were reactive to light and showed no nystagmus. There was neither slurring of or incoherence of speech. His clothes were intact. He also showed the following signs:

(i)     Alcoholic breath;

(ii)     Injected conjunctiva;

(iii)     Pupillary size normal and equal;

(iv)     Flushing of the face; and

(v)     Verboseness.

57     As the accused’s condition was good and he was unlikely to cause immediate danger to himself, he was discharged to the care of the police with no follow-up at 7.15am on the same day. A copy of the triage record (P5) for the TTSH A & E Department recorded by the triage nurse, Ella A Mariano, stated similar observations. Other than a superficial abrasion of his right middle finger knuckle and crust or dried blood on his lips with no source of bleeding, the accused was able to ambulate steadily and calm down when the police left the room.

58     In his evidence before the court, Dr Heng said the accused was not in any pain or discomfort during his observation of the accused that day. He was able to comprehend that Dr Heng was conducting a medical examination on him and did not struggle. As the accused did not know how he had sustained the superficial abrasion to his right middle finger knuckle and crust on his lips or whether he had sustained them during the struggle with the police, Dr Heng recorded “no injuries” on P4.

59     In his clinical notes (P5), Dr Heng recorded the principal diagnosis of the accused as “alcohol intoxication”. There was no trauma. His pulse rate and blood pressure readings were slightly higher than the normal range. This is also known as tachycardia and is consistent with someone having consumed alcohol. The consultation lasted for about 5 minutes and the accused was treated and discharged. A medical report dated 23 November 2017 by Dr Heng (P6) documented his findings, including the injuries noted, of the medical examination of the accused.

#### PW 7 – Assistant Superintendent of the Police (ASP) Lionel Chee Zhen Liang (Investigation Officer – IO Chee)

60     After the medical examination at TTSH, the accused was brought back to the Tanglin Division police station for investigations. IO Chee clarified in court that he was the IO who had investigated the case from the onset and not Ng Si Yi as stated in P4 that was initially filled up by Insp Tan.

61     Separately, the first page of another medical form, P18, was filled up by one of the charge office officers and signed by IO Chee at about 2pm on 12 March 2016. The accused had similarly signed on the first page of P18 to give consent for his blood specimen to be taken. This was undisputed by the accused. According to IO Chee, the accused’s blood sample was taken at around 2.55pm by a doctor from the Healthway Medical Group (HMG) who was stationed at the police station.

62     The second to fourth pages of P18, which included a medical examination of the accused at about 2.50pm to 2.55pm, was completed and signed by the same doctor from HMG who had taken the accused’s blood sample. This was done about almost 8 hours since the medical examination conducted by Dr Heng. Besides finding no injuries on the accused, the HMG doctor found that the accused’s clinical condition from alcohol intoxication has improved. The accused no longer had flushing of the face and verboseness.

63     IO Chee elaborated that the accused’s consent to take his blood specimen was only obtained at that time to ensure that, in fairness to him, he was sober enough to give his consent.

64     After the medical examination and taking of blood sample from the accused by the HMG doctor, IO Chee proceeded to take the accused’s statement (P15) from about 3 to 3.40pm in the interview room. IO Chee testified that the accused was able to converse with him properly and the accused had consented to giving his statement to IO Chee voluntarily. The information stated on P15 was from the accused. When P15 was recorded, both IO Chee and the accused had not seen P1 yet, as the video footage was only made available to IO Chee subsequently. The typewritten statement was read back to the accused before he signed on it.

65     At the trial, the accused did not challenge the voluntariness of his statement. Defence counsel further confirmed that the accused was not challenging the accuracy of the statement recorded. During cross-examination of IO Chee, IO Chee confirmed that he recorded everything according to what the accused had informed him. During the statement recording, IO Chee was unable to distinguish if the accused was lying or genuinely could not remember details of the incident because he was affected by alcohol during the incident.

66     Thereafter at about 4pm, the cautioned statements, charges and notices of warning were served on the accused (P19 to P21) and explained to him by IO Chee. The accused read P19 to P22 himself and wrote his own statements on P19 to P21 before signing them. Again, the accused did not challenge the voluntariness of his cautioned statements at the trial. During this time, IO Chee observed that the accused was equally sober as when P15 was recorded.

#### PW 4 – Dr Yao Yi Ju (Analytical Toxicology Division, Applied Sciences Group, HSA)

67     The blood sample drawn from the accused at about 2.55pm on 12 March 2016 was subsequently sent to the HSA for analysis at 3.42pm on 14 March 2016. The result revealed that the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of the accused at the time the sample was taken was 104mg/100ml of blood (P7).

68     Based on the result, Dr Yao Yi Ju, a Division Director with a PhD in Analytical Chemistry from NUS (CV marked as P8), was requested by the police to conduct a retrograde extrapolation of the BAC of the accused as at the time of the incident. Dr Yao’s report was dated 5 September 2016 (P9).

69     According to the information provided to Dr Yao, the time of the accused’s last drink was around 4am on 12 March 2016 on an empty stomach. The incident occurred around 5.15am to 6am. The accused’s blood sample was obtained at 2.55pm on the same day. As the time of the incident was about 1.5 hours after the time of the last drink, Dr Yao stated that a reasonable assumption could be made in that his BAC at the time of the incident was in the post-absorptive phase. It would therefore be at the linear declining portion of the BAC time curve as it typically takes the body about 1 to 1.5 hours to commence metabolise alcohol after absorbing it. It could take a longer period to reach the post-absorptive phase if one had consumed food.

70     The time difference between the incident and the blood collection was about 9 hours. As the blood alcohol elimination rate (also known as AER) can vary from person to person and even within the same person depending on factors like age, gender, body mass, frequency of consuming alcohol etc., the rate ranges from 9 to 29 mg/100ml/hour. As such, by applying the lower and upper limits of the AER, the possible range of the accused’s BAC at the time of the incident was estimated as follows:

Lower limit of BAC = (9 hrs x 9mg/100ml/hr) + 104 ≈ 185mg/100ml

Upper limit of BAC = (9hrs x 29mg/100ml/hr) + 104 ≈ 365mg/100ml

71     During examination-in-chief, Dr Yao testified that there is a confidence limit of 95% based on the calculations and this would include Asians who are known to have a lower AER than Westerners. The BAC of the accused would be the highest around 5 to 5.15am during the absorptive phase and it would start to decline around 5.30am onwards. The rate of decline would depend on the ability of the accused’s body in metabolising alcohol.

72     Persons with different BAC may exhibit different clinical signs and symptoms for typical social drinkers. This medical reference is commonly known as the “Dubowski Alcohol Table”. It is a recognised authority for correlating BAC with the effects of alcohol on human behaviour, performance and physiological functions (Write-up in P10(1) by Dr Kurt M. Dubowski).

73     Based on the Dubowski Alcohol Table (P10(2)), Dr Yao was of the view that a person with the BAC range of 185 – 365 mg/100ml may exhibit the following signs and symptoms:

74     Dr Yao had prepared her report (P9) without watching the video footage (P1) of the incident. It was subsequently shown to her by IO Chee together with the medical reports of the accused by Dr Heng (P4) and Dr Fones (D1). Portions of the video footage were shown to her again at the trial. During examination-in-chief, Dr Yao was asked to correlate the accused’s behaviour as shown in the video footage with the signs and symptoms in the Dubowski Alcohol Table. Her evidence was that the accused exhibited clinical sign and symptoms mainly from two stages of alcoholic influence as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="25.14%"> <col width="33.74%"> <col width="41.12%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Blood Alcohol Level (BAC)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Stage of Alcoholic Influence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Clinical Signs and Symptoms</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">90 – 250mg/100ml</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Excitement</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">•Emotional instability, loss of critical judgment, sensory-motor incoordination, impaired balance, vomiting</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">•Decreased sensory response (possibly)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">180 – 300mg/100ml</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Confusion</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">•Exaggerated emotional states (fear, rage, grief etc.) Staggering gait (partial and more so in the beginning)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">•Increased pain threshold (possibly)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

75     When Dr Yao was asked for her expert opinion as to the range of BAC the accused was exhibiting at the time of the incident, she estimated that it was between 180 to 250mg/100ml:

QNow, in your expert opinion, right, what range of blood alcohol level the accused was exhibiting at the time of this incident when you looked at the footages?

ABased on the symptoms, it appears that he might have blood alcohol of 180 to about 250, Your Honour, because of the overlap.

….

ABecause most of the symptoms that I observed that he exhibited, comes from the category of “excitement” and “confusion”. Very little from “stupor”. So my estimation is, he is probably about 180 to about 250. But that is just an estimate, Your Honour.

76     When she was asked about Dr Fone’s opinion that the BAC of the accused would have been at least 270mg/100ml by back counting to 11 hours from the time the blood sample was taken (i.e. from the time the accused had stopped consuming alcohol at 4am), Dr Yao said that this would be overestimating as the alcohol level was still climbing upward given that the body was still absorbing the alcohol.

77     Additionally, Dr Fones had used the AER at 15 to 20mg/100ml/hr. This was a narrower range and would not achieve the confidence level of 95% to cater to a wider group of people. Based on the AER used by Dr Fones and the duration of back counting at 9 hours, Dr Yao was of the view that the BAC range calculated would be between 239-284mg/100ml. Dr Yao was hence of the view that her calculations were more encompassing.

78     In summary, Dr Yao maintained her opinion that the likely BAC range of the accused at the material time of the accident was between 180-250mg/100ml because the AER used by her for the calculations according to the guidelines is wider and this would cater to a wider group of people.

#### PW 5 – Dr Guo Song (National Addictions Management Service, Addiction Medicine Department, IMH)

79     The accused was medically examined by Dr Guo Song on 24 October 2016 and 8 November 2016. Dr Guo Song is a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Head of Research at the National Addictions Management Service, Addiction Medicine Department at IMH. According to his CV (P11), besides his degree in medicine, Dr Guo has a master degree in psychiatry and PhD in psychopharmacology.

80     In preparing his medical report on the accused dated 7 December 2016 (P12), Dr Guo also referred to the summary of facts provided by IO Chee, toxicology report from HSA dated 21 March 2016 (P7), write-up by the Defence counsel with statements from witnesses as well as the medical report by Dr Fones on the accused. When the accused met Dr Guo, this would have been about 7 to 8 months after the drinking incident.

81     When Dr Guo interviewed the accused, the accused informed Dr Guo that he was a social drinker and would typically drink with his friends about 3 times a week. However, he drank more than usual during the week leading to the incident because he was stressed as he had to cope with his job as a financial executive in a bank as well as his part time degree studies in Finance.

82     The accused informed Dr Guo that his last memory before the blackout from drinking alcohol on 12 March 2016 with his friends was around 1 to 2am. The accused recalled drinking with his friends after having returned from another table. Thereafter, he could not remember anything until he was sitting in a cell of the police station.

83     Based on the evidence available to Dr Guo, Dr Guo was of the medical opinion that the accused was suffering from alcohol use disorder or alcohol intoxication. This manifested with inappropriate behaviour, unstable moods, impaired attention or memory, impaired judgment, slurred speech and poor coordination. However, even though he was under the influence of alcohol at the material time, he was not of unsound mind.

84     In his evidence before the court, Dr Guo testified that in coming up with the medical report, the recollection of the incident was dependent on the truthfulness and accuracy of the facts provided by the accused. He also relied on the DSM-V criteria of Alcohol Use Disorder (P14) to explain that based on the accused’s past drinking history and the events on the day of the incident, the accused was, in his view, experiencing a mild condition of alcohol use disorder. This was because the accused had satisfied at least 3 criteria of DSM-V.

85     Furthermore, Dr Guo noted that the accused was not reported to have signs of psychosis or unconsciousness but relevant and oriented during the period of the incident. With a BAC of 185-365mg/100ml, the accused could have alcohol induced amnesia or blackout as a result of the alcohol intoxication. This meant that the accused might not be able to remember what he had done during the incident. At the same time, his other memory beyond the blackout period remained.

86     After Dr Guo received the video footage of the incident, he prepared another medical report dated 23 February 2017 (P13). However, Dr Guo’s opinion on the accused’s condition at the time of the incident did not change. In fact, the video showed that the accused’s behaviour at that time, including the manner of speaking and walking, was consistent with his BAC level as calculated by HSA. The accused’s speeches were relevant despite the fact that he was agitated and aggressive due to this disinhibition effects of alcohol.

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

87     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence did not submit no case to answer and the accused elected to give evidence as part of his Defence (DW1).

88     The Defence further called upon the following witnesses to testify on behalf of the accused:

(i)     DW2 – Miss Isabel Melissa Peter (Friend of the accused) \[“Isabel”\];

(ii)     DW3 – Miss Liana Madhavan (Girlfriend of the accused) \[“Liana”\]; and

(iii)     DW4 – Dr Calvin Fones (Psychiatrist at Fones Clinic, Gleneagles Medical Centre) \[“Dr Fones”\].

89     Based on the video evidence, the accused did not deny that there had been physical contact against Sgt Afiq by the accused on at least two of the three occasions. His primary defence was that he was too heavily intoxicated to form an intention to physically deter Sgt Afiq from discharging his duty. He therefore had crossed the threshold of intoxication required in law for him to be exonerated from the offence.

90     Secondly, the accused was of the view that any of the physical contact did not, in any event, prevent or deter Sgt Afiq from discharging his duty. In fact, the accused’s arrest stemmed from Cpl Muhaimin’s personal grudge against the accused which arose during their first interaction.

### Factual evidence on the accused’s state of intoxication

#### DW 1 – The accused

91     At the trial, the accused testified that he had a hectic week prior to the incident because he was juggling work assignments from his part-time degree course in Finance and fulltime job as a finance officer with Maybank. His account of what he did when his girlfriend, Liana, and friends that evening at about 8pm on 11 March 2016 was similar to the accounts of Liana and Isabel. Prior to him starting to drink alcohol at the pub Lot, Stock & Barrel, the accused said he did not have dinner because he took a late lunch at 4pm.

92     In terms of his drinking history, the accused described himself as a regular alcohol drinker since 18 years old. He would drink about 2 to 3 times a week with his friends. He would typically drink whisky and beer and could on average drink about 6 mugs of beer at each session.

93     The accused said in evidence that he drank about 6 mugs of beer at the pub. A pint of beer is about 500ml. 6 mugs will be about 3 litres of beer or equivalent to a towel of beer. When he left the pub, although he could walk on his own, in his own words, he said he was “drunk”. He felt the effect of alcohol could have been greater on him because he did not have dinner. Despite that, because he was meeting more friends at Club Aura, he and his friends proceeded to Club Aura in his girlfriend’s car. The accused was a regular at Club Aura.

94     At Club Aura, the accused remembered that he drank another 4 mugs of beer and 10 to 12 glasses of brandy on the rocks. The accused further recalled he had his last drink at about 4am. He drank a total of about 8 hours from 8pm to 4am and almost continuously at both drinking locations. In his own words, the accused said that he had never drunk so much in his life over a space of about 8 hours before until that night. It would have been beyond his drinking “tolerance level”.

95     When asked by Defence counsel what was his last known memory of that day, he said:

ASo, ---after I drink my last drink, um, I---prior to having my last drink, I remember my friends being there. So each and every one of them, I actually said hi and I spoke to them briefly in my---of course, uh, without much content. So I don’t remember exactly how did I leave the club, but I remember---having a squabble with a friend. And then I remember waking up at the side of the road because my face was smashed into the road. And next thing I know, I was---I woke up in a lock-up. That’s roughly what I remembered.

\---

QAnd were all these---5 plus 3---yah, 8 people intact together right up to the time when you left Aura. Or did---people split earlier?

AIt was more or less 8 of us there.

QThat means to say that when you left Aura, do you--- are you able to remember your girlfriend, Liana Madhavan, she left with you?

AYes. That’s right.

QRight? Was Ms. Isabel Peters also there when you---

AYah. That’s right.

QWas Mr. Ryan Tan also there?

AOh, sorry. Ryan and Armani left earlier.

QOkay. So Ryan and Mohd Armani had left earlier.

AThat’s right.

QRight. What about Mr. Shaazelee, Mr. Jeremy and their friends?

AThey---they were around.

QThey were around.

AYes. That’s right.

QOkay. Right up till the end.

AUh, no. Shaaz went off during the commotion.

QYou remember Shaaz left during the commotion?

AI was told that he left.

\---

QNow you were saying that from the time you came out, you remembered you had some squabbles.

AYes---Sir.

QWho did you have a squabble or squabbles with?

AIt was with ‘Christopher’, a friend of mine.

QWho is ‘Christopher’? Was he drinking with you all earlier?

AUh, we bumped into him. At the club.

QOkay. So he was an acquaintance who was also drinking in Aura.

AThat’s right, Sir.

QRight. Do you remember why you squabbled with him?

ANo, I do not.

QRight. And then do you remember what is the result of that squabble? Did you fight?

ANo, we did not fight, Sir.

QRight. Okay. Then there was an---you said that you---you fell. You landed on the road. You remember that?

ABriefly, yes.

QOkay. So can you tell us what you know? Was it on the road was it in the bush or was it in the van or what?

AI remember it was---is---at the side of the bus stop. I don’t remember what was said. I don’t remember hearing anything. I thought I was just---

QRight. You thought you lost your balance and fell?

AIn some sorts, yes.

QRight. And did you see when you woke up whether you had injuries resulting from that?

AYah. I was bleeding on my lips.

QYou had blood on your lips?

AThat’s right.

96     The accused gave evidence that he could not remember anything else. When he woke up at the police lock-up, he remembered it was daytime. He felt groggy from the effects of alcohol and was in a state of shock. He said he did not know why he was there but he remembered giving consent for his blood sample to be taken, provided his statement to the police at 3pm (P15) and wrote and signed on the cautioned statements (P19 to P21) that day. He could not remember anything about P4.

97     Having watched his behaviour in the video footage at the trial, when asked if he had intended to use criminal force on Sgt Afiq:

QAlright. So we are looking at it---the video, right? Now, a corollary to hit is that, if---even if you did, that means even if there was contact that amounted to criminal force, Mr. Wu, were you able to---did you intend?

ANo, did not intend for all this.

98     When asked what event from the video footage he could remember, he said:

Witness:    I---I had a recollection from being outside the club, okay, but I really had no recollection of speaking with the police or anything happening, so I would assume that I had started to have a blackout from then on, until my head was hit on the floor and I sort of---I was able to have some visions, but I don’t recall hearing any sounds or anything of that sort during that moment. And I don’t even remember going to the hospital, because when I was questioned by my previous lawyer, Mr. Sant Singh, I was---only then I found out that I went to the hospital.

99     During cross-examination, when asked whether he could remember where he fell onto the road, he said:

AWhen I was pinned on the floor and I could just see, this is what I could remember, was looking at Forum.

QAt what, sorry, Forum?

AForum---Shopping Centre.

Qyou remember being at the bus stop?

AYah, so that pieces---that piece together to say that I was at the bus stop.

100    At the same time, despite the fact that he said he was heavily intoxicated when he was talking to them, the accused suggested that Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin had a motive to arrest him but they did not know what to arrest him for or were waiting for an opportunity to do so:

Q\---In that 15 minutes, tell the Court your conclusion from their recorded conversation. Were they---refraining from arresting you, or were they waiting for an excuse to arrest you---

ASorry about that. Um, my fe---feels like, um, they’re not sure what they can arrest me for---

QRight.

Aand they’re not sure if I’ve done anything enough for them to arrest me. So, they were discussing and, yah, like you said, they were wait---sort of waiting.

QRight, so at the end of the day, Prosecution has put to you their position that the Prosecution were---the---the police were very tolerant with you, they want to---only want you to go home and they were refraining from---they did not want to arrest you for 45 minutes, do you agree with that position?

ASo---sorry, can you repeat the, can---could you repeat the question?

QYes, you see the Prosecution has put to you their position that the police that night or that early that morning for 45 minutes, they were patient. They wanted you to go home only. Therefore, they didn’t want to arrest you. Do you agree that that is so?

AMe---I don’t agree to a certain extent.

QRight?

AYah.---Um, like he’s morphing stuff, he’s morphing, um, charges and he’s planting a stigma in, uh, of me in him. So---

QSo that suggests to you what?

AThat he is actually looking for opportunity in the end.

#### DW 2 – Miss Isabel Melissa Peter

101    At the time of the trial, Isabel has been a personal friend of the accused for the past 10 years. She was also one of the friends who was drinking with the accused during the night prior to the incident. She testified that she was familiar with the accused’s drinking habits as she would usually drink with him a few times a month with a group of friends. Typically, the accused would drink about 6 cans of beer and on bigger occasions, he would drink hard liquor as well like brandy or whisky. If so, he would drink about 7 to 8 brandy glasses of such hard liquor. They would typically go to a few of their favourite drinking places to hangout.

102    Isabel said that on the day of the incident, it was not the first time that she had seen the accused drunk. Usually, when he was drunk, he would laugh and talk. He might drink even more alcohol. Occasionally, he might become violent but this was not often.

103    On the fateful night before the incident, Isabel recalled that the accused had met up with her and their group of friends at a pub called Lot, Stock & Barrel. The group had consumed quite a number of towers of beer together. She could not remember how many mugs of beer the accused had drunk but in her view, his face was flushed and he was high by the time they left the pub.

104    Thereafter at about 1 plus in the morning, the group proceeded to Club Aura along Orchard Road to meet more friends. However, not everyone drank there. The group ordered about 2 towers of beer and 3 bottles of brandy. Whilst Isabel recalled the accused drinking more than anyone in the rest of the group, she did not take note of how much he drank. He also drank the brandy on the rocks. The accused drank about 1 to 2 hours continuously during the few hours they were there. When asked how much she drank, Isabel said she drank some beer at the pub and at Club Aura but did not drink much at Club Aura as she did not like to drink hard liquor.

105    As the night progressed at Club Aura, the accused became more and more drunk. He was talking loudly and gibberish. He was wobbly and had an unsteady gait and slurring in his speech. At one point, he recalled her name wrongly and their friends had to support him to help him out of the club at about 4 plus in the morning. Isabel did not recall having seen the accused this drunk before.

106    Outside Club Aura, Isabel and the group of friends were discussing whether to go home or to go out for supper. The accused then started to have an argument with one of the friends. It was at this time that the police came to check on the group to see if everything was fine. The group informed the police that they were going to send the accused home. When the accused’s girlfriend drove by to the side of the road in her car, the group tried to put him in the car. However, he came out of the car to vomit. Thereafter, he refused to return to the car as he continued to have a squabble with one of the friends, Chris, and shouted at him.

107    The police came to check on them a second time. The group reiterated that they were attempting to get him home. The accused’s friends even tried to cover his mouth to stop him from shouting vulgarities at the police. The group kept apologising to the police. Unfortunately, they could not contain the accused. He further lost his balance and fell into the bushes. He then decided to take off his shirt. Isabel decided to support the accused to the bus stop nearby to flag a cab so as to get him home.

108    At the bus stop, the accused got into an argument with his girlfriend, Liana. She was angry with him. At one point, she even threw her keys on the floor. They were also unable to get a cab for the accused to get home.

109    Finally, about 45 minutes later since the first commotion, the police came for a third time at the bus stop to interrupt the squabble between the accused and Liana. Isabel had been trying to calm them down and diffuse the argument but to no avail. It was at this moment that Isabel recalled the police arresting him. As they were at her peripheral vision, she did not see what had happened. The police then handcuffed him on the ground and made him sit down at the bus stop.

110    When asked if she recalled the accused physically assaulting or pushing any of the policemen, she replied that she could not recall seeing any based on her recollection. She added that whilst the accused knew who he was talking to at certain points that night, he was unable to comprehend what was happening and needed someone to support him to walk.

111    When she was shown the video footage, she reiterated that besides being rowdy and speaking to them, she did not recall that the accused had used violence against the policemen. She did not even know what the accused was trying to do or say that night based on some of his actions.

112    A few days after the incident, when Isabel spoke to the accused, the accused informed her that he only remembered snippets of the incident that night. When cross-examined for further details, based on the best of her recollection since the incident happened more than 2 years’ ago, the accused told her he could remember the lights of Club Aura being turned on for closing but not getting into Liana's car.

#### DW 3 – Miss Liana Madhavan

113    Liana is the girlfriend of the accused. They have known each other for 14 years. According to her, the accused is a regular drinker who drinks at least 3 times a week. She has seen the accused drunk before prior to the incident, the last being on New Year’s Day in 2016. Liana also confirmed that when the accused is drunk, he laughs and talks loudly. However, she has never seen him as drunk as on 12 March 2016.

114    On the evening of 11 March 2016, Liana met the accused at about 8pm for dinner at Raffles City. The accused did not eat. Neither did he consume any alcohol then. After dinner at 8 plus, they proceeded to meet their friends at the pub, Lot, Stock & Barrel. This was when the accused started consuming beer but she did not drink. In fact, as she was driving, she did not drink at all that night.

115    She recalled him drinking about half a tower of beer, which was about 1 plus litre from the beer tower (according to the witness, a tower of beer is about 3 litres). He also drank from additional jugs of beer ordered subsequently. There were 3 other friends with them. All in, he drank beer for about 4 hours continuously at the pub.

116    Liana confirmed Isabel’s observation that the accused was already flushed in the face and tipsy when the group left the pub for Club Aura at near to 1am on 12 March 2016. She drove the group to Club Aura.

117    When the group arrived at Club Aura, they ordered 2 towers of beer and 3 bottles of brandy at the same time. This time, besides the group, another 3 to 4 friends joined them. She could not remember how much alcohol the accused drank at Club Aura as he went to other tables to drink with friends he knew as well. All she could remember was she saw him drinking continuously at Club Aura while they were there. Besides mixing drinks, he would drink directly from the brandy bottle or pick up drinks from the other tables to drink as well. She had never seen him drink so much in one night.

118    When they finally left Club Aura at close to 5am, Liana had to support the accused as he was stumbling from walking up the flight of steps to leave. He was very flushed by now and chatting happily with his friends. She asked her friends to take care of the accused whilst she get her car to drive him home. When she returned with the car, she saw the accused shouting as if he was having an argument with someone. She told him to stop misbehaving and calm down but to no avail.

119    Liana’s recollection of events from this point was similar to Isabel. She recalled shoving him into the car but he got out of the car to vomit. She got out of the car and followed him. At one stage, he fell into the bush and she had to pick him up. There was a commotion when he had an argument with Chris. She asked Isabel to get him home in a cab.

120    At another point, she shouted at him in an attempt to knock sense into him to stop misbehaving. She was very frustrated because she felt he was unable to recognise her.

121    Based on her testimony before the court, Liana did not recall the accused having any physical contact with the policemen prior to his arrest. She remembered that he was talking to them. Initially, he was talking to them coherently and even apologised for creating a ruckus when he approached them unaided. He knew they were policemen. Then the accused became rowdier as the policemen became more aggressive and asked him to back down.

122    Just before the policemen arrested the accused, Liana conceded that she was quarrelling with the accused and shouted at him. As she was walking towards him to confront him further, the policemen intervened to arrest the accused.

123    When the police arrested him, the accused became agitated. Although, Liana was able to see what had happened from where she was standing at the bus stop, she said she was unable to see whether the accused had actually pushed the policemen. On the other hand, she could not exclude the possibility of the accused pushing the policemen, either accidentally or unintentionally, during the arrest.

124    Next, Liana did see the accused trying to push his head towards the chest of one of the policemen after the arrest. Even now, she did not believe he had intended to assault the policeman as he was saying things which did not make sense at all at that time like the lifting of a “visor” when there was none.

125    When Liana went to the police station to bail the accused out at about 5plus in the evening on the same day, she said the accused was confused as to what had happened. He only knew he was drunk and was arrested. He could not comprehend how he had ended up pushing a policeman which led to his arrest.

### Medical evidence on the accused’s state of intoxication

#### DW4 – Dr Calvin Fones

126    Dr Fones was requested to give his medical opinion on the accused’s state of mind and his ability to understand what he was doing at the time he left Club Aura and when he was arrested by the police thereafter. This was pursuant to a letter of instructions to him (D5) enclosing HSA’s toxicology report dated 21 March 2016 (P7). Besides that, Dr Fones examined the accused on 1 July 2016.

127    Dr Fones graduated from NUS with an MBBS and is a fellow of the Academy of Medicine in the Chapter of Psychiatrists. Concurrently, he is an adjunct Associate Professor at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at NUS. Prior to being in the private practice, he was Head of the Department of Psychological Medicine at NUS and Senior Consultant in the Department of Psychological Medicine Psychiatrist at NUH.

128    During the medical examination, Dr Fones noted that even though the accused was aware that he was charged for the incident with the police officers (i.e. the 1st to 3rd charges), the accused endeavoured to provide accurate details surrounding and leading to the incident. The recollection by the accused was noted to be residual, sparse and disjointed.

129    Based on self-reporting, the accused informed Dr Fones that his last conscious and continuous memory was at approximately 2am on 12 March 2016. Thereafter, his scattered memory included recollections of:

(i)     subjective frustrations as he was surrendered by his friends who were crowding around him and asked if he was “OK”;

(ii)     boarding his girlfriend’s car and alighting shortly thereafter to vomit;

(iii)     wandering about the vicinity albeit unsteadily;

(iv)     being held down by someone and his face was against the floor, resulting in him feeling shaken; and

(v)     being hauled out of the police patrol vehicle upon arriving at a hospital.

130    Dr Fones recorded that the accused last regained his full memory or consciousness in the lock-up at the police station as it was already bright in the day. He remembered having his statement recorded and was informed of the charges he was going to face. The accused, too, consented to providing his blood sample and was cooperative throughout.

131    In calculating the estimated BAC level of the accused at the material time of the incident, Dr Fones relied on the AER rate of 15 to 20mg/l00ml/hour based on the medical literature tendered by him: Montgomery, Mark R; Reasor, Mark J 1992_; Retrograde extrapolation of blood alcohol data: An applied approach. Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health_ (D3). Like Dr Yao, Dr Fones explained that there is a range for the AER as the rate of metabolising alcohol from one’s body varies from person to person. This will depend on factors like body temperature, type of alcoholic beverage consumed, amount and type of food consumed.

132    According to the AER rate used by Dr Fones, the range of BAC of the accused at the time of the incident would have been:

(15mg x 11 hours) + 104 = 269mg/100ml

(20mg x 11 hours) + 104 = 324mg/100ml

133    Therefore, Dr Fones was of the view that the accused would have a BAC of at least 270mg/100ml during his intoxicated state. This was further validated by the accused’s own account that he ate very little food prior to drinking and he had consumed a considerable volume of various types of alcoholic beverage during his drinking session that night.

134    At the estimated BAC of the accused, he would fall within the stage of “confusion” stage of alcoholic influence at between 180-300mg/100ml. The physiological effects would include confusion, dizziness, exaggerated emotions (anger, fear, grief), impaired visual perception, decreased pain sensation, impaired balance staggering gait, slurred speech, moderate muscular incoordination etc. Such clinical symptoms would have accounted for the offending and disorderly behaviours of pushing, using abusive language and vulgarities. His ability to understand and awareness of what he was doing would have been compromised or even severely so.

135    During examination-in-chief, when asked about his opinion of the accused’s state of mind as at the time of the incident, he replied:

Q\---Dr. Fones. But I just want you to articulate. At the end of your assessment of Mr. Wu and after studying the documents that were provided to you, what was your opinion as to Mr. Wu’s state of mind at the time of the incident?

AIn brief, um, I’m of the ---opinion that Mr. Wu was suffering from, um, alcohol intoxication at, uh, level which was, um, rather high, estimated at---at least 200 to 300 milligrams per 100ml. Hence, leading to a state of confusion as well as, uh, behavioural disinhibition, all of which contributed to his actions at that point in time.

QRight. I’ll come---

APertaining to the memory part, um, I have also opined that, uh, he had, um, amnesia, uh, i.e., a memory loss for events that occurred during the material time.

136    During cross-examination, Dr Fones agreed that he could accept Dr Yao’s opinion that the accused’s BAC level was within the range of 180-250mg/100ml of blood based on back counting of his blood sample taken at the police station as well as the symptoms exhibited by him during the period of the incident. Moreover, Dr Fones agreed that he is not a forensic toxicologist like Dr Yao.

137    Based on the clinical and corroborative anecdotal evidence before him, Dr Fones was of the view that the accused’s mental state had been affected at the material time of him committing the offences on 12 March 2016 due to his alcohol intoxication. As he was experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, the accused was inebriated to an extent which severely undermined his self-regulatory and self-monitoring mechanisms, situational awareness and better judgment. Yet, Dr Fones said the accused was still able to retain certain basic memory functions, particularly memory formed before the incident, despite his level of intoxication:

QNow, my question is that, wouldn’t the conduct of the accused person stated in paragraph 3 of P30---

AMmm hmm.

Qbe indicative that the person that, in this case doc---Mr. Wu, knew what he was doing as he was able to ask the police to show ID, he was able to apologise to the police, he was able to walk a considerable distance and that he was able to ask for his lawyer, he was able to provide his name and he was able to, both at the police station at and---at the hospital?

AUm, I think these, uh, footages, uh, may illustrate that, um, he still retains certain basic functions at a most basic level he was still able to walk. He was still able to, um, answer simple questions, uh, and obey simple instructions. Um, however, it does not automatically, uh---uh, um, suggest that, um, he is able to form intent or is able to understand, uh, what other aspects of his behaviour, uh, may actually be involved in.

QCorrect. And this will also relate to your earlier opinion that memory formed before the incident should be retained. So---so like, for example, his name, his address, his identity card number these are---

ACorrect.

138    In summary, having considered the evidence before him, the BAC level of the accused at that material time and his interaction with the accused, Dr Fones was of the view that the accused was suffering from both fragmentary and at certain points, en bloc amnesia, last for a couple of hours during the incident. This was consistent with the clinical symptoms and behaviour which the accused had exhibited at the material time.

## ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCE

139    Section 353 of the PC states:

**Using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty**

353.  Whoever assaults or _uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty_ as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both. \[Emphasis\]

140    In the case of _Goh Ang Huat v PP_ (_“Goh Ang Huat”_), the High Court held at \[12\] and \[13\] that:

\[12\]  To convict on a s 353 charge, the following ingredients must be proved:

(a)    that the victim of the criminal force was a public servant;

(b)    that the accused used criminal force to such public servant;

(c)    that the accused used criminal force on the public servant when the latter was in the execution of his duty as such public servant.

\[13\]  Dealing with the first and third ingredients of the offence together, the question was whether, at the time of the incident, the complainant was a public servant in the execution of his duty. In this regard, it was also significant whether, at the relevant time, the complainant was acting lawfully in stopping the appellant.

141    Both the Prosecution and Defence were in agreement that the material time of the incident, the victim was a public servant and was in the execution of his duty as such a public servant.

142    I therefore only had to consider the second ingredient, that is whether the accused had used criminal force to the victim as a public servant.

143    “Criminal force” is defined under s350 of the PC as:

350.  Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.

144    Force is further defined under s349 of the PC as:

349.  A person is said to use force to another if _he causes motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion to that other_, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other’s body, or with anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other’s sense of feeling:

_Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the following 3 ways:_

(_a_)     _by his own bodily power_;

(b)    by disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion, or change or cessation of motion, takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person;

(c)    by inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \[Emphasis added\]

145    Chief Justice Yong Pung How held at \[21\] in _Goh Ang Huat_ that the definition of criminal force is so wide that this includes a “force of almost every description of which a person is the ultimate object”.

146    In respect of the accused’s defence of intoxication, sections 85 and 86 of the PC state:

**Intoxication when a defence**

85.-(1)    Except as provided in this section and in section 86, intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge.

(2)    Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason thereof the person charged at the time of the act or omission complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or did not know what he was doing and -

(a)    the state of intoxication was caused without his consent by the malicious or negligent act of another person; or

(b)    the person charged was, by reason of intoxication, insane, temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission.

**Effect of defence of intoxication when established**

86.-(1)    Where the defence under section 85 is established, then in a case falling under section 85(2)(a) the accused person shall be acquitted, and in a case falling under section 85(2)(b), section 84 of this Code and sections 251 and 252 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 shall apply.

(_2_)     _Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of the offence._ \[Emphasis added\]

147    Both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that the accused had voluntarily consumed alcohol on 12 March 2016 and he was not medically certified as “insane”, whether temporarily or otherwise, by reason of his intoxication at the material time. Accordingly, both parties agreed that any defence of intoxication that could possibly be raised by the accused would have to be pursuant to s86(2) of the PC, where the intoxication prevented the accused from forming the requisite _mens rea_ of the offence in question.

148    The requirements for invoking the defence of intoxication under s86(2) of the PC have been enunciated in the Court of Appeal decision of _Tan Chor Jin v PP_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 319 at \[27\]:

\[27\]  We turn now to s 86(2) of the Penal Code, which is the last of the three avenues through which intoxication may be raised as a defence (see \[17\] above). Two requirements must be met before this subsection can be successfully invoked. _First, the accused must show evidence of his intoxication. In this regard, objective evidence of the accused's level of intoxication is crucial_ (see Jin Yugang v PP at \[32\]). _Second, even if the accused can prove that he had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol, the surrounding facts must show that he was so intoxicated that he could not form the intention which is a necessary element of the alleged offence_ (see Mohd Sulaiman v PP ("Mohd Sulaiman") at \[31\]). \[Emphasis added\]

149    The Court of Appeal also commented at \[14\] in relation to ss85 and 86 of the PC:

\[14\]  It has been rightly observed (in K L Koh, CMV Clarkson & NA Morgan, _Criminal Law in Singapore and Malaysia: Text and Materials (Malayan Law Journal Pte Ltd, 1989) (“Koh, Clarkson & Morgan”))_ that from the perspective of criminal responsibility (at p232):

\[A\] person who commits a crime when involuntarily intoxicated should not be blameworthy while one who voluntarily gets into a state of intoxication should be responsible for his acts.

150    With the elements of the offence as well the requirements of the accused’s defence of intoxication in mind, I shall now analyse the evidence presented before me.

## ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE

151    The issues before the court were:

(a)     Whether the accused had made physical contact with Sgt Afiq by pushing him such that it amounted to using criminal force on a public servant when Sgt Afiq was executing his duty as a public servant;

(b)     Whether the accused had the requisite intention to use criminal force on Sgt Afiq at the material time because he was drunk or was in an intoxicating state; and

(c)     Should the accused’s reason that he was drunk at the material time be accepted as a reasonable excuse for his actions against the policeman in any event.

### Was there an act of criminal force committed by the accused on Sgt Afiq

152    The video footage spoke for itself. There was rowdy behaviour and lots of vulgarities being used. For 45 minutes or more, the policemen sought to persuade the accused and his friends to bring the accused home. He was intoxicated and behaved terribly. Yet, he refused return home and caused a commotion in public. This culminated to his arrest. During this almost one-hour period, there certainly was physical contact between the accused and Sgt Afiq.

153    As seen from the video footage, prior to his arrest, the accused was behaving in a disorderly manner at the scene. He talked a lot, shouted vulgarities, quarreled with his friends and girlfriend, took off his shirt and refused to leave the scene and go home when asked repeatedly by both his friends and the police officers to do so. He was even warned that they would arrest him if he continued with his aggressive behavior. The accused not only did not heed the warning, but approached the police officers and challenged them to arrest him. In fact, as time went by, his actions became bolder and his voice louder. In essence, even the accused admitted at the trial that he had behaved badly.

#### The three physical contacts

154    From the evidence adduced, I agreed with the prosecution that the accused was seen pushing Sgt Afiq at least 3 times in the video before, during and post arrest.

155    For the first contact, this was not disputed by the Defence. However, the Defence argued that this did not amount to a criminal force as the accused had merely pushed Sgt Afiq on the chest when he brushed away the latter’s hand from his own shoulder. In any event, this was not intended to deter Sgt Afiq from discharging his duty as a police officer. Even the police officers did not feel that the accused had used criminal force at that time.

156    I disagreed that this was merely an accidental touch by the accused while brushing away Sgt Afiq’s hand from his own shoulder. Just prior to this, the accused was having a heated quarrel with his friend Chris. His behavior was aggressive. Both Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin had to intervene so as to maintain peace in public. Otherwise, there was no reason for the duo to have approached the accused.

157    When the accused sought to look at the nametag of Sgt Afiq, he already knew that the latter was a police officer. Yet, he pushed Sgt Afiq on the chest.

158    During cross-examination of Sgt Afiq, when put to him that even if there had been a contact between the accused and him, this did not deter Sgt Afiq from performing his duty as a public servant, he disagreed:

QThere was contact. First contact at 5.53, I am---my case is that he was drawing your attention, not to deter you from performing your duty, because you were not doing anything in connection with him at that time.

AI disagree, Sir. We were trying to separate the parties. I’m just asking the friend to bring him home. So that’s my duty to keep peace at that place.

159    During cross-examination, based on P1 and P2, IO Chee also disagreed that it did not amount to a push:

AI disagree.

QYou disagree and what is your interpretation?

A\---as police officers sometimes we do get engage with drunk subjects. This is a common part of the job.

QRight.

A\---I think is quite evident to see that Manfred was advancing towards---Sergeant Afiq. I believe Sergeant Afiq’s hand was placed there to prevent him from coming any nearer. Subsequently, um, the accused went to push ---Sergeant Afiq’s hand.

\---

Qbut I am submitting to you---that means I’m putting to you, Mr. Lionel that it can hardly be called a push, it cannot be called a push.

AI disagree.

160    When Defence counsel asked Cpl Muhaimin if the first contact was as a result of the accused trying to brush Sgt Afiq’s hand away since Sgt Afiq had raised his hand to reach for the accused’s shoulder’s first:

QAlright. That---that is the episode, right? I---in my interpretation is that---they were facing each other but they were not looking at each other. ---Afiq was not looking at him, right? And then Afiq raised his hand---to reach for his shoulder and then he brushed it away. You agree?

AI disagree because, um, he came near to us. We were carrying arms so we are afraid that he might just attack.

QYah---

AAnything possible---

Qthe arms is at the---waist, right? So his hands are actually---at the chest.

A\---there are many incidents happened. They just grabbed our arms and just do anything. So to be aware we have to like move---keep step---a distance away from the subject. But he---

QOkay, that’s your explanation---

ACorrect.

161    After the first contact, when asked during re-examination why he said that to the accused that “he did nothing wrong”, Cpl Muhaimin explained that they were just trying to get the accused to go home:

QWhat was the 2nd offence he had committed?

A(clears throat). The---push---

QYah. The push with---to your partner, right?

AYes, Ma’am.

QBut you told him no offence was committed?

AYes, Ma’am.

QAnd you explained yesterday why.

AYah.

QWhy were you trying---why were you telling him no offence was committed?

AI just want to out---I just want him to just go home, yah.

QJust go home.

AYah. Give--- him chance.

Besides, as could be seen from the video, the accused’s friends were urging them to arrest the accused for his behaviour. Nonetheless, Cpl Muhaimin told them to send the accused home in a car quickly to avoid any more commotions.

162    As for the second contact, the defence argued that the Prosecution was unable to prove that there was such a contact. This was more so when the body worn camera was unavailable due to corruption of data or recording error. It further submitted that the Prosecution’s witnesses were inconsistent as regards where was the point of contact on Sgt Afiq for this contact. Finally, if at all, this contact happened in the midst of the arrest and it was hence accidental and not deliberate.

163    There was no reason for me to doubt the evidence of Sgt Afiq that he did feel the push at that time on the chest near the shoulder area. This was particularly so when prior to and during the arrest, as seen from the video, everything happened so quickly.

164    When asked during re-examination whether this could have been an accidental contact by the accused during the arrest and this would not have deterred him from performing his duty as a public servant in any event, Sgt Afiq replied:

AWhen we approached him, he was quite aggressive. So as such, that’s why, we---and that we---necessary force was used and also we landed on the road as well.

\---

Q\---And this---and incident happened to you, did you feel the accused pushing you during the time that you were trying to arrest him?

AYes, Ma’am. At that point of time, I did feel the push.

QYou felt him push you?

ACorrect.

QDid you think it was an accidental touch?

AI don’t believe so, Ma’am.

QSo you felt a positive push towards you---

ACorrect, Ma’am.

Q\---during the---about the time you were affecting arrest?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

165    Further, I did not see any inconsistency in the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses as to the location of the second contact. During cross-examination of Cpl Muhaimin, Defence counsel suggested to him that the second contact was nothing more than the accused trying to withdraw his right hand when Sgt Afiq tried to grab hold of the accused’s hand to effect the arrest but he disagreed:

QAs I have brought your attention to. Once was in front of him offered to be arrested. The 2nd one, he was walking away, he put his hand like that to be arrested. The 3rd one he said, the other---he could only raise 1 hand because the other hand was still around ‘Isabel’ and he was in the process of withdrawing it. And your partner held his left hand---right hand. Do you agree with my interpretation?

AI disagree, yah, Sir.

166    When asked to elaborate during re-examination, Cpl Muhaimin informed the court that he indeed saw the accused use his right hand to push Sgt Afiq on the shoulder area during the arrest. Additionally, nobody hit the accused on his head or body during the arrest.

167    IO Chee said in evidence that this happened when the accused had used his right hand to push the chest of Sgt Afiq near the shoulder area before the accused was being restrained:

QOh, you are talking about this push. Where’s the push?

AThis is the push. With his right arm he tries to shove Sergeant Afiq on the left shoulder. This is the push that we’ve been referring to.

168    Next, I see no reason to doubt the Prosecution’s evidence that the recording from Sgt Afiq’s data could not be extracted as there could have been a corruption of the data. In fact, from the video that was available, which we saw numerous times during the trial, clearly showed that he was not only resisting his arrest but was still behaving in an aggressive manner and shouting vulgarities after his arrest.

169    Even if I take the Defence’s case to its highest that the second contact between the accused and Sgt Afiq was as a result of the arrest itself, there was still the earlier first contact. I now come to the third contact, which was post-arrest.

170    The third contact was the head butting by the accused on Sgt Afiq’s chest. The Defence’s case was that the accused was merely using his head to push away the obstruction over Sgt Afiq’s nametag in order for him to see Sgt Afiq’s name clearly. In the next breath however, the Defence then argued that due to the fact that the accused was heavily intoxicated, the push on Sgt Afiq’s chest in a forward and upwards motion was not intended as a criminal force to deter Sgt Afiq from discharging his duty.

171    Once again, the Defence did not dispute that there was such a physical contact but was merely trying to justify the accused’s action in his state of intoxication. This begs the question: If the accused was that intoxicated, why would he know and want to read Sgt Afiq’s nametag?

172    When put to Sgt Afiq that the third contact would not have deterred him from performing his duties as a public servant because by that time, the accused was already arrested and he had merely wanted to see the nametag of Sgt Afiq, Sgt Afq disagreed. When asked to explain why during re-examination, he said:

QThis is happening post-arrest when he’s already handcuffed?

ACorrect, Ma’am, he was---he was---already handcuffed.

Q\---point of time, he’s handcuffed and he’s still resisting arrest? Would that be correct?

AAnd he’s still uncooperative.

QHe’s still uncooperative, he’s still---being aggressive towards you and Muhaimin?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

\---

QNow, at this point of time, what was your duty? What were you attempting to do?

AI was attempting to call for backup to quickly hurry up.

QOkay. And pertaining to the accused---where the accused is concerned, what was your role? What was your duty when you arrested this accused? What were you trying to do?

AI need to keep him in my custody---

QYes.

AI need to ensure that he’s---he’s there---in front of me.

QThat he wasn’t---escaped from your---custody, right?

ACorrect.

QAnd when he pushed you like this, or when he pushed you, did you feel that he was deterring you from your duty in any way?

AYes, Ma’am.

QAnd how was he deterring you from your duty? What is he doing?

AI was---I need to secure him and also try to actually send a message through my ops room to the said HD. So subsequently, he used his head and pushed onto my chest area.

173    For the third contact, Cpl Muhaimin disagreed too with the Defence that the accused had hit the right chest of Sgt Afiq unintentionally because the accused had wanted to see the name tag of Sgt Afiq after he was arrested:

QRight? And Afiq’s name was obviously printed on his name tag, right? My case is that it was obstructed, alright? And he asked for the obstruction to be removed and he said, “Remove the visor. I want to see. Remove the visor.” Right? And there is no visor, and it is my case that Afiq didn’t expose his name tag and the accused used his head to brush the body cam aside so he that he can see the vi---the name tag, right? So, my case is that there was no head-butting as you have mentioned. His hands were cuffed behind him you agree? Right, so the only thing that he could move was his head.

AYah, he was resisting the arrest (clears throat).

QNo, he was arrested. ---He was already in cuffs.

ABut he was still violent as you can see in---throughout the whole video---

QRight.

Awhen he was---arrested.

QI am asking the question; do you agree that by his head gesture he was attempting to use his head to remove whatever that was obstructing his reading of the name tag?

ADisagree, Sir.

174    When the same question was suggested to IO Chee during cross-examination, IO Chee also disagreed and explained:

QYes. His head went to a motion forward and upwards. I’m---I am suggesting to you that my interpretation of this footage, this is the time at 6:07:58. That the accused was not head-butting Afiq but he was approaching the further half of his body because that was where his camera was which was blocking his name tag and he moved his head forward and upward in an attempt to remove the obstacle which was blocking his view of Afiq’s name tag.

AFirstly, I cannot be certain what’s the intention of the accused. And secondly is what he is doing is I think it’s a clear-cut he’s a criminal force against the officer. The officer had no intention for him to do---to do---for him to allow him to headbutt or at least what you mean was to push the camera up. That wasn’t--- mentioned to any--- other---officer

QWhether---it---amounts to an offence or not, I think this is the purpose of the trial. But what we are trying to do is to interpret---to describe his actions, right. First question is you agree that he didn’t strike---headbutt. That’s means go straight into Afiq’s chest. He did forward and upwards, yes?

AI disagree. I can’t tell.

\---

QCorrect. So, at the end of the day, I put to you, alright, Mr. Lionel that this so-called 3rd contact was not intentional---with the intention to deter Mr. Afiq from doing his duty. Correct? He---he was already arrested. He had already been pinned down. He had---his hand was already in handcuffs. He merely wanted to read the name tag.

AI disagree.

175    As such, there was unequivocal evidence that criminal force had been exerted by the accused on Sgt Afiq to deter the latter from discharging his duty as a public servant more than once. The physical acts have been proven by the Prosecution. There were 3 occasions. This included once pre-arrest, once whilst resisting his arrest by the police for his aggressive and disorderly behavior and a third one post-arrest. All 3 contacts, in my view, did deter Sgt Afiq from lawfully discharging his duty as a police officer that day.

### Whether the arrest was due to a personal grudge by the police officers against the accused

176    Based on the conversation between Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin, Defence counsel sought to suggest that the accused’s arrest appeared to be a personal desire for vengeance by the two police officers. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for them to do so. It felt that Cpl Muhaimin had wanted to teach the accused a lesson due to their initial interaction.

177    I found this argument rather incredible. Looking at the video footage, even prior to the first physical contact, the police officers would have been able to arrest the accused for disorderly behaviour in public and using vulgarities on a public servant. There were clearly sufficient and valid reasons for them to arrest the accused that day. If they had wanted to take revenge on the accused, they would not have waited for more than 45 minutes later before arresting him.

178    Quite apart from the additional paperwork they had to do if the accused was arrested, it was apparent in the videos as well as to the accused’s friends (including Isabel who had testified) and girlfriend present at the scene that the 2 police officer had given the accused numerous opportunities by asking him to go home and stay out of trouble in view of his intoxicating state at that time. They did not even know the accused at all.

179    During cross-examination, when asked if the policemen were trying diffuse the situation by helping them get a cab for the accused to go home safely as soon as possible rather than becoming aggressive towards him, Liana agreed that the policemen were merely doing their jobs. In fact, it was the accused’s behaviour that was aggressive.

180    When asked whether they had an ulterior motive to arrest the accused at the material time since Cpl Muhamin was unhappy with the accused for shouting vulgarities are them as put to him by the Defence, Sgt Afiq replied during re-examination:

QYes. Now, counsel questioned you about this. Right? And he asked you about the arrest that the only reason you all arrested him was because of the vulgarity. Now, on that day---you saw the footage multiple times already. When you arrested the accused, why did you effect the arrest? What were the offences he was committing, or that you thought he was doing that you needed to step in, arrest him? What was he doing?

ADisorderly behaviour.

QOkay. What else did he do?

ACriminal force against public servant and also abusive language.

QSo, when at that point of time when you effected your arrest---you and Muhaimin effected the arrest, was it for those reasons or just because he was shouting things about your mother?

AIt was for those reasons.

\---

QNow, counsel also pointed out to you that your partner sounded unhappy. Right? Remember he was unhappy and he wanted to effect an arrest?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QDo you know why your partner was unhappy and wanted to effect an arrest on the accused at that point of time? Because you were having a conversation, right?

AI believe it was because he wanted to settle the issue. We just want him to leave the area actually.

QYes.

ABut then, he’s still ---uncooperative with us.

QOkay.

AYes, still around the area.

In fact, Sgt Afiq elaborated that for more than 45 minutes that day, the duo had given the accused many chances. They were hardly eager to arrest him and was hoping that he would leave the area and not cause trouble so that they could carry on with their patrolling duty.

181    Therefore, I saw no reason to doubt the credibility of both Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq, particularly given the objective video evidence before me. I found no basis for the Defence’s argument that Cpl Muhaimin had a motive to arrest the accused due to the earlier encounter between them.

182    On the contrary, I found that during the 45-minute period, both the officers had given the accused many chances to go away from the scene. They warned him not to create trouble. They understood that he could have drank more than he should. They kept repeating to him to go home and asked his friends to bring him home. It was only when the accused’s behavior went out of control that they had no choice but to arrest him. Otherwise, I believe they would rather have an uneventful night patrolling the streets of Orchard Road.

183    There was really no motive or benefit for them to arrest the accused or “get the accused into trouble” with the law as such. The accused only have himself to blame for being in hot soup. In fact, his friends had more than once reminded him that Cpl Muhaimin and Sgt Afiq are policeman and he should think about his family and career before doing anything foolish.

### The accused’s alcohol intoxicated state – Was there an intention to commit the offence?

184    The accused did not deny that he had voluntarily consumed alcohol on the night prior to the incident. Hence, his state of intoxication was not a malicious or negligent act of another person done without his consent. In fact, the accused was a regular drinker of alcohol prior to the incident.

185    I was also prepared to accept the evidence of Liana and Isabel that whilst the accused was a regular drinker and previously been drunk, they have not seen him drank so much or became this drunk before prior to the night of the incident.

186    In assessing the accused’s state of mind as a consequence of his alcohol intoxication during the incident, I accepted the evidence of the medical experts before me that this can be determined by:

i.     The BAC level of the accused;

ii.     Stage of alcohol intoxication based on symptoms exhibited by the accused; and

iii.     The recollection or self-reporting of the incident by the accused.

187    Items i and ii are objective elements whilst item iii is a subjective element which requires the honest reporting by a person as to his or her recollection of the events which occurred during the period of intoxication. I would discuss each item sequentially.

#### BAC level of the accused at the material time of the incident

188    I accepted the medical evidence before me that based on the back counting, the accused’s blood alcohol level (BAC) at the material time was around 180mg/100ml to 250mg/100ml of blood. This evidence was accepted by both Dr Yao and Dr Fones. Besides, during cross-examination, Dr Yeo indicated that Dr Fone’s narrower range was in any event within the more encompassing range calculated by her.

#### Stage of alcohol intoxication

189    The BAC level of the accused was further consistent with the expert opinion of both the Prosecution and Defence that based on the Dubowski table, the accused exhibited clinical symptoms which largely fell within the “excitement” and “confusion” stages.

190    The symptoms exhibited by the accused in these 2 stages include emotional instability, loss of critical judgment, vomiting and impaired balance under the “excitement” stage and exaggerated emotional states, staggering gait and memory loss in “confusion” stage. As per the opinion of both the medical experts, there is typically an overlap in the symptoms between the 2 adjacent stages.

191    Whilst I note that some people would even attempt to drive their vehicles home after having consumed this range amount of alcohol, I too accept the medical evidence here that different people would behave differently with the same level of alcohol as their reaction to alcohol is different. We will need to also observe the behavior of the person to see how he or she reacts to the level of alcohol in the body. In fact, Dr Fones was of the view that the accused had exhibited symptoms from the lower “euphoria” stage (30-120mg/100ml) based on the video footage of the incident.

192    Nonetheless, Defence submitted that based on the BAC level of the accused at the material time, the accused’s actions were not of someone who was lucid and mildly intoxicated. Instead, he had by that time become disoriented and was suffering from exaggerated emotional states owing to his heavy intoxication. Hence, he did not form the intention to commit the said offence.

193    Although the objective evidence of the body worn camera in my view showed otherwise, I would proceed to analyse the symptoms exhibited by the accused during the incident and after his arrest.

#### (i)    Symptoms exhibited by the accused during the incident

194    From the video, it would appear to me that the accused was more drunk at the start of the video. For example, initially, his gait was unstable and he required support. Gradually, as time passed, the accused became less drunk and was able to manage himself better. He could be seen walking unaided and his speech was less slurred and more coherent.

195    Sgt Afiq said the accused was intoxicated but not highly intoxicated during the time of the accident. This was based on his 4 years of experience as a police officer:

QNow from your observation of the accused during this incident, did he appear intoxicated to you?

AYes, Ma’am. He appeared---intoxicated.

QAlright. Now from your observation, did he appear to know that you and your partners were police officers when he was speaking to you or he didn’t know that you were police officers when he was speaking to you?

AI believe he was aware---the accused was aware that we are police officers.

QAnd why do you feel that he was aware?

ABecause in the clip, he did mention to one of his friends that we are just doing our job.

QOkay, and anything else apart from that?

AAnd he---we have given our passes and also our name to him quite a number of times.

QAlright. And what did he address you as?

AHe addressed us as officers, Ma’am.

QOfficers as well?

AYes, Ma’am.

QOkay. Now from your observation of the accused during this incident, did the accused appear to recognise his friends?

AYes, Ma’am. He can---can recognise his friends.

QWas he addressing---calling them by name?

\---

QNow you said that you’ve been a police officer for 4-plus years?

AYes, correct, Ma’am.

QAlright. Now in your routine patrol, have you seen many incidents of accused persons who are intoxicated?

AYes, Ma’am. I have seen many.

\---

QOkay. So in your 4 years, how many accused persons who are intoxicated have you seen?

AA lot, Ma’am. I---cannot count.

QCan’t count?

AYah.

QNow from your observation of the accused, did he appear to you to be very highly intoxicated?

AHe is intoxicated but highly intoxicated, he’s---he’s not, Ma’am, because I have seen highly intoxicated people during my work---during my shift of work. Basically, they are---they cannot even respond to us and they just lie down, for heavily intoxicated person.

196    When Cpl Muhaimin was asked what was the accused’s level of intoxication that day based on his own experience of dealing with drunkards in the course of his work as a policeman for about 2 years, he replied that it was average:

QNow from your observation of the accused during his whole incident, right, was intoxicated?

AYes, Ma’am.

QWould you be able to describe how intoxicated you had thought he was from your observation of him?

AHmm, not really highly intoxicated because if he’s really---highly intoxicated he might just have like sit down and then just, uh, lie down on the flat ground.

QIn the course of your duty---as a police officer, have you come across intoxicated people before? Intoxicated people?

AUh, yes Ma’am.

QAnd have there been many occasions or just a few occasions?

AMany, many occasions.

QMany, many occasions of intoxicated?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QAnd where he’s concerned, ---what level of intoxication would you think he was at?

AJust average.

QNow during this---the course of this entire incident---this 45 minutes, was he able to communicate with you and Afiq?

AYes, Ma’am.

QWere you all able to understand him?

AYes, Ma’am.

QFor most of the time?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QSo, there are some instances where you couldn’t understand what he was saying?

AYes, Ma’am, correct.

QWas he able to walk unaided during these 45 minutes---

AYes---

QAnd these 45 minutes, was he able to recognise his friends?

AYes, Ma’am.

QWas he calling them by name?

AYes, Ma’am.

QFrom your observation of accused in the manner in which he was interacting with you, would---was he aware that you all were police officers---

AUh, yes.

Qthis entire incident?

AYes, Ma’am.

QYou all were in full uniform on that day, right?

AYes, Ma’am.

QAnd---you were wearing your pass?

ACorrect, Ma’am.

QAnd so was Afiq?

AYes, Ma’am.

Q\---did he look at both your passes on the day before his arrest?

AYes, Ma’am.

QHe did?

AYes, Ma’am.

QDid he address you all as officers at any point of time during these 45 minutes?

AI don’t know.

QYou---you not sure about that?

ANot sure, yah.

QOkay. But did he ask where you all from, which division?

AYes, Ma’am.

QSo you all told him---you told him that you---you’re from Tanglin?

AYes, Ma’am.

QNow before this incident, did you have any dealings, right, any dealings previously, do you know him personally, the accused or any of his friends?

AUh, no, Ma’am.

197    Even during cross-examination, Isabel agreed that from watching the video footage, the accused could be seen at certain points:

(a)     Walking away on his own unaided including walking straight and backwards;

(b)     Communicating with the policemen and speaking coherently;

(c)     Being aware that he was speaking with the policemen;

(d)     Recognising some of the friends around him including Isabel; and

(e)     Asking his friend to go away from him.

198    Liana observed in the video footage that prior to the accused’s arrest, he was even seen walking forward and backwards by himself. After his arrest, the accused was able to recognise his friends and tell them that he would not resist and asked them to go home. He even told the police to allow him to walk to the police car, this indicating to the police that he would co-operate with them.

199    As mentioned earlier, having observed the accused’s behavior captured in the video footage, it would appear that initially, when he first came out of the night club, he could be seen exhibiting symptoms from both the confusion stage and excitement stages.

200    However, as the video progressed, particularly after he had vomited, the accused even exhibited symptoms from the euphoria stage like sociability, talkativeness, increased self-confidence and decreased inhibition.

201    Besides being able to walk unaided by himself, the accused was able to recognize his friends and even determine who he was talking to. He was able to distinguish Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin from his friends. He even told his friends that Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin were policemen. When the accused spoke to Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin, he clearly knew that they were policemen on duty. He was even lucid enough to tell them that he was reporting for reservist on Monday as a policeman. He even remembered where he was arrested.

202    The fact that the accused was seen exhibiting several of the symptoms from the euphoria stage and a few of the symptoms from the excitement stage during the incident was confirmed by Dr Fones in his evidence before the court:

A    So, um, I think, um, impairment of his, um, uh, motor functions and all, I agree, he was mostly intact, he could walk straight, he could coordinate himself. Um, uh, in terms of his recollection, um, yes, I would say largely he is able to recall most of the basic information. Um, the NRIC error, I find to be somewhat surprising. Um, so, it does seem to show some impairment but I---I mean, my point is that the type of, uh, impairment of the mind has much more to do with, uh, if I refer back to our table again, it’s, uh, _very much to do with the category of euphoria, you know, talkativeness, self-confidence, decreased inhibitions, uh, diminished judgement and control, alright. So, I think those are the key impairments of the mind which we are dealing with. Uh, there’s a little bit of the excitement category as well, especially the emotional instability and the loss of critical judgement_. I think that’s quite key in terms of how he, uh, behaves, um, in the video. The other point I like to make is that for each of these categories, it is not a game of you need to have the full house of symptoms. That means, you do not have to have for that---particular category, every single one. Um, you can have some people with more of 1 symptom or even the absence of another symptom or sign. So, these are---and on the point of, um, how long and what duration had elapsed, I think, uh, he is almost 100% would be at least in the 0.12 level, the euphoria level if we are not taking bones on the, uh, whatever he had actually hit as high as 200 milligrams but, uh, he is definitely at least 120 because we even have a blood alcohol concentration much later, uh, which shows 100 plus, 105 or something like that, yah. \[emphasis added\]

203    In essence, from the observations of the accused by the various witnesses as well as his behavior as seen in the video footage at the time of the commotion, I was not persuaded that he was so drunk or intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing and that what he did was wrong. At the beginning, he could have exhibited symptoms from both the “confusion” and “excitement” stage. Gradually, he started to exhibit more symptoms from both the “excitement” and “euphoria” stages, thus suggesting that his alcohol intoxication level was decreasing prior to his arrest.

#### (ii)    Symptoms exhibited by the accused post-arrest

204    The accused’s behavior soon after arrest also confirmed my observation that at the material time, the level of alcohol intoxication was not so high that it would impair or significantly impair the decision-making capability of the accused such as to deter him from having the requisite intention, specific or otherwise, to use criminal force on Sgt Afiq. He had a clear understanding of what was happening around him.

205    When the accused was brought back to the police station lock-up in less than half an hour, he was able to provide his personal particulars with relative ease. Sgt Afiq recalled that the accused was able to provide his date of birth, ask for his handphone as well as the reason for his arrest. He requested for his lawyer to be contacted. When asked how did the accused, whilst intoxicated, differ from heavily intoxicated people he met previously in his course of work, Sgt Afiq said:

QOkay. What did you observe of this particular person in contrast to those type of people?

ASo the accused can walk by himself and he can also speak---reply to our question, also speak in proper sentences. He also provided his name correctly to a few of people---as well.

QAnd his IC as well?

AIC number, he provided the number correctly but then the alphabet, at that point of time he provided, was wrong.

QOkay. And was he able to provide his date of birth?

AYes, he ­provided date of birth to the nurse as well.

QI see. And looking at all of that from your observation, what did you think of his intoxication?

AHe is intoxicated but I believe he’s not heavily intoxicated.

206    During cross-examination, Insp Tan replied that, whilst he was not an expert in alcohol intoxication, based on his 22 years of experience in the police force where he has encountered people with different degrees of intoxication, the accused was aware of what he was doing and able to relate to his surroundings:

ABased on the part that intoxicated comes in a lot of levels. Like, for instance, I have come across people who are intoxicated and totally were sleeping and out of the world, in which ambulance will have to come to convey him. I have---person who have just drink two or three mugs of beer as informed by the passer-by and was actually aware of what he is doing but he’s actually---this is what I was informed. And he’s still able to relate what is happening---

207    When asked at the trial if the accused could be suffering from memory loss at the lock-up as a symptom at the “confusion” stage (based on the Dubowski table) since he had given the alphabet of his NRIC no. wrongly, Dr Yao was of the view that he did not experience much memory loss, if at all:

QFrom the clips, we observed that he was able to give his NRIC number correctly but the alphabet was incorrect, his name correctly, his date of birth correctly. The rest of the information---the clip ended abruptly, right? So memory loss, you were commenting on memory loss based on the clip?

AIt doesn’t appear that he had much of a memory loss.

QSo memory loss that is referred to in this table, the Dubowski Alcohol Table, what does it actually refer to? What kind of memory loss does it refer to?

ATypically at this blood alcohol concentration, there might be people who does not remember what happened, who is he with or where did he just came from. This kind of memory loss.

QOkay. And that would be at that point of time?

AAt that point of time. Yup, right.

QSo we are talking about real time - at the time where he is, let’s say, at the lock-up, et cetera?

AThe table typically represents clinical symptoms at that blood level.

QOkay. So your calculation was actually blood alcohol concentration at the time of the incident which would be at 6.00?

AAround 6.00am.

Q6.00---around 6.00am?

AYes, Your Honour.

QAnd he is at the lock-up at about 6.00-plus, 6.40?

A6.24, Your Honour.

QYes, around there. So his blood concentration level, based on that, you are looking at the symptoms and he doesn’t correlate with those symptoms - he doesn’t seem to have a memory loss, correct?

AHe does not seem to have a memory loss, Your Honour.

QSo if at that point of time his blood alcohol level was 180 to 300, one of the possible symptoms he would have displayed is memory loss?

AYes, Your Honour, but these are symptoms that is typical of a group of people with that kind of blood level. It does not mean that everyone with this blood level would have the same symptom, Your Honour.

208    Even Dr Heng, who examined the accused about an hour after his arrest at the scene, was of the medical opinion that the accused, whilst experiencing alcohol intoxication, was not greatly intoxicated, sleeping or stuporous. The accused had a Glasgow Coma Score of 15, indicating that the accused was alert, conscious and functional. Otherwise, he would have to observe the accused until he became soberer. The symptoms recorded by him of the accused also confirmed his findings. The accused was even able to communicate properly with Dr Heng and the former could be discharged to go home independently without a risk to his own safety.

209    There was no reason for me to dispute the collective observations of the accused by these witnesses after his arrest. What had happened at the lock-up was moreover captured in the video footage.

#### What is alcohol induced amnesia?

210    Both Dr Guo and Dr Fones agreed that, besides exhibiting the symptoms as a manifestation of alcohol intoxication at the material time that day, the accused had experienced alcohol induced amnesia due to alcohol intoxication.

211    Alcohol induced amnesia is typically a form of anterograde amnesia. This causes a person to have memory loss of events or “blackouts” which occurred during the period of intoxication. According to the Collins English Dictionary, anterograde amnesia means:

Amnesia caused by brain damage in which the memory loss relates to events occurring after the damage.

212    This means that a person may loss his memory for the things he did or the events which occurred during the period of intoxication. The memory loss during this period is commonly called a “blackout”.

213    The decision making capability of a person is not removed by the alcohol even during alcohol-induced amnesia. The person may have forgotten what he did earlier the following day but at that point in time, he or she may still have the ability to know what he was doing and determine what is right or wrong. The alcohol merely increases the risk taking ability of a person.

214    In his evidence before the Court, Dr Guo explained that when the accused was experiencing alcohol intoxication, the alcohol had the effect of affecting the inhibition and judgment of the accused. Whilst the accused should know what was right or wrong, the alcohol enhanced his risk taking ability or his intention to do so. The more alcohol one consumes, the lesser is one’s inhibition or greater the impairment in one’s judgment:

QRight. And his perception, that, “Should I do this? Should I not do this?” Right. That means to say, we all have to make decisions like this all the time. “Should I do this? Should I use a vulgarity on you? Should I not use a vulgarity or” ---do you agree that that inhibition of refraining from using certain---conducting himself in a certain way, has been removed?

ANot really removed, it’s affected---

QHe’s affected, yes?

A\---by the alcohol. The judgement is affected.

QI---oh, I see. The judgement is affected to what extent, Dr Guo?

AIt’s depends.

QWell, we---I’m dealing with a specific subject here.

AIt is affected, significantly affected.

QSignificantly, right? And that, that significant impairment, I use the word “impairment”, right, it’s the same thing, impairment of his judgement, right. That significant affect---impairment is available---impairment of his judgement, would it go to the extent of impairing his ability to decide, “This is right. This is wrong”?

AHe should know what is right, what is wrong. But the only thing is that the---he---it---they---the---the intention to take the---to take the risk is much higher.

QI see. Risk taking ability?

AYes.

QRight. And that is also due to the fact that inhibition has been removed?

AAffected, not really removed. Affected.

QRight. So I’m trying to understand, what is the difference between taking a risk and having his judgement affected? No---is there a difference?

AIt’s the same. Same thing.

QIt’s the same, right? So if his judgement is affected, therefore he was able to take risk.

AYes.

QHow is that translated to the ability to know the difference between right thing to do, wrong thing to do?

AYah, he may---he---he might know the---whether it’s right or wrong, but the issue is that he become---so brave that---that under the influence of alcohol that he---he may just take a risk to do it.

QWhich is not rational?

ANot, yes.

QRight. And which is not something he would have done if he’s sober?

AYah, the person won’t---won’t be doing that---if sober.

QNow, would you be able to scale it up to say that if the more alcohol he had consumed, the higher is his ability to---the more it will affect his judgement? That means to say---

AYes.

Q\---in that scale.

AYes.

215    As agreed by Dr Fones said, a person who is intoxicated by alcohol may become less inhibited by the alcohol and may be more willing to do something that he would ordinarily not have done because of the effects of alcohol.

216    At the same time, due to the alcohol induced amnesia, the accused might have forgotten what he did during the incident after the event when he becomes sober again. The fact that there was a memory loss after the event however did not mean that the person did not know what he was doing or what he was doing at that time when he did what he did was wrong. Such memory loss is anterograde in nature.

217    As elaborated by Dr Fones in his evidence before the court, when the term “blackout” is used in respect of a person, it is not used to describe him or her to be in a state of unconsciousness but that his recollection of the events was patchy due to memory loss as a result of alcohol induced amnesia.

218    This is because blackouts are periods of anterograde amnesia or memory loss for events that had transpired while an individual was consuming alcohol as the alcohol impedes the person from forming new memories during this period of intoxication. In other words, a person may have done something during his state of alcohol intoxication but could not remember doing so.

219    Dr Fones produced a medical literature, _Alcoholic “blackouts”: a review and clinical study of 100 alcoholics_ by Goodwin DQ, Crane JB, Guze SB, _Am J Psychiatry, 1969 Aug; 126(2):191-8_ (D4), to explain how consuming large quantities of alcohol, especially if consumed rapidly and on an empty stomach can cause partial (i.e. fragmentary) or complete (i.e. en bloc) blackouts. Unlike en bloc blackouts, fragmentary blackouts involve partial blocking of memory formation for events that had transpired whilst the person was intoxicated. People who experienced fragmentary blackouts often even became aware they were missing fragments of events after being prompted of the events had occurred.

220    In other words, whilst the accused here might not have remembered he was arrest by police officers that day for being rowdy and a nuisance after leaving Club Aura, that prompted him to recall in his scattered memory that he was surrounded by his friends and frustrated with them, wandering about in his unsteady gait and vomiting after getting out of his girlfriend’s car. A loss of memory does not equate to a lack of intention.

#### Impact of alcohol induced amnesia on the accused

221    As the recollection or self-reporting of the incident on that fateful day requires both cooperation and honesty on the part of the accused, the impact of alcohol induced amnesia on him would involve some form of subjectivity. Whilst I can accept that a person’s memory of an event will fade with time, the court must be very circumspect when reviewing the evidence in determining how the alcohol induced amnesia has affected the accused’s state of mind at the material time.

222    As rightly pointed out by Dr Guo, initially, he could only conclude that the accused was suffering from complete (or en bloc) alcohol inducted amnesia instead of partial based solely on the self-reporting of the incident by the accused to him. This was because when Dr Guo interviewed the accused, the accused said he could not remember anything else about the incident other than someone vaguely hitting him on the head.

223    Yet, when he was shown a copy of the accused’s statement recorded at 3pm on the same day of the incident as well as the accused’s account to Dr Fones of the incident as recorded by Dr Fones in his medical report of the accused when Dr Fones saw him about 4 months after the incident, Dr Guo was of the view that they were not accurate or consistent with the account which the accused had given to him as they contained more information of the incident from the accused.

224    In the circumstances, Dr Guo could not exclude the possibility that the accused was suffering from a partial or fragmentary blackout at the material time. In fact, Dr Guo highlighted that the accuracy in details from the accused’s memory during the blackout period, unlike the retained memory pre and post-amnesia, should not deteriorate through time.

225    When asked if it was reliable to rely on the accused’s statement when his BAC level was 104mg/100ml during the time it was recorded, as it was suggested by Defence counsel during cross-examination that the accused was still under the influence of alcohol at that time, Dr Guo was of the view that the accused was already fine and sober when he gave his statement to the police based on the video footage of the accused when he was in the police station and the answers given by him to the police. Besides, two different peoples with the same BAC level may have different recovery rate depending on the alcohol tolerance level of an individual.

226    There was no reason for me to give little weight to the statement of the accused as suggested by the Defence since the accused himself did not dispute the content of his statement recorded or his voluntariness in giving his statement that day. While he could still have been under the influence of alcohol at that material time, he was already sober.

227    Moreover, Dr Fones confirmed in evidence that based on his interview with the accused on 1 July 2016, the accused was fully aware of what he was doing when his statement was recorded by the police at 3pm on 12 March 2016. This was because the accused had already “woken up” from his alcohol-induced amnesia and his last complete memory or recollection of the events that day was when he was at the police lock-up at around noon.

228    On the other hand, I accepted the accused’s explanation that he was not being uncooperative as to his recollection of what he could remember that day outside the blackout period when he saw Dr Guo. As per his evidence before the court, his retention ability of the events that day could be lesser when he saw Dr Fones as compared to the day he gave his statement to the police. This would likely to be even lesser when he saw Dr Guo after he saw Dr Fones a few months later.

229    I further accepted that when he saw Dr Fones on 1 July 2016 and Dr Guo on 24 October 2016 and 8 November 2016 respectively, he had informed both doctors what he could remember and what his friends had informed him. However, this might not have been very clear when he answered questions from the doctors depending on the manner in which the questions were asked. Besides, what had been stated in the medical reports of the respective doctors were based on a summary of events he had informed them as well as the documents and information that were provided to them either by his previous lawyer or the police prior to the medical appointments.

230    Having said that, both Dr Guo and Dr Fones had considered the evidence, both objective and subjective, before them on the accused. They have separately interviewed the accused. In a nutshell, I accepted the medical opinion of both Dr Guo and Dr Fones that the accused was likely to be suffering from both fragmentary and at certain points, en bloc amnesia, during the incident. This was consistent with not only the BAC level but also the clinical symptoms and behaviour which the accused had exhibited at the material time.

231    The medical evidence was consistent with what the accused could remember about the incident that day. For example, the accused remembered leaving Club Aura with his friends and thereafter he had a quarrel with his friend, Chris. At one point, he remembered waking up next to the side of the road near a bus stop with his face on the ground because he had lost his balance and fallen.

232    Additionally, the accused admitted that with the aid of the video footage, he could remember the following that day:

(a)     The presence of his friends around him like Jeremy, Chris, Isable and Melvin;

(b)     He knew that Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin were policemen in their uniforms when he spoke to them throughout the entire incident;

(c)     He had approached Sgt Afiq;

(d)     When he spoke to Sgt Afiq, the accused was coherent and he was able to inform the latter of the fact that he was going to report for reservist with the police force on the coming Monday;

(e)     He negotiated with the police to let him walk into the police car after his arrest;

(f)     He was able to check around for his handphone; and

(g)     He recognised his friends after his arrest and told them to go back as he would comply with the police.

233    A pertinent point to note is that even though he could not remember the names of Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin, the fact that he had repeatedly asked for their names that night suggested to me that he could at the very least remember and knew that he was talking to policemen and they were not his friends. During re-examination, he was asked:

Q\---Now, you explain to the Court, Mr. Wu, looking at all these sequences that I have just identified, why do you think, you on that day or that night, were asking repeatedly for their identity?

AWhat I can think of would be I actually forgot, uh, the names or forgot even talking to the police officers moments ago. 2nd would be I would---I probably thought that at each time I was speaking to the policemen, they were different pair of policemen that I was talking to.

QOkay. So your explanation is twofold, one is that they told you, you forgot. That means no retention. The 2nd one is that you don’t recognise them because each time you talk to them you thought it were---different people---

AThat’s right, Sir. ---

234    Evidently, the accused knew how to react differently when he was talking to his friends or girlfriend. When he spoke to the policemen, he knew that they were not his friends. Even the manner in which he spoke to the policemen was different from his friends. As such, he asked for the policemen for their names. He did so repeatedly because he kept forgetting their names or having spoken to them earlier. He even told his friends that Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin were policemen. At that point in time, alcohol induced amnesia might have caused him to forget their names but not who he spoke to. He could differentiate the policemen from his friends.

#### Did the accused know what he was doing that day?

235    Having accepted that the accused was experiencing fragmentary alcohol induced amnesia (and at some points en bloc amnesia) at the time of the incident, could it really be said that the accused was so intoxicated that he could not have formed the intention of committing the offence by using criminal force against Sgt Afiq that day?

236    Does the fact that when one forgets necessarily correlates to the lack of intention to do something? The answer must be no.

237    In court, Dr Guo gave his expert opinion that the accused knew what he was doing at the time of the accident and that what he was doing was wrong. This is because a person still retains the capability of making decisions and know what is happening to him during a “blackout”:

AYes, I think so.

QIs that your expert opinion? That he knew---what he was doing---and what he was doing was wrong?

AYes. So actually that the---during the blackout, it’s just the---it’s just problems with the memory recording. So during the blackout, that the person that can function well, although it’s under the influence of alcohol. So usually the person still keep the---during the blackout, still keep the capability of making decision and it---it---you know, that---and---and the---and knowing what is happening to him.

QSo even if, prosecution is not saying he’s suffering from it, but even if he had an alcohol-induced amnesia or blackout, during that period of time, he would still be aware of what he was doing and what he was doing was wrong, is that correct?

AYah. But it’s the---the---the time is the---the behaviour is the---and the thought is under the influence of alcohol.

QYes. But he was aware---he would be aware of what he’ll be doing?

AYes. Should be.

QAnd he’ll be aware that what he’s doing is wrong?

AShould be.

QShould be. And that’s your opinion?

AYeah.

QAlright. ---

ASorry, because all the literature---

QYes.

A\---have indicated that the---when the person is in a blackout, the person still can function well.

QOkay.

AAnd the---have the capability to make a decision.

QTo make a decision?

AYah.

QAnd to be aware of what is right and what is wrong?

AWhat is a---what---what is happening around him---

QYes.

A\---and the---but the only problem is that the---the person cannot remember---

QI see. So it’s just the---

A\---after that.

Q\---memory loss---

AJust---

Q\---but at that point of time, he is functioning---

AYes.

Q\---and aware of what he’s doing?

ARight.

238    In summary, Dr Guo was of the view that even if the accused was actually suffering from alcohol induced amnesia or blackout (whether en bloc or fragmentary) at the material point in time during the incident, he would still know what he was doing at that point in time even though he might not be able remember what he had done after he recovered from the alcohol intoxication due to the memory loss.

239    During cross-examination, when asked to clarify further, Dr Guo replied that the objective evidence shown to him confirmed that the accused was experiencing alcohol intoxication at the material time of the incident. Based on the accused’s behaviour at the time of the incident, the accused had exhibited symptoms mainly in the stages of alcohol influence at “excitement” and confusion”. However, whether the accused was suffering from a complete or partial blackout or memory loss at that time would depend quite a fair bit on the subjective self-reporting of the accused.

240    When asked by Defence counsel whether Dr Guo thought the accused knew what he was doing at the material time, Dr Guo answered positively:

AYah, he should have known---

QRight.

A\---what he’s doing. Yes.

QAnd what motivated him to do what he was doing, was it due to the alcohol that it---was in him?

APartly, yes.

241    Dr Fones too, when asked by the Court, agreed that the accused would be aware of what he was doing for certain things and events even if he was having a fragmented amnesia at the material time such that might not have remembered thereafter:

242    When asked to elaborate further, Dr Fones explained that at certain points in time, in terms of his interaction with the police officers, the accused did not know what he was doing. Due to his disinhibition, at least at some of the time, the accused did not know what he was doing was wrong.

Witness:This one had to do with---even in front of his friends who were trying to restrain him, he was actually very belligerent as well. So I think that just speaks to his lack of inhibition. Perhaps, it’s not for me to comment on the legal concept of mens rea. Lawyers sometimes ask me not to but I think put it simply, did he know what he was doing and did he know what he was doing was wrong? I would say that he---at certain points in time, in terms of in his---his interactions with the police officers, he did not know what he was doing. Did he know what he was doing was wrong? Uh, because of his disinhibition, I would say that at least some of the time, he didn’t know that he was wrong. Yah.

243    Put it in another way, despite his disinhibition, at other points in time the accused did know what he was doing and he did know what he was doing was wrong. The alcohol merely increased his self-confidence to do things that he might not have ordinarily done or thought twice about doing before doing so.

### Being drunk – Should this be a reasonable excuse for one’s actions?

244    I must emphasize that it is easy to use the act of getting and being drunk as a reason or an excuse for one’s actions. This is especially if one regrets them after the event when the alcohol is completely out of the system. The inability to remember what one has done after the incident when one becomes sober again cannot be a reasonable excuse. A loss in memory after the event does not correlate to a person not knowing or not knowing what he was doing was wrong when he committed the acts during his state of alcohol intoxication.

245    Herein lies the cautionary note. The act of intoxication is usually always voluntary unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise. Once a person accepts that he or she has voluntarily gotten himself or herself into that state, he or she should not be expected to be pardoned or excused of any acts done during that state but accept responsibility. After all, it is his or her own fault for being in that state.

246    In other words, it is his or her own responsibility for ensuring that one does not get to the point of intoxication such that he or she commits or is capable of committing an offence. Otherwise, this will create a slippery slope as others may take advantage of the situation by intentionally plying oneself with alcohol before committing an offence in the belief that this excuse will exonerate the person of any wrongdoing. Even if there was initially no intention of committing an offence, a person may become more emboldened and less inhibited after having consumed alcohol. Worse, one may say “I could not remember doing it hence I had no intention of doing so”. Such behavior should not and cannot be condoned.

247    As such, the courts must view the evidence of a case with great circumspect when a defence of intoxication is raised. The threshold for proving that there was a reasonable excuse, albeit on a balance of probabilities, must still be high. On the balance, having considered carefully all the evidence as a whole, I did not believe the accused had a reasonable excuse for doing what he did that day. The objective evidence of the accused’s actions as captured from the body worn camera as well as the evidence of the witnesses adduced at the trial did not support the accused’s position that he did not know what he was doing that day.

248    The accused, as a reservist policeman, knew or ought to have known what he could or could not do to cross the line. Yet, he was, as described by Dr Fones, “belligerent”, and he allowed the alcohol in him to take control of his better judgment despite repeated persuasion from his friends and warning from the two police officers.

## VERDICT

249    All things considered, having done a detailed analysis of the evidence, I was of the view that overwhelming evidence had been adduced by the prosecution to prove its case in respect of the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

250    On the contrary, I found the accused’s defence of reasonable excuse was not made out on the evidence. Accordingly, I had no alternative but convicted the accused and found him guilty as charged.

## SENTENCE

### Antecedents

251    The accused was untraced.

### Restitution

252    There was no need for restitution as there were no observable injuries suffered by Sgt Afiq as a result of the incident.

### Prosecution’s submission on sentence

253    As the accused did not appeal against the sentences for the 2nd and 3rd charges, I shall not delve further into them. Both the Prosecution and Defence were in general agreement that a sentence of a fine should be imposed for them and essentially left the quantum of the fines to the court. Based on the authorities tendered, Prosecution suggested a fine range of $1,500 to $3,000 per charge whilst the Defence submitted a fine of $2,000 per charge.

254    In respect of the 1st charge, the Prosecution sought for a sentence of six week’s imprisonment.

255    This was because the accused had claimed trial for the said charge. Given his lack of remorse, no sentencing discount should be given to the accused. Furthermore, the 5th charge, which was TIC for the purpose of sentencing, also involved a s353 charge over a separate incident in 2015 committed by the accused. Originally, the accused was given a conditional warning for the 4th and 5th charges but the Prosecution had decided to proceed with them after the 2nd set of offences for the first three charges.

256    In support of its sentencing position, Prosecution submitted a table of sentencing precedents involving offenders with a s353 charge. They are primarily PG cases, with some offenders having previously clean records and the victims suffered no or minor injuries:

As the accused approached the complainant, he pushed the complainant forcefully on his shoulders in an attempt to evade arrest, causing the latter to fall to the ground.

257    Based on the table of sentencing precedents for a s353 PC offence, Prosecution submitted that the starting point for an untraced accused who has pleaded guilty to the offence and the victim did not sustain any apparent injury from the criminal force used is a custodial sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment. For this, Prosecution referred me to the cases of _Sasitharan_ (case no. 1), _Suresh_ (case no. 2) and _Balrin_ (case no. 4 where accused had no similar antecedents). Notably, majority of the accused in the cases cited by the Prosecution received a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the s353 PC charge upon pleading guilty.

258    Since the accused here had claimed trial instead of pleaded guilty, Prosecution was of the view that the accused was unremorseful and did not deserve to be given a PG discount. As such, it felt that an uplift of the sentence to 6 weeks’ imprisonment was justified. The only case cited in the sentencing table where the accused had claimed trial was a very old case of _Goh Ang Huat_ (case no. 16). There, the accused was imposed a 4 weeks’ imprisonment after conviction.

259    There were only two other cases where the accused had received a term of less than 4 weeks’ imprisonment. In _Renesh_ (case no. 6), the accused, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to two charges. He was given a 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the s353 PC charge and 1 week’s imprisonment for the s6 POHA charge. In _Sithambaran_ (case no. 3), the accused, who was traced for a s20 of the MO(PON)A charge, was similarly sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the s353 PC charge with the s20 MO(PON)A charge being TIC.

260    Prosecution highlighted that unlike the 2 accused who had received a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment, the accused had not only claimed trial, he was facing a total of 5 charges. 3 charges were proceeded against him with 2 from an earlier unrelated incident being TIC. Of the 2 TIC charges, 1 was also a s353 PC charge. Moreover, the learned Prosecutor submitted that alcohol intoxication was not a mitigating but aggravating factor in the circumstances. There were also no personal circumstances resulting in the accused’s behaviour. Hence, Prosecution was of the view that am uplift from the usual PG benchmark position to 6 weeks’ imprisonment is fair.

### Mitigation

261    At the time of sentencing, the accused was 27 years old and a first offender. Since the incident in March 2016, the Defence highlighted that the accused had cooperated with the authorities in their investigations at all times. It has been almost three years and the entire matter has taken a toll on him. In that sense, the criminal process was, in itself, a punishment for the accused: Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2005) at p 79.

262    As such, the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that no sentencing discount should be accorded to the accused because the accused had claimed trial instead of pleading guilty at the first available opportunity. Each case should be dealt with on the facts.

263    Furthermore, the accused had a justification to claim trial. He was severely inebriated prior to the incident. Hence, his memory of the incident was patchy at best. If he had chosen to plead guilty to the 1st charge, he would not be able to admit to the Statement of Facts without qualification as he could not remember any or many of the facts. A trial would need to result in any event. At the trial, the court was aided by the video recording of the incident. To his credit, having heard his own voice from the video recording, he took a responsible and honest position by pleading guilty to the 2nd and 3rd charges.

264    In terms of the accused’s personal background, he has a very supportive family behind him. He is currently engaged and preparing to get married. His future in-laws are similarly supportive of him. He was a former mortgage officer in a bank. Due to the present case, he made a full and frank disclosure to his former employer at that time and chose to resign from his job. As a first consequence of his actions, he will be unable to work in the banking industry again. The accused felt ashamed and disappointed, particularly towards his family, fiancée and friends.

265    Since then, the accused has furthered his studies and has been trying to study and obtain the relevant qualifications so as to be registered with the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) and be a property agent. He is trying his best to have a good career for himself and his family. At the time of the trial, the accused was an interior designer.

266    Coming to the sentencing position, the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution that the starting point for the s353 PC offence is a custodial sentence. This was because the courts have previously imposed fines on accused persons for the same offence.

267    In _PP v Liang Wayne (unreported) (“Wayne”)_, the accused was attending a music festival when he had pushed a plain clothes police officer off a ledge. After being informed by the officer that he was a public servant, the accused continued to stomp on the foot of the police officer in spite of having been shown the officer’s warrant card. In a Straits Times report dated 4 January 2018, the accused was reported to have replied “so what” after being shown the warrant card and proceeded to stomp on the foot of the police officer while intoxicated. The District Court sentenced the accused to a fine of $10,000.

268    In another case of _PP v Quek Keng Siang Billy_ , the accused was charged for a s353 PC offence as well a s13D(1)(a) offence under the MO(PON)A. In respect of the s353 charge, the accused was found to have spitted on the victim while escorting the accused in the execution of his duty as a public servant. A fine of $5,000 was imposed on the accused for that charge by the District Court.

269    Even when the custodial threshold has been crossed, the Defence argued that the sentence sought for by the Prosecution was manifestly excessive.

270    In the unreported decision of _PP v Zhao Xiaotian_ (“_Zhao_”), the accused, a former Mediacorp producer, was intoxicated and had been swimming topless in a swimming pool when police officers arrived. According to newspaper report from AsiaOne dated 20 April 2016, when officers arrived at the scene to intervene, the accused hurled vulgarities at them and slapped one of the officers on the face. After being arrested, the accused continued to struggle and spat in the face of another police officer twice. The accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment by the District Court.

271    In _Sathanandam s/o Sithambaran_ cited by the Prosecution in their sentencing precedents table, the accused, who had prior related antecedents for disorderly behaviour in 2012, was intoxicated and had pushed a public servant twice, once on the shoulder and once on the chest in the course of attempting to leave the scene after backup police officers had been called. The accused was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment by the District Court and affirmed by the High Court on appeal.

272    Therefore, the Defence urged the court to consider a very hefty fine of $10,000 on the accused for the 1st charge. Alternatively, if the court was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed, the Defence submitted that an imprisonment sentence of 2 weeks would be the appropriate sentence that would be fair and just given the circumstances.

273    The Defence reiterated its position that both the harm caused to the victim was slight as well as the culpability of the accused for the present incident was low. Sgt Afiq effectively suffered no injury. Whilst the accused readily admitted that his actions had caused annoyance to the public, as he was suffering from a state of severe alcohol intoxication in the region of about 250ml/100mg of blood at the material time, this should not be considered as an aggravating but neutral factor against him. In fact, given that the accused was at Orchard Road in the wee hours of the morning, where there were many partygoers who were presumably intoxicated as well, the accused’s conduct should be less culpable and more forgivable.

274    Finally, the Defence sought to persuade the court that there was no clear or immediate danger posed by the accused prior to the arrest. In fact, the accused was already planning to go home when he walked to the bus stop. The arrest of the accused by Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin was motivated by the initial interaction between the accused and Cpl Muhaimin, where the latter had behaved aggressively towards the accused as he thought that he was being verbally abused by the accused.

### Reply by the Prosecution

275    In response to the mitigation, Prosecution disagreed that the accused’s state of alcohol intoxication was not even a neutral factor but an aggravating factor. The fact that he was in that state was self-imposed.

276    Secondly, the cases where fines were imposed could be distinguished given the recent rising trend that police officers were assaulted while discharging their duties as public servants. As such, there is a need for a greater general deterrent sentence being imposed to deter like-minded citizens from committing such an offence. _Quek King Siang_ was an old case decided in 2014.

277    As for Wayne, the case could be distinguished on its facts as the victim was a plainclothes police officer. Here, Sgt Afiq was in plain view in his uniform and the accused even acknowledged the fact that he knew Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin were police officers when he first spoke to them. On the facts, Prosecution was of the position that the custodial threshold had clearly been crossed.

278    Lastly, the cases cited by the Defence were PG cases where the accused had pleaded guilty instead of claiming trial, unlike the accused. Thus, the accused could not expect a custodial sentence at the lower end of the spectrum to be imposed on him.

### Reasons for sentence

279    In coming to my decision on the appropriate individual sentence to be imposed for each charge, I have considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each sentence. Generally, whilst one may be sympathetic, I did not find the personal and family circumstances of the accused to be of significant mitigating value in the circumstances.

280    As stated earlier, since both the Prosecution and Defence were in general agreement that fines should be imposed including the usual range of fines to be imposed on the accused, I ordered a fine of $2,500 in default 10 days’ imprisonment for the s6(1)(a) POHA charge and a fine of $1,500 in default 6 days’ imprisonments for the s20 MO(PON)A.

281    I now come to the s353 PC charge. I agreed with both parties that the harm caused to the victim, Sgt Afiq, was slight as he was effectively not injured.

282    As for the culpability, I would first agree with the Prosecution that the accused’s state of alcohol intoxication at the material time of the offence could not be considered as a neutral factor but an aggravating factor. This is because the accused had voluntarily chosen to consume alcohol to the state of intoxication he was in. He could blame nobody but himself. Consequently, he should not be allowed to hide behind his cloak of bad behaviour to vindicate his ensuing reprehensible actions or worse, to be used as an excuse for them.

283    An analogy to this will be drink driving causing an accident. In such a case, the accused cannot say that his level of alcohol intoxication is a neutral factor as but for his level of alcohol intoxication, he would not have caused the accident and it was a one-off aberration. Another example will be causing hurt to someone in a public place. If the accused drinks in a public place like a pub or night club, it is anticipated that he may hit or injure someone if he is unable to control his behaviour due to alcohol intoxication.

284    Next, I was unable to agree with the Defence that the culpability of the accused’s action was low because it had occurred in the wee hours of the morning in Orchard Road and along an area where there were or it was expected that there would be like-minded party goers who might be equally drunk. On the contrary, it was precisely because that area of Orchard Road is reputed to have many night clubs and drinking spots that police officers like Sgt Afiq and Cpl Muhaimin were tasked to patrol that area during those hours in the morning as part of crowd control. Otherwise, drunkards may potentially create chaos and disrupt the public peace along our famous shopping belt.

285    It was exactly because the police were dedicated to deal with unruly behaviour of partygoers after having partied or drank the entire night that general deterrence is necessary here in my view. This is primarily to ensure that people do not readily use alcohol intoxication as an excuse to behave badly or worse, abuse the very public servants who are endeavouring to maintain public peace and order.

286    Accordingly, I was unable to agree with the Defence that the accused’s culpability was low but medium in the circumstances. From the entire duration of the video, it was evident that the police officers on duty gave him several warning not to create or cause trouble but to no avail. They urged him to go home with his friends but he refused. He refused to listen to his friends even though his girlfriend was already waiting to drive him home. Even his girlfriend was upset with him. The entire period of bad behaviour was clearly not for a short duration.

287    Following from there, I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold has been crossed.

288    The cases cited by the Defence where fines had been imposed can be distinguished on the facts besides the fact that they were PG cases. In _Wayne_, the victim was a plainclothes policeman and not a policeman on duty in full uniform. In _Quek Keng Siang Billy_, the transgression committed was a singular and brief spitting incident and did not involve any physical assault like pushing.

289    As regards the duration of the custodial sentence, I would agree with the Prosecution that based on the authorities submitted, the starting point is a 3 to 4 weeks’ imprisonment term for an accused who has pleaded guilty and is generally untraced or did not have any relevant antecedents. Since the accused had claimed trial, I agreed that an uplift from the usual benchmark sentence was necessary as time and resources have been utilized when an accused decides to claim trial. It further indicated that he was unremorseful for his actions.

290    The PG case of _Zhao Xiaotian_ cited by the Defence can thus be distinguished. Moreover, the accused was faced with more charges, including proceeded charges, than the accused in _Zhao Xiaotian_.

291    I disagreed with the Defence that the accused had no alternatives but to claim trial because due to his alcohol intoxication, he would not have been able to admit to the Statement of Facts without qualification since his memory of the events would be patchy. Once again, this was the accused using his state of alcohol intoxication or even alcoholic amnesia to excuse himself for his actions.

292    In my view, whilst I can understand that it would be easier to plead guilty to an offence where the potential consequences are less draconian, it would be difficult for him to vacillate in his position. On one hand, he said he had to claim trial to the 1st charge because he did not or could not have known what he was doing when he used criminal force on Sgt Afiq, due to alcohol intoxication. Yet, on the other hand, he knew what he was doing when he was behaving in a disorderly manner or using vulgarities at the police officers during the same incident.

293    Prior to the commencement of the trial, the video recording of the entire incident was shown to the accused. If he could have pleaded guilty to the 2nd and 3rd charges after watching the video recording, I am unable to comprehend his reasoning for not being able to plead guilty to the 1st charge if he was genuinely remorseful for his actions.

294    On the other hand, I was of the view that the sentence sought for by the Prosecution was high despite the accused having claimed trial. Even if I took into account the TIC charges, the uplift should not be that significant.

295    Having duly considered the circumstances as a whole and the mitigation made by the defence, including the fact that the accused was untraced, I reduced the sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution somewhat. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to 1 month’s imprisonment in respect of the 1st charge. All in all, given the number of charges involved and the need for a general deterrent effect, I do not believe that the sentence meted out was unduly unfair or manifestly excessive.

## CONCLUSION

296    To summarise, as aforementioned, the accused was convicted at trial and sentenced accordingly:
