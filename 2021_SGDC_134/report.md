4       The global sentence was 9 years' imprisonment (backdated to 1 October 2019), 13 strokes of the cane and fine of $5,200, in default 3 weeks' 6 days' imprisonment. He was also ordered to be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from the date of release.

5       No appeal against sentence was filed by the accused within the statutory period (by 24 December 2019).

## Criminal Motion for extension of time to file Notice of Appeal

6       On 28 April 2021, the accused filed a criminal motion in HC/CM 46/2021 for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal against sentence within 14 days of the order being made. In his affidavit in support of the criminal motion, the accused sought to backdate his sentence to an earlier period of remand before he was granted bail which was revoked on 1 October 2019.

7       On 13 July 2021, the High Court allowed the accused’s criminal motion and the accused filed his Notice of Appeal against sentence and the disqualification orders on 14 July 2021.

8       The _sole ground_ for accused’s criminal motion to file an appeal out of time was to seek a further backdating of his sentence and he did not state in his affidavit in support of the criminal motion that the sentences and orders were manifestly excessive. Nonetheless, for completeness I set out the reasons for my sentence.

## Statement of Facts

9       The accused admitted to the following facts without qualification.

10     On 20 March 2018, at about 5.25 am, Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers were informed that the accused would be collecting a drug consignment from one Gunaselan Tamilsilvam (“Guna”) at the vicinity of Jalan Haji Alias and Coronation Road West, Singapore. CNB officers were thus deployed at Jalan Haji Alias. At about 7.55 am, the accused was spotted riding a motorcycle (bearing registration number FBD3480C) along Jalan Haji Alias towards Coronation Road West. Guna was also spotted riding a motorcycle (bearing registration number JSH6457) at Duchess Avenue. Shortly thereafter, CNB officers spotted both motorcycles turning out from Fifth Avenue.

11     One party of CNB officers followed the accused’s motorcycle. At along Benoi Road to Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, the accused’s motorcycle went against the flow of traffic. At the Pioneer Flyover roundabout, CNB officers lost sight of the accused’s motorcycle.

12     At the traffic junction of Pioneer North Road and Kian Teck Way, CNB officers spotted an injured member of public at the roadside. There were four flattened black taped bundles at the middle of the traffic junction. CNB officers attended to the injured member of public and retrieved the four bundles.

13     CNB officers continued to search the area for the accused. The accused’s motorcycle was found parked at the carpark of Blk 729 Jurong West. The accused was later spotted riding a bicycle travelling along Jurong West to Pioneer Family Healthcare Centre @ Pioneer Polyclinic. On 20 March 2018 at about 8.50 am, at the lift lobby of Pioneer Polyclinic at 26 Jurong West Street 61, the accused was arrested by CNB officers on suspicion of committing drug offences under the MDA. Nothing incriminating was found on the accused at the time of his arrest.

## Defence’s submissions on sentence

62     Defence counsel highlighted that the accused was married. His wife was 25 years old and was working as a retail assistant. They have 2 boys aged 4 years and 2 months and I year and 2 months old respectively. His father was 53 years and was a prime mover with PSA. His mother was 56 years old and a housewife. He has one elder brother and 3 younger brothers. Before his arrest, he was a delivery driver. The accused was staying with his wife's parents in a 5 room HDB flat in Jurong West.

63     In mitigation, defence counsel emphasised that his client had pleaded guilty as an expression of his remorse for his actions and for avoiding a trial thereby saving the court and the prosecution time and resources. He had been fully co-operative with the authorities in the course of investigations.

64     Defence counsel submitted for a sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment for the trafficking in diamorphine charge (1st charge) as that was within the range of 8-9 years’ imprisonment contemplated in _Vasentha_ and agreed with the 1 year’s imprisonment for the possession charge (13th charge) as the accused had other TIC charges for possession of drugs. He did not disagree with the fines sought for the road traffic offences. Defence counsel also asked to backdate the accused’s sentence to the date of his remand on 1 October 2019.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### Drug offences

65     For the trafficking in diamorphine charge (1st charge), in _Vasentha_ the High Court set out the indicative stating points for first time offenders trafficking in diamorphine based on the quantity of diamorphine as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="22.96%"> <col width="36.6%"> <col width="40.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Quantity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Imprisonment</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Caning</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 3g</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5−6 years</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5−6 strokes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3−5g</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6−7 years</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6−7 strokes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5−7g</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7−8 years</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7−8 strokes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>7−8g</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>8−9 years</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>8−9 strokes</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8−9g</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10−13 years</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9−10 strokes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9−9.99g</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13−15 years</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10−11 strokes</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

\[emphasis added\]

66     As the amount trafficked in this case was 7.47g of diamorphine, the indicative starting point would be between 8 to 9 years imprisonment and 8 to 9 strokes of the cane. Given that the 7.47g diamorphine would be near the mid point of the range, the initial starting point would be 8 ½ years imprisonment and 8 to 9 strokes of the cane.

67     In terms of culpability, the accused had admitted that the diamorphine were meant to be sold to two customers for $5,900. That said, there was no evidence that the accused was part of an organised drug trade on a commercial scale. As for aggravating factors, the accused had several TIC charges for trafficking (8th, 9th 10th and 12th charges). As for mitigating factors, he had cooperated with the authorities and had pleaded guilty to a number of drug related offences thus saving time and costs in the administration of justice. In the round, I was of the view that the starting point of 8 ½ years imprisonment merited a net downwards adjustment to 8 years imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane.

68     Both sides were _ad idem_ on the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for the MDMA trafficking charge (11th charge) and 3 years’ imprisonment for the enhanced consumption charge (26th charge).

69     As for the possession charge (13th charge), from the Sentencing Information Repository and Research Repository (“SIRR”) the range of sentences passed for Sec 8(a) MDA possession offences under the MDA are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="22.42%"> <col width="24.3%"> <col width="28.04%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mean</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Median</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25th Percentile</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">75th Percentile</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">75.6 weeks</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>51.4 weeks</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">34.3 weeks</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">102.9 weeks</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

70     I noted that the accused had another possession charge (14th charge) involving another drug type, namely cannabis mixture, which was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The defence also did not disagree with the prosecution’s submission in his regard. As such, I imposed a sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment which was close to the median sentence 51.4 weeks’ imprisonment for such offences.

### Road Traffic offences

71     The road traffic offences proceeded on were all committed on 20 March 2018. The accused had collided into the victim cyclist by failing to conform to the traffic light signal which was red resulting in the victim sustaining injuries with 4 days of outpatient medical leave. After the collision, the accused continued to ride his motorcycle and did not render assistance to the victim who was injured. At that time, the accused did not possess valid Class 2A driving license nor was there a valid insurance policy for the motorcycle ridden by the accused.

72     Having regard to the culpability of the accused and the harm caused, I broadly agreed with the prosecution’s submission on sentence for these road traffic offences and the defence did not make a contrary submission against the specific sentences sought by the prosecution.

73     I also noted that the accused had committed a slew of road traffic offences on 24 May 2019 and 14 September 2019 which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC” charges”). These were driving a vehicle without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road under Sec 65(b) RTA, two counts of driving without valid licence under Sec 35(1) RTA, two counts of driving without insurance coverage under Sec 3(1) MVA, taking away a vehicle without the owner’s consent under Sec 96(1) RTA CAP 276 and a passenger under 1.35m not properly restrained by a child restraint under Rule 8(1)(a) Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Wearing of Seat Belts) Rules 2011. These TIC charges are relevant for the purposes of sentencing – see _Teo Seng Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 65</span> at \[95\].

74     Accordingly, for the s 64(1) RTA offence (2nd charge) which carries a fine of up to $5,000, I imposed a fine on the higher end of the spectrum of $3,000 (in default 2 weeks imprisonment) and 12 months’ disqualification from all classes from the date of the accused’s release .

75     For the s 84(3) RTA offence (4th charge) where the accused had left victim injured after the collision without rendering assistance, I imposed the maximum fine of $1,000 (in default 1 weeks imprisonment) and 12 months’ disqualification from all classes from the date of the accused’s release.

76     For the s 35(1) RTA offence (5TH charge), I imposed a fine of $600 (in default 3 days imprisonment) and 12 months’ disqualification from all classes from the date of the accused’s release.

77     For the s 3(1) MVTPA offence (6th charge), I impose a fine of $600 (in default 3 days imprisonment) and 12 months’ disqualification from all classes from the date of the accused’s conviction.

### Consecutive sentences

78     As I had imposed four sentences of imprisonment, I am required under s 307(1) CPC to order at least two of the sentences to run consecutively.

79     In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”) Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon (“Menon CJ”) observed at \[41\] that:

> As a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.

80     Menon CJ explained the operation of s 307(1) CPC and consecutive sentences in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[52\] as follows:

> The general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences does not contravene s 307(1) or render it otiose. The provision retains its relevance in that it operates regardless of whether the multiple offences are related or otherwise. Therefore, even if all or some of the offences are related, s 307(1) applies to require that at least two sentences should run consecutively. Indeed, in my judgment, s 307(1) of the CPC, the one transaction rule, and the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences should be regarded as complementary principles that collectively help a court decide how sentences should be ordered to run in relation to a multiple offender.

81     In the present case, the prosecution sought to run the longest sentence consecutively with the shortest sentence, namely the 1st charge on trafficking in diamorphine and the 13th charge for possession of methamphetamine. Given that by virtue of s 307(1) CPC at least two imprisonment terms had to be consecutive and this was the most favourable combination for the accused, the defence unsurprisingly did not make any submission to the contrary. Accordingly, I ordered the imprisonment terms namely on the 1st charge on trafficking in diamorphine and the 13th charge for possession of methamphetamine to run consecutively.

82     The accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:

### Backdating

83     The general rule is that every sentence of imprisonment, takes effect _from the date on which it is passed_, as provided for in s 318(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code[^1] (“CPC”), which reads:

> Subject to this Code and any other written law, a sentence of imprisonment, corrective training or preventive detention **shall take effect beginning on the date it was passed**, unless the court passing the sentence or, when there has been an appeal, the appellate court, otherwise directs.

\[emphasis added\]

84     Section 318 CPC was substantially amended with effect from 31 October 2018 and s 318(3) CPC specifically vests in the sentencing court a _discretion_ to backdate a custodial sentence:

> To avoid doubt, **a court may under subsection (1) direct** that a sentence of imprisonment, corrective training or preventive detention is to **take effect on a date earlier than the date the sentence is passed**.

\[emphasis added\]

85     Section 318(4) CPC elaborates on the court’s discretion to backdate:

> Where an offender has been remanded in custody, or remanded in a psychiatric institution (whether for observation or otherwise) under Division 5 of Part XIII, for an offence, a court must consider directing that a sentence of imprisonment, corrective training or preventive detention, which is to be imposed for that offence, is to take effect on a date earlier than the date the sentence is passed.

86     Further, s 318(5) of the CPC stipulates a list of factors for a court to consider in deciding whether to backdate a sentence of imprisonment. It reads:

> Before directing the date on which a sentence of imprisonment, corrective training or preventive detention, which is to be imposed for an offence, is to take effect, a court must consider all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (a)    the date on which the offender was arrested for the offence;

>> (b)    the length of the period (if any) during which the offender was remanded in custody in relation to the offence;

>> (c)    the length of the period (if any) during which the offender was remanded in a psychiatric institution (whether for observation or otherwise) under Division 5 of Part XIII in relation to the offence;

>> (d)    the length of the period (if any), after the offender was arrested for the offence, during which the offender was not in custody.

87     Defence counsel had invited me to exercise my discretion and backdate the accused’s sentence to 1 October 2019 which is the date on which his bail was revoked. The deputy public prosecutor (“DPP”) did not object to this.

88     I now note that the accused had an earlier period of remand from the date of his first charge on 21 March 2018 until 31 July 2018 when he was bailed out. He remained on bail until his bail was revoked on 1 October 2019. From 1 October 2019 he was in remand until his plead guilty mention and sentencing on 10 December 2019. Neither defence counsel or the DPP had invited me to exercise my discretion to further backdate the accused’s sentence to 21 March 2018 and to exclude the period of bail from 31 July 2018 to the date of revocation of bail on 1 October 2019.

89     Nor was there any submission by defence counsel or the DPP to factor this earlier period of remand into the sentences imposed with the appropriate reduction. In _Vasentha_ the High Court agreed that the time spent in remand should not be disregarded simply because the accused was granted bail as to hold otherwise would disincentivise an accused person from seeking to make bail once a substantial time has been spent in remand and that seemed wrong in principle. The High Court in _Vasentha_ accordingly made a further reduction of the sentence imposed on account of the time spent in remand.

90     In the circumstances, I had backdated the sentence to the date of revocation of the accused’s bail, namely on 1 October 2019.

## Conclusion

91     The global sentence imposed was 9 years' imprisonment (backdated to 1 October 2019), 13 strokes of the cane and fine of $5,200, in default 3 weeks' 6 days' imprisonment. He was also ordered to be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from date of release.

92     The accused is currently serving sentence.
