\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9256/ 2021/ 01.\]

25 April 2022

### District Judge Wong Li Tein:

1       The Accused, Muhammad Ridhwan Abdullah, was a 53-year-old male Singaporean charged for four charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) (“MDA”) as follows:

> (a)     Drug possession under s 8(a) of the MDA (“the first charge”);

> (b)     Drug consumption under s 8(b)(i) of the MDA (“the second charge”);

> (c)     Possession of drug utensils under s 9 of the MDA (“the third charge”); and

> (d)     Drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA (“the fourth charge”).

2       One count for drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA and one charge for drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC charges”).

3       The Accused pleaded guilty to the four charges for which he faced and after carefully considering the facts of the case, submissions on sentence by the Prosecution and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

4       Sentences in the first and fourth charges were ordered to run consecutively, but concurrently with the rest, making it a global sentence of 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment against the Accused.

5       I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## The Charge

6       The charges for which the Accused pleaded guilty to read as follows:

> (a)     First Charge (DAC-901323-2020)

>> You, Muhammad Ridhwan Abdullah, are charged that you, on 24 October 2019 at about 5.45pm, at or in the vicinity of Blk 7 North Bridge Road, Singapore, did have in your possession a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) to wit, one container and one packet containing a total of not less than 4.22 grams of vegetable matter detected with 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group, without any authorization under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA,

> (d)     Fourth Charge (DAC-908472-2020)

>> You, Muhammad Ridhwan Abdullah, are charged that you, on 24 October 2019 sometime after 1.00pm, at or in the vicinity of Blk 7 North Bridge Road, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“MDA”), to wit, by selling not less than 1.84 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and detected with 4-fluoroMDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group, to one Osman Bin Hamid, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) of the MDA, and further that you, prior to the commission of the said offence, were on 6 May 1998, in Court No. 24, vide DAC11525/1998, convicted of an offence of trafficking in a Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Rev. Ed), to wit, diamorphine, under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Rev. Ed.) and sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you shall on conviction be punished under Section 33(4A)(i) of the MDA.

7       He agreed for two other charges under the MDA to be taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing (“TIC charges”). The TIC charges read as follows:

> (a)     DAC-908473-2020

>> You, Muhammad Ridhwan Abdullah, are charged that you, on or about 22 September 2019, at or in the vicinity of Blk 8 Beach Road, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“MDA”), to wit, by selling not less than 0.76 gram of vegetable matter analysed and detected with 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group to one Rosle Bin Ahmad, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) of the MDA, and further that you, prior to the commission of the said offence, were on 6 May 1998, in Court No. 24, vide DAC11525/1998, convicted of an offence of trafficking in a Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Rev.

(“MDA”), to wit, methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and further, that you, prior to the commission of the said offence, were on 15 February 2011, in Court No. 13, vide DAC53113/2010, convicted of an offence of consumption of a Specified Drug, to wit, a cannabinol derivative, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, and punished under section 33A(1) of the MDA with 6 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you shall on conviction be punished under section 33A(2) of the MDA

## Facts

8       The detailed facts of this case were found in the Statement of Facts which the Accused had admitted to without qualifications. For purposes of explaining my decision, I set out briefly the pertinent facts.

### Statement of Facts

9       The Accused was arrested in the vicinity of block 7 North Bridge Road on 24 October 2019 at about 5.45pm by Central Narcotics Bureau ("CNB") and Singapore Police Force ("SPF") officers. The following items were found in his possession upon arrest:

> (a)     a container containing vegetable matter (marked as "Al");

> (b)     two packets of rolling papers (marked as "A2");

> (c)     a packet containing vegetable matter (marked as "A3"), and

> (d)     a packet of rolling papers (marked as "A4").

### Facts relating to the first and third charges (DAC-901323-2020 and DAC 901325-2020)

10     A1 was found to contain not less than 2.73 grams of vegetable matter, with 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group detected. A3 was found to contain not less than 1.49 grams of vegetable matter with 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group detected. 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA and its fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group are Class A Controlled Drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

11     The Accused was aware at the material time that the vegetable matter in A1 and A3 contained a new psychoactive substance known colloquially as “mushroom”. He had intended to use the rolling paper in A2 and A4 to smoke the "mushroom"

12     As the Accused was previously convicted on a similar offence of possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA on 6 July 1991 and sentenced to a fine of $1,500 (in default 1 month's imprisonment), he was liable for an enhanced sentence under s 33(1) of the MDA.

### Facts relating to the second charge (DAC- 901324-2020)

13     After his arrest, the Accused provided two urine samples which were tested and found to contain 241-(4-Fluorobuty1)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the butyl group. He had thus also intentionally consumed "mushroom" whilst not authorized to do so.

14     Given that the Accused had a prior conviction for a similar offence of consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA on 15 February 2011 and sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment ad 3 strokes of the cane, he faced punishment under s 33(4) of the MDA for this offence.

### Facts relating to the fourth charge (DAC-901324-2020)

15     Earlier on the same day at around 2.45pm in the vicinity of block 8 North Bridge Road, the Accused sold a container of vegetable matter to one Osman Bin Hamid, a male 65-year-old Singapore man for about $10.00. The container of vegetable matter was found to contain not less than 1.84 grams of vegetable matter with 4-fluoro-MDMB-BINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the butyl group detected.

## Prosecution’s Sentencing Position

### Offences under the MDA

16     The Prosecution urged the Court to sentence the Accused to a global sentence of at least 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment broken down as follows:

> (a)     First charge: To impose at least 2 years’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Second charge: To impose at least 3 year’s imprisonment;

> (c)     Third charge: To impose at least 9 months’ imprisonment; and

> (d)     Fourth charge: To impose at least 10 years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment.

17     The sentences sought for the first and second charges were the mandatory minimum sentences provided under the MDA. In respect of the third charge, the Accused had previously been sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment for a similar offence of possession of drug utensils in 2011. In respect of the fourth charge, the Prosecution sought a three-month uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment in light of aggravating factors which demonstrated the Accused’s propensity to reoffend and the need for specific deterrence. Further, the Accused faced two TIC charges, one for a similar charge of drug trafficking[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) and one for consumption which was committed whilst he was released on agency bail[^2].

18     In deciding the final sentence, the Prosecution urged the Court to consider ordering the sentences for the first and fourth charges to run consecutively for a global sentence of at least 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation Plea by Defence

19     The Defence Counsel sought a global imprisonment term of not more than 10 years’ and 9 months imprisonment on account of the Accused’s timely plea of guilt, demonstrating that he was highly remorseful and regretted his actions, and the fact that he had cooperated fully in the course of investigations.

20     The Accused was an odd-job labourer earning around $60 per day for a few days weekly before the commission of the offences. He was the sole breadwinner providing for his wife, two young children and bedridden father. Although he had six previous convictions for drug-related offences under the MDA, he had tried his best to “stay on the straight path” and had maintained a clean record since his last conviction in March 2016. Due to personal and financial circumstances, he committed the present offences.

### Sentence sought by the defence

21     In terms of individual sentences, the Defence sought the same sentences as the Prosecution for the first three charges. For the fourth charge of drug trafficking, Defence Counsel asked for the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment because the amount of drugs sold to Osman was small, he was not a part of a syndicate and had only committed this offence in order to earn a little extra money to support his family.

22     The Defence Counsel urged the Court to allow the third and fourth charges to run consecutively, but concurrently with the rest, as the incidents stated in the charges occurred at the same place and time. This, he submitted, would be sufficient to serve as a reminder to the Accused of the ramification of his actions should he continue down this route in the future.

## Sentencing Considerations

### Applicable legal principles where the offender faces multiple charges

23     The case of _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ _<span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span>_ (“_Raveen_”) provide guidance on sentencing offenders facing multiple charges which were applicable in this case. In _Raveen_, the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon set out an analytical framework for sentencing a multiple offender at \[98\] as follows:

> 98    In summary, the relevant principles in sentencing a multiple offender are as follows:

>> (a)    The first stage of the sentencing analysis is for the sentencing court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence…. In arriving at the individual sentences, the sentencing court will generally have to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each discrete sentence (see \[37\] above).

>> (b)    The second stage of the sentencing analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. In this regard, the starting point of the analysis is whether the offences are unrelated and this is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest (see \[68\]–\[70\] above). As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC.…

>> (c)    The third stage of the sentencing analysis is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality (see \[73\] above). Specifically, there are two limbs to the totality principle. First, the court should examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Second, the court should examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects….

>> (d)    Across all stages of the analysis, the sentencing court should be careful not to offend the rule against double counting….It applies to both aggravating and mitigating factors, and it may arise in cases involving single offences as it does in cases involving multiple offending. However, it does not necessarily violate the rule against double counting if a fact constituting a mitigating factor is again taken into account in the application of the totality principle even though it has been given effect to elsewhere in the sentencing analysis (see \[91\]–\[94\] above).

24     In line with the principles in _Raveen_, I first considered the appropriate individual sentences for each charge for which the Accused faced. I then decided how each of these individual sentences should run, before taking a “last look” and applying the totality principle in determining the global sentence to be meted out against the Accused.

### Stage 1: Sentence for individual charges

25     The Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement with the sentences for each of the first three charges, the first two being the mandatory minimum sentences required by law and the third being on par with the sentence which the Accused had received for a similar conviction in 2011. Given that there were no particularly aggravating factors in this case, I shared the view that the sentences submitted by the Prosecution and Defence would be appropriate for each of these charges.

26     For the fourth charge of trafficking, the Prosecution had sought a slight uplift of three months’ imprisonment from the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in view of the TIC charges. I agreed that an uplift in sentence for this charge was warranted, in view of a similar TIC charge of drug trafficking. An uplift of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate to address the Accused’s repeated offending.

27     The fact that the Accused had committed these offences due to financial personal hardship had no mitigatory value as it was not a consideration which the Accused could be given credit for. At best, it would be considered a neutral factor: _Public Prosecutor v AOM_ _<span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1057</span>_ at \[37\].

28     On account of the Accused’s age, caning was not ordered against the Accused, nor did I impose any sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning.0

### Stage 2: Whether the offences were related

29     As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed (“CPC”): _Raveen_ at \[41\], \[54\] and \[98(b)\].

30     In determining if the offences committed by the Accused were related in the second stage of analysis, I had to consider if they involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. In this case, although the offences were committed by the Accused at the largely the same time and place, the nature of these offences were clearly distinct and violated different legally protected interests. The Accused faced charges for drug possession and consumption, possession of drug utensils and drug trafficking. The Accused fed his own addiction in the charges for drug consumption and the possession of drug utensils, as well as possessed drugs for both personal use and supply to others. Based on this, at least two of the sentences which the Accused faced should run consecutively in order to give actual recognition and real effect to his culpability in the commission of these offences. As observed by Menon CJ in _Raveen_ at \[42\] “(a)ll else being equal, a multiple offender bears greater culpability and will have caused greater harm than an offender who has committed only a single offence.”

31     Although there was no presumption or rule obligating that the two most severe sentences should consecutively: Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Mohamed Shouffee_”) at \[25\], I was mindful that the final sentence should be accurately reflective of the Court’s disapprobation against the numerous offences committed by the Accused. In the present case, it would be fair for the sentences for the first charge of drug possession and for the fourth charge of trafficking to run consecutively, but concurrently with the rest, given that the Accused would have the drugs for both his own consumption and sale to others. The total aggregate sentence at this point would therefore be 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.

### Stage 3: Totality principle and taking a “last look”

32     In the third and final analysis, the Court applies the totality principle and takes a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. In doing so, the Court should:

> (a)     Examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed; and

> (b)     Examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.

33     In the present circumstances where the Accused faced two other TIC charges and had a long history of drug offences, I was of the view that the total aggregate sentence of 12 years and 3 months’ imprisonment was appropriate and not crushing. It would not be correct to aggregate the highest (for trafficking) and lowest sentences (for possession of drug utensils) instead because of the nature of the offences committed by the Accused, the TIC charges and his antecedent record. The Accused had six previous convictions for drug offences and had two TIC charges - one for a similar charge of trafficking and the other for drug consumption (LT1) which would have attracted a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment.

### Aggravating and mitigating Factors

34     As mentioned above, I found that there were no aggravating factors in this case. However, there were no notable mitigating factors either. I was sympathetic with the Accused’s financial difficulties, but that was not a factor which the Court can take into account in order to mete out a lower sentence for drug offences. The Accused was a repeat offender who knew full well the consequences of his own actions. Selling drugs can hardly be said to be a means of supplementing family income.

## Conclusion

35     Having considered fully the facts of this case and in view of the TIC charges against him, I sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 12 years and 3 months.

36     Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, the Accused has now appeal against my decision. The Accused is in remand pending appeal.
