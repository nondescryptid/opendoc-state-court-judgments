### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       A male masseur, Qu Laihua (“the accused”), aged 55 years old, was charged with outraging the modesty of three female persons, PW1, PW2 and PW3 (“the victims”) on three separate occasions in the month of March 2016. The offences were alleged to have been committed in the course of professional massage services that he was providing to the three victims.

2       Following police reports made against the accused, three separate charges under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224 Penal Code, 2008 Rev Ed) were framed against the accused for the offences of outrage of modesty. The particulars of the charges are summarised below:

3       The accused claimed trial to all three charges. With the consent of the Defence, the Prosecution proceeded on a joint trial against the accused on all the charges, and all three victims testified in the course of the trial.

4       At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was sufficient evidence to make out each and every element of the charges, I called on the accused to enter his defence. The accused testified and also called his wife to give evidence. In addition, he called an expert witness to testify on the effect of 2 of the 16 ingredients found in a paste that he allegedly used for the massages.

5       After examining the notes of evidence (NE), the exhibits, and the detailed submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, I was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to prove the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on all three charges, and I convicted him accordingly. Thereafter, following comprehensive sentencing submissions from parties, as well as victim impact statements tendered by the Prosecution, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 22 months’ imprisonment on the accused.

6       The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal. I now give my detailed grounds of decision.

## Outline of the Prosecution’s Evidence

7       In presenting its case, the Prosecution called a total of four witnesses for the entire trial, including the three victims (PW1, PW2 and PW3), and PW4 ASP Almeida Tay, the police officer who recorded the accused’s statements. The latter was called as a rebuttal witness.

8       In summary, the Prosecution’s case was that the three victims, who are all dancers, had been molested by the accused on three different dates in March 2016. The offences were committed when the victims separately sought massage services at a massage establishment known as Genki Wellness, which the accused had set up. On each of these occasions, he had molested them in the course of performing full body massages on them.

9       Each victim testified that the accused had outraged her modesty in the manner set out in her respective charge. The Prosecution submitted that their evidence was consistent on material facts, and that they were unusually convincing witnesses.

10     In contrast, the Prosecution submitted that the accused, whose defence was that of a bare denial, was an evasive witness whose evidence was self-serving and not in accord with common sense or logic. As for his wife DW2 Ding Jun (“Ding Jun”), she had backtracked on many of the claims she initially made in court, and her evidence was of no assistance to him. As regards the evidence of DW3 Ms Lim Chin Chin, who was called as an expert witness, the Prosecution’s position was that she had conducted “very rudimentary tests” on a paste that the accused claimed to have used on the victims, and that her evidence “do(es) little to advance the accused’s assertion of innocence”.

11     Before setting out my detailed findings, I will provide an outline of the main evidence of the three victims, as well as an outline of the evidence of the Defence witnesses when considering the Defence’s case. I will also summarise the evidence of the Prosecution’s rebuttal witness.

### Evidence of PW1 (victim for the third charge)

12     PW1 is a 29-year-old female dance instructor. Since the beginning of 2015, she has been going for massages at Genki Wellness for about 10 times to ‘release her muscles’. This was a massage establishment that a fellow dancer had recommended her to.

13     PW1 usually went for the full body massage which lasts for at least 1 ½ hours. In 2016, she went for massages there about 3 to 4 times, with the last time being on 11 March 2016. The massages she received, on the various occasions she visited, were provided by either male or female masseurs.

14     On 11 March 2016, PW1 had made an appointment for a massage session to deal with her general muscle tension. This was similar to the reason why she had gone for her earlier massages.

15     When she reached the counter, PW1 was directed by a female masseur to a room, where she took off her clothes and laid down to wait. At that time, she was topless and wore only ‘boy shorts’, which are like bicycle shorts but shorter, reaching her “mid upper thigh”. In addition, she also wore her underwear underneath the boy shorts, while lying face down waiting for the masseur to come in.

16     Subsequently, a female masseur come into the room. As PW1 laid face down, the masseur proceeded with the massage from her upper back to her middle back, and then to her lower back.

17     Halfway through the massage, the masseur said that her hand was painful, so she had to hand over to a male masseur. PW1 said that she had no objection to a male masseur taking over as she (PW1) felt that she had no choice. The female masseur then left, and the accused came in and continued with the massage for PW1.

18     Subsequently, the accused instructed PW1 to turn over to face up. He then left the room while PW1 turned over and covered her chest with a towel that extended to the lower part of her body. The accused returned and asked PW1 to bend her right leg to form a V-shape with the foot resting against her left knee, while her left leg remained straight. This caused her shorts to ride up a little bit, as her boy shorts was tight but not fitting.[^1] The accused then massaged up to PW1’s upper thigh near her pubic area.

19     At her upper thigh area, his fingers went from under the bottom of her boy shorts and then he began to massage the surrounding area at the edge of her underwear. He also used his thumb or fingers to go beneath her underwear and massaged the “V” (i.e. her pubic) area. PW1 said that she could feel this. She described his pressing action as being “medium touch” and “momentary but it was repetitive”.[^2] Also, PW1 said that she could “hear that, uh, was wet. I could hear the sound from my own body, yah.” [^3]

20     Using the exhibit P2 (showing a drawing of the female private part) to make her point, PW1 testified that:

> “…\[the accused\] will slowly move in towards the outer---outer lips of the vagina…and then he will move out and then he will go in again, out and in, out and in but he didn’t go any inner than that. So he touched the outer lips of the vagina, yah. Uh, the inner---inner and outer lip, the pink area---the pink area, yah.”[^4]

21     PW1 said that the accused moved from the outer area and then moved in and out. He did this first on the right side of her leg, and then moved to the left side where he did the same. She said that he touched her in this manner at least 10 times on each side.

22     When asked how she felt as he was doing this, PW1 said that she was uncomfortable but thought that what he was doing could be accidental. However, when he repeated this a few times, she thought that she could be feeling a bit sensitive and that this may have been his massage technique. PW1 also felt confused and thought that she was in a very vulnerable position as she was half dressed and she was lying on a bed with a man in the room. Further, she said that she wasn’t thinking rationally, and her thoughts were not very coherent at that point in time. In her own words, she stated: “I was in a state of shock, and I really didn’t know what to do”.[^5]

23     PW1 also said that when the accused did the same thing as he massaged her left leg and started touching her vagina on that side, she realised that what he was doing was wrong, and she said “no” in Chinese (“bu yao”), but not very loudly because she was scared. She also used her hands to block and press on her groin area. However, the accused continued with his actions for another two or three minutes.

24     PW1 explained that she only reacted when he did this to her on her left leg, rather than when he was doing this on her right leg, because she was initially unsure as to whether this was accidental or intentional, and she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. It was only when he did the same thing when massaging her other leg that she decided to voice out. She described her “boy shorts” as “stretchy”, and confirmed that it was possible for him to insert his fingers under her boy shorts and her panties.

25     Aside from saying no to him, she did not talk to him or ask him about what he did to her. PW1 confirmed that she was not ok with him touching her in that manner, nor did she consent to his actions. Neither had he asked if he could insert his hand into her boy shorts and under her underwear.

26     Subsequently, the accused moved on to massage her shoulders and then near her armpits. He also slipped his hand below the towel and close to her breast but did not touch her breast. She could not remember if he massaged her head but said that the massage ended shortly after that. PW1 said that she allowed him to touch and massage her shoulders even though he had touched her vagina[^6] because she was in a state of shock, so she didn’t move.

27     The entire massage lasted for about 2 hours. PW1 said that she paid about $100 plus for the massage. However, she was not sure if the payment was made to the accused or to the female masseur who had massaged her earlier. She also could not remember if she had any conversation with the female masseur about getting insurance for TCM treatment.

28     PW1 said that for the massage on 11 March 2016, she could not confirm if a medical rub, such as the paste in D2A/D2B[^7] was used on her during the massage session. She clarified that when she went to Genki Wellness for her massage sessions, she would sometimes opt to have oil used and sometimes she would not. On the occasions when oil was used on her, she had experienced a warm but not a stinging sensation. PW1 also confirmed that she had not felt any warm sensation on her private part that day.

29     PW1 said that she did not tell anyone, including her parents, about the incident. It was only subsequently when she met PW2, who was also a dancer at the same studio as her but who was not a close friend, that they both talked about the accused massaging very close to their individual private parts. This happened when they were speaking casually.

30     When PW2 told her that it was “kind of weird”, PW1 realised that she (PW1) was not the only one who had the experience. PW1 described their discussion as an “emotional conversation” during which they did not tell each other specifically about what the accused had done to them, or where exactly they were individually touched, although PW1 did tell PW2 that the accused had come close to her private part. PW1 explained that she was not comfortable discussing the incident with anyone because “…I think it’s a very private thing. I think the details are---I wouldn’t share the details openly. “[^8]

31     Subsequently, PW1 had a conversation with PW3, who was another dancer at the same studio and who had overheard her. The latter approached PW1 and started crying and opened up saying that she had a similar experience where “he touched me everywhere”. PW3 had told him to stop but he continued.

32     PW1 confirmed that the other victims did not tell her exactly where they were touched, or how the massages were conducted. She also did not give them details of her own experience but merely said that she felt uncomfortable. She clarified that apart from discussing the procedures with the other two victims, she did not discuss the other aspects of the case with them.

33     Realising that she wasn’t the only one affected, and that what the accused did was intentional because of where he had touched her, PW1 arranged with PW2 and PW3 to make a police report on 1 April 2016. On that date, PW1 made a police report (P4) stating that: “On the 12th of March 2016 at about 7:30, I was at the above-mentioned location, I was molested by 1 Chinese subject, that is all”. PW1 explained that she had given the date of the incident erroneously as 12 instead of 11 March 2016, because she wasn’t sure exactly which day it was. She only subsequently discovered it was 11 March 2016 when she checked her schedule book.

34     PW1 also said that prior to this occasion, the accused had previously given her massages on earlier occasions in 2016. On the first occasion, he did so when there was no female masseur available. On the next two occasions, he had taken over from a female masseur in the course of the massage. However, on none of these occasions, did he rub her vagina or place his hands into her undergarments or underwear. [^9] PW1 also aside from rubbing her vagina on 11 March 2016, there was nothing different about this massage from the earlier massages carried out by the accused. And for the massage on 11 March 2016, before carrying out the massage on her, the accused did not explain to her what he was going to do, nor could she remember him asking her whether she wanted anything done to her. PW1 said that she did not go back to Genki Wellness after this incident.

35     PW1 also confirmed that as between the accused and her, their relationship was only that of a masseur-customer, and she has not had any interactions with him after 11 March 2016. Further, during the course of her massages with him, there was no disagreement between them.

### Evidence of PW2 (victim for the first charge)

36     PW2 is a 26-year-old female freelance dance instructor. She was introduced to Genki Wellness by her friends and fellow dancers, and had gone there since 2015 or 2016.

37     When she went there on 13 March 2016, it was already her fourth visit to Genki Wellness. On the first two occasions, she was attended to by a female masseur, and by a male masseur on the third occasion. On each of these occasions, PW2 had gone for a one hour full body massage to get her muscle strains dealt with so that she could dance better. She was also asked whether she wanted massage oil to be used, and she had said yes.

38     On 13 March 2016, it was the accused who met her at the cashier counter. The latter told her that there was no female masseur available and asked if it was ok with her that he carry out the massage for her. She replied that it was ok. When asked by counsel, PW2 said that she did not recall going with a friend to Genki Wellness that day.

39     In the massage room, which was dim and dark, PW2 stripped down to her underwear and laid on the massage bed face down, with a blanket or towel that reached from her shoulders down to her ankles, to cover herself. The accused then entered the room. He started massaging her neck and her upper back, down to her lower back, her butt and her legs.

40     After that, PW2 laid on her back, with her eyes covered by a piece of cloth. The accused then proceeded to massage the feet of one leg, and then move up to her calf and thigh. PW2 said that when the accused massaged her, he would remove the towel so that the part of the body being massaged would be uncovered. PW2 said that her panties covered her “V area”, and ran along the “V line”. The accused subsequently asked PW2 to bend her leg into a V shape so that her feet would be at the level of the opposite knee.

41     The accused then continued to massage up her upper thigh, her inner thigh and then moved to her groin area. At the “V area” (at her groin as shown in D1B), the accused used his thumb and massaged in a circular motion inward. PW2 described the accused as massaging from the outer hip and then moving towards the vagina. She said that this massage was different from the earlier massage carried out by the accused, as previously, he “didn’t go on the V area. But the 4th time, he actually went under the underwear on the V line”.[^10]

42     PW2 said that the accused’s thumb was fully under her panties and touched the side of the vagina. The accused did not ask if he could reach under the panties. PW2 said that he continued to massage for 1 to 2 minutes. The accused repeated the same motion on the other leg and also touched the other side of her vagina. [^11] PW2 said that she did not stop him when his thumb reached into her panties to massage her groin area. PW2 said that he massaged the area with medium to strong force and she felt pain. She was shocked at what he did, and was “a bit taken aback” as she was not sure what to do at that time. [^12]

43     PW2 confirmed that she did not consent to him massaging her in that manner, nor was she fine with it. Neither had he told her what he was going to do so before he touched her at that area, nor did he tell her what he was doing when he touched her there. PW2 said that she did not stop him, nor did she shout or use her hand to block him. She only moved around a little bit because of the pain. In her words, “…it felt wrong and it’s definitely out of line for---from---for someone to touch the V area basically”. [^13]

44     PW2 also said that she did not feel a tingling sensation during the massage although she recalled feeling a warm sensation when the oil was applied. However, she could not confirm that the paste (shown in D2A/D2B) was what was used on her during the massage that day.

45     PW2 stated that at the middle of the massage, she was asked by the accused whether she wanted to extend the massage by 15 minutes, and she agreed. This was before the incident when she was touched on the V area. PW1 said that she was awake during the entire massage session, and that the massage was done using the thumb of one hand to press against part of her body, and moving in a circular motion.

46     PW2 testified that the massage, which lasted for 75 minutes, ended at about 4.15 pm. After the massage was over, she got dressed and went to make payment. She could not recall whether it was the accused or a female person who attended to her for the payment. PW2 said that she just wanted to make payment and to leave the place. She testified that she did not go back to Genki Wellness after this incident.

47     PW2 said that when she subsequently spoke to PW1, they realised that they both felt “weird”. PW2 recalled that PW1 had told her that she (PW1) “felt weird and uncomfortable” but the latter did not go into details.[^14] PW2 also confirmed that neither she nor PW1 had told each other specifically about what happened to them.

48     PW2 also had a discussion with PW3 about her experience during the massage. The latter had said that she was massaged at a place that she didn’t want to be touched. She also told PW2 that she had informed the accused that she did not want to be touched there.

49     Subsequently, the three of them (PW1, PW2 and PW3) arranged, via text messages, to meet at Cantonment to make police reports. PW2 herself had made a report (P5) as she “…felt it was wrong”, and she found out that her other two friends had gone through the same thing. PW2 conformed that aside from the procedure of reporting, the three of them did not talk specifically about what had happened to each of them. PW2 explained that the three of them made the report together because they had all experienced a similar situation. She also did not want this to happen to anyone else. [^15]

50     PW2 said that her relationship with the accused was that of a masseur-customer, and she has not had any other dealings with him since the incident.

### Evidence of PW3 (victim for the second charge)

51     PW3 testified that she is a 32-year-old dancer and choreographer from India who moved to Singapore to study at the National University of Singapore (NUS) for her master’s degree, and subsequently for her PhD in cultural studies. She was also a professional dancer, teacher and a lecturer of dance at two arts colleges, La Salle College of the Arts and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.

52     PW3 testified that she was introduced to Genki Wellness by a fellow dancer. For her first visit there, she underwent a full body massage carried out by a female masseur called “May”, where PW3 laid down on a bed and put her head through a hole. May had massaged her neck, down her upper back, and also massaged her legs, inner thighs, arms and head, but did not touch PW3’s private parts. PW3 described this visit as a good experience, and May as an effective massage therapist.

53     PW3 returned to Genki Wellness about 1 ½ months later on 4 March 2016. When she reached the venue at about 2.30 or 2.45 pm, she saw the accused and recognised that he had been the receptionist on the previous occasion. PW3 had requested for a female massage therapist but the accused said that there was no female massage therapist available, and he bragged about his massage skills. While not 100% comfortable with the idea, PW3 said that since she had used a male massage therapist before, and had not experienced any inappropriate massage in Singapore previously, and also since she had gone to Genki Wellness ready for a massage, and as her body “…was really crying for a massage…”, [^16] she agreed for the accused to be her massage therapist.

54     PW3 requested for a back massage for an hour and was then shown a massage bed. PW3 described the lighting in the massage room as dim, with faint background music, and said that the accused only spoke to her in broken English while she was not conversant in Mandarin.

55     The accused then drew the curtain and PW3 removed her outfit including her bra but kept her underwear on. She also wrapped a towel around herself. She then laid face down and put her head through a hole. Next, the accused came in, lifted the towel, and placed it back on her body. Without asking her, the accused then rolled the towel down to the start of her buttocks, and began pouring oil on her back, even though she had not opted for an oil massage. He then massaged her back, starting with her neck and shoulders, before working down to her lower back. To counsel’s question, PW3 was sure that it was the accused who had massaged her back, and not a female masseur.

56     After about 45 minutes, PW3 felt that the massage was required for her body and it felt good. Also, because she had time on her hands, PW3 asked the accused to extend the massage by an hour and to turn it into a full body massage.

57     The accused then started to massage her legs, starting with her calf. He used both his hands on her one leg at a time and applied pressure with his thumbs. He did this to her right leg first, and as he massaged her, he started going higher and higher up her leg doing long rubs from her ankles all the way up to her upper leg at the back of her thigh. PW3 described what happened: [^17]

> “…he started doing….4 or 5 long rubs down from my ankle to the upper part of my leg. He did that 4 to 5 times and he started going higher and higher. Um, just bit by bit, in the name of a massage, he would always just kind of take his thumb up a little higher. And then I realise that, um, the next rub, 2 or 3 times, **_he kind of slowly slid his thumb under my underwear, just kind of sliding it into my underwear and coming back down_****.** Uh, at no point it felt disconnected from the rub. It was always part of the---the rub but he would just kind of slide it in very slightly and come back down. Um, I started feeling---feeling that on my---on my leg and then, uh, just---though rub---after that, he went even further. **_He went a little bit further and I---and I felt a little touch on my, uh---on---on the outer part of my vagina, um, in---during the same course of action and, uh, that’s when I felt a little shudder in my---in my system and it didn’t feel right but, um, it was just e---uh, very uncomfortable, uh, and he---he did that the whole time as part of the massage._** … I think he did that 1 or 2 times and I felt extremely stiff in my body. Uh, having felt that, hmm, I didn’t respond physically in any way at that time. Uh, but I was---I remember feeling extremely uncomfortable, uh, with that---with that touch. And after that, he switched to my other leg...”

\[emphasis added\]

58     PW3 said that with the next rub “…he went even further and with the same technique, he was able to---to touch the outer part of my vagina and then he came back down.” PW3 said that one of the accused’s thumb came in touch with her vagina while the other thumb was on the outer portion of the leg. In response to counsel, PW3 said that: [^18]

> “… it took me some time to really understand what he was doing and that was grossly inappropriate. In retrospect, like I said, today maybe I should have reacted sooner but at that moment, it was not an immediate response although I was very conscious…of…what…he…was doing…”

59     PW3 elaborated: [^19]

> “But it took me some time and I regretted. I regret, uh, not being aggressive about my response earlier. But I think my body and my mind were because it was a such a blurred state, I was aware, I will not deny. I was definitely aware, I was conscious. I knew it was inappropriate but I think my reaction time was a lot longer in a state of confusion and just complete, um, disgust. I think there was a combination of feelings. I had never experienced anything like that before and that was the primary reason why I didn’t know how to respond. I do regret res---not---not responding sooner.”

60     Subsequently, after the accused was done with massaging her right leg, the accused switched to PW3’s left leg and carried out the same massage technique, including using his fingers to slide in and touch her inappropriately. When he was doing this, PW3 said that she was twitching and showing small signs of discomfort, but she did not respond in an obvious way.

61     The accused then asked her to turn around and lie on her back. As she was feeling uncomfortable with the accused because of his inappropriate touching when he was massaging her earlier, she placed her hand to cover the upper part of her pubic region and pressed really hard. Despite this, the accused still tried to push through with his fingers and slide his finger under her fingers even though she was pressing down hard. She had to tell him that she did not want that part of her leg massaged. While PW3 didn’t want to be rude or to make a scene, she was firm in directing him to her feet instead.

62     The accused then worked on her feet for 2 or 3 minutes before moving up her left leg again. PW3 was shocked and kept pressing on her legs with her hands but felt that he was trying to pierce through that pressure. However, she did not let him do that and told him firmly that “It’s okay.” PW3 said that she did not immediately get up and walk out as she did not want to make a scene, although she made clear signs to show that she was uncomfortable. At that time, she was confused and there were multiple thoughts going through her mind. [^20]

63     Eventually, the accused went on to massage her head, neck and shoulders. When he did so, PW3 pulled the towel higher up so as to cover a higher portion of her chest to protect herself as she was worried that he might try to touch her breasts. When he indeed tried to “pierce through” her fingers, she said to him something along the lines of “(t)hat’s enough”.[^21]

64     Subsequently, the accused asked PW3 to turn over onto her stomach once more and he used a tool to massage her lower back. At that point, she felt an extra pair of hands on her body and also heard a female voice speaking in Chinese. The accused asked PW3 if she spoke Chinese and she said no. PW3 testified that the female person left the room after about 5 minutes. She and PW3 did not speak to each other during this time.

65     The accused then pulled down her panties to expose about three-quarters of her buttocks without asking her or seeking her consent. He then massaged her buttocks with his thumb and hands. When the accused used his thumb to brush against her anus, PW3 pulled her panties up giving a clear indication that she did not want him to continue working on that part of the body. She, however, did not walk out. She explained that “I was, um, held back by my just---my state of shock and---and discomfort.” [^22]

66     The accused next asked her to turn around to lie on her back. Then without warning, the accused did three very quick presses at her pubic region in a triangular fashion. PW3 was shocked at the accused’s actions. He then raised her right leg, followed by her left leg, and then both legs at a time. Following this, he informed her that the massage was finished and left PW3 alone in the room. PW3 testified that at that time, she was very slow in changing as she was “was very, very paralysed almost by what have just happened.” [^23]

67     PW3 subsequently made payment to the accused at the reception counter. She remembered that at that time, the accused was covered in sweat.[^24] She then left the massage parlour and turned left to the toilets on the same floor, where she stayed and cried for about 10 minutes having been so traumatised by her experience with the accused.

68     PW3 testified that when she came out of the toilet, she saw the accused outside Genki Wellness by the railings and that he was looking at her. She made eye contact with him for a moment but because she was uncomfortable, she looked away immediately. She then took the escalator down from the third floor to the ground floor. When she next saw him, she said that: “(h)e was following me with his eyes the whole time until I left….”[^25] PW3 has not returned to Genki Wellness since this incident.

69     PW3 said that during the night of the incident, after her husband had returned home, she started crying in bed. She then shared with him about what had happened, but not in elaborate detail. They then discussed whether to file a police report. However, although she was very affected by the incident, PW3 did not file a report at that stage as she had just gotten married in January 2016 and entered a new family that she didn’t know well. Also, she was only a few months from finishing her PhD and was managing a full time job as a dancer.

70     PW3 eventually did make a police report. This was after she had overheard PW1, who was in the same dance company as her, say that she had an uncomfortable massage experience at Genki Wellness. PW3 then told PW1 that the accused had touched her private parts and that this occurred before PW1’s own experience. At that time, PW1 told PW3 that PW2 had experienced something like that. PW3 described their conversation as brief, and they didn’t exchange elaborate details about what had happened to them.[^26] PW2 and PW3 subsequently also had a conversation about their individual experiences, although this was also not a very elaborate discussion about the exact sequence of events.

71     The three victims realised that they had all experienced inappropriate massages, and been touched inappropriately on parts of their bodies that they should not have been. PW3 also said that she wasn’t sure whether there had been other women whom the accused had done the same thing to, or who may experience the same thing in future. PW3 said that the three victims then decided to step forward to make a police report. Thus, on 1 April 2019, they went to the Police Cantonment Complex to file their police reports.

## Outline of the Defence’s Evidence

72     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible and which satisfied each and every element of the three charges, I called on the accused to give his defence. The accused elected to take the stand. He also called two witnesses, his wife, Ding Jun, and a scientist, Ms Lim Chin Chin, to testify for the Defence. I will set out in an outline form, the main aspects of the accused’s evidence, as well as an outline of the evidence of Ding Jun and Ms Lim.

### The accused’s evidence

73     The accused was the boss and sole proprietor of Genki Wellness. He came from China in 1996 and started Genki Wellness in 2006. Genki Wellness was registered in his sole name. Around March 2016, it had four other employees, including his wife, Ding Jun.

74     The accused said that he himself only started performing massage services in October 2015. He said that he would ask customers to enter the room, and then ask them, one or two minutes later, if they were ok before entering the room. He would also ask if they wanted to use oil for the massage. The accused said that the curtains in Genki Wellness were not full length but ended about 10 - 15 cm off the ground. They were opaque and one could not see what happens in the room from the outside. All four massage rooms, which measured about 90 cm in width each, have their own curtains. Further, between the reception room and the massage rooms was another curtain made of beads.

75     The accused initially said that the curtains to the massage rooms were for purposes of privacy for the customer. However, while the curtains to the rooms were fully drawn when the other masseurs, all females, serve the customers, the accused said that his wife insisted that for him, he has to keep the curtain one-third open, whether the customer that he was serving was male or female. When asked him why the curtain was supposed to be drawn to leave such a gap when the customers were inside, the accused did not give an answer, other than repeatedly saying that his wife had insisted that he keep them one-third open. This was despite the fact that he had admitted that the curtain was meant for the privacy of the customer.

76     Also despite being the owner of Genki Wellness, the accused insisted that he would obey his wife on keeping the curtain one-third open, because he claimed that his wife was “always controlling me. I’m very frightened.”, and that he has to follow what she says, even when they were at home. Despite repeated questioning, the accused claimed that he did not know why his wife had asked him to keep the curtain one-third open when he was carrying out the massage for a customer. Neither was he interested to find out. Instead, he claimed that he would just follow her instructions as she was very domineering, and that he did not dare ask her for the reasons. [^27] However, the accused denied that she had wanted the curtain to be opened so that she could check on him to make sure that he did not do anything funny with a female customer, or to check on his massage technique. The accused also claimed that he “dare not come up with any reasons” why she asked him to do this. [^28]

77     The accused also added that his wife, Ding Jun, would walk around the shop and would be able to see him and that she just enjoyed doing so. The accused said that the curtain would be closed for the other masseurs when they were massaging their customers, but that his wife would open the curtain when she wanted to enter their massage rooms.

78     As for using oil for massages, the accused said that the oil he uses would initially cause a cooling sensation, following by a warming and stinging sensation. He further said that they would advise customers whom they used the oil on, that they should wait 2 hours before they shower. [^29]

79     The accused denied committing any of the offences, even though he admitted that he had carried out massages for the three victims. He also said that the three victims did not complain about anything. His specific responses to the allegations made by the three victims are outlined below.

#### Massage provided to PW1

80     The accused said that PW1 had made an appointment for a massage at 7.30 pm on 11 March 2016, and had gone into room number 3. When he entered the room, PW1 was already lying face down, with her legs and buttocks covered with a towel. At that time, the accused’s wife, Ding Jun, was with PW1.

81     Deng Jun had then said that her hands were painful and asked the accused to take over the massage for PW1. She said that PW1 was agreeable to this, and that PW1’s problem was with her waist area. Ding Jun then left.

82     The accused said that he applied the paste, shown in D2A and D2B (as “Rheumatism Paste’) on PW1’s waist and back, although he did not show PW1 the bottle containing the paste. He then used his elbow to massage her and also used his hands, placed one on top of the other, to exert pressure. PW1 subsequently agreed to extend her massage from 90 minutes to 120 minutes.

83     With PW1 lying face downwards, the accused started to massage her legs.by applying the paste on her calf, the back of her knees, and the back of her thigh, from mid-thigh downwards. The accused said that for PW1’s thigh, he moved upwards to her mid-thigh and then back to the knee before pushing upwards to her mid-thigh and moving back again. He then repeated the process.

84     After this, the accused covered PW1 with the towel and told her to turn around. The accused claimed that throughout the time that he massaged her, the curtain was fully opened as his wife did not close the curtain when she left. This was despite the fact that the accused’s wife would normally close the curtain when she left, with the customer still in the room. [^30] While the accused claimed that the instructions from his wife was that he was to keep the curtains one-third open (rather than fully opened) when he was massaging a customer, the accused said that on this occasion, since “(s)he left the curtain fully open and did not close it. So why should I close it and make her angry?” [^31]

85     The accused further claimed that when he asked PW1 to flip over, the curtain to the room was fully open, although he subsequently said that he closed the curtain when she was flipping over because “…she was not wearing a bra, if I did not close it fully, then she will be exposed”. [^32] However, he insisted that when he was massaging PW1, despite her also being braless at that time, he kept the curtain open since he has to “follow \[his wife’s\] instructions”. [^33]

86     The accused further said that when PW1 raised her head to look left and right, he moved out of the room and closed the curtain. When he did so, he saw his wife at the opposite room as the curtain for that room was open. She was holding her mobile phone, and leaning against the side of the bed nearest to the door, and she took a look at him.

87     After standing outside for a while, the accused asked PW1 if she was ready, and he re-entered the room when she said, “okay”. At that stage, PW1 was lying on her back with her head looking upwards and she was covered with the big towel from her neck to her toes. The accused said that after he entered the room, he left the curtain fully opened, but did not inform PW1 of this. [^34]

88     The accused then began massaging PW1’s legs, starting with the outer part of her leg. He applied the paste and started on the calf first and then went on to massage the mid-thigh. The accused also said that when he flipped open the towel, the corner of the boy shorts that PW1 was wearing was exposed. He described her boy shorts as body hugging. The accused then said that he worked on the calf, followed by the knee, and then at the part below the mid-thigh.

89     For the massage, the accused used his thumb to exert pressure on the calf up to knee, back to the top of the foot and repeated the process. He then worked on the part below the mid-thigh and exerted pressure using his thumb and moved upwards from the knee to the mid-thigh and then moved back again to the knees. He completed the massage of PW1’s leg, from mid-thigh downwards, before he moved on to massage her other leg. The accused said the massage process for both legs was the same, and took about 15 minutes.

90     Following the massage of the legs, he proceeded to the top of the bed and massaged PW1’s neck and shoulders, including the acupoints below her collarbone. He then hit her legs with his fist for about 5 minutes before telling her that he had finished. After this, he left the room and closed the curtain. The accused said that he did not speak to PW1 when she came out of the room, but he could hear her speaking to his wife who asked her about how the massage was, and PW1 replying in Mandarin “(v)ery good”. [^35]

91     Throughout the massage process, his wife did not come into the room. The accused also said that PW1’s legs were kept straight, and not bent as she had claimed. He denied that he had put his fingers under her boy shorts and pushed his fingers in and out. Instead, the accused insisted that he did not massage the area above the mid-thigh. Neither had he massaged her pubic area, nor move underneath her boy shorts and touch the outer lips of her vagina. Further, he denied that he had slid his hand under her panties and rubbed her vulva. The accused said that he was frightened of his wife and that if anything had happened, and anyone had shouted, his wife could hear and enter the room.

#### Massage provided to PW2

92     The accused said that PW2 had made an appointment for massages on 13 March 2016 itself. The appointment was for a total of two 60 minute massages for two people. Prior to this appointment, he had provided massage services to PW2 before, but he could not recall how many times he had done so.

93     At about 3 pm on 13 March 2016, while the accused was still carrying out foot massage for a customer, PW2 had arrived with a female companion. PW2 told his wife that she was willing to receive massage services from a male masseur. Thus, after the accused had finished the foot massage for his customer, he brought PW2 to Room 4 where she closed the curtain and changed. After confirming that she was ready, he entered the room and saw PW2 lying face downwards and covered by a large towel from her neck to the base of her feet.

94     The accused said that he then massaged her using the paste shown in D2A and D2B, although he did not explain to her what he was using on her. The accused started by massaging PW1’s neck, then her shoulders and waist, as well as the area in between her shoulders and waist for about 50 minutes, He then cleaned up the paste with the small towel, covered her with the big towel, and informed PW2 that he had completed the massage for the back. The accused said that he then asked PW2 if she could extend the time by another 15 minutes, as her friend had started 15 minutes later, and she could leave with her friend if she extended her time. The accused said that PW2 had agreed to this.

95     For the 15-minute extension, the accused gave PW2 a leg massage by starting on her calf, knee and then the part below her mid-thigh. He said that he flipped open the towel covering one of the legs, then placed a small towel in the middle of the leg, and tucked in the bottom part of the small towel under the big towel. He then started to apply the paste starting from her mid-thigh downwards, before starting the \`tui na’ massage from the outer side of the calf, the inner side, and then the top, and repeated his actions. He described PW2’s boy shorts as being very tight and said that they hugged her thigh and covered the length of her thigh with the bottom part of the shorts ending somewhere above her mid-thigh. He said that they were the same as the type of shorts worn by PW1.[^36]

96     The accused said that after working on PW2’s calf, he then worked on her knees, followed by the area below the mid-thigh, starting from the outer side and then the inner side, and then the top, and repeated his actions. After completing the massage on one leg, he used the small towel to clean the paste on that leg before moving on to massage the other leg, where he repeated the same massage process. In essence, for both her legs, the accused said that he only massaged up to her mid-thigh.

97     After he had finished with the massage of her legs, he wiped off the paste and covered her with the towel. He then told her “finished”, left the room and closed the curtain. The accused said that the massage for PW2’s two legs took about 15 minutes, and during this process, her legs were placed straight and she was facing down. Subsequently, PW2 came out of the room and he went in to tidy up. He took about 2-3 minutes to do so. When he came out of the room, PW2 was no longer in the premises of Genki Wellness.

98     The accused said that while he was massaging PW2, his wife entered the room twice, although he does not recall what she did when she was in the room, or why she came in. The accused subsequently said that his wife should have entered at the time when he was exerting pressure on PW2’s back, and massaging the back of her leg.

99     The accused denied that he had used his thumb to go into circular motions around PW2’s groin area, or had touched her vulva or the side of her vagina. Nor was his thumb into her panties. He said that he only massaged up to the portion below her mid-thigh. The accused also said that after PW2 turned around, he only had 10 minutes left to work on both her legs, and said that the main problem was with her shin which was aching.

#### Massage provided to PW3

100    The accused said that PW3 had made an appointment on 4 March 2016 for a 90 minute full body massage starting at 2.30 pm. The accused said that he did not record this appointment down. The appointment was for his wife to provide massage services for PW3. However, because of a quarrel between the accused and his wife, she did not go with him to Genki Wellness that day.

101    On 4 March 2016, the accused had met PW3 at the reception area. He was the only one at the shop that day. The accused said that he asked PW3 if he could perform the massage for her and she had replied “ok”. The accused then brought PW3 to room 2, where she drew the curtain herself. Subsequently, after she replied to him that she was ok, he entered the room and saw her lying face downwards with her body covered by a big towel from her neck down to her legs. The accused said that he left the curtain to the room about one-third open.

102    He said he then folded the towel from PW3’s neck down to her waist, exposing her back, and massaged her using the paste like that in D2A, by applying it to the whole of her back. He started with massaging her neck, followed by her shoulders and then her waist, using his hand and elbow to do so. He said that she pointed to her waist and said “pain”. The accused then massaged PW3’s waist for about 15 minutes before his wife came in and asked him where PW3 felt unwell. The accused told Ding Jun that PW3 was a dancer and her waist was very tight and stiff, and that he was not able to loosen it. His wife then asked him to stand aside and watch how she did it.

103    The accused said that he suggested that his wife take over the massage, but she replied that she had another appointment. When Ding Jun was carrying out the massage for PW3, she pulled either PW3’s shorts or the panties downwards above the butt crack before continuing with the massage. He said that his wife massaged PW3 for around 30 over minutes, and PW3 complimented her on the massage. The accused said that he himself did not speak to PW3.

104    His wife then told the accused to press against four points on PW3’s buttocks using his elbow, and then left the room with the curtain one-third open. Thereafter, the accused worked on the four points using his elbow with the towel covering PW3. He also continued working on her waist, and used a tool to massage that area. When he had finished, it was already 75 minutes into the 90-minute massage. PW3 then agreed to change it to a 2 hour massage.

105    The accused said that he then started on PW3’s legs one at a time, and used the midline as a guide. He flipped the towel to the centre exposing one leg, while the other leg was covered by the towel. After massaging her leg, PW3 did not say anything to him. His wife came in briefly after he had finished. The accused said that he then wiped away the paste, covered her with the towel, and told PW3 to turn over. After that, he left the room and closed the curtain.

106    The accused later returned to the room and saw PW3 lying faced upwards, covered with a towel from her neck to her legs. The accused then started to work on the front of her legs. He did this by applying the paste and started on her shin first, followed by her knee, and then worked on the area below her mid-thigh. One of her legs was covered with the towel while the other leg that he was working on, was exposed all the way up to mid-thigh. The accused said that he massaged PW3 up to the mid-way line and then returned to the knee. He also said that his wife came in when he was massaging PW3 who was facing up at that time.

107    After he had finished massaging both of PW3’s legs, the accused said that he lifted her legs and asked her whether this was okay. When she answered, “okay”, he continued to lift her legs further until she said, “not okay”. He then slowly put her legs back and used the towel to cover her legs properly.

108    Following this, he massaged PW3’s head for 5 minutes and then told her that he had finished. He then left the room and closed the curtain. When he was at the walkway, he met his wife and told her that he had worked on this customer for 120 minutes. He subsequently did not speak to PW3 when she came out of the room. He also did not see PW3 again after that.

109    Throughout the time that he massaged PW3, the accused said that his wife entered the room about 3 or 4 times: once when he was pressing the four points on PW3’s buttock; once when he was pressing the back of her legs; and also after PW3 had turned over. The accused said that even though his wife was attending to a customer between 3.30 to 4.30 pm, it was possible for her to check on him, and that she would do so whether she had a customer or not.

110    In response to the specific allegations made by PW3, the accused said that he had only asked her to turn over once during the message. He denied slipping his thumb into her underwear and touching her vagina when she was facing downwards and when he was massaging her right upper thigh, or that PW3 had used her hand to block her pubic region in response. He further said that he did not touch her anus, or rub her vulva or buttock, and that he did not use his fingers to press her groin in a triangle on her pubic region when she was facing upwards.

111    In summary, the accused denied the allegations of molest made against him by the three victims. He insisted that he was very shocked and had not worked on those areas where they alleged that he had rubbed or touched them. He also said that before he applied the paste on them, he had told them about this, although he had not specifically shown them the paste indicated in D2A and D2B. The accused also said that fewer than five of his previous customers had complained that the paste was very hot and that there was a smell. In the case of the three victims, none of them had complained about the paste used on them as having caused them stinging and burning sensations. [^37]

112    The accused also said that for a female customer, he would only use his elbow but not his hands to massage her buttocks. The massage would also be done over a towel. He also said that for female customers, he would not usually massage their buttocks except when asked to do so by his wife. In the case of PW3, he had exerted pressure on her buttocks without asking her permission. This was because his wife had told him to exert pressure on the four spots; two of these spots were above the buttock and two were on the side. This was despite the fact that the accused had also testified that if the customer were female, his wife would not let him exert pressure above her mid-thigh, and the buttocks was above the mid-thigh level. [^38]

113    The accused also said that his wife had not taught him to massage the area above the mid-thigh level. Neither had she taught him to massage a woman’s groin area or the area where her leg connects with her hip. In fact, she had told him not to massage the inner thigh area near the vagina as massaging this area could be dangerous. [^39]

114    When asked if he had massaged any female other than PW3 on her buttocks, the accused replied: “I can’t recall because she is more special---because I---because I could remember that it was my wife who gave me the instructions. And as for the others, I can’t recall.” [^40] The accused stated that if he were supposed to massage above the thigh for any other woman, he would have asked his wife. However, the accused said he could not remember whether he had ever asked his wife about this before.

### Evidence of the accused’s wife: Ding Jun

115    The accused’s wife, DW2 Ding Jun (Ding Jun), testified for the Defence. She said that she has been married to the accused for nearly 30 years and arrived in Singapore in 1998, By then, the accused, was already working in Singapore.

116    Ding Jun said that she has a TCM practising certificate and that she knows medicine from her experience in a hospital in China. She said that she was the one running Genki Wellness even though this business was registered in the accused’s name. In March 2016, Genki Wellness employed five members of staff, including herself, the accused and other employees. At that time, the accused’s job was to attend to telephone calls and to cleanliness of the premises. He would also give massages when there was no other staff available.

117    As for the layout of Genki Wellness, Deng Jun said that there was a curtain made of bamboo beads in the centre of the shop, and that the shop has four massage rooms. The customer would be assigned one of these rooms based on availability. In the case of Genki Wellness, there was a standard procedure that if a massage was to be provided by a male masseur, he would leave the curtain one-third open, regardless of whether his customer was male or female. Ding Jun said that she learnt this practice of having a male masseur keep the curtain one-third open at a course she attended at the Spa Institute in 2010.

118    Ding Jun said that what she was taught at the institute was that for female masseurs, the curtain should be kept closed when they carry out massages for customers, regardless of the customers’ gender. However, for male masseurs, the curtain should be kept one-third open if the customer was female, so as to let the female customer feel safe. But that there was no requirement to keep the curtain open by one-third if the male masseur was massaging a male customer.

119    However, Ding Jun said that she had adapted the practice such that for Genki Wellness, the male masseur was required to have the curtain opened by one-third regardless of whether the customer was male or female. Ding Jun also said that aside from what she learnt from the Spa Institute, her experience with hospitals in China was that a male doctor would also have a female nurse present when examining a female patient. However, since there was no accompanying person when a male masseur was dealing with a female customer at Genki Wellness, Ding Jun said that she had introduced the practice of keeping the curtain one-third open whenever a male masseur was carrying out a massage.

120    Ding Jun also claimed that her female customers were aware of this practice in Genki Wellness for the curtain to be kept one-third open if massages were to be carried out by male masseurs. While she agreed that a female customer may be exposed if the curtain was kept one-third open during the massage, she claimed that the male masseurs had been instructed to close the curtain if they heard noises of people entering the premises. They were to open the curtain only after the person had walked past. The male masseur in the massage room thus had to be alert as to what was happening outside. She said that started to employ male employees in 2014.

121    Ding Jun said that the accused applied for the police licence for Genki Wellness to operate, and that she herself was not aware of the licensing conditions. Specifically, she was not aware that one of the conditions imposed was that male masseurs cannot carry out massages for female customers. This despite both the Prosecution and Defence accepting, as an agreed fact that:

> “…**_the condition that no male masseur can massage the female patron was in existence prior to 2009 and remained in force…until---and including 2016_**. In fact, they remain in force until early 2018. The condition has always been applied to all category 2 massage establishments with no exception. This is an agreed fact between Defence and Prosecution…It is not disputed that Genki Wellness is a category 2 massage parlour.”[^41]

\[emphasis added\]

122    Ding Jun claimed that they only knew about the condition against male masseurs providing massage service for female customers after the incidents had occurred. She admitted that the accused was convicted of three charges and fined for providing massage services to female patrons. Nevertheless, she disagreed that it was impossible for the Spa Institute to have taught about male masseurs massaging female patrons (when this was against the licensing conditions), and for them to keep the curtain one-third open when this was done. Ding Jun said that she would not tell customers that the curtains would be one-third open if the masseur was male.

123    Ding Jun further testified that she supervised the employees at Genki Wellness when they were providing massages, and that she would stand outside their rooms to look in, or would enter the rooms. There was no fixed timing or number of times she would conduct such spot checks, except that she would do so two or three times during a massage. She would carry out such checks even if she was carrying out massages for her own customers at that time. Ding Jun said that the purpose of these checks was to ensure that none of her employees was providing sexual services to the customer, and also to check with the customers how they felt about the massage, and whether the service provided was good.[^42] Aside from checking, Ding Jun said that she also personally handled payment so that she could have face to face interactions with the customers to find out if they have any final comments.

124    She said that for massages, the masseurs would normally use medicated oil which they apply to the back and thigh region, and the area of injury of the customer. When applied to the body, the customer would experience a cool and prickly feeling, and after the massage, there would be a warm feeling.

125    As regards, the charges involving the respective victims, Ding Jun’s evidence is set out below.

#### Account of her encounter with PW1

126    Ding Jun said that she met PW1 at the counter of Genki Wellness on 11 March 2016, and then led PW1 to room 3. She said that she drew the curtain, waited outside the room, and after one or two minutes, she opened the curtain and went into the room and saw PW1 lying face downwards covered by a towel. PW1 told Ding Jun that she felt very tired on her neck, shoulders and leg. Ding Jun then asked if PW1 would like oil to be applied and PW1 said yes. Ding Jun then used the paste shown in exhibit D2A.

127    In the course of massaging PW1, she saw that the latter was wearing tight shorts. She also found that the muscle around PW1’s waist region was very taut, tight and stiff. PW1 told Ding Jun that she was a dancer and Ding Jun massaged her waist for about 10 minutes. Ding Jun then told PW1 that she could not solve her problem and asked if PW1 would mind her getting a male masseur to resolve her problems. Ding Jun also said that she would oversee the male masseur by the side.

128    Ding Jun said that she then opened the curtain and went to look for the accused and told him to carry out the massage for PW1. She told the accused to use his elbows to massage the most painful part of PW1’s waist. Ding Jun then left the room and went to attend to another customer who was at the counter. She said that she left the curtain completely opened when she left the room. This was done even when there was still another customer in the shop.

129    After this, Ding Jun said she went to the bed at room 1, which was located directly opposite room 3. Ding Jun said that she sat at the end that was near to the door, with the curtain to the room kept open. Ding Jun said that the time she left room 3 until she went to room 1 was around 5 minutes.

130    When she was at room 1, Ding Jun said that she was checking on her handphone as she was learning from the director of the Radiation Department about radiation and also about how to examine X-ray films. Ding Jun said that she also sat there as she had promised PW1 that she would be watching from the side. Hence, while looking at her handphone, she also watched the accused carry out the massage for PW1.

131    Ding Jun said that she did not go into room 3 but she could see PW1 lying face down, and that accused was in the room the whole time. She said that she did not stay in the same room with the accused, despite earlier promising PW1 that she would stay by her side, since she (Ding Jun) was tired that day. Subsequently, Ding Jun claimed that when she told PW1 that she would stay beside her, this meant that she would be somewhere around PW1,[^43] and not necessarily be at her side.

132    Ding Jun testified that the accused only left room 3 when he told PW1 to turn around. He then closed the curtain. He subsequently asked PW1 if she was ready before he re-entered the room. She said that the accused drew the curtain completely opened when he entered the room. Ding Jun said that she could see that PW1’s legs were parallel to each other when the accused was massaging her. Ding Jun also said that she did not find anything unusual during the time that the accused was massaging PW1.

133    After the massage, Ding Jun said that she went to the counter to get a cup of water for PW1 and waited for her to come out. After PW1 came out of the room, Ding Jun said that PW1 told her that the massage was very good. Ding Jun even claimed that at the counter, she had introduced an AIA insurance policy to PW1, and had spoken to her for about 15 minutes. PW1 then made payment and left. The accused was not at the reception area when she collected money from PW1. Ding Jun said that she has not seen PW1 since then.

#### Account of her encounter with PW2

134    On 13 March 2016, at about 3.00 pm, when both Ding Jun and the accused were at the counter, PW2 had arrived at Genki Wellness with a friend. PW2 informed that she had a 3 pm appointment and that it was for two persons. Ding Jun replied that they had to wait while she finished with a customer. They then went outside the shop to wait.

135    Subsequently, after Ding Jun had finished, PW2 and her female friend approached her and Ding Jun asked which of them was prepared to accept a male masseur for the leg massage. PW2 agreed to this, and Ding Jun informed the accused to carry out the massage for PW2. The accused then brought PW2 to room 4 for the massage.

136    Ding Jun said that about 5 or 10 minutes later, Ding Jun went to check on the 4 massage rooms. During this time, she entered the room where the accused was massaging PW2 and remained there for about 1 or 2 minutes.

137    Subsequently, Ding Jun entered the room once more when the accused was massaging PW2. She said that the curtain to the room was about one-third open when she went there on both occasions. Ding Jun said that she did not notice anything unusual when she entered the room. Ding Jun said that she next saw PW2 at the counter after her massage. Ding Jun had asked her if she felt comfortable and PW2 replied that the massage was very good, and she paid $75 in cash. PW2’s friend who was also there paid $60 in cash. Ding Jun said that they then left the shop together. She did not notice if the accused was at the reception area at that time.

#### Account of her encounter with PW3

138    On 4 March 2016, Ding Jun had arrived at Genki Wellness sometime in the afternoon although she could not remember what time this was. She went there to attend to a customer called Jun, who wanted acupuncture treatment. Ding Jun said that she had quarrelled with the accused (her husband) the day before so they went to Genki Wellness separately that day.

139    When she reached there, Ding Jun said that there was no one else in the shop other than the accused who was in room 2 attending to PW3. The latter was lying face down, with a towel covering her from her waist region down to her feet. The curtain to the room was one-third open. When Ding Jun enquired about PW3, the accused said that she was a dancer and that the muscle around her waist was very tight and that he was not able to solve her problem. When he requested for help from Ding Jun, the latter replied that she could not help as she had an appointment to provide acupuncture treatment. However, she did ask the accused to stand aside as she decided to massage PW3 on the right side of her waist first. She used the paste (shown in D2A) and massaged PW3 on the skin all the way down to the coccyx region, but did not massage PW3’s legs. She confirmed that she massaged the space between the belt line and the butt crack of PW3, but not the “fleshy parts” of her buttocks.

140    Ding Jun said that after doing this for a period of time, PW3 turned to her and said that her massage was very good and requested that Ding Jun continue the massage for her. However, Ding Jun said that she could not do so as she had another appointment. She also told PW3 that she would need to make a booking for a massage with her in the future. Ding Jun then continued massaging PW3 for a short period of time, with the accused standing beside her.

141    Ding Jun said that when she heard the sound of the main door, she pulled down the towel and PW3’s shorts to the coccyx region to expose the tip of the end of her spine, and told the accused to massage the three acupuncture points on each side of the buttocks region and to do so using his elbow. Ding Jun’s said that the massage she carried out for PW3 lasted for about 30 minutes, although she subsequently admitted that this timing was only a guess.

142    Ding Jun said that she left the curtain one-third open and then went to attend to another customer whom she brought to the room opposite to where the accused was carrying out the massage for PW3. Ding Jun said that she used this room so that she could observe the accused carrying on the massage for PW3. Ding Jun said that she later returned to room 2 and saw the accused using his elbow to massage PW3 on her buttocks over the towel, and that she remained in the room for about 1 or 2 minutes before returning to room 4.

143    Aside from this occasion, Ding Jun said that she went back to room 2 for a total of three more times. The first time, she saw the accused working on PW3’s leg with PW3 still facing downwards. The next time she entered the room, Ding Jun asked PW3 if she was ok, and the latter raised her hand, made the “okay” sign and also said ok. On the final time that Ding Jun went into the room, PW3 was facing upwards while the accused was working on the front part of her leg. Ding Jun did not do or say anything on this occasion.

144    The next time Ding Jun saw PW3 was at the counter, when she asked PW3 whether the latter felt ok, and PW3 replied that she was “okay, good, good”. Ding Jun testified that before PW3 left, she complimented Ding Jun and even went to the extent of making another appointment with her. Ding Jun said that “…at the same time I also asked her “you want booking next time?” She replied to me “I want booking next---next Friday 2:00.”” [^44]

145    Ding Jun said that PW3 then made payment to her using NETS for an amount of $115. The receipt for this payment indicated the time of payment as 16:28. While Ding Jun also claimed that PW3 then made an appointment for another massage session, she was not able to show this from her records. Subsequently, Ding Jun never saw PW3 again.

146    When asked how she felt about the allegations made against the accused that he had molested the three victims, Ding Jun said that she was shocked and insisted that these incidents could not have happened as she was at the scene, and she did not hear or feel anything unusual. Ding Jun also said that she was not aware of anyone else having made similar allegations against the accused.

### Evidence of DW3 Lim Chin Chin (“Ms Lim”)

147    Ms Lim is a senior consultant forensic scientist with the Forensic Experts Group. She was engaged by the Defence to examine the bottle of rheumatism paste (D2A) for the presence of 2 specific ingredients, menthol and methyl salicylate, and to describe the topical effects of these items based on scientific literature. [^45]

148    While admitting that it was possible to do so, Ms Lim did not look at, or test for, the other 14 ingredients listed on the bottle of rheumatism paste that was allegedly used to massage the victims. Nor was Ms Lim asked to consider the effect of these ingredients, or whether and/or how much they would affect the menthol and methyl salicylate contained in D2A. Neither did she do a quantification of the menthol and methyl salicylate in the bottle of rheumatism paste, nor did she test the paste on anyone. [^46]

149    Ms Lim had stated that based on the scientific literature, the sensory impact of menthol when applied to skin or mucosal surface, depends on its concentration, with low concentrations giving a cool sensation whereas high concentrations of 2 to 5 per cent of menthol cause irritation and local anaesthesia, and a burning sensation when applied to the skin. As for the methyl salicylate, high concentrations of 6 to 18 per cent cause strong burning sensations. Ms Lim also said that the sensation felt depends on the concentration of the item applied, and where on the body it was applied.

## Rebuttal evidence

150    ASP Almeida Tay was called as a rebuttal witness by the Prosecution. The Defence did not object to this application.

151    ASP Tay was the former investigation officer (IO) for this case. She has a bachelor’s degree from the National University of Singapore, and confirmed that she is trained in the recording of statements. She had recorded a statement from the accused on 3 April 2016 (P10), which was about 24 hours after the accused was arrested on 2 April 2016. At his request, the accused had given his account in Mandarin, and the statement was recorded by ASP Tay in English.

152    ASP Tay confirmed that she is proficient in Mandarin, although she agreed that she is not a certified interpreter. However, she said that it was not the “SOP” to get an interpreter as she is proficient in Mandarin and it is ok for her, a Chinese officer, to do the interpretation.

153    ASP Tay also said that for the statement recording, she understood what the accused said, and would clarify with him if she did not understand. She denied that she had mistranslated what he had said in the statement, or that there had been any failure in communication between them in the course of recording the statement, as she understood him perfectly. ASP Tay also said that as far as she was aware, the accused (and also Ding Jun, whose statement (P12) she also recorded) understood her when she was recording their statements.

154    ASP Tay confirmed that as regards the accused’s statement, he had signed on each page of his statement. At the end of the statement recording, she had read the statement back to him and invited him to make changes. This resulted in him making an amendment at A10, wherein he had stated in Mandarin in his own words that “Also, I never massaged her vagina”. ASP Tay had then handwritten these words in English on the statement at A10.

155    ASP Tay denied including in the statement words that the accused had not said. She also disagreed that she had inaccurately recorded his statement, and specifically denied that the accused had not said the words (in P10) that: “When I massage their upper thigh, I will pull up their shorts and lay a towel on the vagina, I will then massage their upper thigh”, or that she had added these words in by herself. ASP Tay also confirmed that the answers to questions Q4, Q6, Q10, Q11 and Q11A, and Q12 i.e. what appear as A4, A6, A10, A11 and A12 in P10, were answers provided by the accused to those stated questions. However, she admitted that she had made an error at paragraph 2, when the accused had said “10.30 am” but she had mis-recorded this as “10.30 pm”.

156    ASP Tay denied that during the statement recording process, the accused was angry. She stated that he did not shout nor was he aggressive. Instead, ASP Tay described the accused as co-operative. She also did not tell him that she had the means to make him plead guilty, nor had she informed him that she would “do a lie detection”. Further, during the statement recording, the accused did not request for food, medication, a toilet break or any kind of break. Nor did he appear to be faint or light-headed, but appeared to be ok. After the statement P10 was recorded, it was printed out and read back to the accused in the same interview room (room 12), before he was asked to sign on the statement.

157    ASP Tay also said that the accused had requested for medication the day before the statement recording, and they had gotten the doctor to verify the medication and also to check if there were any injuries on him. ASP Tay said that no injury was discovered on him.

## Summary of Defence’s Submissions

158    The Defence’s arguments were presented in its “Defence’s Closing Submissions” (119 pages), “Defence’s Closing Submissions” (48 pages) and “Defence’s Rebuttal Submissions” (9 pages). I have set out – in an outline form – the main arguments of the Defence.

159    In essence, the defence was that a bare denial, as the accused had claimed that he did not massage the victims higher up their legs than the mid-thigh level, and also did not rub or touch their groin or private parts as set out in the charges. The Defence further suggested that there was “contamination of evidence”, although counsel later clarified that the Defence was “… more going on the basis that there could be a situation of contamination by innocent infection, not so much that it was a malicious or---or intentional lie because we have no evidence of any ulterior motive on the part of the…victims.”[^47] The main aspects of the Defence, as distilled from its submissions, are set out below.

160    In essence, the Defence argued that the victims’ accounts were unreliable and not unusually convincing. Specifically, their evidence “reveals their numerous internal and external inconsistencies, illogical evidence, and penchant for exaggeration or an inability to remember as it suited them”. The Defence also argued that the Prosecution had failed to address the inconsistencies raised, or the victims’ changing evidence.

161    The Defence, in particular, alleged that:

> (a)     PW1 and PW3 gave “…unbelievable and nonsensical” evidence (paragraphs 43 to 54 and 132 to 180 of the Defence’s Submissions). Amongst other things, the Defence argued that as PW1’s vagina was underneath her boy shorts and underwear, it was illogical and physically impossible for the accused’s hands to reach and touch her genitals.

> (b)     As for PW3, the Defence argued that she could not have been asked by the accused to flip three times, since she had attended the same kind of massage as PW1 and PW2, both of whom only flipped once. Moreover, if she had been inappropriately touched by the accused at an earlier point in the massage session, it made no sense for her to continue with the massage and be further molested. Also, PW3’s evidence about her reactions to the accused’s actions were inconsistent, or illogical, and that PW3 had a tendency to embellish her answers in Court (paragraphs 173 and 196 to 200 of the Defence’s Submissions). Amongst other things, the Defence alleged that PW3 had concocted evidence about what the accused had said to her in English, when there was no evidence to suggest that he had any English speaking ability at all.

> (c)     There were internal inconsistencies in each of the victim’s evidence (paragraphs 55 to 77, 83 to 96 and 160 to 180 of the Defence’s Submissions). Amongst other things, the Defence argued that the victims gave inconsistent accounts about how the accused allegedly touched them, about their reactions to his actions, and about the circumstances leading up to their making of the police reports. The Defence further took issue with the fact that the Prosecution had made amendments to the charges initially tendered against the accused.

> (d)     The Defence further argued that there were external inconsistencies in the victims’ evidence, such as regards whether they had previously been provided by a gown to wear when they visited Genki Wellness, and how they contradicted each other in relation to how and why they decided to lodge a police report (paragraphs 181 to 195 of the Defence’s Submissions).

162    In addition, the Defence made the claim that “(t)he facts surrounding the complaints are highly suspicious” and alluded to the possibility that the victims, who knew one another, had colluded or that there had been innocent infection, leading to the false allegations. The Defence pointed out that they had discussed the matter and argued that they had contaminated one another’s evidence. At the same time, the Defence argued that “it is highly suspicious” that the victims “gave differing versions in Court of how they met, what they discussed, and how they decided to report the matter to the police”. [^48]

163    Further, the Defence took issue with how and why the victims decided to make the police report, after they met one another two to four weeks after the incidents. Counsel further argued that: “It is simply unlikely and improbable that \[the accused\] chose to molest three women who all miraculously attended the same dance studio and knew each other”[^49], and submitted that there was “a very real risk that the \[victims\] transferred their recollections to each other, and wrongly accused \[the accused\] of outraging their modesty”. [^50] Much was also made about the manner in which the victims reacted to the offences, their delay in the reporting of the offences, and the presence of other persons in the shop (citing the case of _PP v Wee Teong Boo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 56</span> (“_Wee Teong Boo_”).[^51]

164    As regards the accused’s evidence, the Defence argued that:

> (a)     The inconsistencies between his evidence in court and a statement recorded from him in April 2016 should be disregarded as it was not shown that the statement was interpreted to him. Instead, the Deference argued that his statement P10, recorded in April 2016, substantiated his argument that the curtain was left one-third open, although what was recorded was that he had said that he had left a 15 cm gap. The Defence alleged that the statement was “inaccurately and haphazardly recorded by IO Tay, and was not interpreted back to \[the accused\] in Mandarin”, and it was therefore unsafe to rely on it. [^52] Further, the Defence argued that inconsistencies between his statement and his testimony about whether he massaged the buttocks of female customers, should be disregarded since, his explanation in court that he meant that he massaged the buttocks of “male” customers only, should be accepted, even if no such “clarification” appeared in the statement.

> (b)     In addition, the Defence said that the accused was confused in court when he was confronted with his April statement, apparently because he had not said those things to the recorder.

165    The Defence also highlighted the case of _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> (“_Nabill_”) where the Court of Appeal had held that the Prosecution was under a duty to disclose to the Defence a material witness’s statement which might tend to support the defence (at \[44\]), and that the disclosure should take place before trial began (at \[50\]). The Defence argued that even though the Prosecution failed to do so in that they did not disclose the accused’s June 2016 statement (D17) before trial, that statement in fact supported the Defence’s case, in that it corroborates his evidence that:

> (a)     The room curtain would be left one-third open, and not 15cm open, whenever he was conducting a massage on a female client (paragraphs 285 to 289 of the Defence’s Submissions);

> (b)     That he does not massage female customers above the mid-thigh line (paragraphs 290 to 294 of the Defence’s Submissions); and

> (c)     He massaged PW3 for 30 minutes before Ding Jun took over a portion of the massage, and that it was Ding Jun who pulled down PW3’s panties (paragraphs 295 to 298 of the Defence’s Submissions).

166    Further, the Defence disputed the Prosecution’s arguments that there were discrepancies between the accused’s evidence and that of his wife and instead argued that their evidence was in that they showed that:

> (a)     For PW1, Ding Jun had massaged her for half an hour before the accused took over; and

> (b)     For PW3, it was Ding Jun and not the accused who had lowered her panties to half her buttocks.

167    The Defence also argued that the accused’s evidence was consistent with that of Ms Lim, who had testified that the paste, which the accused had applied, contained herbal menthol and methyl salicylate, and that even in low concentrations, the application of these ingredients would result in a sensation of coolness, warmth and/or irritation on the skin. The Defence contended that since the victims did not testify that they felt any warm, cool, tingly or stinging sensation on their private parts, the logical conclusion must be that the accused did not touch their private parts. In addition, the Defence submitted that since the Prosecution had failed to call an expert witness to challenge Ms Lim’s expert evidence, such evidence, which was based on sound grounds and supported by basic facts, should be accepted by the Court.

168    Finally, the Defence emphasised the improbability and unlikelihood of the accused being able to commit the offences in a public place, reiterating that his evidence that the curtain was left one-third open was credible.

## Summary of Prosecution’s Submissions

169    The Prosecution’s position was put forward in its “Prosecution’s End of Trial Submissions” (79 pages) and “Prosecution’s Rebuttal Submissions” (41 pages). As with the Defence submissions, I have summarised the main points put forward by the Prosecution below.

170    Essentially, the Prosecution’s position was that the accused had taken the opportunity to outrage each of the victim’s modesty when he performed full body massages on them as detailed in the three charges framed against him.

171    In this regard, the victims’ evidence about the allegations was consistent and unusually convincing, and the challenges by the Defence against them, including on their post assault behaviour, lateness in making the police reports, and the alleged impossibility of committing the offences, largely “rely on propositions that the Courts have been slow to accept”. In particular:

> (a)     As regards the Defence’s arguments about how victims of such offences are expected to act during or after the assault, the High Court in _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”) had made it clear that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed to act in a certain manner. Moreover, the DPP pointed out that the victims did testify about their reactions and emotions when molested by the accused.

> (b)     The Prosecution also pointed out that the victims had explained the circumstances that led to their making of the police reports.

172    In addition, the Prosecution submitted that the accused was evasive, and his evidence was self-serving and did not accord with common sense or logic. There were other matters raised by the Defence which the Prosecution highlighted as being of no assistance to the Defence.

173    For one, the Prosecution took issue with the accused’s claim that he had left the curtain one-third open when carrying out the massage of the victims, as being absurd and illogical:

> (a)     First, this alleged policy was never told to patrons who were undergoing massage, even thought they would be each in a state of undress at the time they were being massaged by a male masseur. Moreover, the accused was evasive and refused to admit that the purpose of having a curtain was to protect the privacy of the customer even thought this was patently obvious. Further, the evidence of Ding Jun was that the accused has to draw the curtains fully when he hears others approaching. This “effectively negated any opportunity for occasional surveillance by people passing by”.[^53]

> (b)     In any event, the Prosecution argued that even if the curtain was indeed kept one-third open, this does not preclude the commission of the offences, citing the case of _PP v GCD_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 23</span> (“_GCD_”), where the outrage of modesty had taken place inside a classroom of a music school. The Court there recognised that offences of molest had previously been committed even in public places in the presence of potential witnesses. Added to the fact that it was Ding Jun’s evidence that the accused could hear people approaching the room and he was supposed to react by closing the curtain, the Prosecution argued that having the curtain opened by one-third would not hinder the commission of the offences. Neither would the number of times that Ding Jun allegedly entered the room when the accused was carrying out the massages for the victims prevent them, especially since the duration of the massages was such that the accused would have plenty of opportunities to commit the offences, even if Ding Jun entered the room periodically. In addition, even Ding Jun’s evidence that she was observing the massage carried out by the accused on PW1 did not assist the accused, especially since Ding Jun was distracted and not observing the accused throughout the process.

174    The Prosecution also argued that the accused was not a credible witness, but was inconsistent and also petulant.

> (a)     For one, there was a discrepancy between his evidence in court and his testimony over whether the curtain was kept one-third open or one-sixth open (i.e. with a 15 cm gap out of a room width of 90 cm). Also, the accused did not, and was not able to, explain why he left the curtain one-third open during the duration of the massage session.

> (b)     There was also a discrepancy over whether the accused massaged the buttocks of his customers, as he gave a different account in court from the account given in his statement. When asked to explain the discrepancy between the two different versions, the accused instead, responded in a petulant manner instead.[^54]

> (c)     The Prosecution highlighted the accused’s repeated claims of confusion when confronted with discrepancies between the account he gave in court, and the account he gave in his statement over such things as whether he massaged customers’ buttocks, over whether he remembered PW3 when he gave his statement to the police, and whether he had told the police about massaging the thighs of female customers.

> (d)     The Prosecution also took issue with the accused’s denials of the admissions contained in his April statement, including about massaging his female customer’s upper thighs, and massing near their vagina area.

175    Further, with regards the witnesses for the Defence, the Prosecution argued that Ding Jun had also qualified and backtracked on many of her claims made in examination-in-chief. She was also unable to explain why there was a policy of keeping the curtain one-third open when the accused was massaging his customers, when the customers were in states of undress. The Prosecution further submitted that there were serious discrepancies between the accounts of Ding Jun and the accused in relation to who pulled down PW3’s panties, and that this called into doubt Ding Jun’s account that it was she, rather than the accused, who pulled PW3’s panties down. The Prosecution argued that Ding Jun’s version was given to exonerate the accused.

176    As for the Defence witness, Ms Lim, it was argued that she only conducted “very rudimentary tests” on the paste purportedly used on the victims, and her test results did little to advance the accused’s assertion of innocence. This was because she confined her analysis of the paste to only confirming that “Herba Menthol” and “Methyl Salicylate” were present, but not as to their quantities. Further she did not analyse the other 14 components of the paste, even though they made up the bulk (96%) of the paste according to the label on the bottle of the paste. Also, the scientific studies that Ms Lim relied on about the effects of menthol and methyl salicylate were unhelpful, and there was no experiment carried out to show the effect of the paste, especially if it would produce the “tingling or burning sensations” claimed.

## The Court’s decision on the charges

177    I start off my analysis by summarising the main legal principles that apply to such cases, before setting out my views on the evidence and arguments presented on the main issues. I will then explain how I reached the decision on whether the charges have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

### The Applicable Law

#### The unusually convincing standard

178    In _Winston Lee Siew Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 186</span> (“_Winston Lee_”), Justice Chan Seng Onn had to deal with an appeal against conviction and sentence for a case which involved a doctor who was alleged to have committed an offence of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code against his patient. After reviewing the relevant cases on the matter, Chan J summarised the relevant legal principles at \[68\] as follows:

> (a)    The legal burden on the prosecution remains to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This is the ultimate question that the court has to determine after a holistic examination of all the relevant evidence.

> (b)    In the absence of corroboration, this burden may be satisfied if the trial court finds the complainant’s evidence to be unusually convincing such that it is safe to convict solely on her evidence. In making this assessment, the trial court assesses the complainant’s credibility by weighing the _demeanour_ of the complainant alongside both the _internal and external consistencies_ found in the complainant’s testimony.

> (c)    On an appeal against a conviction where the trial judge has found the complainant’s evidence to be unusually convincing, appellate intervention is only warranted where the internal and external inconsistencies of the complainant’s evidence show that the trial judge is _plainly wrong_ in arriving at his conclusion that the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing. This is because an appellate court does not have the benefit of assessing the demeanour of the complainant, unlike the trial judge.

> (d)    Even where the evidence of the complainant is not unusually convincing, the legal burden of the prosecution may still be discharged if there is sufficient corroboration. The trial judge should identify which aspect of the evidence is not so convincing before looking for supporting evidence and ask whether, in taking the weak evidence together with the supporting corroborative evidence, he is satisfied as a whole that the prosecution's case is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard, corroboration is approached in a practical manner. The court looks at the substance and relevance of the evidence to determine if it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate.

> (e)    As indicated above, the question at the end of the day, after a holistic examination of all the relevant evidence before the court, remains whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

179    In _PP v GCK_ \[2020\] SGHA 2 (“_GCK_”), another case involving a charge of outrage of modesty, the Court of Appeal elaborated on the “unusually convincing” standard that applies where the witness’ uncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for conviction. The Court stated:

> \[88\]  The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that “a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]). The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’s demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.

> \[89\]  …. In the absence of any other corroborative evidence, the testimony of a witness, whether an eyewitness or an alleged victim, becomes the keystone upon which the Prosecution’s entire case will rest. Such evidence can sustain a conviction only if it is “unusually convincing” and thereby capable of overcoming any concerns arising from the lack of corroboration and the fact that such evidence will typically be controverted by that of the accused person: see the decision of this court in _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_AOF_”) at \[111\].

> \[90\]  Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard entails that the witness’s testimony _alone_ is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt: see _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[73\]. The overwhelming consideration that triggers the application of the standard is the _amount_ and _availability_ of evidence: see also _Kwan Peng Hong_ at \[29\].

180    In _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ \[2018\] SGHC 09 (“_Kunasekaran”)_, yet another outrage of modesty case, Justice Chan Seng Onn emphasised that all the evidence, both evidence adduced by the Prosecution and evidence adduced by the Defence, have to be considered to determine if the charge has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. His Honour stated:

> \[27\]  …it is necessary for a court to assess _all_ the relevant evidence when determining whether the Prosecution’s case is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, **_a court, when considering whether the victim’s evidence is “unusually convincing”, must “assess the victim’s testimony against that of the accused”, such that the victim is found to be “unusually convincing” to the extent that “the court can safely say his account is to be unreservedly preferred over that of another”:_** _XP v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 107</span> at \[34\] _per_ V K Rajah JA.

\[emphasis added\]

181    A similar approach was adopted in _GCK_ where at \[129\] of the judgement, the Court of Appeal made clear that in assessing a case, the Judge has to look at all the evidence presented both parties in deciding if it is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the offence with which the accused person is charged. The Court added at \[148\]:

> **_In the context of the uncorroborated evidence of an eyewitness, whether his or her account is considered unusually convincing (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt) requires an assessment of the internal and external consistencies of the account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider. Such other evidence necessarily requires a consideration of the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person (or the lack thereof)._** We would also add that a finding must be made as to the relevant facts before the court directs itself to the ultimate inquiry of whether the Prosecution’s case has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

\[emphasis added\]

#### Credibility and Discrepancies

182    In so far as the assessment of the credibility of a witness is concerned, Yong Pung How CJ in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> had held at \[9\] that a judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following: - (a) his demeanour, (b) the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence, and (c) the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and the extrinsic evidence.

183    The law, however, recognises that discrepancies in the evidence of a witness does not _ipso facto_ mean that the witness should not be believed.

184    In _Osman Bin Din v Public Prosecutor_ \[1995\] 2 SLR 129, the Court of Appeal at \[39\] cited with approval the following reminder of Abdul Hamid J in _Chean Siong Guan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span>:

> Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. **_Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies_**_._ Absolute truth is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. **_In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court_**_…_

\[emphasis added\]

185    Similarly, in _Public Prosecutor v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (_No 2) <span class="citation">\[1977\] 1 MLJ 15</span>, Raja Azlan Shah FJ had stated:

> **_I shall be almost inclined to think that if there are no discrepancies, it might be suggested that they have concocted their accounts of what had happened or what had been said because their versions are too consistent_**. The question is whether the existence of certain discrepancies is sufficient to destroy their credibility...

\[emphasis added\]

186    Further in _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> at \[13\], Yong Pung How CJ (as the then was) had this to say:

> Counsel for the appellant sought to make a great deal out of these discrepancies. In the appeal to this court, the trial judge was criticised for having accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses despite the presence of these discrepancies. **_The short answer to this was that the discrepancies relied on by the appellant were all immaterial discrepancies, that is, they had no direct bearing on the facts in issue. In other words, they had nothing to do with the question whether it was the appellant who committed the offence._** In my judgment, the trial judge was perfectly entitled to find that these discrepancies did not detract from the general veracity of the prosecution witnesses on the material issues and to accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses on those issues.”

\[emphasis added\]

187    Finally, in _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[82\], V K Rajah J (as he then was) stated that:

> It is trite law **_that minor discrepancies in a witness’s testimony should not be held against the witness in assessing his credibility. This is because human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is both common and understandable:_** Chean Siong Guat v PP <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span> (“Chean Siong Guat”) at 63–64; Ng Kwee Leong v PP <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> at \[17\]. Inconsistencies in a witness’s statement may also be the result of different interpretations of the same event: Chean Siong Guat… But a court is perfectly entitled, notwithstanding minor inconsistencies, to hold that a particular witness is in fact a witness of truth and to accept the other aspects of his testimony which are untainted by discrepancies.

\[emphasis added\]

188    Bearing in mind the guidance set out by the courts in the approach to take in assessing the evidence and the credibility of witnesses, I now turn to discuss the main issues, and the evidence and arguments put forward before me.

### The main disputes between parties

189    The main evidence against the accused on each of the three charges consisted of the evidence of the victims for the respective charges, although there was also reliance on some aspects of the evidence of the Defence witnesses, and on admissions that the accused had made in his April 2016 statement (P10). In essence, all the victims had alleged that the accused used criminal force to molest them in the manner set out in the charges.

190    As for the Defence, the critical aspect of the accused’s case was his denial that he had massaged beyond the mid-thighs of the three victims. The other evidence brought up by the Defence related to the unlikelihood of the offences having taken place, bearing in mind that the massages were allegedly carried out with the curtain one-third open, with Ding Jun observing the massages, or in a position to enter the room and observe the accused carrying out the massages, and also because the victims had not said that they felt a tinging or stinging sensation on the parts of their body where they were allegedly molested. It was argued that such sensations should have resulted from the paste the accused allegedly used when he massaged them.

191    I will now deal with the various matters relevant to deciding whether the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the three charges.

### The victims gave highly convincing accounts

192    There were no eye-witnesses to the offences alleged by any of the victims. As noted by Justice Chan Seng Onn in _Winston Lee_, and by the Court of Appeal in _GCK_, in assessing whether a witness is “unusually convincing”, the Court would consider such factors as the victim’s demeanour, as well as whether her evidence is internally and externally consistent, and assess her testimony against the Defence’s case, including the evidence of the accused.

193    I will first deal with each victim’s evidence for her respective charge.

#### PW1’s charge: PW1’s evidence was highly believable

194    As reflected in the charge involving PW1, the accused was alleged to have outraged her modesty by sliding his hand under her panties and rubbing her vulva. This took place during her visit to Genki Wellness on 11 March 2016 when the accused carried out his massage on her. I was of the view that PW1’s account of the commission of the offence by the accused was highly believable, and her evidence was clearly compelling.

195    When PW1 visited Genki Wellness on 11 March 2016 itself, PW1 had worn boy shorts for the massage. Her boy shorts were tied but not fitting, and they moved up when she bent her leg to form a V, which she did when requested by the accused to do so during the massage. PW1’s shorts were also made of material that was stretchable, and she confirmed that it was possible for the accused to insert his fingers under her boy shorts and her panties. Further, the DPP highlighted that the end of the boy shorts was only 2 inches from the vagina. Thus, contrary to the claims of the Defence, it was entirely possible for the accused to have molested her in the manner that PW1 testified to.

196    PW1 was also steadfast in her account that during the accused’s massage of her upper thigh area, she could feel the accused use his hand to go under her boy shorts and her underwear, and massage her pubic area and touch her vagina (i.e. vulva). As a result of the accused’s actions, PW1 candidly shared that she could feel that she was wet and could hear the sound of her own body.

197    In this regard, I noted that the molest of PW1 took place while she was lying down undergoing a massage by the accused, and she was thus not in a position to see his hand come into contact with “the outer lips of her vagina”. This, plus the fact that the entire process was dynamic, and the accused had used one or two hands at different points in time and in different ways when he massaged her, likely explained the ambiguity as to how the accused touched her.[^55] In any event, based on her other senses, PW1 was clear that the accused had indeed touched her vagina (vulva) with his hand, as she not only felt him touching her, but also could feel, hear and describe her own reaction to the contact that he made with her private part.

198    I also noted PW1’s testimony that the contact that the accused made with her private part took place in the context of a massage that he was carrying out on her upper thigh region. While she was uncomfortable at what he did, PW1 initially thought that his contact with her private parts was accidental. She also testified that as a result of his actions, she felt confused, vulnerable, and wasn’t thinking rationally or coherently as she was in a state of shock and that she “really didn’t know what to do”.[^56]

199    It was only when the accused subsequently repeated his actions, by touching her vagina when massaging her other leg, that she reacted more firmly by saying “no” in Chinese (“bu yao”) to the accused. However, even then, she did not react very loudly because she was scared. PW1 also used her hands to block and press on her groin area. However, the accused continued with his actions for another two or three minutes.

200    While the Defence repeatedly questioned and tried to cast doubt on PW1’s claims that she had been molested on account of the way she reacted to the accused’s actions, and because of her failure to stop him, I agreed with the Prosecution that victims should not be expected to conform to certain actions, or be required to react in fixed ways, before their evidence could be believed.

201    In this regard, I can do no better than to quote the words of See Kee Oon J in _GBR_ who made it abundantly clear that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed to behave in only a certain way. At \[20\], his Honour had stated:

> \[20\]  I should add that I saw absolutely no merit in the appellant’s insinuation that the victim must have been making false allegations against him because her behaviour at and around the time of the alleged offence was atypical of a victim of a sexual crime. **_I shared the District Judge’s view (at \[68\] of the GD) that victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner_**. The fact that the victim was young, sexually inexperienced and was thus likely to have been taken aback by the appellant’s unexpected but brazen conduct meant that her reaction was well within the realm of possibilities and indeed would have been perfectly foreseeable.”

\[emphasis added\]

202    I would add that while the Defence mounted a forceful challenge against PW1 on her testimony, and while she was clearly uncomfortable when talking about her private parts being violated and the reactions that his actions caused to her body, PW1 was nevertheless firm and sure in the evidence that the accused had definitely carried out the offending actions of rubbing the side of her vagina (vulva) in the course of massaging her thighs. Thus, despite repeated and intense questioning by counsel, PW1 maintained the same account throughout, and was consistent on all material matters. There was certainly no indication that she had made up a story, or that that she was testifying about a false or imagined account.

203    The Defence also alluded to the late reporting by PW1 of the offence committed against her to the police, and argued that this cast further doubt on her claim that she had been molested. In her case, PW1 had taken 3 weeks (from the date of the incident) to make the police report. When questioned, PW1 had explained that she needed some time to process what had happened and what to do next, and that she was confused and needed to put her emotions in place “because it was like in a mess”, and “…there were already a lot of things going through my head. So if there are multiple things coming out that are conflict---that are in conflict, that was really what I was going through.”.[^57] Thus, it was only after speaking to PW2 and PW3, that she realised what had been done to her by the accused was intentional, and also about the severity of his acts. She also explained that she had “never been in in such a situation before”.[^58] In addition, PW1 revealed that her parents had also expressed a concern that the accused would see her face and she would be in danger.

204    I found PW1’s account and explanation to be entirely believable. In this regard, her behaviour, influenced by her initial sense of confusion and doubt, was wholly consistent with her relatively passive reaction even when the accused was taking advantage of her. In the circumstances, I certainly did not consider the fact that she did not make an immediate police report to have affected her credibility in a negative way.

205    In this regard, I would highlight to the words of Justice Aedit Abdullah in _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> (“_Yue Roger Jr_”), where his Honour found that the young victim’s failure to report the offences, until five years later, did not make her evidence less credible as there were reasonable explanations provided for her conduct. At \[30\], his Honour had stated:

> **_I accepted that victims of sexual offences may not behave in a stereotypical way_**. Many victims report their sexual abuse early to a family member, friend, the police, or other person in authority. However, **_there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion_**. Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on a case-by-case basis (see DT v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 583</span> at \[62\]; Tang Kin Seng v PP <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span> at \[79\]). While I accept that an omission to report the offence in a timely fashion, in the absence of other evidence, may in certain circumstances make it difficult to establish a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, **_I emphasise that the effect of any delay in reporting always falls to be assessed on the specific facts of each individual case._**

\[emphasis added\]

206    In agreeing with the approach taken Abdullah J, the Court of Appeal stated in _Yue Roger Jr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 12</span> at \[3\] that:

> **_The mere fact that the victim did not complain in a timely manner and had remained in contact with the appellant over the extended duration of the abuse did not rob her of credibility._** The trial judge accepted the victim’s explanation for her behaviour, and **_he was sensitive to the fact that people react in different ways to sexual abuse, including compartmentalising or rationalising their reactions._**

\[emphasis added\]

207    In the recent case of _GCK_, the Court of Appeal also gave a timely reminder about the real challenges and dilemmas that victims of sexual offences face, when it came to reporting such offences committed against them. At \[103\], the Court had stated:

> ….Regardless of the veracity of an allegation of sexual assault, the reporting of the alleged assault should not be depicted as “easy”, particularly **_given the considerable practical, psychological, and emotional barriers that sexual assault victims face in bringing their violators to account_**: see Paul Roberts & Adrian Zuckerman, _Criminal Evidence_ (Oxford University Press, second Ed, 2010) at p 672.” (at \[103\]) …

\[emphasis added\]

208    Such was the situation that I found PW1 (and also PW2 and PW3) to be in, before she finally made the police report on 1 April 2016, especially since she was, until then, confused and not sure if what the accused did to her was intentional, and also because she was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. This was, of course, until she discovered that there were other female customers also inappropriately touched by him.

209    I would also highlight that the scenario in the present case with PW1 (and similarly, the scenarios with the other two victims) was that the area intruded was near to where the accused was supposed to be massaging them, and his rubbing of her vulva also followed (without a break) from similar massage actions that he had performed on the other parts of her body. This made it even less clear whether what he did was an intentional act, or whether they were accidental contacts that occurred in the course of a legitimate massage.

210    This was clearly different from the situation in _Wee Teong Boo_, where the Court there doubted the victim’s account as to why she initially believed the offender’s actions in stroking her vagina was part of a medical examination, when her “medical complaint that day had nothing to do with her genital area at all”. (see \[79\] of _Wee Teong Boo_). Further, in that same case, the Court of Appeal had found that the reasons given by the victim for her late reporting of the offences were doubtful and not credible (see \[84\] and \[85\] of _Wee Teong Boo_). Again, this was unlike the scenario here, where PW1 (and the other victims) was clearly confused and unsure about whether what the accused did was intentional or accidental, and was thus willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, until it became obvious that his actions were clearly deliberate. It was only then that she reported to the police.

211    Further, another major difference between the present case, and the outrage of modesty charge in _Wee Teong Boo_, was that the Court there explicitly noted that the credibility of the victim on the molest charge, was already adversely affected by the Court’s earlier finding that they disbelieved her account about a rape charge that she had made against the same offender (see \[86\] of _Wee Teong Boo_). Certainly, there were no similar circumstances that would adversely affect the credibility of PW1 (or any of the other victims) here.

212    I would also add that another reason why I found PW1 to be credible was the fact that she was measured in her evidence, and made no attempt to embellish her account.

> (a)     For one, while certain that the accused had rubbed her vagina in that way, PW1 was equally clear that when the accused subsequently massaged her shoulder near to her breast, he did not touch it. Nor did she have complaints against him of any other sort about the massage her performed on 11 March 2019.

> (b)     Further, I also noted that PW1’s visit to Genki Wellness on 11 March 2016, when the offence occurred, was not the first time that she had gone to Genki Wellness. Instead, she had been Genki Wellness for massages on numerous previous occasions, and had also undergone massages by the accused previously. Yet, she did not allege that anything of the sort that happened to her on 11 March 2016, had occurred on any other occasion. This explained why she continued to go back to Genki Wellness and was there for a massage on 11 March 2016.

> (c)     It was only following her experience in 11 March 2016, that PW1 never returned to Genki Wellness again. Instead, after this last visit – when she was molested - that PW1 made the police report against the accused for outraging her modesty.

213    I further noted that there was clearly no reason for PW1 to have made any false allegation against the accused. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _GCK_ at \[102\]: _“_Insofar as a motive for a false allegation is raised, in _both_ sexual and non-sexual offence cases, it is for the Defence to first establish sufficient evidence of such a motive (see _AOF_ at \[215\]).”

214    In the present case, as stated earlier, counsel rightly accepted that there was no evidence that PW1 (or any of the other victim for that matter) had any motive to lie or give false evidence against the accused. Instead, the Defence made the allegation that there was collusion or innocent infection of PW1’s evidence, due to the fact that PW1 had revealed her incident to PW2 and PW3, before the three of them made the police report.

215    In this regard, since the Defence accepted that there was no evidence that PW1 (like the other victims) had any motive to lie or, presumably, to fabricate evidence against him out of malice, it would appear that at best, PW1 was mistaken that the accused had reached under her panties and rubbed her vulva. I thus carefully considered the possibilities of collusion, innocent infection, and/or of mistake on the part of PW1. Having done so, I rejected these possibilities, not only because such allegations were illogical and unsupported, but they actually went counter to the evidence that was presented, not only by the Prosecution, but also by the Defence. I elaborate below.

216    First, PW1’s evidence was that after the incident, she had found out from PW2 about the accused’s inappropriate massage of PW2.

> (a)     At that point, they had an emotional conversation, but they did not tell each other specifically what the accused had done to them, or where exactly they were individually touched. PW1 had explained that she was not comfortable discussing the incident with anyone because “…I think it’s a very private thing. I think the details are---I wouldn’t share the details openly.”[^59]

> (b)     PW1 testified that it was only when she found out from PW3 that the accused had touched her everywhere, that they all decided to make a police report. However, PW1 was clear that the other victims did not tell her exactly where they were touched, nor how the massages were conducted. Neither did she give them details. Further, apart from discussing the procedures, she did not discuss other aspects of the case with them. Indeed, any danger of collusion/cross infection of evidence was largely eliminated as PW1 did not discuss particulars such as where she was touched, or how the offending massage was conducted.

> (c)     I would add that PW1’s evidence was consistent with the accounts of PW2 and PW3 that there was little by way of disclosure about the specifics of the offences committed against each of them.

217    Next, **_if indeed the accused had only massaged PW1 up to mid-thigh (as the accused had claimed)_**, **_it was highly incredible that PW1 would then have been so “infected” by what was said to her by the other victims, that PW1 would then have concocted her own story that the accused had somehow (also) rubbed her on her private parts, if such an event never happened_**. This was especially so when her own massage with the accused had taken place only weeks before her conversation with the other victims, and she would have been fully aware and remembered what her own experience with the accused was like. **_In other words, if her own massage session with the accused at Genki Wellness– only weeks earlier before she spoke to PW2 and PW3 - had been so innocuous as the accused claimed, would PW1 have come up with such an embarrassing story that she had been violated by him on her private parts?_**

218    To further suggest that PW1 would next make a police report, and then provide highly private and distressing accounts to the police, the prosecutor and to the Court, is completely illogical and incredible, if indeed the accused had not even massaged her beyond her mid-thigh as he had claimed.

219    In addition, I noted the Prosecution’s submission that the handphone records between PW1 and PW2 (and also between PW2 and PW3), which the Defence had sought and been provided with, presumably to try to establish a possibility of collusion between them, apparently did not show any such collusion.[^60] While the Defence disputed such an inference, it was clear that the claim of alleged collusion was entirely an assertion put forward by the Defence in the first place.[^61]

220    Further, since PW1 undoubtedly had no reason or motive to frame the accused, the idea that she could somehow been mistaken about the accused having slid his hand under her panties and rubbed her vulva, was also irrational and ran counter to the evidence. In this regard I noted that:

> (a)     There could hardly have been a mistake on PW1’s part, **_since the accounts given by PW1 and the accused were as different as night and day._** Specifically, PW1 had said that in the course of massaging her thigh, the accused had reached below her boy shorts and panties and had molested her by rubbing her private part. He did this by moving his hand in and out at least 10 times on each side. Further, this was done not only when he massaged her right thigh, but also when he massaged her left.

> (b)      The accused’s account was that **_he did not even massage beyond her mid-thigh_** and thus could not (and did not) massage below her boy shorts and panties. A fortiori he did not touch her on her vulva, let alone rub it. Thus, there could hardly have been a mistake made by PW1 when she said that he had reached her under panties and rubbed the lips of her vagina (vulva).

> (c)     In addition, PW1’s account was that prior to reaching and touching her private part, the accused had asked her to bend her leg in a V shape so that her feet would be at the level of the opposite knee. This caused her shorts to ride up, with the end of her shorts merely 2 inches from her groin area.[^62] The accused’s account was that PW1’s legs were straight and parallel to each other throughout the massage. Again, these versions could not be reconciled. Moreover, PW1 could hardly have been mistaken about having been instructed by the accused to bend her leg, following which he molested her while purporting to massage her.

> (d)     Further, PW1’s account of the accused’s contact with the outer area of her vagina (vulva) was clear and vivid. She described that he “…slowly move in towards the outer---outer lips of the vagina…and then he will move out and then he will go in again, out and in, out and in but he didn’t go any inner than that. So he touched the outer lips of the vagina, yah. Uh, the inner---inner and outer lip, the pink area---the pink area, yah.”[^63] Aside from the feeling him touching her vagina area, she could hear that she was wet. Again, she could hardly have made an error about what her different senses were telling her.

> (e)     Certainly to suggest that she was ‘inventing’ or being ‘influenced’ to come up with a story about having her private parts violated by a stranger, and to do so such as to implicate someone whom she hardly knew and had nothing against, was entirely fanciful.

> (f)     Further, PW1 described that when the accused repeated his action of rubbing the side of her vagina (the vulva) when he was massaging her left thigh, she tried to resist him and said “said “no” in Chinese (“bu yao”), and also used her hands to block and press on her groin area. This contrasted with the accused’s account that the entire massage was uneventful.

> (g)     Finally, by the account of the Defence witnesses, both the accused and Ding Jun, PW1 left Genki Wellness apparently in an amicable state. There was no suggestion of any dispute or animosity between PW1 with the accused or with his wife, or with anyone at Genki Wellness. Again, PW1 could hardly have made such a colossal mistake of saying that the accused had done something so intrusive and offensive, if she was allegedly so happy with her treatment by the accused on 11 March 2016.

221    All in all, I found PW1’s evidence, and her actions and reactions, to be highly believable and her account to be clearly compelling. She did not embellish her evidence, her evidence was consistent on all material matters, and her testimony has the ring of truth that was the mark of a witness giving an honest account. In short, I had no hesitation in accepting that she had given a frank and truthful account of what transpired during her massage session with the accused.

#### PW2’s charge: PW2’s account was credible and persuasive

222    Many of the same reasons why I believed PW1’s evidence also applied in PW2’s case, leading me to also believe her account of the offence against her.

223    In this respect, I similarly found that there was no collusion, no innocent infection, and that PW2 did not make a mistake when she said that the accused had inappropriately touched her by sliding his hand under her panties and rubbing her groin area, while giving her a full body massage. Her testimony was again completely different from the accused’s claim that he did not even massage her higher than her mid-thigh area.

224    PW2 was also clear that the massage carried out by the accused on 13 March 2016 – where he had rubbed her at the groin area - was not the same as the massage carried out by the accused on an earlier occasion when he “didn’t go on the V area. But the 4th time \[13 March 2016\], he actually went under the underwear on the V line”.[^64]

225    Further, PW2 had said that in the course of carrying out the massage on 13 March 2016, the accused had asked her to bend “….1 leg at the time, uh, into like a V shape so he could get into the harder to reach areas.”[^65] Thereafter, he “…continue on the upper thigh, inner thighs, uh, and then he will move upwards to the groin area.”[^66] In this way, the accused was able to go under PW2’s panties and molest her in the way set out in the charge.

226    As for how she felt when his hand came into contact with her groin area, unlike PW1, PW2 said that his action actually caused her to feel pain as he used medium to strong force. PW2 did not stop him, or shout or use her hand to block him. She only moved around a little bit because of the pain. When PW2 was questioned extensively by counsel about her relative lack of reaction to the accused’s action of massaging her under her underwear, she answered that “I was in pain, I was in shock, I was confused. I just let it go on…”[^67]

227    In assessing her evidence, as stated earlier, many of the same reasons why I believed PW1 were also applicable to PW2’s situation, which was why I also found PW2 to be an unusually convincing witness. I will set out below some of the more pertinent reasons why I came to this conclusion.

> (a)     First, PW2 similarly had no motive to frame the accused and neither did the Defence suggest or allege any.

> (b)     Second, PW2 had never made any complaint about the accused prior to her experience on 13 March 2016, even though she had similarly been massaged by the accused before. It was clear that before that particular massage, PW2 never had any issue or complaint against the accused, and it was only after he had massaged her on 13 March 2016, that PW2 made the allegation that the accused had slid his hand under her panties and rubbed her groin area. Further, despite forceful challenge from the Defence, PW2 was firm and maintained her position about what the accused had done to her.

> (c)     Third, there could also not have been any mistake on PW2’s part, nor could the contact by the accused with her groin area have been accidental, since by the accused’s own account, he had not even massaged her anywhere above her mid-thigh. Further, the fact that PW2 felt the medium to strong pressure that he applied at her groin area, sufficient to make her feel pain, also showed that the contact he made at her groin region was no accident brush, but was a deliberate intrusion.

> (d)     Fourth, what the accused did to her on 13 March 2016 had so affected her that even after the massage, she continued to feel “weird”. Thus, when she found out that PW1 also had a “weird” experience, she spoke to the latter about it. However, PW2 confirmed that even though both PW1 and she felt weird about the massages carried out on each of them by the accused, neither she nor PW1 had told the other specifically about what had happened to them. In any event, I would add that the allegation made by PW2 was that the accused had rubbed her groin area, and that this had caused her pain. This was unlike PW1’s case.

228    PW2 also had a discussion with PW3 about her experience during the massage. The latter had said that she was massaged at a place that she didn’t want to be touched, and had informed the accused about this. PW2 made it clear that the three of them (PW1, PW3 and her) did not talk specifically about what had happened to each of them, and explained that they made the report together because they all experienced a similar situation.

229    As for why she did not make a police report earlier, PW2 explained that this was because of “(f)ear in general, fear being here, fear of just coming forward.”. She was also fearful of ruining the accused’s life.[^68]When asked to elaborate, she stated that she was concerned that it could have been an honest mistake on the accused’s part, or that she was overthinking. So she had “back and forth thoughts, going around that situation...” However, she confirmed that she knew that what he did was wrong. [^69]

230    When she found out about the accused’s actions against PW1 and PW3, PW2 had made a report (P5) as she “…felt that it was wrong”, and she did not want this to happen to anyone else.[^70]Thus, while it was quite evident from her testimony that the accused had rubbed her groin when he carried out the massage on her, PW2 was fearful and initially willing to give the accused the benefit of the doubt that it was a mistake. Clearly, PW2 did not strike me as someone who had embellished her evidence, or who would make such a serious allegation, if false, against the accused.

231    As with PW1’s account, I accepted that for PW2 as well, there was significant shock, confusion and doubt felt by her initially, and also a willingness to believe that the accused’s actions were not intentional. She only changed her mind when it became obvious, having realised that there were others who were also affected, that what the accused did was actually deliberate. Thus, PW2’s reason for the delay in reporting was believable and not surprising.

232    While the Defence suggested that PW2 was inconsistent in her evidence, including about whether the accused was in the room when he asked PW2 to turn around, I accepted that it was not unreasonable for her to be unsure about this aspect and not to be able to remember this clearly, since she had gone to Genki Wellness on other occasions for other massages. Moreover, since this particular episode took place several years before her testimony, to expect her to remember such a relatively minor detail with precision was clearly not reasonable (see cases cited at \[184\] – \[187\] above). Similarly, the Defence’s insistence that PW2 had gone to Genki Wellness with another person, was again neither here nor there. Not only was this immaterial, the basis that they used to make the claim i.e. the logbook, was a record that even Ding Jun herself accepted to be poorly kept.[^71]

233    Thus, looked at as a whole, PW2 was steadfast in her evidence, and sure about what the accused had done to her. The discrepancies in her evidence were minor and on immaterial issues. All things considered, I found that she was cogent and clearly convincing on material issues, and I accepted that her modesty had been outraged by the accused in the manner set out in the charge.

#### PW3’s charge: PW3’s evidence was compelling

234    As with PW1 and PW2, I accepted PW3’s evidence that she had been molested by the accused in the course of performing massage services on her. Similar to the other victims, her evidence was consistent on material matters, there was no reason or motive for her to fabricate evidence or to lie, and there was also no evidence of collusion, innocent infection, or mistake on her part.

235    Further, many of the same reasons why I rejected the Defence’s criticisms against PW1 and PW2, such as their not ‘responding in a way (which the Defence alleged) a sexual offence victim should have been expected to’, and the ‘lateness’ in reporting of the offence to the police, equally applied in PW3’s case, and I would generally not repeat my views that I had earlier expressed, and the authorities I had earlier referred to, save as to say that they applied to PW3’s case as well. In fact, just as the manner in which the accused molested PW1 and PW2 was not exactly the same, how he committed the offence against PW3, and her subsequent reactions to his actions, also had dissimilarities. However, rather than being a criticism, this in fact further debunked any suggestion of collusion or innocent infection.

236    For completeness, I will briefly recap some of the more noteworthy features of PW3’s evidence to illustrate why I also found her evidence to be compelling and believable.

237    First, prior to the offence committed against her on 4 March 2016, PW3 had patronised Genki Wellness, where she had a good experience after receiving massage services from a female masseur, May. PW3 had previously also had a male massage therapist before, and had never experienced an inappropriate massage in Singapore. In fact, on 4 March 2016, PW3 was initially impressed with the back massage given by the accused, and had asked him to extend his massage services and to convert it to a full body massage. It was in the course of this subsequent full body massage that he touched her inappropriately.

238    As for the acts of molest committed on 4 March 2016, to reiterate:

> (a)     PW3’s evidence was that when she was lying face down, in the course of the massage carried out on her by the accused, the latter slid his thumb under her underwear, and she could feel him touch the outer part of her vagina as he performed his massage. At that time, PW3 was wearing a regular underwear with a bikini cut, which “...was not very tight-fitting, um, which allowed possibly for a little easy access”.[^72]She felt very uncomfortable and confused, but didn’t respond physically at that time. When the accused repeated his actions on her other leg, she was twitching and showing small signs of discomfort, but she did not respond in an obvious way.

> (b)     As stated earlier, when PW3 turned around and laid on the back, she tried to protect her pubic region by pressing hard with her hand, but the accused still tried to push his through with his fingers. She had to tell him that she did not want that part of her leg massaged, and said to him firmly that “It’s okay” when he persisted. At that time, PW3 was confused and there were multiple thoughts going through her mind.

> (c)     When PW3 was next lying on her stomach, the accused was also the one who pulled her panties down to expose about ¾ of her buttocks. He then massaged her buttocks with his thumb and hands, and also used his thumb to brush against her anus. PW3 pulled her panties up but did not walk out. She explained that “I was, um, held back by my just---my state of shock and---and discomfort.”[^73]

> (d)     The accused then asked her to turn around to lie on her back and, without warning, he did three very quick presses at her pubic region in a triangular fashion. PW3 was shocked at the accused’s actions. PW3 testified that thereafter, she was very slow in changing, as she “…was very, very paralysed almost by what have just happened.”[^74]

239    What was clear from PW3’s evidence was that while she did not consent to the accused’s actions, and was shocked and confused by what he did, she did try to resist it, albeit in a relatively passive manner, rather than through direct confrontation. This was not entirely surprising, since the accused appeared to be carrying out the offence as if his actions were part of a legitimate massage service, rather than in an obviously offensive and deliberate manner.

240    When questioned, PW3 said that she had never had such an experience with a massage therapist before and it was confusing to her. She also said that “there were many thoughts that were going inside my head”, and she was also shocked and confused. She also said that “this was the 1st time that I had experienced something so inappropriate.”[^75] Indeed, as PW3 described it “throughout **_all the touches happened indirectly as in the name of a rub, in the name of a massage_**…there was no, for example direct groping or direct touch of a private part. **_It was always kind of---uh, in the name of a massage_**, using the finger slightly higher or slightly lower. **_Um, that blurred the boundaries for me a little bit._**... I knew that it was inappropriate but emotionally and physically I was very, um, shaken by whatever I had experienced and that shocked state of, uh, being was stopping me from being, uh, logical about my reactions.”[^76]

241    Indeed, PW3 acknowledged that she should have reacted in a more direct and explicit manner against the accused’s actions. Looking back, she admitted that: “Now, I’m logical about my reactions and therefore 2 years later, I’m thinking straight and I would---I s---I would have told my 2-year-old self saying, I should have done it sooner. **_But at that point, I was not logical, I was not rational because I was so emotionally and physically constricted by...what had happened._**” [^77]

242    After the massage, PW3 left Genki Wellness and went to the toilet where she was overcome by her emotions. She testified that:[^78]:

> I went into the bathroom even though I didn’t need to but I was---I think I just needed some time on my own to realise what had happened and I remember bawling my eyes out, uh, in the cubicle. Um, I was definitely emotionally very affected by what had happened because it---it had never happened to me before and it was definitely emotionally scarring so I spent, uh, close to 10---10 minutes, uh, on my own in the bathroom.

243    I would add that PW3’s frank expression of regret, in court, about her earlier lack of response was understandable. Further, her relatively passive reaction to the accused’s intrusions of her private parts at the time of the offence, when overcome with emotions of shock and confusion sweeping through her when molested, were also highly believable. In addition, her distress and her crying by herself in the toilet immediately after the massage session (and molest) by the accused, were also supportive of the fact that only moments earlier, she had been violated by the accused.

244    In addition, PW3 testified that she looked away when she next saw the accused looking at her after she left the toilet and was going out of the mall. Following this incident, she never visited Genki Wellness or even UE square (the mall that Genki Wellness) was located again. This was further evidence of the strong negative emotions that the accused’s actions had provoked in her.

245    It was thus clear that something serious had happened to PW3 between:

> (a)     the time that the accused ended giving her the back massage, when she was obviously happy with his services (resulting in her asking him to extend the session and to give her a full body massage), and

> (b)     the time that he ended giving her that full body massage, when she was obviously distressed and distraught.

246    According to PW3, what had happened to so dramatically change her feelings towards the accused, was that he had rubbed her vulva, buttocks and anus without her consent. I certainly saw no reason to disbelieve her evidence.

247    Another aspect of PW3’s testimony – which was consistent with her claim that she had been molested – was that during that night of the incident, she had cried and shared with her husband about what had happened at Genki Wellness, although not in elaborate detail. They had then discussed whether to file a police report, but PW3 eventually decided not to do so as she was newly married in January 2016, and had entered a new family that she didn’t know well. Further, she was only a few months from finishing her PhD, and was also managing a full time job as a company dancer.

248    This aspect of PW3’s evidence also explained why no immediate police report was made by PW3, despite her feeling that she had been violated. I saw no reason to disbelieve her evidence on this issue, since there was really no reason for her to have made this up. In this regard, like the other two victims, PW3 clearly also had no motive to lie or fabricate evidence against the accused, something that the Defence rightly acknowledged.

249    While the Defence did take issue with various aspects of PW3’s evidence, such as her saying that she had been asked by the accused to turn over three times during her massage, as compared to PW1 and PW2 who did not do the same, and also about the accused speaking to her in English etc., I agreed with the Prosecution that all these were matters were easily explainable. For one, as PW3 had switched over from a back massage to a full body massage halfway through the session, why she had to turn over three times may well have been connected to this reason. As for her communication with the accused, PW3 certainly did not say that the accused spoke perfectly grammatical English, but that he communicated in broken English. This was something I found highly believable as he has been in Singapore since the 1990s. In any event, all these minor issues that clearly had no bearing on the charge (see \[186\]-\[187\] above).

250    Similarly, whether PW3 had been given a gown to wear when she visited Genki Wellness, and how her evidence allegedly differed from the evidence of PW1 and PW2 on this matter, an issue repeatedly highlighted by the Defence, was, with the greatest of respect, completely immaterial and unimportant.

251    All in all, I believed PW3’s account that the accused had outraged her modesty in the manner set out in the charge. I certainly saw no reason for PW3 to have made up the distressing claims about what the accused had done to her, or about the anguish she expressed in the toilet soon after the incident. Nor was there any reason to lie about seeing the accused looking at her as she left, or about her crying over that incident that night. It was a real stretch of imagination to suggest that PW3 had simply invented these accounts.

252    I also accepted that PW3 eventually did make a police report about the offence committed against her (despite her initial hesitation), after she found out that PW1 and PW2 had similarly been molested by the accused. In this regard, PW3’s evidence was corroborative of the testimony of the other victims, that they did not share with one another details about what they had gone through, given the intimate and even embarrassing nature of their individual encounters. Indeed, there were significant differences in their encounters and experiences to show that what they went through with the accused was unique to themselves, and certainly did not suggest any complicity or that any innocent infection of evidence had occurred. While the Defence tried to suggest some inconsistencies in the victims’ accounts of their discussion, “(s)ometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise.**_”_** (see \[184\] and also \[185\] above).

253    Further, I accepted that it was after the three victims had confirmed their individual suspicions that the unwanted and intrusive acts of the accused, in touching and rubbing them in different ways on the private and intimate areas of their bodies, were not accidental actions but deliberate acts of sexual violation, that the police reports were made. With such realisation, and also with emotional support that they provided to one another, they then made their individual police reports against him. Indeed, it was clear from PW3’s evidence that having spoken to PW1 and PW2, this gave her strength to make a police report, something that was much harder to do on her own.

254    All things considered, like the evidence of the other victims, PW3’s evidence was compelling and consistent in material particulars, and showed that she had been sexually violated in the manner set out in her charge. Similarly, her evidence had a clear ring of truth to it.

255    In short, all the victims’ evidence that the accused had rubbed them on their groin, vulva, buttocks and/or anus as indicated in their respective charges, was unusually convincing, especially when compared to the accused’s claim that he never even massaged them beyond their mid-thighs.

### Irrelevant that the pre-trial charges were amended

256    For completeness, I will deal with the issue brought up by the Defence concerning changes that the Prosecution had made to the original charges framed against the accused before trial, and how they differed from the charges that were finally proceeded with.

257    On this issue, I agreed with the arguments put forward by the Prosecution.[^79] In essence, I was of the view that the position put forward by the Defence on this matter, was really a case of much ado about nothing, especially since the substance of the charges remained largely similar.

258    In addition, I would repeat the words of See Kee Oon J in _PP v BNO_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 243</span> (“_BNO_”), where his Honour made it clear that the Prosecution has the discretion to proceed with any amended charge at trial and need only ensure that the evidence adduced proves the elements of the amended charge. At \[80\], his Honour had stated:

> On a related note, the Defence suggested in its closing submissions that the first charge was not made out because the words “over his shorts” were removed from the original charge. I rejected this contention. The present case was unlike _XP v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span>, where the court found that the complainant had failed altogether to mention a crucial detail which was stated in the charge that was proceeded with at trial. **_In contrast, the first charge in the present case was amended before the trial commenced. The Prosecution retains the discretion to proceed with any amended charge at trial._** The Victim’s evidence was consistent with the particulars in the amended first charge**_._** This was not an instance of the Victim failing to mention any detail in the proceeded charge at trial.

\[emphasis added\]

### Why I rejected the Defence

259    The Defence was one of bare denial. In essence, the accused’s evidence was that he had carried out a body massage of the victims and that nothing untoward had happened. As regards their leg region, he testified that he had massaged their feet, calves, knee and up to the mid-thighs. However, he insisted that he did not massage their upper thighs, and that his fingers and thumb did not come into contact with the vagina or anus regions of the victims. In summary, his account was that the massages that he carried out for all three victims were all completely above board and uneventful. There was also no argument or disagreement with any of the victims, nor (since he only massaged up to the mid-thighs) any possibility that he could have accidentally touched (let alone rub) them at the private parts or groin region as alleged by them.

260    In fact, the position of the Defence was that the victims were apparently happy and complimentary of the service that he provided to them, and even made appointments for future massage sessions. At the same time, the Defence attacked aspects of the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence allegedly for being inconsistent and illogical, and also suggested that the Prosecution witnesses had lied or had innocently infected one another’s evidence.

261    Having carefully reviewed the evidence, I did not believe the accused or his wife, nor did I accept the defence that was put up. I set out my reasons below.

#### Defence’s incredible claim that accused left the curtain one-third open when massaging half-dressed female customers

262    One of the main planks of the Defence was that the accused had left the curtain one-third open when he was massaging the victims. This was apparently done in line with the policy of Genki Wellness, which Ding Jun had come out with, after attending a course at the Spa Institute. The policy was that if a male masseur of Genki Wellness was performing massage for any customer, whether male or female, the curtain must be left one-third open. This policy applied to male masseurs only, and since the accused was the sole male masseur at Genki Wellness, it was only in the case of his customers, that the curtain would be left one-third open. Even so, this alleged “open curtain” policy was not told to his female customers.

263    For the massages performed on the three victims, the accused insisted that this policy was followed. This was apparently important to the Defence as it suggested that if this policy was indeed practised, the accused was not likely to have outraged the modesty of any of the victims, as he would have been at risk of being seen by someone outside the massage room when he committed the offences. However, I found it difficult to believe that there was really this one-third “open curtain” policy implemented for the accused.

264    First, even though the alleged policy was to keep the curtain one-third open, the evidence from the accused varied broadly as to how wide he allegedly kept the curtain open.

> (a)     In the case of PW1, the accused insisted that his wife drew the curtain wide open when she departed from the massage room, leaving only PW1 and him alone in the room. After that, he did not close the curtain to leave only a one-third gap. Instead, the curtain to the room was kept fully open, even as he continued to massage PW1 who was bra-less. The accused claimed that if he “…were to close the curtain or leave it one-third open, \[his wife\] will be angry”.[^80]

> (b)     This evidence of the accused was thus not only contrary to the evidence that he (and his wife) gave that the policy was to keep the curtain one-third open, but it also begged the question of why the accused would be afraid that his wife would be angry if he were close the curtain to leave only a one-third gap, since this was the very policy that his wife herself had allegedly introduced. Further his claim that the curtain was left fully open when PW1 was only half-dressed (i.e. not wearing her bra) in the room, was also quite incredible when, by Ding Jun’s account, there was another customer in the shop, whom she had gone to attend to at the counter at that very time. Thus, there was a real risk that the customer could have looked in (or passed by) the completely open room and be able to see PW1 being massaged by the accused.

> (c)     Moreover, in his statement (P10), the accused had claimed that the curtain would typically be kept open by 15 cm, when the width of the massage room was 90 cm. This meant that the gap that he left when he massaged customers – according to the earlier account in his statement - was much smaller, at one one-sixth the width of the room, rather than one-third. **_Yet by the time of the trial, the size of the gap had somehow doubled._**

> (d)     Such flip-flops about how wide the accused allegedly kept the curtain open cast grave doubts about the truth of such a claim.

265    In any event, save for the claim made by the accused and his wife about leaving the curtain opened by one-third, no independent corroboration was produced of this doubtful claim. Certainty no testimony from a single customer, or evidence from a single employee of Genki Wellness, was adduced, even though this policy had allegedly been learnt by Ding Jun in 2010, and implemented for all her male masseurs, including the accused. Further, Ding Jun admitted that Genki Wellness had employed male employees since 2014.

266    In addition, none of the victims testified that they saw the curtain being kept open by one-third, despite they spending more than one hour each in the massage room with the accused. Instead, what they did confirm was that when they had to change clothes or to flip over, the curtain was fully drawn.

267    The curtain was also ostensibly in place and fully drawn to protect the customers’ privacy when they were changing out of their clothes before the massage commenced, and they were in states of partial undress. If so, it seemed incredible that the accused would have kept the curtain one-third open when he was performing massage on the victims, when they would all still be in such states of partial undress, with only a towel covering their bodies. Indeed, it seems quite ridiculous to suggest that when massaging half-dressed female customers, the accused would leave the curtain one-third open such that anyone from outside the room, including a male customer, could potentially pass by and peer in to see the accused carrying out such massages. Further, since such a rule was not imposed on the other masseurs, it would appear that only the accused’s customers ran the risk of having a stranger possibly be able to look into the massage room, when they were in a state of semi-undress. Indeed, if the accused really left the curtain one-third open, and did so without the female customers’ knowledge or consent, he would have run the risk of his female customers complaining that they may be “exposed” a lot more than they wanted or agreed to. This was a scenario that was quite hard to believe.

268    When questioned about this alleged practice and the reasons for introducing it in Genki Wellness, the accused was not able to provide any coherent answer, other than insisting that this was a policy instituted by his wife, and that only she could answer this question. He also insisted that he had “blindly” followed her instructions, and refused to say why he thought such a policy was introduced, even though it applied only to him, and not to the others.

269    Clearly, the accused’s apparent ignorance, or his apparent refusal to find out from his wife why he was the only one at Genki Wellness who had to abide by this rule, were simply unbelievable. The accused’s credibility was made even more doubtful by his further assertion he was so afraid of his wife that he did not even dare to ask her the reason for this discriminatory practice, despite it having been implemented for so many years.

270    Yet while claiming that he was fearful of Ding Jun on this issue, the accused was apparently not so scared of her that he did not cross swords with her on other matters and on other occasions, such as when he allegedly argued with his wife on 4 March 2016, resulting in her not following him to Genki Wellness that day. 4 March 2016 was also the date that the accused carried out the massage for PW3, when he was alleged to have molested her in the process.

271    As for the explanation given by Ding Jun on how this alleged one-third rule originated, I found it hard to believe her that she had learnt and adapted this practice from a course that she took at the Spa Institute in 2010. Her claim that she was taught at the Spa Institute that male masseurs should keep the curtain one- third open when massaging female customers, flew in the face of the fact – **_accepted by both the Prosecution and the Defence_** – that the licensing rules for massage establishments prohibited male masseurs from massaging female customers in the first place. As this licensing prohibition has been in place for quite some time, I found it hard to believe that the Spa Institute would teach something that was against an established licensing condition for massage establishments. Further, save for Ding Jun’s bare claim, no evidence was produced that Ding Jun had ever been taught such a practice at the Spa Institute.

272    In any event, I also noted that the position of the Defence was that Ding Jun had a policy of going into the massage rooms unannounced to check on the masseurs when they were performing their massages. This was allegedly something that Ding Jun did even when she had her own customers to attend to. Apparently, Ding Jun entered the massage rooms without warning to check on her masseurs, and this was done as a safeguard against something improper taking place in the rooms. Presumably, this practice of hers would have discouraged the accused from carrying out any act of outrage of modesty against his female customers. Yet if Ding Jun really had this practice of coming into the room unannounced to check on the accused, why was there a need for her to insist he keep the curtain one-third open, ostensibly for the very same purpose?

273    Further, when Ding Jun was asked about this policy of keeping the curtain one-third open, while she apparently acknowledged the danger posed to the privacy of the accused’s female customers, Ding Jun’s response was that a male masseur who has to abide by this policy, would respond to protect the customer’s privacy by quickly closing the curtain every time he hears people walking by. However, this was an absurd explanation since it suggested that the male masseur would literally have to be on his toes to listen out for any possible third party outside his massage room and to rush to react to draw the curtain, even as he was busily engaged with performing the massage on his customer.

274    Moreover, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, Ding Jun claimed that every time she approached the room, she would see that the curtain was one-third open. However, this could not have been the case since the accused would presumably have heard her footsteps, and drawn the curtain fully even before she appeared outside the room. Clearly, the Defence was tying itself up in knots trying to make, and rationalise, this ludicrous claim.

#### Offences could be committed even if curtain was one-third open

275    In any event, I agreed with the Prosecution that even if the curtain was indeed left one-third open when the accused was massaging his customers, the accused could still have committed the offences against the three victims.

276    In this regard, it was clear that the acts of outrage of modesty were all committed in the course of the accused carrying out massages for each of the three victims. The offences all appear to be largely opportunistic as they were committed when that the accused was massaging the victims on their thighs. Essentially, while doing so, the accused just moved his hands beyond massaging their middle thighs up to their groin area, before rubbing and touching them on their groin and private part, and also buttocks and anus in the case of PW3. As the areas where the accused intruded upon were near to the parts of their bodies that he was legitimately massaging (i.e. their thighs), his victims were confused and unsure over whether what the accused did, when he touched them on their groin and private areas, was done accidentally or intentionally.

277    I would add that since the accused’s acts of molest were apparently ‘disguised’ in this manner as part of a legitimate massage process, such acts would have been even less obvious to an observer, especially one who may just be casually looking in, through a slightly open curtain, into a dimly lit massage room. To this casual observer, it could well have appeared that the accused was just carrying out a legitimate massage around the customer’s thigh area, even when he was actually molesting her by touching her more private areas.

278    In any event, to support its case that the accused could still commit the offences even if the curtain was one-third open, the Prosecution cited the case of _GCD_, where the High Court upheld a conviction for an offender who was charged with outraging the modesty of his student inside a classroom. The offender there had similarly argued that he could not have committed the offence as there was a small window in the door of the classroom through which outsiders could see what was happening in the room. In rejecting this argument, the judge had stated at \[75\]:

> As a general observation, a person may decide to commit an offence either because he thinks no one will catch him or because he has taken precautions so as not to be caught or both. **_Molest offences occur even in the most crowded of places let alone in a room behind closed doors with no one else present except the accused and the victim_**. **_It is a fact that offences of molest have been committed in public places in the very presence of potential witnesses all around e.g. on a bus or train and in at least one case, in a classroom in the presence of other students_**.

\[emphasis added\]

279    Indeed, consistent with the above observation of the Court in _GCK_, I would add that convictions have similarly been recorded, and upheld on appeal, in such outrage of modesty cases as _Public Prosecutor v Hoo Swee Tiang_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 34</span>, where the molest took place on a crowded MRT train, and in _Public Prosecutor v Rakesh Kumar Prasad_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 34</span>, where the offence took place in a yoga studio that was not only equipped with a CCTV camera, but where outsiders could look in and see what was happening. Indeed, Aedit Abdullah J had noted at \[42\] of _Yue Roger Jr_ that “(s)exual offences, including rape, have taken place at various places, including at public locations.”

280    Clearly, offenders do commit sexual offences even in circumstances where there is a risk of being found out or observed by third parties. Thus, even if the curtain of the massage room was one-third open in the present case, this was clearly no bar to the accused committing the offences set out in the charges.

281    Moreover, I noted that during the massage sessions with the victims, the accused was not under constant observation, whether by his wife or any other person. Thus, during the long periods that he spent carrying out the massages for the victims, he had ample time and opportunity to commit the offences, and to do so unseen and undetected.

282    Indeed, even in the case of PW1, where Ding Jun claimed to have sat in the massage room opposite hers, watching both a training video on her phone, and also observing the accused carrying out his massage on PW1 at the same time, not only was Ding Jun a distance away from the dimly lit room where the accused was massaging PW1, she herself admitted that she was not paying attention to the accused at all times. I will deal with this issue in greater detail at a later part of this judgment (see \[299\]–\[303\] below).

283    Finally, by the Defence’s own argument, the accused was supposed to close the curtain if he heard footsteps outside, ostensibly to protect the privacy of his partially undressed customer who was in the room. However, if he could indeed hear footsteps of people approaching his massage room (in order to close the curtain), he could certainly have been able to stop his nefarious activities when he heard such footsteps. In short, even if the curtain had really been kept opened by one-third, this would clearly not have prevented the offences.

#### The accused could not account for discrepancies in his statement

284    Aside from the various material discrepancies, and the far-fetched, implausible and unbelievable aspects of the accused’s testimony as set out above, I also noted that his evidence in court was challenged on the basis it was materially different from what he had earlier stated in his statement, P10. This statement was recorded on 3 April 2016, which was less than a month after the offences. The Prosecution applied to impeach him based on these differences. The major discrepancies, and the accused’s responses, are set out below.

285    First, as noted at \[264(c)\] above, the accused had stated in P10 that his wife would ask him to leave a 15 cm gap when massaging a female customer. In court, he instead said that she had told him to keep the curtains one-third open i.e. leave a 30 cm gap. When asked about the discrepancy, the accused responded by saying that he did not know why the gap was stated as 15 cm in P10. He subsequently claimed that he had not said this to the recorder, but had said the gap was one-third wide instead. He further said that when this part of the statement was read back to him at the end of the recording process, he had not heard the recorder mentioning 15 cm, but had heard her saying one-third. This, even though, the accused agreed that he had signed on P10. As for why he had stated in P10 that his wife advised him to leave the gap to prevent misunderstanding, but had stated in court that he was unable to give a reason why she did so, the accused admitted that he had given different accounts, but was unable to explain why. **_All the accused could say was “Difference means different, I can’t explain. There is no way for me to explain._**”[^81]

286    As regards \[4\] of P10 where he had stated that “However, I do use my elbow to massage their buttocks”, which was inconsistent with his testimony that he does not massage his customer’s buttocks, the accused initially claimed that the versions were the same. Later, he vacillated and claimed that he only massaged the buttocks of male customers. He finally said that he had given a wrong answer in his statement, and attributed his giving of the alleged wrong answer to his feeling unwell when he gave the police statement. He said that that he did not sleep, was feeling giddy, sick and in a daze at that time. The accused also said that the officer had told him to take his medicine, before saying that he did not actually tell the recording officer that he was feeling light-headed and sick, as the officer was allegedly very fierce, and he did not dare to tell her. He subsequently said that he had taken his medicine before his statement was recorded. The accused even claimed that the rice provided to him at the police station was very little but that he did not dare to ask for more. It was certainly difficult to track the shifting stances that he took in his testimony.

287    I noted further that despite his alleged poor health condition and medical issues, the accused admitted that when he was released on bail after giving his statement, he did not seek medical treatment. Neither did he ask for assistance when he was in the lockup, nor did he tell anyone that he was feeling light-headed or feeling sick. During re-examination, he even claimed that the recorder did not read this part of the statement back to him.[^82] In short, the accused provided a host of purported reasons that clearly were more like lame excuses.

288    Next, when asked about the inconsistency between his account at \[4\] of P10 that: “When I want to massage their buttocks, I did not seek their consent. I will only automatically massage their buttocks if they suffered from lower back pain”, and his version in court that he would not massage their buttocks and that even if he did so, he would do this only upon request, the accused said that his version in court was correct. **_However, he refused to explain why he had given an incorrect version to the recording officer insisting instead that: “I will not explain.”_**[^83] Following this rather petulant response, and when pressed to answer the question, the accused then claimed that he was confused at the time he gave his statement.[^84]

289    Further, when asked about the inconsistency between what he had also said at \[4\] of P10 that he would massage the customer’s upper thigh, and his statement in court that he would massage only up to the mid-thigh area, the accused denied that he had stated the version that appears in P10.

290    Next, when asked about the inconsistency between what he had stated at A1 of P10, that he could not remember the female Indian customer, and his contrary version in court that he could clearly remember PW3 because she was an Indian, the accused again claimed that he could not recall that customer, even though he conceded that he had only had one Indian customer up to that point.[^85]He subsequently said that when he gave the statement, he could not remember PW3 (his only Indian customer) because he was “perhaps” confused.[^86]

291    As regards his answers about PW1, the accused had said at A11 in P10 that he remembered that: “(s)he is a dancer. Her inner thigh muscles near her vagina is very tight and in pain, so I massaged this area.”. Yet in court, the accused had said that he never massaged the inner thigh area near the PW1’s vagina. The accused even claimed that he could not have given the answer in P10.[^87] He also denied having given the answer, recorded in P10, that: “I told my wife about it and she told me that it was a sensitive area and told me to stop massaging that. and then I stopped doing so recently.”[^88]

292    As regards his answer A11A in P10 to the question why he massaged near the vagina of his female customers, the accused had stated: “My wife never taught me that. Based on my own creativity and positive feedback from other female customers, I realised that by massaging to the inner thigh area near the vagina can reduce their pain. So I would massage that area for customers. However, after my wife saw how I massage recently and gave me feedback that it could be too dangerous, I stopped.” The accused admitted that this account in P10 was different from what he had testified in court. When asked to explain the discrepancy, the accused initially said that he was confused when he gave the version in P10. Subsequently, he denied having given the version that appears as A11A in P10,[^89]and claimed that he had no idea why those words were recorded in P10.[^90]

293    In addition, the accused denied giving the answers (both the handwritten and typewritten answers) in A10, and even claimed that the recorder had not asked the question that appears as Q10 in P10. Instead, he alleged that she had asked him a different question.[^91]This was despite the fact that the accused admitted that he had signed against the handwritten part of the answer, (“Also, I never massage her vagina”) that was attributed to him and which appears next to his answer at A10.[^92]The accused even claimed that these handwritten words were not on P10 when he signed on the statement, and that he did not know when they were included, **_even though his signature appears next to the handwritten words_**.In addition, the accused alleged that the recorder (ASP Tay) was very fierce and hence he dared not ask her why she made him sign twice on page 3 of his statement.[^93]During re-examination, the accused even claimed that instead of reading back the word “vagina” which appears at A10, the recorder had said “abdomen” instead.[^94]

294    The accused also said that in recording his statement, the recorder would ‘sometimes’ type on a computer, and would \`sometimes’ write. After the statement recording was completed, the recorder read the statement to him in Mandarin, and then told him to sign if he agreed, or to ask for it to be amended if he did not. In this case, after she had read out P10 to him in Mandarin, and asked if he had any amendment to make, the accused had signed it.

295    It could be seen from the above summary, that the accused kept changing his answers, and gave inconsistent, illogical, and patently incredible accounts. This was when he was confronted with obvious inconsistencies between his evidence in court and the account that he gave in P10.

296    I would also add that there was no reason to believe that P10 had not been properly recorded, or that it did not accurately reflect what he had said to ASP Tay. In this regard:

> (a)     ASP Tay had testified that she is proficient in Mandarin, the language that the accused chose to speak in for the statement recording. ASP Tay also confirmed that she understood what the accused said, and that he also understood her during the process.

> (b)     ASP Tay had given the accused a chance at the end of the statement recording to make corrections. It was, in fact, at that stage that he had asked her to include the words “Also, I never massaged her vagina”. This she did. The accused also signed on every page of P10, including against these exculpatory words that he specifically asked her to include in P10.

> (c)     I also accepted ASP Tay’s evidence that the contents of P10, including the accused’s many personal details in it, came from the accused, whom she had described as co-operative during the recording.

> (d)     Further, I noted that the accused did not dispute that P10 is a voluntary statement, and that there was no question of ASP Tay having had any motive to mis-record or misrepresent the accused’s account in P10. Nor was there any reason to believe that she did so, or that she was incapable of understanding him during the statement recording process.

> (e)     I would add that P10 also contained largely exculpatory accounts, as well as many of the same denials that the accused had repeated in court. This bolstered the argument that P10 reflected what the accused had said during the statement recording process.

> (f)     Finally, I noted that D17, a statement that the Defence, chose to rely on, was also recorded by ASP Tay. It seems incongruous for the Defence to want to rely on D17 (suggesting that it was accurately recorded by ASP Tay) and yet tried to attack the accuracy of P10 (recorded by the same recorder) only two months earlier, apparently because P10 did not fit the narrative given by the accused in court.

> (g)     All in all, I saw no reason to doubt that ASP Tay had indeed recorded P10 faithfully and truthfully. I thus accepted that P10 contained the account that the accused had told ASP Tay when P10 was recorded, whether or not he still wished to maintain the same version in court.

297    In light of the above, where the accused was not able to satisfactorily explain the material discrepancies between what he had testified to and what he had stated in P10, I was of the view that this cast serious doubt as to his credibility, and made his evidence even more doubtful.

#### Ding Jun’s evidence was not credible or helpful to the accused

298    Moving on to Ding Jun’s evidence, aside from my doubts previously expressed about the veracity of Ding Jun’s claim concerning the alleged policy of keeping the curtain one-third open, there were other aspects of her evidence which I had misgivings about. I highlight two main areas below.

##### Ding Jun’s alleged observation of the accused while he was massaging PW1

299    Ding Jun claimed that she was observing the accused while he was massaging PW1, hence suggesting that he could not possibly have molested PW1. Quite aside from the fact that there were grave doubts over whether the curtain was open (fully or one-third) while the accused was massaging PW1 (see \[262\] – \[274\] above), it was clear that Ding Jun’s attention was, in any event, not focussed on the accused throughout his massage of PW1. Instead, Ding Jun was looking at her handphone learning about radiation from the director of the Radiation Department during this time. In fact, as she apparently had no reason to suspect that the accused was doing something wrong, she would likely not even be concentrating on what the accused was doing, but rather be focussing on listening and learning from the director on her phone.

300    Indeed, when cross-examined, Ding Jun agreed that when she was distracted by what was taught and shown on her handphone, she was not looking at the accused. She was also not sure if she observed the accused more, or paid more attention to what was shown on her handphone.[^95]

301    Moreover, what the accused did when he was in the massage room with PW1, was not something that was necessarily obvious to Ding Jun, since the accused was a distance away from her, and in a dimly lit room at that time. Finally, as the accused was supposed to be touching PW1’s body as part of the massage anyway, even if Ding Jun was observing him (from a distance), it was doubtful if she could see clearly where he was touching or what he was doing.

302    Further, it was undisputed that even while the accused was carrying out the massage on PW1, Ding Jun also went to attend to payments by other customers, or would (as she claimed to be her usual practice) be moving around and checking on other masseurs.

303    In short, Ding Jun’s evidence did nothing to suggest that the offence against PW1 could not have been committed by the accused.

##### Ding Jun’s doubtful evidence about her encounter with PW3

304    According to Ding Jun, she had prolonged interactions with PW3 on 4 March 2016, even though it was the accused who had started the massage session with PW3. She also claimed that PW3 was so impressed with her skills that PW3 made an appointment at the end of the session on 4 March 2016, for a subsequent massage session with her. The implication of Ding Jun’s evidence seems to be that PW3’s experience at Genki Wellness on 4 March 2016 was a pleasant one, and that PW3 could thus not have been molested as claimed.

305    However, Ding Jun’s attempt fell well off the mark. Her evidence was in various ways, not only uncorroborated, but was also illogical and contradicted by PW3, the accused and even by Ding Jun’s own police statement.

306    First, Ding Jun’s evidence that she had carried out the massage for PW3 for about 30 minutes, and that she had spoken to PW3 both during the massage, and after it was over, was contradictory to PW3’s account. Essentially, PW3’s evidence was that she only briefly heard a woman’s voice during the massage session, but that the massage on her was actually carried out by the accused.

307    Next, when Ding Jun tried to suggest that PW3 was so impressed with her massage skills that PW3 made an immediate appointment to return for another massage the following Friday at 2 pm, this claim was not only not consistent with PW3’s evidence, Ding Jun was also not able to show from her log book records that such an appointment by PW3 had actually been made. Instead, Ding Jun admitted that she did not have any record of PW3’s name or particulars in the records for the alleged subsequent appointment. Further, when confronted, she then claimed that she had merely made a stroke in the book to indicate that there was an appointment made, but that there was nothing to show that this appointment was actually for PW3. Ding Jun further admitted that she did not put down any form of identifier (such as name or phone number) of PW3, even though she had her log book with her at the counter, when PW3 allegedly made the appointment with her. I would add that when the record was examined, both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that there could only be seen a faint line (of a mark previously written in pencil) at the 3 to 3.30 pm timeslot on the second column. It was not even clear if there was any line indicated at the 2 pm timeslot, even though Ding Jun claimed that she had drawn a line from 2 pm to 3.30 pm to indicate the appointment that PW3 allegedly made on 4 March 2016.[^96]

308    Clearly, Ding Jun’s claim that PW3 had made any such appointment was not supported by evidence. Further, as correctly pointed out by the Prosecution, the alleged appointment shown in the record was for “cupping”. This is a completely different form of treatment from the massage that PW3 received on her visits to Genki Wellness, and which she was allegedly so impressed with (Ding Jun’s skills) on 4 March 2016. This suggested that the cupping appointment indicated in the record, was for some customer other than PW3.

309    Further, I noted that Ding Jun also subsequently admitted that she had given inconsistent accounts about whether PW3 had praised her massage skills when she was in the room with Ding Jun, and/or whether this was done when PW3 was allegedly at the counter to pay Ding Jun.[^97] All in all, Ding Jun’s claim about PW3’s alleged satisfaction with the treatment she received at Genki Wellness on 4 March 2016, was neither credible nor believable.

310    Another major area where Ding Jun’s evidence was contradictory related to the question of who pulled PW3’s panties down. PW3’s evidence was clear that it was the accused who did this, whereas the accused had said that this was done by Ding Jun. On this aspect of the evidence, Ding Jun’s initial testimony was that she did not pull down PW3’s panties to reveal half her buttocks, nor did she massage PW3’s buttocks. When Ding Jun was then confronted with her earlier statement (P12 - made on 4 July 2016) where she had stated that she pulled PW3’s panty down to reveal half the buttocks and that she had massaged PW3’s buttocks, Ding Jun changed her testimony and claimed that what was stated in her statement was the same as what she said in court save that she had used different words on the two occasions. Clearly, Ding Jun was making up evidence as she went along, and trying hard to continue giving an account in favour of the accused.

311    All in all, while I would not find Ding Jun any less believable just because she was the accused’s wife, or even because she co-managed Genki Wellness with the accused, on careful examination of Ding Jun’s evidence, I found her to be clearly a witness of little credit because her account was incredible, illogical and inconsistent on so many material matters.

#### Ms Lim’s evidence was also unhelpful to the Defence

312    The accused insisted that he had used a medicated paste (shown in D2A and D2B) to massage the victims, and that this paste would produce a cold sensation, followed by a warm stinging or burning sensation, where applied. The Defence argued that since the victims did not experience such sensations on their private parts, the accused clearly did not massage or touch them there.

313    On this issue, based on the label on the bottle of D2A/D2B, the paste purportedly contained 16 ingredients in the quantities indicated below.

![]([2020] SGMC 0045_Image/[2020] SGMC 0045_image1.png)

314    The Defence engaged Ms Lim to conduct an analysis of the paste for the presence of two of the items stated in the list, namely: “Herba Menthol” and “Methyl Salicylate”. Thereafter, she was to describe the effects of these two substances based on scientific literature (see \[5\] of Ms Lim’s report (D16)). Based on this scope of engagement, Ms Lim:

> (a)     Confirmed that the paste contained menthol and methyl salicylate; and

> (b)     Stated that based on scientific literature, menthol gives a cooling sensation at low concentrations and a burning sensation at high concentrations of 2% to 5%, and that methyl salicylate is a strong irritant to the skin, and higher concentrations of 6 to 18% of it causes strong burning sensations.

315    However, while I did not doubt the validity of Ms Lim’s findings or the statements set out in the scientific literature she referred to, and I do not level any criticism of Ms Lim’s analysis and evidence as such, I did not find Ms Lim’s evidence to be of any real use to the Defence. This was primarily because of the highly limited mandate given to Ms Lim, as her scope of work was limited (by the Defence) to only commenting on the two specified ingredients (menthol and methyl salicylate) that made up 4% of the paste, and did not extend to checking on the identity or effect of the other ingredients that made 96% of the paste. In other words, Ms Lim’s evidence would not, and did not, address any of the main issues in dispute. I elaborate below.

316    First, while the paste purportedly contained 16 ingredients, Ms Lim was only asked to check on two of them. In this regard, Ms Lim did not check or test for any of the other 14 ingredients listed on the label to confirm if they were present, let alone their quantity and effects. In fact, it would appear that some of the ingredients may not even have been identified by their scientific names on the label. This meant that objectively, we could not confirm whether these other ingredients were present, and if so, what they actually were, and also what were their actual quantities.

317    More importantly, the individual effects of each of the other 14 ingredients (if in fact present) were not known, nor was it known what they were included in the paste for. Also, how any of them would (if at all) affect or influence the effect of the menthol and methyl salicylate (in a positive or negative way) was a total mystery. As noted above, these omissions were particularly jarring when one considers that based on the label, the menthol and methyl salicylate, which were the only ingredients tested, only made up a very small component of what was in the paste. Specifically, at 30 mg (3%) and 10 mg (1%) respectively out of 1000 mg of the paste, menthol and methyl salicylate collectively accounted for only 4% by weight of the paste, with the other 14 ingredients making up 96% of it. Thus, without analysing or even knowing the identity or effects of the other 14 ingredients making up 96% of the paste, this meant the Ms Lim’s evidence was ultimately incomplete and unhelpful.

318    Indeed, even if Ms Lim had checked on the remaining 14 ingredients (both the identities and individual effects), the collective effect of all 16 ingredients, put together in the form of the paste (shown in D2A/D2B) allegedly used on the victims, was also not known or tested by her on any human subject, again because this was not part of her mandate.

319    I further noted that aside from the accused’s claim, there was no independent evidence that the same paste analysed by Ms Lim was used on one, let alone all three of the victims.

320    More importantly, there was no independent evidence that this paste, even if used, would produce the warm, stinging or tingling sensation (as alleged by the Defence) when applied on any part of any customer’s body. Certainly, neither PW1 nor PW2 said that they felt any stinging or tingling sensation when the massage oil/paste was used to massage any part of their body. Further, PW3 confirmed that when the oil (i.e. paste) was applied to her for the massage, she felt the lubrication but did not feel any warm, stinging or tingling sensation on her skin. Neither did it have a strong smell. In addition, when PW3 was touched on her private parts, there were no unusual sensation caused by it. Specifically, PW3 testified that she did not know what the accused had used, but that there was nothing abnormal that she felt on her body.[^98] In addition, it was not clear how much of the paste would have to be applied before it would produce the tingling or burning effect claimed, even if it could have done so, and even if it was used for the massage of one or more of the victims.

321    I would add that the accused’s own evidence was that they would advise customers to whom they applied the paste to wait 2 hours before they showered.[^99] However, there was no evidence from any of the victims, or even from the accused himself, that such advice was given to them. This further suggested that even if a paste was used on the victims, this was not the same as the one shown in D2A/D2B. Alternatively, the paste in D2A/D2B certainly did not cause the tingling or stinging sensation that the Defence claimed.

322    To summarise, I did not find Ms Lim’s evidence to be of any real assistance to the case. And there was nothing to show that the paste, even if it was used on the victims (whether on their private parts or otherwise), would produce the tingling, stinging or burning sensation claimed by the Defence.

### The admissions in the accused’s April 2016 statement

323    I have dealt with the discrepancies between the accused’s testimony in court and the versions he gave in P10. Besides being material in casting doubt on his credibility, P10 also contained a number of admissions, even as it contained excuses that he wanted to put forward. In _Chan Kim Choi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 MLJ 260</span>, the Court of Appeal accepted the position set out in _R v Findley Duncan_ \[1981\] 73 Cr App R 359 at page 365 that for such mixed statements of accused persons, while the entire statement has to be considered, the incriminating parts were likely to be true, whereas the excuses do not carry the same weight.

324    In the present case, it was clear from P10 that at \[4\], the accused was talking about female customers as he had used references like breasts and vagina. In the same paragraph, he admitted that he had used his elbow to massage the buttocks of such customers, and that he does not seek their consent beforehand. Further, for his answer A11 (in response to Q11), where he was talking about PW1, he admitted to massaging her thigh muscles near to her vagina, although he claimed to have done this to alleviate her tightness and pain. He also said that he only stopped massaging this area recently after his wife warned him that “it was a sensitive area”.

325    On these matters, the contents of the accused’s statement contradicted his evidence in court as regards his claim that he did not massage his female customers anywhere above their mid-thighs, and also corroborated the evidence of the victims that he did touch them on the parts of the body as alleged.

326    For completeness, I would add that I did not place much weight on the accused’s June 2016 statement (D17), since this statement does not amount to independent corroboration of his evidence.[^100] As for the Defence’s further argument that disclosure of D17 should have been made at an earlier juncture based on the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Nabill’s_ case, with respect, the Defence’s argument was conceived. _Nabill_ dealt with the additional disclosure obligations pertaining to the disclosure of a statement of a material witness who was not called to the stand (see _Nabill_ at \[38\] and \[39\]). It does not deal with the statement of an accused person who did testify.

### The evidence clearly establishes the guilt of the accused

327    In summary, after a careful consideration of the evidence put forward by the Prosecution and by the Defence, I was satisfied that the victims’ accounts were unusually convincing, and that the evidence taken together conclusively proved the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

328    In particular, I was persuaded that the victims had given clear, coherent, consistent and compelling accounts which showed that the accused had outraged their modesty in the manner set out in their respective charges. I was also satisfied that there had been no fabrication of evidence or collusion by the victims, nor any innocent infection or mistake on their part, and that there was nothing put forward in the Defence’s case that suggested otherwise.

329    In short, I agreed that the Prosecution had established the case against the accused on all three charges and I convicted him accordingly.

## Sentencing Phase

330    In respect of a charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 2 years, or a fine, or caning, or any combination of such punishments.

331    The accused has three previous convictions on 7 August 2018 for offences under Section 9(d) of the Massage Establishments Act (Cap 173, 2013 Rev Ed) in that he had on three different occasions contravened a condition of a massage license by performing massages on the same three female victims who are the subject matter of the present charges. He was fined $600 per charge.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

332    The Prosecution initially submitted that a global sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment should be imposed. This was the position set out in the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions at \[9\]. However, on 9 September 2020, which was the date of the sentencing mention, DPP Lai indicated a change of position, and submitted for an aggregate sentence of 25 months’ imprisonment instead. He explained this aggregate sentence to consist of the following:[^101]

> (a)     First Charge (involving PW2): 10 months’ imprisonment.

> (b)     Second Charge (involving PW3): 13 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. In lieu of these 3 strokes, he asked for an additional 1 month’s imprisonment.

> (c)     Third Charge (involving PW1): 13 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. In lieu of these 3 strokes, he asked for an additional 1 month’s imprisonment.

333    The DPP took the position that the sentence in the first and second charges should run consecutively for what would have been a ‘preliminary’ aggregate sentence of 23 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. However, since the accused could not be caned as he was above 50 years of age, an imprisonment term of 2 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning should be imposed, for an aggregate imprisonment sentence of 25 months (i.e. 23 months + 2 months). [^102]

334    As regards the individual imprisonment sentences set out above, the Prosecution argued that these were justified based on the two-step sentencing bands framework set out by the High Court in _Kunasekaran_ (hereafter the _Kunasekaran_ framework) which involved looking first at the offence-specific factors at the first step to determine which of three bands (band 1–3) would apply, followed by a consideration of offender-specific factors at the second step. I will elaborate on this framework at a later part of this judgment.

335    The Prosecution argued that the current charges fell into Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework, highlighting the following offence-specific factors:

> (a)     The degree of sexual exploitation was high as regards the charges involving PW1 and PW3, as the accused had deliberately and repeatedly rubbed their private parts, skin-on-skin, for a sustained period of time. In addition, he had also rubbed PW3’s anus.

> (b)     There was an abuse of trust as the offences were committed in the course of the accused’s massage of the victims as a professional masseur (citing the case of _PP v Tan Kok Leong and Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 188</span> (“_Tan Kok Leong_”)). That case involved a doctor who molested his victim, whom he had sedated in the course of providing treatment.

> (c)     There was use of deception as the accused had disguised his acts of molest as part of the massage service that he was providing to the victims, citing the case of _GBR_ where deception was recognised to be an offence-specific aggravating factor. The DPP also highlighted the case of _PP v GAO_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 3</span> (“_GAO_”) where the offender, who was a massage therapist, had molested his victim after suggesting to her that he perform a body massage on her to improve her blood circulation.

> (d)     There was premeditation involved in the offences, as the accused had used the same _modus operandi_ on all three victims. He had deliberately positioned the victims such that it would be easy for the acts of molest to be committed, and all three victims were unable to see what the accused was doing when he molested them.

> (e)     There was significant and long-lasting psychological harm caused to the victims as a result of the accused’s intrusion against them. To support this argument, the Prosecution tendered victim impact statements recorded from the victims, whereby they had shared about the emotional and psychological toll caused to them and the distress that they felt, both from the offences committed against them by the accused, as well as from having to testify in court.

336    In addition, the Prosecution argued that there should be no sentencing discount given to the accused as he had demonstrated a lack of remorse.

> (a)     In this regard, the DPP cited the case of _BNO_, where the High Court had found that there was a lack of remorse shown by the offender who had claimed trial to the sexual offence charges, thus putting the Victim through the ordeal of testifying and reliving the painful details of the incident. The Court there commented on “…the bold and extravagant manner in which he chose to conduct his defence”, including making “…numerous spurious allegations in a bid to discredit the Victim.” (_BNO_ at \[195\]).

> (b)     In the present case, the DPP highlighted that the accused had also made the victims testify and relive the painful details of their individual experiences. There had also similarly been numerous spurious allegations made in a bid to discredit the victims by essentially blaming them for their inaction during and after they were molested.

> (c)     In addition, the DPP argued that the accused had also alleged that “…the victims had colluded to frame him just because they went to make the police report together without more”, and this “…sought to disparage the integrity of the victims without sufficient or adequate basis”, and “…exacerbated the hurt the accused had caused them and opened old wounds. It affected and re-traumatised the victims.” [^103]

337    As regards the sentence sought, the Prosecution argued that since private parts were intruded in respect of the victims for the second and third charges, a sentence of three strokes per charge would have been appropriate for these charges. While caning could not be carried out because of the accused’s age, the aggravating features of the case justified an additional imprisonment term of one month in lieu of caning for each of these two charges.

338    The DPP also submitted that the proposed global sentence (of 25 months’ imprisonment) would not infringe the one transaction rule or the totality principle. It would also not be remiss even if the Prosecution had submitted that the sentences for the second and third charges should run consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment. This was because the accused had molested three women, and because of his greater culpability, and the greater harm that he had caused. Thus, asking for the sentences for the first and third charges (rather than the sentences for the second and third charges) to run consecutively was already taking a lenient position.

339    Finally, the Prosecution argued that its proposed sentence was supported by precedents, namely:

> (a)      _GCD_: For this case, the offender had claimed trial to four counts of outrage of modesty against a 16-year-old female student who was taking private cello lessons from him. He was convicted and sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment each for the two charges involving the touching of the chest; 5 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving the touching of the thigh; and 15 months’ imprisonment and 1 stroke of the cane involving the direct touching of the breast. His global sentence was 21 months’ imprisonment with 1 stroke of the cane. The DPP argued that in the present case, an uplift in the imprisonment sentence from 21 months’ imprisonment (to 25 months’ imprisonment) was justified as the accused here was more culpable than _GCD_, as his acts of molest involved a greater degree of sexual exploitation as he had rubbed, and not merely touched, PW1 and PW3’s genitalia, and he had also molested three victims while _GCD_ only molested one.

> (b)      _Rakesh Kumar_: The offender, a yoga teacher, had claimed trial to one count of outrage of modesty by slipping his hand under the victim’s sports brassiere, pinching her left upper breast and touching her breast. His sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment without caning was enhanced, by the High Court, to 12 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane. According to the DPP, the sentence was enhanced because the High Court there noted that the offender had abused the trust of the victim, there was a pattern of escalation in his actions, and there was evidence of premeditation in that the second and third instances of molest were clearly deliberate. DPP Lai argued that in the present case, the accused was more culpable than _Rakesh Kumar_, since the contact made on PW1 and PW3’s genitalia was repeated over a prolonged period of time, and the accused had molested a total of three victims while _Rakesh Kumar_ had only molested one. In addition, the accused here was deceptive when committing the offences, while _Rakesh Kumar_ was not. An uplift from 12 months’ (to 13 months’) imprisonment per charge for the second and third charges was thus warranted.

> (c)      _PP v Loh Siang Piow @ Loh Chan Pew_ (MAC 904652/2017 and anor) (“_Loh Siang Piow_”) (sentenced on 22 July 2020): The offender, a track-and-field coach, had claimed trial to two counts of outrage of modesty by (i) rubbing the victim’s vulva over her clothing with his thumb under the guise of massaging the back of her thighs; and (ii) rubbing the victim’s vulva over her clothing with his thumb under the guise of massaging the back of her thighs. The victim was his former trainee. The offender was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for the first charge, and 13 months’ imprisonment for the second charge, with both sentences running consecutively for a global sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment. The case is pending appeal against conviction and sentence in the High Court. The Prosecution argued that the accused in the present case was more culpable than _Loh Siang Piow_ since the acts of molest committed by the accused involved a greater degree of sexual exploitation given that there was skin-on-skin contact with the victims’ genitalia and groin area, and a total of three victims were involved in the present case, whereas _Loh Siang Piow_ involved only one victim. Therefore an uplift from a cumulative sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment (to 25 months’ imprisonment) was warranted.

### Mitigation Plea and Defence’s reply

340    The Defence submitted for a global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment, based on the following considerations:

> (a)     The accused’s background: the Defence stated that the accused had given up his career as an engineer to set up Genki Wellness with his wife, and has various medical conditions, namely diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and high blood pressure. Further, Ding Jun was now the sole breadwinner, and their daughter, who recently graduated, was looking for a job;

> (b)     The accused’s unblemished record;

> (c)     The sentencing framework for such offences; and

> (d)     The relevant sentencing precedents.

341    As regards, the sentencing framework for s 354(1) Penal Code offences, the Defence also sought to apply the _Kunasekaran_ framework, and argued that the accused’s offences fell into the middle of Band 2, on the basis that there was intrusion of the victims’ private parts, and also skin-to-skin contact, but no deception. Counsel argued that the sole offence-specific aggravating factor was that the offence was committed opportunistically in the course of a massage.

342    Counsel also submitted that the present case was less egregious when compared to the following cases where the offenders had also claimed trial:

> (a)      _PP v Chai Meng Teck_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 16</span> _(“Chai Meng Teck_”): This case involved an offender, a school counsellor, who was convicted after trial of four charges of outrage of modesty and one count of attempted outrage of modesty. Two of the outrage of modesty changes involved direct skin-to-skin contact with the genitalia of two victims, where the offender had touched the penis of one victim, and had stroked the penis and scrotum of another. The court applied the _Kunasekaran_ framework, and identified the following offence-specific aggravating factors: (1) the offender was a school counsellor who was in a position of trust vis-a-vis his victims, who were young and vulnerable secondary school students at the time; and (2) the offence against one of the victims was premeditated because the accused had asked him to come to his office under the pretext of a discussion before molesting him. While the Court found that this case fell at the higher end of Band 2, the harm caused to the victims was not severe. The sentence imposed was 12 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for each charge, with an aggregate sentence of 32 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. As caning could not be inflicted because of the accused’s age, an additional 12 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed in lieu of caning.

> (b)      _PP v Chan Cheng_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 245</span> (“_Chan Cheng_”): The offender was a psychology lecturer who was engaged by a school to conduct a 3-day youth camp for its secondary one male students in June 1999. He was convicted at trial on five charges of outrage of modesty under section 354 of the pre-2008 Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). He also consented to seven similar charges being taken into consideration for sentencing (TIC charges). Of the five charges proceeded with, three of them involved skin-to-skin contact, where the offender had caressed the victims’ penises under the false pretexts of massaging their thighs, applying body powder, or supervising their shower. After conviction, the offender had absconded. When finally sentenced, the court applied the _Kunasekaran_ framework and identified multiple offence-specific aggravating factors, including the young age and vulnerable status of the victims (13 years old at the time of the offences), the fact that the offender was the camp commandant who had abused his position of trust and authority, and the fact that the offences were premeditated. Further, there were also seven TIC charges, and the offender had absconded while on bail. For the molest offences involving the victims’ genitalia, the Court held that the charges fell at the upper end of Band 2, and sentenced the accused to 14 months’ imprisonment per charge. The Court further ordered an additional term of five months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning as the offender would have been liable for 11 to 16 strokes of caning had he not absconded in 1999. His aggregate sentence was 43 months’ imprisonment, inclusive of 5 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.

343    The Defence argued that the offences in the present case were less egregious than those in _Chan Cheng_ and _Chai Meng Teck_, as the latter two cases involved offenders who were in positions of authority. They had also exploited their students who were vulnerable victims. Further, the offences in _Chan Cheng_ and _Chai Meng Teck_ were premeditated, and involved the use of deceptive behaviour in order to create the opportunities to carry out the offences.

344    In contrast, the Defence argued that the most that could be said in the present case was that the accused had acted in an opportunistic manner when he touched the victims inappropriately during their massage. Hence, his offences fell within the middle of Band 2, with an indicative starting point of less than 12 months’ imprisonment.

345    The Defence also argued that the accused’s offences were most similar to the offence in _PP v Li Qingdong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 60</span> (“_Li Qingdong_”), where the offender, a masseur who was convicted after trial of touching the victim’s genital area in the course of a massage, was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. There, the offender had used his fingers to touch the victim’s vagina a total of nine to ten times in the course of a massage, and had massaged her buttocks over her bare skin for about 20 seconds. The victim suffered psychological harm even long after the incident. The Defence submitted that “(s)uch harm would have been a relevant factor under the _Kunasekaran_ framework”[^104], and that “…there was little evidence that the \[victims here\] have suffered any continuing harm, and no victim impact statement has been submitted by the Prosecution”.[^105] Thus, the sentence here should be lower than the 11 months’ imprisonment imposed in _Li Qingdong_.

346    The Defence further submitted that there were no offender-specific aggravating factors, and that since the accused was a first offender, a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment per charge was appropriate.

347    On the issue of imposing imprisonment in lieu of caning, the Defence recognised that caning would otherwise have been appropriate in the present case, but the accused’s age, as the offence involved the intrusion of the victim’s private parts, and there was a discretion for the court to impose caning in lieu of imprisonment in the circumstances.[^106] However, counsel argued that it would not be appropriate to do so, citing _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 904</span> (“_Amin_”), where Sundaresh Menon CJ had held that the correct starting point is that an offender’s term of imprisonment term should not be enhanced in lieu of caning unless there were grounds to justify doing so. Counsel also highlighted the case of _GBR_, where the Court had held at \[40\] that a term of imprisonment should only be enhanced in lieu of caning where there are substantial aggravating factors which require a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence, such as the use of violence or the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable class of victims. These factors are absent here.

348    Finally, on the aggregate sentence, the Defence argued that in line with the principles of totality and proportionality, and with the need to avoid double counting, only the two sentences for the second and third charges should be ordered to run consecutively, for a global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment.

## Court’s Decision on Sentence

349    As stated above, both parties agreed that the _Kunasekaran_ framework should apply in the present case.

350    Under the first step of the framework:

> (a)     The Court ascertains the gravity of the offence by examining the manner and mode in which the offence was committed (“offence-specific factors”). This entails examining (i) the degree of sexual exploitation, (ii) the circumstances of the offence, and (iii) the harm caused to the victim whether physical or psychological.

> (b)     After examining these factors, the Court should place the offence within the appropriate band, with the range of punishment as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.46%"> <col width="61.52%"> <col width="25.02%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 5 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where two or more offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where numerous offence-specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

351    For the second step of the framework:

> (a)     The Court should consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that are personal to the offender (“offender-specific factors”).

> (b)     Offender-specific aggravating factors include an offender’s lack of remorse and the number of charges taken into consideration. Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt which obviates the need for a victim to be re-traumatised through trial proceedings.

352    Parties also submitted on the issue of whether imprisonment in lieu of caning should be imposed, as well as the appropriate global sentence in this case. I will set out my views on the appropriate individual sentences based on the _Kunasekaran_ framework, before commenting on whether imprisonment in lieu of caning should be imposed, and finally the aggregate sentence to impose.

### Applying the Kunasekaran framework.

353    To recap, I had found the Prosecution to have made out the elements of each charge. For convenience, the details of the charges, the brief description of what the accused did, and the proposed sentences put forward by the parties are summarised below for easy reference.

354    As could be seen from the table above, both parties agreed that based on the charges that were made out, the accused’s offences fell within Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran f_ramework. However, except for the sentence involving PW2’s charge, they disagreed over the starting point and individual sentences for the charges involving PW1 and PW3, and hence the aggregate sentence.

355    I now move on to apply the _Kunasekaran_ framework, where the first step involves consideration of the relevant offence-specific factors, namely: (i) the degree of sexual exploitation; (ii) the circumstances of the offence; and (iii) the harm caused to the victim.

#### First Step: Offence-Specific Factors

356    I will start with the first charge which involves PW2. Both parties agreed that a 10 months’ imprisonment sentence would be appropriate for this offence.

##### First charge: Sliding his hand under PW2’s panties and rubbing her groin area

##### (a)   Degree of sexual exploitation

357    As regards this consideration, it has been held that this factor includes “…considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty_”_ (see _Kunasekaran_ at \[45(a)(i)\]). Further, as highlighted by the Defence, Chan J in _Kunasekaran_ had made a distinction between an offender who touches a victim on her groin area as opposed to her private parts (see _Kunasekaran_ at \[55\]), since touching of a victim on the former “…does not _ipso facto_ mean that private parts had been intruded upon”.

358    In the present case, as set out in the charge, the area intruded upon was identified to be the groin area of PW2, rather than her private parts. I also noted that there was skin-to-skin contact involved.

##### (b)   Circumstances of the offence

359    As regards this consideration, Chan J accepted the following factors (as set out in _GBR_) to also be relevant for a s 354(1) charge, namely: “(A) the presence of premeditation; (B) the use of force or violence; (C) the abuse of a position of trust; (D) the use of deception; (E) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (F) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim”.

360    In the present case, despite submissions to the contrary from the Prosecution, I was of the view that there was no obvious evidence of premeditation by the accused. In this regard, I was willing to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and accepted the Defence’s argument that the offence was more opportunistic than planned.

361    However, I accepted that there was some degree of abuse of trust, since PW2 had, by allowing herself to be massaged by the accused in her state of semi-undress, essentially trusted the accused as a professional masseur, and expected that he would perform the massage in a lawful manner. By molesting her, the accused had thus abused this trust. Further, I was of the view that in order to carry out his offence, the accused had also practised deception, as that it was under the guise of performing the massage service, that the accused could, and did, slip his hand under her panties and rub her groin area.

362    While the Defence argued that there was an element of double counting if both the considerations of “abuse of trust” and “deception” were considered in sentencing,[^108] with respect, I do not agree. Quite apart from the fact that the High Court in _Kunasekaran_ had accepted that these are distinct considerations that may apply, the Defence appeared to have misunderstood how these considerations both applied in the present situation. Specifically, in the context of the abuse of trust, the victim had placed her trust in the accused “by virtue of his office of employment” (see \[29(c)\] of _GBR)_ as a masseur. As for deception, he had practised this by tricking her into believing that a full body massage required him to massage her at/or near the groin area (as part of the massage), thus enabling him to reach an area that he would otherwise not have been able to. In this regard, even by his own account in P10, this area of his customers was clearly off-limits, since he was not supposed to massage a customer above her thigh region. Further, as a result of practising deception on PW2 (and the other victims) in this manner, this also made the offence harder to detect, since PW2 (and the other victims) was unsure about whether the accused’s actions were part of genuine massage practice, and also whether the contact that he made with their groin/private parts was accidental or intentional.

363    All in all, I agreed with the Prosecution that both the aggravating factors of abuse of trust and deception operated in the present case.

##### (c)   Harm caused to the victim

364    In _Kunasekaran_ at \[59\], even though no victim impact statement (VIS) was tendered, Justice Chan accepted the victim’s evidence of how she was traumatised and affected by the incident. His Honour held that the lack of a victim impact statement should only affect the _weight_ to be accorded to the victim’s evidence of psychological harm.

365    In the present case, to the Prosecution’s credit, the DPP did tender a VIS for each of the three victims to show evidence of the psychological harm suffered by them. DPP Lai submitted that the VIS demonstrated that “…. all three victims have suffered significant and long-lasting psychological harm as a result of the offender’s intrusion to their bodies.”[^109]

366    The Defence had initially wrongly assumed that the Prosecution would not tender any VIS and thus argued that “…there is little evidence that the \[victims\] have suffered any continuing harm, and no victim impact statement has been submitted by the Prosecution”. [^110] However, when confronted with the VIS of all three victims, the Defence then tried to argue, without any obvious substantiation, that “(t)he negative impact suffered by the \[victims\] as outlined in the victim impact statements were a result of the stress of trial, and not a result of \[the accused’s\] offences”.[^111]

367    With respect, while the victims were also clearly affected by their experience of being questioned and challenged by the Defence at the trial, the bulk of their VIS specifically dealt with how they had individually been adversely impacted and traumatised by the offences committed against them by the accused, and how they remained adversely affected to this day. In this regard, contrary to the suggestion from counsel, the VIS of each victim reflected the psychological harm caused by the accused’s offences against each of them.

368    In the case of PW2, in her VIS, she shared that she was “…greatly traumatized by the ordeal that \[she\] had been put through”, and that this has left a “psychological scar”. PW2 also revealed that she still experiences flashbacks of the incident, and continues to feel an “…upsetting anxiety and a nagging emotion” whenever she thinks about getting a massage, even though massage treatments are a very essential part of her routine as a dancer. In short, the accused’s actions against PW2 continue to haunt her to this day.

369    Thus, based on the considerations above, it was clear that this was a Band 2 case, something that both the Prosecution and Defence accepted. Further, using the guidance put forward by Justice Chan in _Kunasekaran_, and consistent with the decision of the Court in _PP v Goh Eng Chin_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 17</span> (“_Goh Eng Chin”)_, where it was similarly decided that it was a Band 2 situation where the offender had violated the victim by touching her thigh, hugging her, and using his head to touch her pubic region, an appropriate sentence to impose on the present case would be in the range of about 10 months (as suggested by both parties) to 11 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, the latter being the sentence imposed in _Goh Eng Chin_. I will deal with the appropriate final sentence for this charge at a later part of this judgment.

##### Second & Third charges: Rubbing PW3’s vulva, buttocks and anus, and sliding his hand under PW1’s panties and rubbing her vulva respectively

370    As there were similarities in the circumstances of both charges, I will deal with them together.

##### (a)   Degree of sexual exploitation

371    As regards the issue of sexual exploitation:

> (a)     I agreed with the Prosecution that the degree of sexual exploitation was high for both charges, since the accused had repeatedly rubbed their private parts, skin-on-skin, for a sustained period of time.

> (b)     In the case of PW3, the accused had also not only rubbed her vulva, he had done the same to her buttocks and anus.

> (c)     Clearly, based on this consideration, both offences were more serious than the offence reflected in the first charge and, all things being equal, the individual sentences should also be higher.

##### (b)   Circumstances of the offences

372    Moving on to this second consideration, the same factors of abuse of trust and deception equally applied as per the first charge. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the accused slipped his finger/thumb into their boy shorts and/or under their panties and rubbed their private parts. He thereafter continued his massage, acting as if nothing was wrong. It was no wonder that his actions left the victims in a confused and anguished state. It is to this factor that I now turn.

##### (c)   Harm caused to the victims

373    As with PW2, for PW1 and PW3, a VIS was also put up for each of them. The VIS showed that like PW2, PW1 and PW3 also suffered distress, and continuing anguish and even shame as a result of the accused’s offences.

374    PW3 shared in her VIS that the incident has taken “a toll on \[her\] emotionally as well as psychologically”, and that the incident weighs heavily on her mind and state of being. She described that “…it has scarred \[her\] certainly for the rest of \[her\] life” and that she “spent hours that night crying over it and several days after that feeling disgusted, feeling violated, feeling absolutely disappointed in \[herself\] for letting it happen. It is certainly not easy to leave it behind. \[She\] will never forgive that man for doing what he did”.

375    As for PW1, she related how the incident had impacted her emotionally, and recounted that that “…when the incident first happened, there was a lot of confusion felt, and also a slight sense of shame”. She recalled that the period was distressing for her, and that she was afraid that the accused would recognise her. PW1 also stated that her parents were very concerned about her safety, and shared that she “…. still feels scared when \[she\] see male masseurs as it reminds \[her\] of the incidents”.

376    It was thus clear that the VIS of the victims provided clear support for the Prosecution’s position that significant psychological harm had been caused to the victims as a result of the accused’s offences committed against them.

377    All things considered, I agreed with the Prosecution that the starting point for the second and third charges should be at the higher end of Band 2. For these charges, the Prosecution submitted that the starting point should be 12 to 15 months’ imprisonment, while the Defence submitted that 10 months’ imprisonment would suffice, albeit based on their initial assumption that no evidence of harm had been shown. I will address the issue of the appropriate final sentence for each charge at a later part of this judgement.

#### Second Step: Offender- Specific factors

378    I agreed with the Defence that the accused was entitled to claim trial as is his right, since the burden is always on the Prosecution to prove its case. That said, it is also uncontroversial that he should hence not be entitled to any sentencing discount as evidence of remorse.[^112]

379    In fact, the manner in which the trial was carried out may itself be an aggravating factor, particularly in cases involving sexual offences, where “…victims of sexual offences are made to relive the trauma of their sexual assault when they have to attend court to give evidence and be cross-examined on it” (see _BNO_ at \[194\] citing the decision of _Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 68</span>).

380    In this regard, I noted that two of the victims had also set out in their respective VIS, about how the trial had negatively impacted them. PW1 shared that “…taking the witness stand was really distressing for me…” and that “(t)he defence counsel made me feel like I was a criminal, and I found his questions extremely condescending...it was very stressful for me, and I remember feeling the effects of the trial over the next few days, feeling my mind running through the occurrences and what I said and what was being said. After the trial, there was still some lingering anxiety as to whether we had to take the stand again, and every time the possibility was mentioned, I felt anxious.” As for PW2, she recounted that the trial had left her shaken, as “(i)t was overwhelming and not to mention, intimidating on the stand, facing the accused for the second time”.

381    As for counsel’s argument about the accused’s clean record, I noted that the offences involved three separate victims and three separate incidents, and that they were all committed over the span of 2 weeks (from 4 March 2016 to 13 March 2016). In such circumstances involving multiple offences, “(t)he most that can be said about the \[accused\] in this case is _not_ that he is a first-time offender, but that he did not have any prior antecedents.” (per Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 117</span> at \[47\]).

### Why I declined to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning

382    It is trite law that where the outrage of modesty involves intrusion of a victim’s private part, as a starting point, caning will be imposed (see _Kunasekaran_ at \[50\]).

383    In the present case, the Defence correctly accepted that caning would have been imposed but for the fact that the accused was more than 50 years old (see section 325(1)(_b_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”)). However, while the Defence also acknowledged that the court may impose imprisonment of not more than 12 months in lieu of caning under section 325(2) of the CPC, counsel argued that in light of the guidance of the High Court in _Amin_ at \[53\], and of the High Court in _GBR_ at \[40\], the term of imprisonment should not be enhanced in lieu of caning in the present case (see \[347\] above).

384    In contrast, at the sentencing mention on 9 September 2020, the Prosecution argued that so far as the second and third charges were concerned, additional imprisonment of one month per charge in lieu of caning should be imposed in light of the aggravating factors of the case, even as it acknowledged that the same aggravating factors may already have been factored in its sentencing submissions for the proposed imprisonment terms for these charges. The Prosecution also did not appear to have directly addressed the guidance set out by the High Court in _Amin_ and also in _GBR_, that as a starting point, imprisonment in lieu of caning should not be imposed.

385    In deciding this issue, I was of the view that since the private parts of PW3 and PW1, the victims identified in the second and third charges respectively, had been intruded, ordinarily at least 3 strokes of the cane would have been imposed for each charge. This would have meant imposing an additional sentence of 6 strokes of the cane. Based on the indicative guidelines for imprisonment in lieu of caning as set out in \[90\] of _Amin_, effectively an additional imprisonment sentence of up to 3 months may have been appropriate.

386    However, in the present case, even if it could be said that the victims were all in a vulnerable position _vis-a-vis_ each being in a state of partial undress and being alone with the accused in the room at the time they were molested, I accepted that there was neither violence exhibited by the accused, nor could the victims be considered as a “vulnerable class of victims”, within the meaning set out in _GBR_. Accordingly, and in line with the Defence submissions, I declined to impose any additional imprisonment in lieu of caning.

### Final Sentence

387    In determining the sentence to impose for each charge, as well as the number and specific imprisonment terms to run consecutively, I was guided by the following principles set out by the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee”):_

> (a)     After the Court determines the appropriate individual sentences, it must consider which sentences are to run consecutively, taking care not to violate the one-transaction rule. The one-transaction rule is not an inflexible or rigid rule but serves as a filter to sieve out those sentences that ought not as a general rule be ordered to run consecutively. The application of this rule is to be undertaken as a matter of common sense, and it is helpful to have regard to factors such as proximity in time, purpose or location of the offence, continuity of design and unity of the legally protected interests (_Shouffee_ at \[27\] and \[40\]).

> (b)     The Court should then consider if the aggregate sentence runs afoul of the totality principle, which is a principle of limitation and a manifestation of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions. Two limbs have to be considered. First, whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of offences involved; and second, whether its effect is to impose on the offender a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects (_Shouffee_ at \[47\], \[54\] and \[57\]).

> (c)     The totality principle is a consideration that applies at the end of the sentencing process that requires the court to take a last look at the facts and circumstances to assess whether the sentence looks wrong. If, having taken a last look at the facts and circumstances and a sentence looks wrong, the Court may consider re-assessing which sentences ought to run consecutively or re-calibrating the individual sentences so as to arrive at an appropriate global sentence (_Shouffee_ at \[58\] and \[59\]).

> (d)     In considering the totality principle, the Court is to observe three ancillary principles. First, the total term of imprisonment for the sentences to be run consecutively had to exceed the imprisonment term imposed for the highest individual sentence. Second, the Court must be vigilant to ensure that aggravating factors are not counted against the accused twice over. Third, where the circumstances called for it, the Court can order more than two sentences to run consecutively (_Shouffee_ at \[75\], \[77\], \[79\] and \[80\])).

388    In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen_”), Menon CJ reaffirmed the approach set out in _Shouffee_, and also made it clear that as a general rule, an offender who had committed multiple unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and that this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively (see \[41\] of _Raveen)._

389    In addition to the above principles set out in case law, section 307(1) of the _CPC_ also provides that where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the Court must order the sentences for at least 2 of these offences to run consecutively.

390    Having assessed the possible sentences for the individual charges, and being guided by the above sentencing principles that applied to offenders with multiple charges, I imposed the following final sentences:

> (a)     1st charge: 10 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     2nd charge: 12 months’ imprisonment

> (c)     3rd charge: 12 months imprisonment.

391    The sentences for the first and second charges were ordered to run consecutively for a global sentence of 22 months’ imprisonment.

392    I would add that the individual sentences of 10 to 12 months’ imprisonment per charge were lower than the sentences imposed for the individual charges in _Rakesh Kumar_ and _Tan Kok Leong_ in light of the differences between those cases and the present case. The sentences that I imposed were, however, similar to the sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane imposed in _Li Qingdong_, another molest case involving a masseur, albeit that case involved only one victim. In addition, the aggregate sentence of 22 months’ imprisonment imposed here, for an accused who had outraged the modesty of three victims in the manner set out in the charges, was also considerably lower than the aggregate sentences imposed in _Chai Meng Teck_ and _Chan Cheng_, where the facts were more egregious.

393    All in all, I am of the view that the aggregate sentence imposed on the accused is fair and proportionate, and has taken into account all the relevant sentencing principles, sentencing considerations and sentencing precedents.

394    Finally, it leaves me to thank counsel and the DPPs for coming up with detailed and useful submissions, which were of immense assistance to the Court in arriving at the verdict and sentence in this case.

[^6]: While the witnesses often used the term “vagina” to describe the external female genitalia that they said the accused rubbed, the more anatomically accurate term “vulva” was used in the charges. For the purposes of this judgment, the two terms are generally used interchangeably.

[^7]: The witnesses and parties used the words “oil” and “paste” interchangeable. As such, for the purpose of this judgement, no distinction has been made between these two words and they are generally taken to mean the same thing.
