\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9085/2019/01.\]

3 May 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

1       Mr Tham Chin Chee, a Singapore citizen currently 28 years of age, was addicted to gambling, and became in debt due to his gambling habits. He resorted to borrowing money from unlicensed moneylenders (“**UMLs**”) to pay his debts. He was harassed by UMLs when he was unable to repay his debts to them. Between May and December 2017 he worked for one of the UMLs in order to repay his debts. He collected bank cards, bank tokens and cash, and performed banking transactions for the UML. He also moved large amounts of cash, which were illegal proceeds of the business of the UML, out of Singapore and into Malaysia.

2       15 charges were brought against the defendant. 12 charges related to his providing assistance to facilitate the business of the UML, which were offences under the _Moneylenders Act_ (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“**MLA**”). Three charges related to his moving the UML’s illegal proceeds out of Singapore, which were offences under the _Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act_ (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“**CDSA**”).

3       Following a plea offer by the prosecution the defendant pleaded guilty to five charges, with and remaining 10 offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 18 April 2019 he was sentenced to a total of 10 months’ imprisonment and $90,000 fine (in default 3 months’ imprisonment). He began serving the sentence, and filed the present appeal against the sentence on 22 April 2019.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## PLEA OF GUILT

#### Charges

5       The defendant pleaded guilty to five charges.

#### (a)   MLA charges

6       Three charges were for assisting the UML, which were offences under the MLA:

DAC-946309-2017 (1st Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, \[sometime\] on the 20th day of December 2017, at the vicinity of 57 Dawson Road, in Singapore, did assist an unlicensed moneylender known as “Jacob”, in the carrying on of the business of moneylending, _to wit_, by collecting one United Overseas Bank (UOB) ATM card bearing serial number \[xxxxxxx.x\] from one \[CLT\] on behalf of the said Jacob, knowing that these would facilitate his unlicensed moneylending business, when he is not an excluded moneylender or an exempt moneylender or authorised to do so by licence, and you have thereby assisted in the contravention of Section 5(1) of the Moneylenders’ Act, Chapter 188 (Revised Edition 2010) and committed an offence punishable under Section 14(1)(b)(i) read with Section 14(1A)(a) of the said Act.

DAC-930005-2018 (10th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, from mid-September 2017 to December 2017, in Singapore, did assist one unlicensed moneylender known as “Jacob”, in the carrying on of the business of moneylending, _to wit_, by performing fund transfers, making cash withdrawals and checking of account balances, using a United Overseas Bank bank account (account number \[yyy-yyy-yyy-y\]) linked to a direct VISA card bearing serial number \[yyyy yyyy yyyy yyyy\], knowing that these would facilitate Jacob’s unlicensed moneylending business, when he was not an excluded moneylender or an exempt moneylender or authorised to do so by licence, and you have thereby assisted in the contravention of Section 5(1) of the Moneylenders’ Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) and committed an offence punishable under Section 14(1)(b)(i) read with Section 14(1A)(a) of the said Act.

DAC-930009-2018 (14th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, \[sometime\] between late October 2017 and early November 2017, somewhere in the vicinity of Geylang, Singapore, did assist one unlicensed moneylender known as “Jacob”, in the carrying on of the business of moneylending, _to wit_, by collecting cash generated from Jacob’s unlicensed Moneylending business amounting to SGD $7000 from his worker, knowing that these would facilitate Jacob’s unlicensed moneylending business, when he was not an excluded moneylender or an exempt moneylender or authorised to do so by licence, and you have thereby assisted in the contravention of Section 5(1) of the Moneylenders’ Act, Chapter 188 (Revised Edition 2010) and committed an offence punishable under Section 14(1)(b)(i) read with Section 14(1A)(a) of the said Act.

#### (b)   CDSA charges

7       Two charges were for removing cash, which represented the illegal proceeds of the UML, out of Singapore, which were offences under the CDSA:

DAC-930006-2018 (11th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, on 2 November 2017, at about 12.36am, at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did remove property from the jurisdiction of Singapore, namely, cash amounting to S$10,000, _to wit_, by bringing out the said amount of cash into Malaysia, when you knew that such property, in whole, directly represents one Jacob’s benefits from criminal conduct, namely, the carrying on of the business of unlicensed moneylending in contravention of section 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under section 47(2)(b) and punishable under section 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed).

DAC-930007-2018 (12th Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, on 1 December 2017, at about 12.36am, at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did remove property from the jurisdiction of Singapore, namely, cash amounting to S$10,000, _to wit_, by bringing out the said amount of cash into Malaysia, when you knew that such property, in whole, directly represents one Jacob’s benefits from criminal conduct, namely, the carrying on of the business of unlicensed moneylending in contravention of section 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under section 47(2)(b) and punishable under section 47(6)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed).

#### Facts

#### (a)   Defendant’s involvement with unlicensed moneylenders (UMLs)

8       Sometime in 2011, the defendant became addicted to gambling. He was unable to settle the debts accrued as a result of his gambling habits. He then resorted to borrowing money from various UMLs to repay his gambling debts and continue his gambling habits. By 2017 he owed about $15,000 to eight UMLs.

9       When he became unable to repay his debts, the UMLs started to harass him for repayment. Sometime in May 2017, a UML known as “Jacob” called the defendant on his mobile phone and asked him to repay a loan that he had taken. When he told Jacob that he was unable to repay, Jacob offered to offset $1,000 of the debt per month, and offered to pay him an additional $1,000 per month, if he worked for Jacob in the UML business.

10     The defendant agreed to work for Jacob. His job scope was to collect ATM cards and internet banking tokens from Jacob’s runners, and to perform bank transactions from the bank accounts. From July to 20 December 2017, the defendant collected more than ten ATM cards and performed bank transactions using four bank accounts. He performed the transactions daily between 3 pm and 10 pm.

11     Additionally, from August 2017 onwards, the defendant was also tasked by Jacob to bring cash proceeds from Jacob’s UML business out of Singapore, and to pass the cash to Jacob’s runners in Malaysia. The defendant would either withdraw these cash proceeds from the bank accounts on Jacob’s instructions, or he would collect cash from Jacob’s runners. The defendant would travel to Malaysia about four to five times per month for this purpose. Each time he would hand over at least $8,000 in cash to Jacob’s runners in Malaysia. For this particular role he was paid $2,000 per month.

12     The defendant cleared his debts with Jacob in September 2017. From early October 2017, he started to earn $4,000 per month from Jacob for his various roles in assisting Jacob’s UML business.

13     At all times the defendant knew that Jacob was a UML, and that he was not an excluded moneylender or exempt moneylender, nor was he authorised to carry on a moneylending business by licence.

14     On 20 December 2017, police officers arrested the defendant in the vicinity of 57 Dawson Road, Singapore, on suspicion that he had committed offences under the MLA.

#### (b)   Facts relating to MLA charges

15     Sometime on 20 December 2017, in the vicinity of 57 Dawson Road, the defendant assisted the UML Jacob in the carrying on of his moneylending business by collecting a United Overseas Bank (“**UOB**”) ATM Card (serial number xxxxxxx.x) from one CLT. (DAC-946309-2017; 1st Charge)

16     From mid-September to December 2017, in Singapore, the defendant assisted the UML Jacob in the carrying on of his moneylending business by performing banking transactions such as fund transfers, cash withdrawals, and checking of account balances, using a UOB account (account number \[yyy-yyy-yyy-y\]), linked to a Visa card (serial number \[yyyy yyyy yyyy yyyy\]). (DAC-930005-2018; 10th Charge)

17     Sometime between late October and early November 2017, in the vicinity of Geylang, the defendant assisted the UML Jacob in the carrying on of his moneylending business by collecting $7,000 in cash from one of Jacob’s runners. The defendant knew that the money was proceeds from Jacob’s UML business. (DAC-930009-2018; 14th Charge)

#### (c)   Facts relating to CDSA charges

18     Sometime on 1 November 2017, the defendant collected $7,000 in cash from Jacob’s runner in Geylang. He also withdrew $3,000 from a UOB bank account which he was using to perform banking transactions on behalf of Jacob. On 2 November 2017, at about 12.36 am, the defendant crossed the causeway into Malaysia through the Woodlands Checkpoint, and handed over the $10,000 in cash to Jacob’s runner in Malaysia. He returned to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint at 1.21 am on the same day. (DAC-930006-2018; 11th Charge)

19     Between 30 November to 1 December 2017, the defendant collected $5,000 in cash from Jacob’s runner in Geylang. He also withdrew $5,000 in cash from a DBS bank account which he was using to perform banking transactions for Jacob. On 1 December 2017, at about 12.36 am, the defendant crossed the causeway into Malaysia through Woodlands Checkpoint, and handed over the $10,000 in cash to Jacob’s runner in Malaysia. He returned to Singapore through the Woodlands Checkpoint at 1.09 am on the same day. (DAC-930007-2018; 12th Charge)

20     At all times the defendant knew that the cash from Jacob’s runners and from the various bank accounts, which he had removed from the jurisdiction of Singapore, directly represented Jacob’s benefits from criminal conduct in the carrying on of the UML business in contravention of the MLA.

#### Charges taken into consideration (TIC)

21     Apart from the five charges to which he pleaded guilty, the defendant also admitted to 10 other offences and consented to having these offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These charges related to:

(a)     Assisting in the business of the UML Jacob by collecting bank cards and tokens (four charges), conducting multiple banking transactions (four charges), and collecting cash (one charge) – offences under the MLA; and

(b)     Bringing $8,000 cash out of Singapore and handing over to the UML’s runner in Malaysia (one charge).

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

22     The prosecution submitted that general and specific deterrence were key sentencing considerations in the present case. It was highlighted that the defendant had already cleared his debt in September 2017, and he continued to work for the UML for profit after that.

23     For the charges relating to the collection of ATM cards and cash on behalf of the UML, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least one month’s imprisonment and $30,000 fine for each charge. For the charge relating to performing banking transactions, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment and $30,000 fine. These were in line with the usual sentences for such offences.

24     For the two charges under the CDSA, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 6 months’ imprisonment per charge. It was highlighted that the defendant had brought $10,000 in cash out of jurisdiction on each occasion. This had occurred over one to two months. There was also a TIC charge where he brought out $8,000. The total amount transacted was $28,000. Furthermore, he had _actual_ knowledge that he was assisting a UML, as he had collected money from the UML’s runners in Singapore as well as withdrawn money from bank accounts on behalf of the UML.

25     It was further submitted that one sentence for each category of offences run consecutively, giving a global sentence of at least 10 months’ imprisonment and $90,000 fine.

26     Various precedents were cited by the prosecution, which will be considered later (at \[31\]).

#### Mitigation plea

27     In his mitigation plea, the defendant said that his involvement in the offences was borne out of fear and a misjudged attempt to protect his family from further harassment from the UMLs. He had fully cooperated with the authorities. This was his first time being convicted. He was immensely remorseful and sincerely regretted his actions and would not commit such offences again.

28     He made mention of his personal circumstances. He was married with a new born child. His wife was not working and was taking care of the child. His mother resided in a nursing home. He was responsible for all the household needs and expenses. This included looking after a wheelchair-bound aunty who suffered from various ailments.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### (a)   Sentencing objective

29     In deciding upon the appropriate sentence, I considered the dominant sentencing objective to be _deterrence_. This applied both to the MLA charges and the CDSA charges.

#### (b)   Sentencing precedents

30     I was also of the judgment that the prosecution’s sentencing submissions were consistent with the sentences imposed in past cases, and were correct in principle.

31     The relevant sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution were as follows:

#### (c)   Appropriate sentence

32     In respect of the MLA charges involving the collection of an ATM card (1st Charge) and cash (14th Charge) on behalf of the UML, in my judgment a sentence of one month’s imprisonment and the mandatory minimum fine of $30,000 per charge would be appropriate. This is the sentence generally imposed for a first offender, and there were no grounds to depart from it.

33     In respect of the MLA charge where the defendant performed fund transfers, made cash withdrawals and checked bank account balances (10th Charge), the precedents tendered by the prosecution show that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment is usually imposed, with the mandatory fine. I considered this to be an appropriate sentence in the present case. There were no grounds to depart from the normative sentence.

34     For the two CDSA charges, the precedents show that where a sum of $10,000 is involved, the sentence is generally in the region of 5 months’ imprisonment. In the present case, given that there was a TIC charge where a sum of $8,000 was involved, an uplift of the sentence to about 6 months would be appropriate.

35     Considering the number of charges and the totality of the defendant’s involvement in the UML’s business, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that it would be appropriate for three sentences to run consecutively - one sentence from each category of offences. A particularly aggravating factor in the present case was that the defendant worked for the UML for profit, and continued to do so even after his debt with the UML had been cleared.
