### District Judge Jasbendar Kaur:

1       The Accused in this case is Ho Jiada, a 30-year old Singaporean. He was charged under section 65B(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276) for using a mobile communication device while the car that he was driving was in motion on the road. He claimed trial to the charge. The trial was heard over three days and at the end of the trial, I acquitted him as I found that the Prosecution failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. These grounds are issued as an appeal has been filed against the acquittal.

## Prosecution’s Case

2       On 16 September 2018 at about 5.35 pm, as Traffic Police patrol officers Ameer Hamzah Bin S Zailani PW 1 and Muhammad Refdee Hidayat Bin Mohd Noor PW 3 were waiting at the junction of Lorong Marzuki and Sims Avenue East, they spotted the Accused who was travelling along Sims Avenue East in his motor vehicle SLG 519 S using his mobile phone as he drove pass them from their left to right. Upon observing this, both officers turned to Sims Avenue East one after another to chase him. PW 1 caught up with the Accused first and he observed him using his mobile phone for about 5 seconds before signalling him to stop. He had first observed the Accused through his side mirror and when he moved forward to observe through the driver’s door window, he saw the Accused holding his mobile phone in his left hand and using his fingers to scroll through a WhatsApp chat page. Upon observing this, he decided to signal the Accused to stop. By this time, PW 3 had caught up and like PW 1, he had observed the Accused using his mobile phone. PW 1 switched on his warning blinker lights and sounded his horn and he advanced forward so that the Accused could see him. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused only became aware that he was being trailed and observed by the patrol officers when PW 1 had signalled him to stop and when he saw PW 1, he quickly put down his mobile phone.

3       Thereafter, the Accused and the patrol officers stopped along Jalan Senang where the Accused was questioned by the two patrol officers and his mobile phone was examined[^1]. Both officers stated that the Accused initially denied using his handphone when PW 1 questioned him and that he only admitted when PW 3 took over the questioning. He then showed to the officers the relevant WhatsApp chat page that he was “scrolling” as he was driving. A photograph of this WhatsApp page was taken and before the Accused drove off, he was told that summons would be issued against him.

## The Accused’s Account

4       The Accused denied committing the offence and it was his case that the patrol officers could not and did not see any offence being committed. He stated that the officers could not have seen him holding his handphone as he drove pass Lorong Mazuki as he was using his left hand to hold his passenger’s hand who was “disturbing” him at that point in time. He also claimed that he would not have used his mobile phone shortly before he was signalled to stop as he was already aware of police presence.

5       He also disputed the Prosecution’s case that he had made an admission when he was questioned at Jalan Senang and insisted that he had “vehemently denied” and had told the patrol officers that they had made a mistake. He stated that he had consistency maintained his innocence and had challenged the decision to issue the summons against him by going down to the Traffic Police the next day and by lodging two online appeals.

## Finding by the Court

6       It was not in dispute that the Accused was driving along Sims Avenue East towards New Upper Changi Road in his car SLG 519 S with a passenger, Tan Yi Chen on 16 September 2018 around 5.35 pm. What was in dispute was whether the Accused was using his mobile phone as he was driving. In proving their case against the Accused, the Prosecution relied on the observations of the two patrol officers \[the 5-second observation by PW 1 and a shorter one by PW 3 when he caught up with the Accused before PW 1 directed him to stop\] and the admission by the Accused that he had used his mobile phone to access the a WhatsApp chat as he was driving when he was questioned by the patrol officers at Jalan Senang.

7       The Accused, on the other hand, relied on his dashboard camera video recording that came with audio recording to challenge the evidence of the two patrol officers to show that their observations were unbelievable and unreliable. He argued that the recording supported his claim that he was holding his passenger’s hand to stop her from “disturbing” him during the material time and that he was not caught red-handed as he had spotted PW 1 about 10 seconds before he caught up with him.

8       After assessing all the evidence submitted by the parties, I found that the Accused managed to raise a doubt in the Prosecution’s case on a balance of probabilities. This was because I found that there were some inherent discrepancies in the Prosecution’s case and more seriously, material aspects of their case were not supported by objective evidence (i.e.; the video and audio recording from the Accused’s dashboard camera - Exhibit D1). I will now explain the reasons for this finding.

## (I)   PW 3’s evidence was contradicted by the video recording Exhibit D 1 and by PW1’s evidence

9       PW 3 testified that he and PW 1 decided to pursue the Accused when he drove pass Lorong Marzuki as they had observed him holding a mobile phone in his left hand. He stated that he was able to observe this clearly as the Accused was travelling at a slow speed and he was holding the phone at his chest level. It was his evidence that he managed to catch up with the Accused soon after PW 1 and that he was a short distance behind when he had observed the Accused using his mobile phone before PW1 signalled him to stop – “I would say short because I was abreast to the Defendant’s car”.[^2]

10     It was not in dispute that PW 3 had pursued the Accused and that he did manage to catch up with him and PW 3’s incident report in his logsheet that was read out by the Prosecuting Officer during the trial on 23 September 2019 confirmed this.[^3] However, what was not so clear was whether he managed to do this and observe the Accused for about 5 seconds (as recorded in his logsheet) before PW 1 signalled the Accused to stop as his account was not supported by the rear-view video recording in Exhibit D1 and by PW 1’s evidence.

11     PW 1 stated that when he caught up with the Accused’s vehicle, he had observed him for about 5 seconds by first looking at his side mirror and then by looking through the driver’s door window before he moved forward to signal the Accused to stop - “I start to on my police lights and I used my horn to ---to inform you that I am going to stop you.”[^4] What is important is that it was PW1’s evidence that when he signalled the Accused to stop, the Accused had reacted by putting down his handphone. Based on PW 1’s account, one would expect the video recording to show PW 3 riding alongside the Accused’s car directly behind PW 1 for at least a few seconds before PW 1 had signalled the Accused to stop. However, the rear-view recording did not show this. In fact, the recording suggested that PW 3 was quite a distance away when PW 1 switched on his blinker lights and sounded his horn. This meant that if PW 3 only caught up after the signalling, he could not have observed the Accused using his handphone since it is highly implausible that the Accused would have continued to use his mobile phone for about 5 seconds after being told to stop by a police officer. The conundrum was that if I relied on the video recording and accepted PW 3’s evidence, I would have had to reject PW 1’s evidence that the Accused had put down his handphone when he was signalled to stop and I decided that I should instead reject what PW 3 contended.

12     It did not help that PW1 was not able to confirm PW 3’s evidence that he was travelling directly behind him just before the Accused was signalled to stop. When questioned on the whereabouts of his partner, PW 1 first stated that he could not recall where PW 3 was when he was travelling alongside the Accused[^5] before suggesting that he was slightly behind him – “close by by” or “slightly behind me”[^6] without being able to indicate if he was on his left or right side.

13     All in all, I was compelled to doubt the veracity of PW 3’s observation evidence and this was mainly because of the rear-view video recording in Exhibit D1. It should be noted that when queried, the Prosecution chose not to address the discrepancy between the video recording and PW 3’s evidence and were only prepared to say that PW 3 had managed to catch up with the Accused.[^7] Basically, PW 3’s evidence was found to be flawed and this weakened the Prosecution’s case.

## (II)   Prosecution’s case that the Accused was caught unaware and red-handed was not supported by the audio recording in Exhibit D 1

14     PW1’s evidence was that when he was travelling alongside the Accused’s car, less than one car’s length away, he had managed to observe the Accused holding his handphone - “…and I was just beside him, so I was close enough to see exactly what app he was even using.”[^8] He stated that he managed to keep observation for about 5 seconds as the Accused was not aware of his presence. When he had moved forward to signal the Accused to stop, he noticed that he was not looking in his direction as he was “focused on his, um, passenger” and he was using his left thumb to scroll on the screen of the phone. According to PW 1, the Accused only became aware of his presence when he had sounded his horn and the Accused had then “locked eyes” with him before placing his mobile phone down - “Then I saw him like we were actually --- we actually like locked eyes, like we were looking each other while he was still using--- while he’s still holding his handphone at the moment.”

15     The main part of PW1’s evidence was that the Accused was caught unawares and as a result, he was able to observe him using his handphone when he caught up with him. The interesting fact was that the audio recording in Exhibit D1 as shown in the transcript below suggested that the Accused may have become aware of PW 1’s presence about 10 seconds before PW1 signalled him to stop – See the exchange between the Accused and his passenger at 46 and 47 seconds below:

![]([2020] SGMC 0028_Image/[2020] SGMC 0028_image1.png)

16     Apart from being aware of the presence of traffic police, the recording at 52 seconds which captured the Accused asking his passenger if she “Got wear belt?” (4 seconds before the Accused was signalled to stop) showed that the Accused had reacted to the presence of traffic police by checking if his passenger was using her seat-belt - “Because wo---if she was not wearing, then we might get summoned for not wearing seat belt.” Essentially, the recorded exchange called into question PW 1’s account on how he caught the Accused red-handed as it showed that he was not oblivious to the presence of the patrol officers.[^9]

17     When PW 1 was queried on the audio recording, he suggested that the recording may not be inconsistent with his observation evidence as the Accused may not have had any reaction time to put away his mobile phone after being aware of his presence since he caught up with him quite quickly.[^10] I acknowledge that patrol officers are able to move very quickly when in pursuit but the audio recording suggested that the Accused had ample reaction time since PW 1 only managed to signal the Accused to stop some 10 seconds after the Accused noticed his presence (which was at the 46th second). In fact, he even had time to check if his passenger was using her seat-belt which was about 4 seconds before he was signalled to stop.

18     In short, the audio recording from the dashboard camera Exhibit D1 cast a serious doubt over PW1’s observation evidence as it refuted his claim that the Accused was caught unawares.

## (III)   Little or no weight was accorded to the admission by the Accused in light of the gaps in the observation evidence of the patrol officers

19     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had made an admission when he was questioned by the patrol officers, PW 1 and PW 2 at Jalan Senang. PW 1 stated that when they first engaged the Accused, he had denied using his mobile phone and this “was shocking to even me because I clearly caught him, uh, using the handphone, and we even looked at each other. So, I was actually quite baffled, lah, as to ---as to know like ---as to why he actually denied.”[^11] According to PW 1, the Accused admitted after PW 3 stepped in to interview him – “So, somehow, anyhow, the Defendant actually admitted. I certain that the ---the driver---the Defendant actually admitted in using the phone and showed us the WhatsApp chat he was using.”[^12] Once he admitted, PW 1 continued with the questioning and the Accused then opened up the handphone screen and showed the WhatsApp chat page that he was looking through to share some information with his passenger when he was driving[^13]. Since this confirmed what the officers had observed earlier, PW 1 took a photograph of the chat page which was admitted as Exhibit P3.

20     The Accused denied making any admission and insisted that he had “vehemently” denied using his mobile phone when he was questioned by the patrol officers. According to him, when PW 3 took over the questioning from PW 1 after about 5 to 10 minutes, he had instructed him to unlock his handphone’s screen which showed a WhatsApp window with a chat with “TTChen” that had taken place about 14 days prior to 16 September 2018. He stated that when the officers could not find any incriminating information on the handphone, they started asking him “loaded” questions. He suggested that the alleged admission that was recorded in PW 1’s logsheet was probably a construct based on his responses to the “loaded” questions about the WhatsApp chat page as he did not admit that he was using his mobile phone when he was driving.

21     As it can be seen from above, there was clearly a dispute as to whether the Accused had made an admission. The Prosecution urged the Court to give full weight to the admission for the following reasons:

> (a)     The two officers had given credible evidence on how the Accused was questioned and why they were able to recall the details. PW 1 stated that he was able to clearly remember what happened as the Accused was the only offender who had “actually denied using the phone even after I caught him red-handed” and also because he had been sharing this experience with his colleagues because of the unique facts – “…But for this case, he straight up deny using the phone which was ---where I ---which I ---as I said just now, I was like a bit baffling, like, I just caught you holding to the phone and using it, and we looked at each other in the eyes, so how can you still deny using? So, the reason why I remember this because I actually use this experience to share with my colleagues and also my juniors say that, know, that’s because, uh, you saw them red-handed, they will simply just, uh, let you summon them…So, I use my experience to share with other people and this is what I can still remember, because this is a unique experience for me.”[^14]

> (b)     There was a contemporaneous record of this admission in PW1’s logsheet Exhibit P2 and it stated that the Accused “was denial at first. Upon further interviewing, a/m admitted to using his phone while driving. A/m was using his phone application whatsapp to search for personal stuff by contact ‘TTChen’”;

> (c)     The fact that the Accused’s mobile phone was not seized confirmed the officers’ evidence that an admission was made because it would have been seized if the Accused had not admitted; and

> (d)     The fact that the accused was informed that summons would be issued against him also confirmed that he had made an admission - “Uh, eventually, he ---he admitted, lah. He admitted that he used the phone, so that’s where we proceeded to ---we proceeded to summon him for it.”[^15]

22     Apart from the above, I also noted that the Accused’s evidence in relation to the questioning process also suggested that he may have made an admission. This could be inferred from his answer that PW 3 “did lead me to confess” when he was asked to explain if he was induced by the officers to make an admission[^16] –

> A:    My --- my understanding of the word “induced” is that the police lead me to confess, but if you are asking did he like take out a weapon and say, “if you don’t confess I’ll hit you, then no, nothing of that sort.

> Q:    Okay.

> A:    But he did lead me to confess. That is my understanding of the word, with ---

> Q:    Can you repeat the last sentence you said?

> A:    He did lead me to confess. That is my understanding of the word “induced”.

23     Further, the fact that the Accused expended considerable effort to cast aspersions on the questioning process and on the conduct of the officers to show that they may have tried to “twist my account” by “feeding me with little lies”[^17], suggested that the “loaded” questions may have caused him to say something incriminating when he did not intend to.

24     On the other hand, there was also evidence to support the Accused’s evidence that he may not have made an admission. First, PW 3 did not mention the admission in the incident report in his logsheet even though the admission was allegedly made after he took over the questioning. Second, there was evidence to suggest that the officers needed incriminating evidence; either on the handphone or in the form of an admission before issuing the summons and since they could not find any incriminating evidence after checking the handphone, they may have misinterpreted some of his answers in their zest to obtain an admission. Third and most importantly, if the audio recording in Exhibit D1 is to be believed and the Accused was holding his passenger’s hand and not his handphone when he was driving, it was highly unlikely that he would have made the admission.

25     With two possible findings, I decided that it would not be appropriate to determine the more plausible version. As the burden of proof lies with the Prosecution and there was a doubt as to whether the admission was made, it was clear that this issue had to be resolved in favour of the Accused by applying the principle as enunciated in **PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik** <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> at paragraph 34:

> Unlike civil cases, where the court may choose between two competing stories and accept the one on a balance of probabilities, that is to say, accepting that version because it seemed more plausible than the other, in a criminal case, there is an important norm to be taken into account at all times - that _where there is a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused_.

26     It is worth noting that even if I had found that the Accused had indeed made the admission that was recorded in PW1’s logsheet Exhibit P2, I would have given it little weight and would not have relied on it having assessed the admission together with all the other evidence in this case. This is because the discrepancies that weakened the observation evidence of the two patrol officers would also have materially affected the probative value of this admission.

## (IV)   There was evidence to suggest that the Accused’s defence was not fabricated and/or inherently incredible

27     The Prosecution urged the Court to reject the Accused’s defence that he was holding his passenger’s hand when he was driving along Sims Avenue East and argued it was “just purely an afterthought”[^18] by highlighting (i) that the video recording Exhibit D1 did not show or suggest that the Accused was not using his handphone[^19] and (ii) the Accused had not mentioned his defence when he was questioned at Jalan Senang and in his two appeals to the Traffic Police

28     The Accused admitted that he had not mentioned in his appeals that he was holding his ex-girlfriend’s hand when he was driving[^20] but insisted that he had informed the patrol officers “many times” that he was holding his passenger’s hand when he was questioned at Jalan Senang. He also argued that Exhibit D1 “supplemented” his defence as the audio recording of the conversation between him and his ex-girlfriend showed that the physical interaction between them had started before he drove pass Lorong Mazuki and it only ceased when he noticed the presence of a police officer (at the 46th second of the recording)[^21].

29     I agreed with the Prosecution that care must be taken to assess the Accused’s defence since he had failed to specifically mention it when he made his appeals and there was also a possibility that he may have failed to raise it when he was questioned at Jalan Senang. While it was a fact that the Accused did not mention that he was holding his passenger’s hand in his two appeals, I decided that when assessing the Accused’s defence it was necessary to consider his entire conduct subsequent to 16 September 2018 and not just what he may have said when he was questioned and what he had mentioned in his appeals. Having done so, I decided that his defence could not be considered as an afterthought when the evidence clearly showed that he had been challenging the police’s decision to issue the summons against him since 17 September 2018 on the ground that the officers had made a mistake and he had done this by relying on his dashboard camera recording. In arriving at this finding, I took into account the following:

> (a)     The Accused had verified the facts immediately upon returning home by reviewing his dashboard camera footage and when it became clear to him that the officers could not have seen him using his handphone, he had gone down to the Traffic Police the next day to lodge an appeal;

> (b)     There was evidence to suggest that when the Accused visited the Traffic Police on 17 September 2018, he had brought a copy of the video footage to show to the duty officer. This can be inferred from PW 4’s answer when he was asked by the Accused to reiterate what he had mentioned in his appeals - “In the appeal you ---yah, I know that you, uh say---I can recall that you were mentioned inside your appeal stating that you came to traffic police with the video evidence that you have. I can---I recall it, you mentioned one of your appeal.”[^22];

> (c)     Even though the Accused did not specifically mention that he was holding his passenger’s hand in his two appeals, he had stated that his video footage would show that the officers could not have seen him using the handphone. IO Sufian Sudin PW 4 confirmed this inference when he stated that the Accused’s appeals “actually sparks me to get it (the video recording) from you.”[^23]; and

> (d)     The Accused was not responsible for the delay in the submission of the video evidence since he had revealed that he was relying on the recording in his appeals that were forwarded on 26 September and 5 October 2018 and it was the police who only decided to view it in March 2019 after PW 4 took over as the Investigating Officer.[^24]

30     I will now deal with the issue of whether the audio recording in fact “supplemented” or “reinforced” the Accused defence. The relevant audio recording of the interaction between the Accused and his passenger who his girlfriend then with the corresponding time-stamp was transcribed by the Accused for the trial. The Prosecution had initially objected to the admission of the transcript on the ground that it was not prepared by an independent third party. I had ruled that it was not necessary for the Accused to engage the services of a third party to transcribe the audio recording when the Prosecution could verify the accuracy by listening to the recording without any special equipment. The transcript that was prepared by the Accused was admitted in evidence, collectively with Exhibit D1. When the Prosecution indicated that they intended to get the audio recording “officially transcribed”, they were directed to alert the Court should they discover any inaccuracies. Given that the Prosecution did not raise this as an issue in their closing submissions, I accepted Exhibit D1 as a reliable record of the exchange between the Accused and his passenger.[^25]

31     I agreed with the Prosecution that the audio recording did not conclusively show that the Accused was holding his passenger’s hand but having heard the audio recording with reference to the timings mentioned in the transcript, I found that there was evidence to suggest that both the Accused and his passenger were interacting physically with each other during the relevant period for at least 41 seconds. The exchange suggested that they were engaged in physical play when the patrol officers first spotted the Accused’s car at Lorong Marzuki and it only ceased when the Accused became aware of PW 1’s presence, some 10 seconds before he was signalled to stop – see the transcript Exhibit D1 below from 0 to 46 seconds:

![]([2020] SGMC 0028_Image/[2020] SGMC 0028_image2.png)

32     In particular, the exchange at 23 seconds where his ex-girlfriend, referred to as “Tan” in the transcript, had asked him to “take off” his hand just as they drove pass Lorong Marzuki and at 41 seconds when she stated in Mandarin that he was very good at squeezing lend credence to his claim that he could not have held his handphone in his left hand when he was using it to engage in physical play with his then girlfriend.

33     When assessing the credibility of the Accused’s defence, I noted that the Accused failed to mention his then girlfriend, Tan Yi Chen in his appeals and he also chose not to call her as his witness. He stated that he did not mention her in his appeals as he did not want to embarrass her - “the contents (in the video recording) could be embarrassing for her.”[^26] They have since parted ways and according to him, they are no longer on talking terms but his reason for not calling her to testify was the same – he did not want to embarrass her. The Prosecution argued that this was a serious omission and suggested that the Court should draw an adverse inference against the Accused under section 116(g) of the Evidence Act as he failed to call a witness that could have corroborated his evidence.

34     I decided that it was not appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the Accused for two main reasons. First, there was no evidence to suggest that the Accused decided not to call Tan Yi Chen as a witness because he was concerned that she would not support his version since they are no longer on good terms as he did not get her involved even when they were together. Second, there was some evidence that Tan Yi Chen had given a statement to the Traffic Police[^27] and if this was correct, then the Prosecution could have called her as a rebuttal witness to contradict the Accused’s defence if she had given a statement that was contrary to the Accused’s defence. Since this was not done, I decided that the evidential effect of her absence was neutral to both parties.

35     Hence, I rejected the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s defence was an afterthought and unbelievable and instead found that the defence was sufficiently credible.

## Conclusion

36     As with most road traffic cases, the strength of the Prosecution’s case was very much dependent on the strength of the evidence of the two reporting officers. In this case, I found that it could not fairly be said that the evidence of two officers was convincing in all material aspects. This was because the video and audio recording Exhibit D1 raised serious doubts in relation to their observation evidence and suggested that the Accused’s defence was not inherently incredible. When confronted with the recording Exhibit D1, PW 1 had maintained his evidence and stated that he believed what he had seen with his own eyes more than what the recording seemed to suggest because “…even if I’m wrong, this video also cannot show that you are right…”[^28] It is true that the recording did not show that the Accused was holding his passenger’s hand but the Accused did not have to show this in order for him to raise a doubt on the balance of probabilities. The Accused only had to show that there was a reasonable possibility that he may have been touching his passenger with his left hand as he was driving and in my view, he had managed to do this with the audio recording. Thus, with two reasonable versions, I was compelled to find that the Accused managed to establish reasonable doubt and decide in his favour as per the guidance in **Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP** <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at paragraph 90:

> As explained above, it is a cornerstone of our criminal jurisprudence that in a situation where the evidence may lead to two equally reasonable results, that suffices to establish reasonable doubt.

37     For the reasons stated above, I found that the Prosecution were not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was using a mobile phone when he was driving and accordingly, I acquitted the Accused on the charge that was the subject matter of Report No. 186168963311.
