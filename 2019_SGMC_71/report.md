19 November 2019

### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 35 year-old male Singaporean. He is employed as a Key Account Specialist. He is married with a 9-year old son.

2       The accused had claimed trial to a charge of committing a rash act endangering the personal safety of others by riding an E-scooter along a pedestrian passageway just outside the Chinatown MRT station and having collided into a Taiwanese tourist Madam Liang. At the conclusion of the trial, he had been found guilty and was convicted of this Charge on 24 July 2019. He was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

3       The accused has appealed against both his conviction and sentence. He is presently on bail pending appeal, with a stay on the execution of the sentence of imprisonment.

## The Charge

4       The accused was tried on the single charge as set out below -

> _MAC-902522-2018_

> _You_,

> _are charged that you, on the 26th day of January 2018, at about 3.49pm, at Apt Blk 91 Upper Cross Street Chinatown MRT station, Exit E, Singapore, did commit a rash act endangering the personal safety of others, to wit, by riding an electric scooter along the pedestrian passageway at a speed of approximately 13 – 15kmh despite the fact that the ground was wet and when there was a steady flow of human traffic in that area, which caused the wheel of the said electric scooter to collide into one Liang Yuan-Chia’s heel, as a result of which she fell and suffered tenderness over her buttocks bilaterally and an occipital hematoma, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 337(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed._

## The Undisputed Facts

5       The Prosecution and the Defence had agreed to the following Statement of Agreed Facts (the “SOAF”) for the purpose of the trial:

**_AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS_**

**_PP v TOH ZHIWEI_**

> **_Parties_**

> _1_      _The accused is Toh Zhiwei, male/ 35 years old (DOB: 19 September 1983), holder of NRIC: XXX._

> _2_      _The victim is Liang Yuan-Chia, female / 45 years old (DOB: 4 August 1973). She is a tourist from Taiwan who had come to Singapore on a holiday with her husband and daughter._

> **_First Information Report_**

> _3_      _On 26 January 2018, at about 3.50pm, the Police received information from SCDF with the message, “E-scooter knocked onto someone”. The incident location was given as Block 91 Upper Cross Street Chinatown MRT Station Exit E, Singapore._

> **_Facts relating to the charge_**

> _4_      _Investigations revealed that on 26 January 2018, at about 3.48pm, the victim and her husband and daughter had exited from Exit E of Chinatown MRT Station (“the Exit”).

At that time, it was raining and the ground was wet. There was a steady flow of pedestrians in the area near the exit._

> _5_      _At about 3.49pm, the victim turned towards her right and continued to walk forward in a slow pace, while still looking at her handphone. At that same time, the accused was riding his electric scooter along the pedestrian passageway in the area around Exit E, and was heading in the same direction as the victim from behind._

> _6_      _The wheel of the accused’s e-scooter collided into the right heel of the victim. The victim fell to the ground and hit the back of her head on the ground as a result of the collision. After the collision, the accused offered assistance to her and also called for an ambulance. The victim was subsequently conveyed to the Singapore General Hospital where she received medical attention.

## The Offence

7       The offence of causing hurt by a rash act endangering the personal safety of others under s. 337 (a) of the Penal Code is as follows –

> “337. Whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished —

>> (a)    in the case of a _rash_ act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both; or ……….

## The Prosecution Case

#### Witnesses for the Prosecution

8       The Prosecution adduced evidence from 4 witnesses. A summary of the evidence of the witnesses is as follows.

#### (i)   PW1 SGT Valerie Phua

9       PW1 SGT Phua’s evidence was largely formal as she was the IO for the case. She testified that on the day of the incident, the SCDF had received a call which was routed back to the Police.[^7] The call was made by the accused. PW1 Phua went down to the scene at about 6.00pm where she secured the CCTV footage. She also went to SGH where she had recorded a statement from the victim. The witness also testified that at that point of time, “_the weather condition is still drizzling and the floor---floor condition was wet.”[^8]_

10     The CCTV footage of the incident was played in court and SGT Phua was asked to describe scene at the time stamp 15:49:28 and 15:49:37, a period of about only 10 seconds. She testified that -

> _“ You see the---well, the accused was still behind riding on his e-scooter. The victim turn on---turned to her right---right side which back facing the accused. So, the accused was still riding on the e-scooter and could not brake in time and he jumped off from the e-scooter itself. Which the front wheel collided onto the victim .[^9]_

11     PW1 also gave evidence that she had asked the victim whether she would return to Singapore to testify in court but the victim had declined.[^10]

12     During cross-examination, PW1 disagreed when put by Counsel that the accused had slowed down when he was approaching the victim just before the collision.[^11]

13     During re-examination, APP Lim had asked PW1 why she had given instructions to charge the accused under s. 337 (a) of the Penal Code. PW1 replied that she did do because –

> “_Under the basis that__the accused did not dismount knowing that the floor is wet and due to the weather itself which is still drizzling. He did not dismount his scooter and instead he still proceed his way into the pedestrian walkway which cause a rash act to the other pedestrian itself.”__[^12]_

#### (ii)   PW2 Muhammad Shahed

14     PW2 SSGT Muhammad Shahed gave evidence that he was one of 2 responding Police Officers to the scene of the incident on 26 January 2018. He testified that the weather conditions that day was light drizzling and the road was wet.[^13] PW2 also testified that when he arrived at the scene, he met the accused who was holding on to his E-scooter. He then asked him what had happened. According to PW2, the accused was cooperative and forthcoming. The accused told PW2 that it was an accident and that he was riding on his E-scooter when he claimed that this lady suddenly turned around. The accused also told PW2 that he wasn’t able to brake on time and that’s where he actually hit onto her. The accused also told PW2 that he was the one who had called for an Ambulance. PW2 also testified that the accused spoke to him in English and there was no language barrier.[^14]

#### (iii)   PW3 Abdul Malik

15     PW3 SGT Abdul Malik testified he had attended to the scene of the incident together with his partner PW2. Upon arrival at the scene, he noticed the accused present together with the victim’s husband. Together with his partner PW2, they managed to speak with the victim’s husband through the help of Ms. Kng Lay Hen (PW4). PW3 testified that the accused told PW2 and himself that while he was riding down the wet pavement, the victim walked into his path, and that she wasn’t facing him and so, he couldn’t brake in time and he skidded and hit into her from the back. [^15] He also testified that he had observed PW2 SGT Muhammad Shahed talking with the accused and there was no language barrier as the accused spoke in fluent English.

#### (iv)   PW4 Kng Lay Wen

16     Ms Kng testified that she was present on the day of the incident. She had been travelling by bus from Bedok and had just alighted at Chinatown Point. She testified that it was drizzling at that time. She had walked inside Chinatown Point and then she had heard a “bong”---a “bang” sound and it was just next to her. She then tried to see what happened. She testified that she saw a scooter had knocked onto someone. She then told the rider of the scooter not to run away because he had collided into someone. Then, the rider alighted from the scooter. At that time there wasn’t many people around although subsequently, more and more people crowd around the area. PW4 then shouted to the rider that someone had already made a phone call. She also told the rider to call for the ambulance and the police. The accused then made the calls. She testified that she saw the victim lying on the ground unconscious. She then shouted to the rider to quickly call for the ambulance and also for the police. PW4 then asked the husband of the victim why the wife was unconscious. She then proceeded to give some water to the lady who was unconscious. The victim then began to regain her consciousness. The victim told PW4 that she had hurt her head and also her thigh area. At that time, the ambulance arrived and conveyed the victim to the hospital.[^16]

#### Statement of victim recorded in P11

17     The victim, Madam Liang Yuan-Chia had been conveyed by ambulance after the collision to Singapore General hospital for treatment. Madam Liang had indicated to PW1 SGT Valerie Phua that she was not willing to return to Singapore from Taiwan to testify in court. PW1 had also recorded a statement from Madam Liang at SGH on the details of the incident. The Prosecution applied to admit the statement into evidence. Counsel did not object to its admissibility. The statement P11 was marked and admitted into evidence. Madam Liang gave brief details of the incident in P11. All she recalls is that she was hit by “something” on her right leg. She then fell to the floor and landed on her buttock. Subsequently her head fell back to the ground. She stated that all other information pertaining to the collision was given to her by her husband on the way to SGH.

## Close of Prosecution Case

18     At the close of the prosecution case, I called upon the accused to enter his defence as I was satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the accused, which if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The accused elected to give evidence in his defence.

## Witnesses for the Defence

19     The accused was the only witness for the defence.

20     The accused testified that he was riding his E-scooter towards Clarke Quay for an appointment. At the passageway outside Exit E of Chinatown MRT station, he asserted that he had kept a look out for other pedestrians. He stated that also that he had slowed down on his E-scooter before the accident because he saw a few people in front of him.

21     He saw the victim looking at her hand phone and he stated that he tried to avoid her but she walked into his path. He asserted that he had dismounted and moved to one side, but the victim continued walking into his path and he collided into her because he was unable to avoid her in time. He then called the ambulance and offered assistance to the victim and her husband thereafter.

## Submissions of the Prosecution

22     The Prosecution had submitted that given the circumstances on that day of the wet floor and the amount of human traffic near the MRT exit, the accused ought to have dismounted and pushed his E-scooter. He did not do so. Instead, he decided to ride the E-scooter even though he was fully aware of the risk of collision. It was submitted that the accused had even increased his speed just before the collision even though there was a blind spot. It was the Prosecution case that this had resulted in the accused being unable to stop the e-scooter when he saw the victim. The accused therefore jumped off and tried to swerve the e-scooter in his bid to avoid the victim but he was unable to do so in time. The E-scooter then collided into the right heel of the victim and she fell to the ground and hit the back of her head. It was the Prosecution case that this sequence of events was captured entirely on the CCTV footages in P5. [^17]

## Submissions by the Defence

23     Based on the accused’s EIC and as gleaned from the closing submissions of Counsel, the accused’s defence can be summarized as follows.

24     The accused had testified that before the collision, he had slowed down on his E-scooter as he had seen a few people in front of him. He also saw the victim looking at her hand phone. He stated that he tried to avoid her but she had walked into his path. He asserted that he had dismounted and moved to one side, but the victim continued walking into his path and he collided into her because he was unable to avoid her in time.

25     I should also mention at this juncture that Defence Counsel had raised in his written submissions matters which were strictly not relevant to the charge his client was facing. Counsel had submitted for example that the Prosecution had ‘_meddled into something that it was not privy to_’ because the right to pursue the matter lay on the victim and not the Prosecution.[^18] It was further submitted by Counsel that _‘Given her unwillingness to pursue the matter, no charge should have been brought upon by the Prosecution given that there was no complainant to begin with._[^19] Counsel even went further to suggest that not only did the Prosecution press charges in the absence of the complainant, the Prosecution was ‘_actively seeking conviction at all costs at the expense of taxpayers’ money’_.[^20]

26     Not surprisingly, the Prosecution took strong objection to Counsel’s assertions. It was submitted that “_The Defence’s allegation against the Prosecution is completely baseless and unwarranted and must be rejected in full._”_[^21]_

27     As the Taiwanese lady victim had already left Singapore, she was not available as a complainant witness for the Prosecution. In this regard, I note that Counsel had also asserted in the same defence closing submissions that PW1 had engaged in ‘continuous harassment’ of the Taiwanese victim to get her to return to Singapore to testify.[^22]

28     As both these allegations above by Counsel were bare assertions, unsubstantiated and devoid of merit, I had no difficulty in totally rejecting Counsel’s allegations.

## Applicable legal principles

29     The accused was charged with an offence of causing hurt by committing a rash act endangering the personal safety of others under s. 337 (a) of the Penal Code. It was necessary for the court therefore to consider the meaning of a _rash_ act.

30     The case of _PP v Hue An Li <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span>_ is instructive on this issue. This was a decision of the High Court of Three Judges. In that case Menon CJ had sated at paragraph 65 that –

> “65.  T_he first proposition attempts to draw a line between rashness and negligence._ **_We have already stated that advertence to the potential risks that might arise from one’s conduct will in general be the key ingredient for a finding of rashness._** _Ng Jui Chuan added the gloss (at \[7\]) that such advertence must extend to an appreciation that the risk would “in all likelihood” materialise. With respect, we disagree with this._ **_In our judgment, advertence to a real (as opposed to a merely theoretical or fanciful) risk of adverse consequences arising from one’s conduct is sufficient for rashness to be made out._** _Indeed, it seems to us that if a person is aware that an adverse outcome would in all likelihood occur as a result of his conduct, such conduct might even be viewed as being intentional in nature._

> (Emphasis added)

31     As for the risks posed to pedestrians by cyclists, the case of _PP v Lim Choon Teck <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 265</span>_ has relevance to the facts of the present case. The respondent pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment for one charge under s 336(_a_) of the Penal Code for committing a _rash act_ that endangered the personal safety of others. The respondent had been cycling on his non-motorised bicycle by riding on the pavement near the bus stop at an unsafe speed, when his view of pedestrians approaching the bus stop from the walkway connecting the bus stop and the adjacent Block 354 was obscured, resulting in a collision with the victim. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to three weeks ‘imprisonment. Chan Seng Onn J had decided as follows –

> “**_The threat to the safety of pedestrians imposed by cyclists cycling on pavements is a real one_** _because, as highlighted by the Prosecution_, **_personal mobility devices such as bicycles can travel at a speed that is five times faster than the typical person walking on a pavement._** _When travelling at such speeds, the cyclist may lose control of the bicycle thereby causing danger to pedestrians._ **_As pedestrians often do not walk predictably in a straight line or at a constant speed along a pavement, cyclists may not be able to avoid colliding into pedestrians who move suddenly and unexpectedly by making a left, right or “U” turn or pedestrians who suddenly stop moving_**_._ **_Unless a cyclist slows down very considerably as he approaches pedestrians, it may be difficult to avoid a collision especially when a number of pedestrians are present at the same time walking along a narrow pavement in directions which are largely unpredictable._** _Furthermore, pedestrians may not look left and right before entering or crossing a pavement as they normally do when they step on to or cross a road. Pedestrians may step on to a pavement from a blind spot without watching out for on-coming cyclists who are not supposed to be cycling on pavements. These factors significantly increase the risk of pedestrians being injured by cyclists who are riding their bicycles unlawfully on pavements. At bus stop shelters erected along pavements, bus commuters congregate to wait for buses. When buses arrive, bus commuters will be busy alighting and disembarking from the buses._ _It is therefore reckless for a cyclist to simply cycle through bus stop shelters thinking and hoping that he will be able to avoid colliding into bus commuters.__Accordingly, general deterrence should feature strongly in sentences meted out so as to reduce “rash cycling” on pavements.  _

> (Emphasis added)

## Evaluation of evidence

### (i)   Issue before the court – did the accused act rashly?

32     Given the nature of the charge, the key issue before the court was whether the accused had committed a rash act endangering the personal safety of others by riding his E-scooter outside Chinatown MRT station on the incident day although at that particular time the ground was wet, there was a steady flow of human traffic and he was travelling at a speed of 13 – 15 kmh? This is a fact-sensitive enquiry and will be further examined below.

A.      _The weather conditions on the day_

33     As stated at paragraph 6 above, it was undisputed and set out in the ASOF that the ground at the Chinatown MRT incident location was _wet_, as it had been raining earlier. It was also agreed among parties that there was a steady flow of pedestrians at the location. Further, it was also clear from the CCTV footage that it was still drizzling at the time of the incident.

B.      _The actions of the accused_

#### (i)   Accused was aware of unpredictable path of a pedestrian

34     The Prosecution had submitted that the accused was aware of and had recognized the unpredictable nature of the travel path of a pedestrian. It was also submitted that the accused was also aware of the increased risk of collision given that he was travelling at a speed, which was much faster than the other walking pedestrians.

35     In this regard, I note the following answers in cross-examination given by the accused –

> _“Now your---you claim to be travelling between---well, either 13---10 to 13 or 13 to 15 kilometres per hour. So you would agree with me that you were much faster than the pedestrians on the pavement, correct?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _Will you also agree with me that_ _if a person is walking, this person can just make a left turn or right turn suddenly or just stop?_

> _A_ **_Agree_**.[^23]

36     As such, the answers given above by the accused more than amply support the submission made by the Prosecution. I therefore agreed with the submission of the Prosecution above that the accused was alive to the unpredictable nature of the manner and path of travel of a pedestrian and that this could therefore result in a collision. In similar vein, I also agreed with the Prosecution submission that the accused was equally alive to the realization that he was travelling at a speed relatively faster to that of the walking pedestrians.

#### (ii)   Accused was aware of longer time needed to stop

37     It was further submitted by the Prosecution that the accused was aware of the longer time needed for him to stop his e-scooter. I agreed with the Prosecution. I also set out below the answers of the accused during cross-examination on this point -

> “Q. _You would also agree with me, it would be more difficult for you to avoid colliding into a pedestrian when you are on an e-scooter, because you now need more time to bring the e-scooter to a complete stop?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ **_The faster you are travelling, the longer it would take for you to come to a complete stop. You agree?_**

> A **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _So you knew that there was a possibility of you colliding into the pedestrians when you rode your e-scooter on the pavement where there were other pedestrians, correct?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ **_So I take it you are aware of this risk?_**

> A **_Yes.[^24]_**

38     In fact, the entire context of the answers above given by the accused also demonstrably indicates _his awareness of the increased risk of a collision_. I find that the accused was undoubtedly alive to the risk of a collision. I also find that the accused was equally advertent to and prepared to take this risk of a collision.

#### (iii)   CCTV footage and increased speed of the accused just before the collision

39     The CCTV footage was played in court for parties to examine the events just prior to the collision between the accused’s e-scooter and the victim. I have carefully scrutinized the CCTV footage.

40     The CCTV footage is revealing. The CCTV footage CNT 366 _(15:49:26 to 15:49:28)_ demonstrates that the accused had slowed down when he saw 2 pedestrians walking from his right to left up the stairs leading to the MRT station. The accused passed the 2 pedestrians without incident. After the accused had passed the 2 pedestrians, it can be seen that he had accelerated and picked up and increased his speed. This can be seen in the same CCTV footage from time stamp 15:49:29 to 15:49:32. From the footage, _the accused is seen to have collided into the victim at time stamp 15:49:32._

41     The accused was cross-examined on the images as seen in this CCTV footage segment. I find that the answers of the accused were significant in ascertaining his appreciation of the risks he was prepared to take and accept.

> _“Q_ _And I believe this is the 3rd pillar. So you see the 3 pillars in this video?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _From where you are coming, you would not be able to see if anyone was behind those pillars, correct?_

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _So these were blind spots, correct?_

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _It was possible that there could be somebody standing behind those pillars. Will you agree with me?_

> _A_ **_Agree_** _.”_ [^25]

> (Emphasis added)

42     In this regard, the accused’s answers above indicated that he was aware of the blind spots in front of him a mere six or so seconds before he collided into the victim.

43     In the continued exchange below, the accused went on further to agree that he could not have avoided a collision if a person standing in front of the KFC pillar were to suddenly walk into his path. The accused had stated as follows[^26] -

> _“Q_ **_I’m at 15:49:30._**

> _Looking at this screenshot, you will agree with me,_ _somebody who’s standing in front of the pillar bearing the KFC advertisement, if that person suddenly walks into your path, there was no way you could have avoided him?_

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _And you would also agree with me---earlier you’ve also agreed with me that at this point in time, the footage shows that you not only failed to slow down, but you picked up speed, even though there was a blind spot there._

> _A_ _After I slow down if I did not increase a bit of my speed, I would not be able to balance my e-scooter. Because if I did not increase my speed, definitely I would fall._

> _Q_ _My question is_ _you were aware of the blind spot, but you increased your speed. You agree?_

> _A_ **_I did add a little bit of speed_** _._

> _Q_ _At the same time_ _you were also aware of the blind spot, correct?_

> _A_ **_Yes.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

44     The context of the exchange above vividly and clearly indicates that the accused was alive to and advertent to the blind spot ahead of him as he approached the pillar bearing the KFC advertisement. Moreover, the accused had also admitted that he would have been _unable to avoid_ any pedestrian who came out from behind this pillar unexpectedly. This is significant in assessing the mental state and culpability of the accused.

C.      _Evidence of the Accused_

45     What was the defence of the accused? The accused in essence, denied that he had acted rashly when he had collided into the victim. He did not dispute the collision itself. He maintained however that his actions prior to colliding into the victim were not rash.

46     Let me now consider in detail the actions of the accused just prior to the collision with the Taiwanese lady victim.

#### (a)   Actions of the accused

#### (i)   Accused did not dismount but had skidded and jumped off his e-scooter

47     The accused was adamant that the collision had occurred only because his E-scooter had skidded when he had tried to avoid the victim.

48     The accused’s evidence on this aspect of his e-scooter having skidded bears some careful scrutiny. To be fair to the accused, the Prosecution had played the CCTV footage at the key time stamp from 15:49:28 to **15:49:32** (_this was the point of collision_). His testimony after watching the CCTV footage was as follows –

>   
| 

“_Q_

 | 

_Do you agree with me,_ _you would require a longer braking distance for the e-scooter to come to a complete stop when the ground is wet?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

**_I agree._**

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_You would agree with me that_ _there was a higher chance of you skidding when the ground is wet, as compared to when the ground is dry?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

**_Agree._**

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_You also will agree with me that_ _skidding would occur more frequently when the ground is slippery?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

**_Yes._**

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Mr. Toh, you don’t dispute you came from behind the victim, correct?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Yes, I saw the back of the victim._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_So the victim did not see you at all, correct?_

 |
| 

_A_

49     The answers given above by the accused again demonstrates a high appreciation and awareness of the risks associated in riding on a slippery surface, especially the longer braking time needed and the higher chances of skidding on a wet and slippery surface as opposed to a dry surface. It is also pertinent that the accused’s appreciation of the risks based on the CCTV footage is an indication of his awareness of the risks involved merely seconds before the collision occurred. I find that in these circumstances, the accused should have engaged in at least 2 preventative acts of safety measures –

> (i)     he should have slowed down his speed; or

> (ii)     he should have dismounted from his E-scooter.

50     Despite being advertent to the risks involved, the accused did not carry out either of these 2 preventative actions which would have prevented a collision.

51     The awareness of the accused to the risks he was taking by his own actions and the ground conditions and also the pedestrian traffic is again brought into sharp focus by the next exchange between the accused and the DPP. In this exchange, the accused states –

> _“Q_ _You would also agree with me, it would be more difficult for you to avoid colliding into a pedestrian when you are on an e-scooter, because you now need more time to bring the e-scooter to a complete stop?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _The faster you are travelling, the longer it would take for you to come to a complete stop. You agree?_

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _So you knew that there was a possibility of you colliding into the pedestrians when you rode your e-scooter on the pavement where there were other pedestrians, correct?_

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ **_So I take it you are aware of this risk?_**

> A **_Yes.”[^28]_**

> (Emphasis added)

52     This exchange above has now gone even further as regards the state of risk awareness of the accused. The accused now states that he was completely aware of the risk of a _collision_ when he rode his E-scooter at a speed faster than the walking speed of the other pedestrians on the pavement. This is significant.

53     By way of summary, the CCTV footage reveals the following key moments leading up to the point of collision with the Taiwanese lady victim –

#### (b)   Other aspects of the accused’s evidence

54     I did not find the accused to be consistent in his evidence. He had shifted his position on a few occasions. At other times I also found him to be an evasive witness. I will consider below the following areas which more than amply demonstrate that the accused was not a credible witness.

#### (i)   Accused’s explanation for his inability to avoid colliding with the victim

55     The fact of the accused having collided into the victim was undisputed. As such, the accused’s explanation for not being able to avoid colliding into the victim bears some careful scrutiny.

56     During cross-examination on this issue, the accused gave the following explanation –

> “_Q_ _Alright. You would agree with me the frames show that your e-scooter was still in motion when your feet was on the ground?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _You did not wait for the e-scooter to come to a complete stop before you came down._

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _You said earlier you would usually only get off the e-scooter after it comes to a complete stop._ _Why did you not do so in this case?_

> A **_If I waited for the e-scooter to stop completely before I dismount, I would have knocked into her body, rather than her leg._**

> Q _So_ _you could not stop the e-scooter in time, when you saw the lady, correct_?

> _A_ **_According to my feeling, yes._** _[^29]_

> (Emphasis added)

57     I observe here that the accused has admitted candidly that when he saw the lady, he realized that he could _not_ stop his E-scooter in time. His preceding answer also makes clear that the safer course of waiting for the E-scooter to stop completely and then to dismount, was no longer an option as he would otherwise have collided into her body instead of hitting her leg.

58     In further cross-examination, the accused again states candidly that he had tried to swerve away from the victim but was unable to do so in time. He states –

> _“Q_ _So the reason why_ _you had to take these 4 steps in quick succession was because of your momentum of getting off the e-scooter when it was still in motion._

> _A_ **_Half---part of this is this reason_** _, but the other part is that I wanted to move the e-scooter away. Sorry, push the e-scooter away, rather._

> _Q_ _But_ _you didn’t manage to push it away, correct?_

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _So at this point in time_ _you did not anticipate yourself having to come down from the e-scooter when it was still in motion._

> _A_ _Your Honour_, **_if I had wanted to wait for the e-scooter to stop completely, I would have collided into the body of the victim_**_. So the reason of me doing this is that I wanted to slow down, so that I can slowly push the e-scooter away._

> _Q_ _So, am I right to say, the reason you are unable to avoid the victim in time was_ _because you realised too late when she started walking to her right?_

> _A_ **_You can say so_** _._ **_However, I saw her walking towards my direction and if I did not avoid her, she will still be going towards the same direction.”[^30]_**

> (Emphasis added)

59     It is important to note that the above answers given by the accused were after the accused had been shown the CCTV footage at the key moments between 15:49:28 and 15:49:32 – a mere 4 seconds before the collision. In particular, in his answer above the accused had stated that he had seen the victim walking in the same direction as he was travelling. Further, he also stated that “_if I did not avoid her, she would still be going in the same direction._” This is again significant. The accused is in effect, conceding that not only had he seen the victim, but she was walking in the same direction and _away from him and yet he had to avoid her._ In my view, it is at this critical, but late moment that the accused had realized that he was on the verge of colliding into the victim. In my judgment, I find that this is another clear example that the accused had acted rashly mere moments before the collision occurred with the victim. I am also of the view that the fact of the E-scooter’s wheel having collided into the right heel of the victim, as opposed to her body, did not in any way diminish the accused’s culpability in his actions a mere 4 second before the collision. His actions cumulatively amounted to a rash act. I find that the accused’s distinct and discrete actions in these circumstances clearly amounted to a rash act.

#### (c)   Payment made for the victim’s medical expenses

60     The accused had offered to pay for the victim’s medical fees. The Prosecution did not dispute that the payment was actually made by the accused. However, it was submitted by the Prosecution that the accused offered to pay for the medical expenses only because he knew he was at fault for causing the victim’s injuries. It was submitted that the accused because he was at fault, wanted to offer compensation to the victim.

61     I now examine this payment of medical expenses issue bearing in mind that the accused had given differing versions of his reason for paying the medical expense of the victim on the two different occasions in court that he gave evidence on this issue.

62     The first such occasion was on 2 Nov 2018.[^31]

> _“Q_ _It is also your Defence_ _that you are not at fault for colliding with the victim?_

> _A_ **_I did not say I was not at fault_**, _but it’s not a rash act._ **_If I say I’m not in the wrong, I wouldn’t bear the medical fees of the victim._**

> _Q_ _So_ _why were you in the wrong?_

> _A_ **_Because my scooter caused her to fall, so it’s my fault.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

63     The second occasion was some 5 months later on 29 April 2019.[^32] This time round, no doubt without some considerable reflection on his part, the accused had something different to say –

> _“Q_ _Did you decide to pay for the medical bills, because you knew that you were at fault?_

> _A_ **_No. By paying the medical bills, it’s a kind of consolation to them._**

> _Q_ _So, am I right to say that what you are saying, it was the victim’s fault because she walked into your path? She landed in hospital because of that, but you decided to pay the medical bills, even though you were not at fault?_

> _A_ _Both party decided not to pursue against each other._ **_That means that she did not find me at fault nor I did not find her at fault. As for the medical fees, I’ve already said earlier that it’s a kind of consolation to them.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

64     With respect, I found the answers of the accused somewhat convoluted and difficult to follow or comprehend.

65     I am mindful that neither the victim nor her husband had ever asked the accused to pay for the medical expenses. This was not disputed by the accused.[^33] In his earlier testimony, the accused had stated unequivocally that “_Because my scooter caused her to fall, so it’s my fault.”_ For reasons best known to himself, the accused now some 5 months later, has decided to shift his position. First, the accused stated he did not pay the medical expenses because he was at fault. Then he asserted that it was ‘_kind of consolation to them_.’ A further and third shift in his position now was that both parties were _not a fault_ and the payment of the medical expenses was a consolation. At best, the accused’s answer is bereft of logic and at worst, he is being disingenuous. If neither party were at fault, it would be reasonable to expect the accused to stand firm on his innocence and not to offer any payment at all for the medical expenses incurred by the victim. _A fortiori_, if the victim was at fault as seems to be the new assertion by the accused, then the accused should also not have to pay for the medical expenses of the victim as he was wholly innocent. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the only reasonable explanation was that the accused himself was “at fault” and that this was the only reason why he had paid for the victim’s medical expenses. I therefore find that the so-called ‘consolation’ explanation of the accused for his payment of the medical expenses of the victim was not a credible explanation at all.

66     I pause here to mention in passing that Counsel during his oral sentencing submissions had sought strenuously to portray the ‘red packet’ payment of the medical expenses by the accused as an act of “kindness.”[^34] I have to disagree. Indeed, given the answers of the accused during cross-examination as cited above, I could not accept that the accused’s payment of the victim’s medical expenses of $121/ (and a higher ‘lucky’ amount of $128/ at that) was an entirely altruistic act of kindness.

## Totality of Evidence

67     I now proceed to consider in totality the key aspects of the defence put up by the accused.

#### (i)   Statements made to the Police

68     The accused gave his statement P13 to ASP Lee Ting Wei a mere 6 hours after his collision with the victim. In P13, the accused stated that the victim had taken 2 steps to her right and he therefore immediately braked. However, as the floor was wet, the back wheel of his E-scooter had skidded to the left and hit the victim’s right heel. In P14, which was recorded about 2 months later by SGT Valerie Phua (PW1), the accused now stated that he regretted what had happened. He also asked for a warning to be given in view of his family background. Both P13 and P14 had not been challenged by the accused for involuntariness and had therefore been marked and admitted into evidence.

69     The Prosecution had submitted that the accused in his testimony in court had testified that the victim had walked into his path, he had swerved his E-scooter to avoid the victim and that he had also dismounted. It was submitted that these crucial details had _not_ been mentioned by the accused in both P13 and P14. It was further submitted by the Prosecution that the accused’s explanation for these omissions in that he wanted to “use the simplest way to explain” or that he had wanted “to attend to the victim” were not credible explanations. I was in agreement with the Prosecution. A reasonable person would have, especially immediately after the incident, been fully aware of the circumstances of the incident and also eager to tell the Police what had actually happened to exonerate himself. The omissions in the accused’s Police statements P13 and P14 relating to his later testimony in court that the victim had walked into his path, he had swerved his E-scooter to avoid the victim and that he had also dismounted, constituted if true, vital pieces of evidence for the Police. In my judgment, these explanations given by the accused were clearly an afterthought. I accordingly rejected these explanations given by the accused.

#### (ii)   Oral evidence in court

70     During his cross-examination, I noted that the accused had also testified that he did not think either party was at fault. However, when the court resumed after the lunch break, the accused in a reversal of his earlier evidence, now testified that he had admitted to his fault in P13 because both parties were in the wrong. When pressed further, the accused explained that he had difficulty in expressing himself and saw no difference between the two expressions. I set out the long exchange below as background [^35]–

> _“Q_ _Alright, mis---Mr. Toh, just before we break for lunch, you said that the victim said she did not want to pursue the matter and by admitting to it, you would bring the matter to an end. Do you remember saying that?_

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _What do you mean by “It would come to an end”?_

> _A_ _Both parties would not pursue against each other. However, the police will investigate the matter. Therefore, I admitted to the offence._

> _Q_ _At that time when you gave your statement, you did not know that there was CCTV footage, correct?_

> _A_ _That is so._

> _Q_ _So, when you gave your statement, you did not know that the victim was going to say that this was not her fault._

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _But yet, you admitted it was your fault for causing hurt to the victim._

> _A_ **_Yes, because both person---_** **_both parties felt that both of us were in the wrong.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

71     It is clear from this first exchange segment above that the accused, after the lunch adjournment, now took the contrary position that both parties had been at fault for the collision.

72     This was a turn-around from the accused’s earlier position before lunch. This was pointed out to the accused by the DPP in the second exchange segment as follows[^36] –

> _“Q_ _Mr. Toh, just before lunch, you just informed the Court that she did not find you atfault, you also did not find her at fault._

> _“A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _Now, you are telling us that “Both parties felt that both of us were in the wrong”. Can you explain?_

> _A_ **_That was why I needed an interpreter; I have a difficulty in expressing myself. That was why I said there’s no difference between the both._**

> (Emphasis added)

73     This was an unexpected answer. So much so that with this answer, the court in a bid to be fair to the accused, was prompted to ask the Interpreter to repeat the answer given by the accused as set out below[^37] -

>   
| 

_“Court:_

 | 

_No different_ (sic) _between?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_There’s no difference between both, Sir.”_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Both, meaning what the victim would say, and what he would say?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes, Sir. As in what he said earlier in Court and what he said now, there’s no difference._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Oh, okay.”_

 |

  
  

74     This now led to the third exchange segment between the DPP and the accused as set out below[^38] -

> _“Q_ Mr. Toh, you had the benefit of an interpreter before lunch, correct?

> _A_ **_Yes._**

> _Q_ _So, notwithstanding that, you maintain that what you said before lunch and you have just said, to you, there’s no difference, you mean exactly the same thing._

> _A_ _Yes._

> _Q_ _So I’m going to ask you, were you at fault?_

> _A_ **_Your Honour,_** **_both parties felt both were not at fault. However---however, both par---parties also felt both were at fault. So to me, both are the same.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

75     Again the court had to ask the Interpreter to repeat the above answer of the accused to ensure that it had been correctly heard by the court.[^39] The interpreter repeated the accused’s answer as follows –

>   
| 

“Court:

 | 

Can you repeat that again?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Both---**both parties felt** **both parties were not at fault.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

“Were not at fault”, yes.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, **but both parties also felt** **both parties were at fault.**

 |
| 

**So to me,** **both means the same. “**

 |
| 

(Emphasis added)

 |

  
  

76     This answer from the accused now led to the fourth exchange segment between the DPP and the accused as set out below [^40] –

>   
| 

“Q

 | 

Mr. Toh, it’s a simple question. Were you at fault or were you not at fault?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**This a very difficult question to answer. If---if I say I’m not at fault, you will say that I’m very unreasonable; but if I say I’m at fault, you will say I want to admit to the offence.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, when you admitted to the offence in your statement, question 2, answer 2, were you at fault?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I felt that I was at fault. However, according to the footage, I was not at fault.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Which means when you admitted to the---to the question in your statement, you felt you were at fault?

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

You felt?

 |
| 

Lim:

 | 

You were at fault.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Yes.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, why did you think that you were at fault at that time?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Because when I saw the victim got injured, I felt guilty.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I’m sorry, “when I saw the”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I saw the victim got injured, I felt guilty.”**

 |

  
  

77     This was a strange answer in many ways. It was all too evident now from the entire exchange above and especially its context, that the answers of the accused were leaving him entangled in a web of wholly improbable and inconsistent answers. In my view, the accused at best, was engaging in self-serving answers. At the other end of the spectrum, the accused was clearly engaging in a calculated course of deliberately contrived and duplicitous answers in a bid to shake off the DPP. I found him to be not a credible witness at all.

#### (iii)   Prosecution application to impeach credit of Accused

78     The Prosecution had made an application to impeach the credit of the accused. It was pointed out that there were material contradictions between the statements made by the accused in P13 and P14 and his oral testimony in court. P13 was the accused’s statement recorded under section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code, while P14 was the accused’s cautioned statement recorded under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code. P13 was recorded on 26 January 2018 at 9.39pm at Central Division lock up. P14 was recorded almost 2 months later on 13 March 2018 at 12.44pm at Central Division interview room.

79     It was submitted by the Prosecution that the parts marked in red in P13 stated that the accused had told the recorder ASP Lee twice that the back wheel of the E-scooter “skidded.” While under cross-examination, the accused had instead testified that he had _swerved._ He also clarified that he knew the two words had different meanings. The accused also explained that he did not have an interpreter with him during the statement recording and further, that he did not know how to express himself clearly.[^41] It was submitted however that the accused was given the choice to speak in English and Chines. He did not however tell ASP Lee that he had swerved and pushed his E-scooter away. The Prosecution also submitted that it was unconvincing for the accused to claim only at trial that the word ‘push” did not come to his mind, especially as P13 was recorded a mere 6 hours after the incident when the circumstances would still have been fresh in his mind.[^42] It was also submitted by the Prosecution that the accused spoke both English and Chinese. Further, P13 had been read back to the accused in Chinese and he had affirmed it to be true and correct. [^43]

80     Another example cited by the Prosecution was during cross-examination when the accused was asked why he had _admitted_ to the Police in P13 that he had caused injury to the victim in Q2 and A2 of P13. Here, the accused explained during cross-examination that he ‘_put the responsibility on himself’_ because he wanted to ‘_settle the matter_’ and return home as soon as possible. The accused further explained that the matter would go on endlessly if both the victim and he claimed that they were not at fault. He had therefore decided to admit that it was his fault.[^44]

81     It was also submitted by the Prosecution that again the accused had given a ludicrous answer. It was submitted that even if the victim had informed the accused that she did not intend to pursue the matter, this was not tantamount to saying that it was her fault. It was further highlighted by the Prosecution that at the time when P13 was recorded, the accused had no way of knowing what the victim was going to inform the Police.[^45] Crucially, the accused would not know at all if the victim was going to tell the Police whether the collision was a result of her fault or the fault of the accused. The Prosecution emphasized that there was “completely no basis” for the accused to claim that the matter would come to an end if the accused admitted to the collision.[^46]

82     The Prosecution cited a further example of a material inconsistency between what he said in his section 23 CPC cautioned statement P14 and his oral testimony. In cross-examination the accused had testified that he did not think the Police would charge him as he thought he would be given a _warning_ for which he is prepared to accept. The Prosecution pointed out that none of the Police Officers had even told him that he would be given a warning. It was further submitted that it “was telling” that the accused was prepared to accept a warning even though he was _not_ at fault.[^47]

83     In view of the above contradictions, the Prosecution submitted that the accused from his ludicrous explanations, baseless conclusions and material omissions, was clearly not worthy of credit. There were also vast discrepancies in his testimony and he was clearly a witness of scant credibility. The Prosecution had urged the Court to make a finding that the accused’s credit had been successfully impeached and that his evidence should be rejected.[^48]

## My findings

#### (i)   Impeachment application

84     At the end of the trial, I had to proceed to consider whether the credit of the accused had been impeached as a result of the material inconsistencies between his oral testimony in court and the highlighted portions of his statements relied on by the Prosecution. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had repeatedly vacillated in his accounts. He was also evasive when providing his explanations for the highlighted portions in his statements. On the facts, after a careful consideration of the entire evidence before me, I did not accept the accused’s explanations in court as regards the material inconsistencies. I found him not to be a credible witness and found that his credit had been impeached.

#### (ii)   Other Findings

85     I was also of the view that the accused’s long statement P13 and his cautioned statement P14 were both accurately recorded. I accordingly gave due weight to both his two statements. From his admissions in P14, I also found that the accused had regretted for what had happened and also hoped that a warning could be given to him as he was the sole breadwinner. From his own long statement in P13, it was clear that the accused had also admitted that he had caused injury to Mdm Liang the Taiwanese tourist.

86     I was of the firm view that the accused’s feeble and meandering attempts to exculpate himself were wholly incapable of belief and even illogical at times. This was largely a consequence of the evasive and shifting nature of his evidence, especially whenever he was confronted with an inconvenient inconsistency. I therefore had no difficulty agreeing with the Prosecution that the evidence of the accused revealed several material inconsistencies, both internally and externally. This amply fortified my finding that he was not a credible witness.

## Summary of findings on conviction

87     The accused had in essence denied that he had acted rashly in riding his E-scooter in the manner that he did on the pedestrian passageway outside Chinatown MRT Station on 26 January 2018. I was however satisfied that at the material time the ground was wet and there was a steady flow of human traffic in that immediate area. The objective CCTV evidence adduced also showed that the accused had picked up speed just before his E-scooter collided with the lady victim. Further, the accused himself had stated in his own testimony that he was aware of the unpredictable walking path of a pedestrian and that a longer breaking time was needed when the ground was wet. I was also of the view that the accused himself was not a reliable or credible witness.

88     In view of the above, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Prosecution had proved its case against the accused. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of the Charge.

## Antecedents

89     The accused had an unrelated antecedent in 2006. He has had a clean record since that date.

## Prosecution sentencing submissions

90     The Prosecution had submitted for a sentence of one week’s imprisonment based on 2 precedents (unreported) involving PMDs that were tendered before the court. The High Court decision in _PP v Lim Choon Teck <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 265</span>_ was also cited on the need for general deterrence in cases involving PMDs.

## Mitigation

91     Counsel had submitted that the accused was married and had a 9-year old son. He also supported his aged parents. He was remorseful and had paid the medical expenses of the victim.

92     Counsel submitted for a fine to be imposed on the accused.

## Reasons for sentence

93     As part of my findings after having found the accused guilty at the conclusion of the trial, I was of the view that the evidence before the court showed clearly that –

> a.     The ground outside the MRT Station was wet;

> b.     There was a steady flow of human traffic in the area;

> c.     The accused was travelling at a speed of 13 – 15 km.

94     In arriving at the appropriate sentence in any case, the court always considers both the culpability of the accused and the harm caused by his conduct and also all the aggravating and mitigating factors.

95     The Prosecution had referred to 2 unreported cases of _PP v Liu Jiaming (MAC 902271/2018)_ and the case of _PP v Victor Chin MAC (903105-06/2019)._ In the case of _PP v Liu Jiaming_, the accused had pleaded guilty to one charge under s. 337(a) of the Penal Code. He had rode his PMD into the hawker centre from the main entrance. He did not slow down, dismount and push his PMD despite approaching the blind spot in that area. He collided into the victim at the blind spot causing the victim to fall to the ground. The victim lost consciousness for a few seconds and was conveyed to KTPH. She complained of occipital head pain and left lower limb parathesia and was found to have mild occipital tenderness. The accused was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

96     In the case of _PP v Victor Chin MAC (903105-06/2019)_, the accused had pleaded guilty to 2 charges under s. 337(a) of the Penal Code. The accused rode his e-scooter on the bridge connecting Clementi Avenue 4 and Sunset Way across a canal located near Block 308 Clementi Avenue 4. The accused was aware that there were many pedestrians using the bridge. There were also barriers at the entrance of the bridge directing individuals to ‘dismount and push’. While riding his e-scooter on the bridge, the accused attempted to squeeze through a gap between two pedestrians walking in the same direction. As he was doing so, the right handle of his e-scooter knocked onto the right elbow of the victim who fell to the ground. He was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment per charge, with both sentences to run consecutively for a global sentence of 2 weeks imprisonment.

97     As for precedents cited by Counsel, the precedents cited did not involve cases of rash acts involving the use of PMDs. These precedents included a case of throwing clay pots containing hot porridge and another case involving the throwing of a water tumbler. As such, I did not find the precedents cited by Counsel to be of any assistance at all.

98     As regards the culpability of the accused, I am mindful of the observations made by the High Court of Three Judges in the leading case of _PP v Hue An Li <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span>_ at page 45 where Sundaresh Menon CJ stated as follows –

> _45_.     _“In our judgment,_ _awareness of the potential risks that might arise from one’s conduct ought, in general, to be the dividing line between negligence and rashness. For both negligence and rashness, the offender would have fallen below the requisite objective standard of the reasonable person._ **_The harsher sentencing regime for rashness is justified on the basis that the offender was actually advertent to the potential risks which might arise from his conduct, but proceeded anyway despite such advertence._**

> (Emphasis added)

99     In my view, the accused’s culpability is moderate to high since as indicated above, the ground was wet, there was a steady flow of human traffic in the vicinity and the accused’s E-scooter was travelling at a speed of 13 -15 km. He was also advertent to the potential risks which might arise from his conduct.

100    This case clearly calls for a deterrent sentence. The dangers posed by PMD riders and E-scooters was the subject of intense debate in Parliament recently and also in April 2019 when the Minister for Transport had given a Written Reply in Parliament. In particular, the risks posed to pedestrians by riders of E-scooters, especially the elderly and young children, has been a continuing worry and concern for MPs.

101    PMD devices today are a ubiquitous part of the Singapore landscape. It is incontrovertible that, as with all advances in technology, they play a useful role in society. It is their usage, perhaps, that has caused deep concern among members of the public, especially with regard to the numerous collision incidents and injuries caused by errant PMD riders.

102    At the request of the court at the conclusion of the trial and at the time of sentencing on 19 August 2019, the Prosecution had provided statistics on the number of incidents involving PMD riders for 2017 and 2018. The statistics were provided in the Written Reply by Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan on serious accidents involving personal mobility devices (“PMDs”). These accident figures evoke a palpable sense of disquiet. The figures show that in 2017 and 2018, there were 228 reported incidents involving PMDs on public paths. Of these accidents, there were 196 cases with reported injuries, out of which one was a fatal accident involving a PMD rider who self-skidded and subsequently succumbed to his injuries. There were 32 other cases involving major injuries such as concussions or fractures.[^49]

103    I should add here, that the increased mobility afforded by these PMDs, carries a concomitant responsibility on the part of PMD riders to use their PMDs responsibly, with due care and consideration for other users of roads, pavements, pedestrian walkways, HDB void decks, neighbourhood centres and other common. Spaces. PMD riders cannot be indifferent and impersonal to the risks they pose to others, especially to the frail and elderly, each time they mount their PMDs. Freedom of mobility is not freedom to act rashly or recklessly and endanger the personal safety of others.

104    Sadly, the accused had acted in a rash manner when using his PMD and colliding with the Taiwanese lady tourist outside Chinatown MRT Station on 26th January 2018. I have already recounted above the findings of the court in finding the accused guilty of the charge of committing a rash act endangering the personal safety of others when he rode his E-scooter in the manner he did that wet January afternoon in 2018.

105    What I also find disturbing in the accused’s manner of riding his PMD that day was that he had been riding _towards_ the victim. So he had therefore knocked into the victim from the rear and to her right side as shown in the CCTV footage. So clearly, the accused had not seen her or had seen her but was not able to slow down and avoid her. This is an area outside an MRT station with a heavy and almost never-ending pedestrian footfall. It is in the heart of Chinatown and crowded with many tourists at almost all times of the day. The accused should have been aware of the potential risks. At the very least, he should have been more alert, slowed down his speed or even have dismounted and pushed his PMD instead. He did not take any of these preventative safety actions. Further, the ground was wet and there was a steady flow of human traffic outside the MRT Station. The accused must have been actually alive and advertent to the potential risks which might arise from his conduct, but he proceeded anyway despite such potential risks involved.

106    I have noted in the accused’s favour that after colliding with the victim, he had parked his E-scooter and went to the assistance of Madam Liang. He had also called for an ambulance. He had also reimbursed the victim’s medical fees by giving her a red packet of $128.

107    Counsel has submitted that the accused is suffering from depression and separation anxiety. However, there was no medical report submitted which shows any causal link between his depression and his offending criminal conduct of riding the E-scooter in a rash manner.

108    The precedents cited by the Prosecution indicating 1 week’s imprisonment for similar s. 337 (a) Penal Code charges are in respect of accused persons who had pleaded guilty to their Charges. However, the accused had _claimed trial._ He is therefore not entitled to any sentencing discount that might otherwise have been granted in view of a timely plea of guilt that would have evidenced his remorse or which would have saved on the costs of a trial. This was recently stated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the case of _Gan Chai_ Bee _Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> at \[73\].

109    It is a recognized sentencing principle that apart from the culpability of the accused, the harm caused by the accused’s actions also go towards the severity of the sentence to be imposed. From the Medical Report, I have noted that the victim had only suffered minor injuries - tenderness over her buttocks bilaterally and an occipital hematoma. In the light of the not so serious injuries suffered by the victim, the harm suffered by the victim can be considered to be on the low side.

110    I had considered the mitigation of the accused. He has no similar antecedents. Counsel also submitted that he had cooperated with the Police and was remorseful. The accused had also paid for the medical expenses of the victim. Apart from these submissions, there was really nothing extenuating or exceptional in the mitigation plea advanced on his behalf by Counsel.

111    Having regard to the culpability of the accused and the harm caused to the victim and all the surrounding circumstances, the accused is sentenced to a term of one week’s imprisonment for the charge on which he has been convicted.

112    The accused has appealed against both his conviction and sentence. He has been granted bail pending appeal. A stay of execution has also been ordered on the sentence of imprisonment.

113    For the avoidance of doubt, this judgment and in particular paragraphs \[100\] to \[103\] above did not take into consideration or was in any way influenced by the Government announcement on 4 November 2019 of the ban on E-scooters from public footpaths.
