Civil Procedure – Summary judgment

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/RAS 5/2022.\]

5 March 2022

### District Judge Lee Lit Cheng:

## Introduction

1       This is a claim by the Plaintiff against her tenant for repossession of the rented premises and rent arrears since 15 December 2020.

2       The Plaintiff obtained summary judgment in the court below and the Defendant appealed. I dismissed the appeal as none of the grounds which the Defendant sought to rely on in his defence were pleaded. The Defendant now appeals against my decision.

## Facts

3       The Plaintiff is the owner of 5A Ontario Avenue #XXX The Windsor, Singapore 576194 (“the Property”).

4       There was a written tenancy agreement between the parties to lease the Property for $3,800 per month for a period of 12 months from 15 May 2017 (“the 2017 Tenancy Agreement”). After the 2017 Tenancy Agreement expired, there were no further written agreements and the Defendant continued to rent the Property at $3,800 per month to be paid on the 15th of each month.

5       The Defendant had not been paying rent since 15 December 2020 despite the Plaintiff’s repeated demands.

6       On 20 March 2021, the Plaintiff issued a Notice of Repossession and Termination, requiring the Defendant to vacate the Property forthwith.[^1]

7       On 30 March 2021, the Defendant sent the Plaintiff a text message as follows:

> Hi Ms Loke,

> The tenancy agreement will terminate on 15 May 2021.

8       Subsequently, the Defendant denied wanting to quit or vacate the Property on 15 May 2021 and refused to move out.

### The Plaintiff’s claim in this Suit

9       On 10 August 2021, the Plaintiff commenced the present Suit against the Defendant seeking, _inter alia_, an order that the Defendant forthwith delivers possession of the Property to the Plaintiff and pays the rent arrears.[^2]

### The pleaded defences

10     The Defence (Amendment No 1) (“the Amended Defence”) filed by the Defendant on 15 November 2021 was a bare denial with the first paragraph stating that the Amended Defence was filed in reply to the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) filed by the Plaintiff dated 10 August 2021 “without prejudice to \[the Defendant’s\] rights to seek further and better particulars of the SOC, serve interrogatories, and amend the Defence and file counterclaims upon receipt of the particulars and answers to the interrogatories and discovery of documents”.

### The decision below

11     On 20 September 2021, the Plaintiff filed DC/SUM 3736/2021 seeking summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”).

12     On 22 December 2021, DC/SUM 3736/2021 was heard by the learned Deputy Registrar Elaine Lim Mei Yee (“DR Lim”), who found that the Plaintiff had shown a _prima facie_ case for judgment and the Defendant had not raised any arguable defence as the Amended Defence was simply a bare denial of the Plaintiff’s claim. DR Lim granted summary judgment in favour of the Plaintiff and ordered that:

> (a)     The Defendant shall deliver up possession of the Property to the Plaintiff within 21 days from the date of DR Lim’s order.

> (b)     The Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff rent arrears totalling $19,000 for the period from 15 December 2020 to 14 May 2021, and doubt-rent pursuant to s 28(4) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Civil Law Act”) at $7,600 a month for the period from 15 May 2021 to the date the Defendant delivers up possession of the Property to the Plaintiff.

> (c)     Interest on the above sums at 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ to the date of the Defendant’s delivery up of the Property to the Plaintiff.

> (d)     The Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff the costs and disbursements of this application and of this action, fixed at $7,000 (all in).

13     The Defendant appealed against DR Lim’s decision.

## The law governing summary judgment

14     The principles relating to a summary judgment application under O 14 of the Rules of Court are well settled. The plaintiff must first show that he has a _prima facie_ case for judgment. Once he has done that, the burden shifts to the defendant who, in order to obtain leave to defend, must establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or _bona fide_ defence (_Associated Development Pte Ltd v Loong Sie Kiong Gerald_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 389</span> at \[22\]).

15     In assessing whether there is an arguable defence, the court cannot consider defences which have not been pleaded, unless the case is an exceptional one where the court is of the view that there are good reasons to permit reliance on such a defence, as for instance, if the defence struck at the heart of the court’s powers (_Olivine Capital Pte Ltd and anor v Chia Chin Yan and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1371</span> at \[43\]).

16     It is also trite that a court would not grant leave to defend if all the defendant provides is a mere assertion in an affidavit of given situations which forms the basis of his defence (_M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 325</span> at \[19\]).

## My decision

17     I dismissed the appeal as I found that the Plaintiff had shown a _prima facie_ case for judgment, and the Defendant failed to establish that there was a fair or reasonable probability that he had a real or _bona fide_ defence. I will set out my reasons for each part in turn.

### The Plaintiff had shown a prima facie case for judgment

18     The Plaintiff had shown a _prima facie_ case for judgment on the following basis:

> (a)     It was undisputed that the Defendant was renting the Property at $3,800 per month and rent was to be paid in advance on the 15th day of each month.

> (b)     It was undisputed that the Defendant continued to occupy the Property even though he had not been paying rent since 15 December 2020.

> (c)     The Defendant had committed a repudiatory breach by not paying rent, and the Plaintiff was entitled to and had in fact terminated the tenancy on 20 March 2021 by issuing the Notice of Repossession and Termination.[^3]

> (d)     On 30 March 2021, the Defendant had also sent a text message to the Plaintiff stating that he would be terminating the tenancy for the Property on 15 May 2021.

> (e)     Pursuant to s 28(4) of the Civil Law Act, a landlord has the option to charge double rent from the date of termination of the tenancy until possession is given up by the tenant, whether notice to that effect has been given or not.

19     I noted that although there was _prima facie_ evidence that the tenancy was terminated on 20 March 2021 and the Plaintiff could have opted to charge double-rent from 20 March 2021 onwards, the Plaintiff sought an order for double-rent only from 15 May 2021.

### The Defendant failed to establish a real or bona fide defence

20     Having established that there was a _prima facie_ case for judgment, the burden was on the Defendant to show that there was a fair or reasonable probability that he had a real or _bona fide_ defence, in order to obtain leave to defend.

21     I find that the Defendant failed to establish that he had any real or _bona fide_ defence because none of the grounds he relied on in his defence had been pleaded, and there were no good reasons for me to consider defences which were not pleaded.

22     The Amended Defence was nothing but a bare denial of the claim and a statement to reserve the Defendant’s rights to “seek further and better particulars of the SOC, serve interrogatories, and amend the Defence and file counterclaims upon receipt of the particulars and answers to the interrogatories and discovery of documents”. There was nothing in the Amended Defence which showed that the Defendant had a real or _bona fide_ defence.

23     The Defendant sought to rely on the following grounds in his defence:

> (a)     First, the Defendant said there was a valid tenancy agreement till 15 May 2022 as the parties had agreed to extend the lease on a yearly basis. This was not pleaded in his Amended Defence and was, in any event, based on his bare assertion.

> (b)     Second, the Defendant said he did not terminate the tenancy agreement on 15 May 2021 and the text message he sent to the Plaintiff on 30 March 2021 (see \[7\]) was not intended to be a notice of termination. This ground was also not pleaded in his Amended Defence and was, in any event, irrelevant given that the tenancy had been terminated earlier on 20 March 2021 when the Plaintiff issued the Notice of Repossession and Termination.

> (c)     Third, in the Defendant’s written submissions filed on 24 January 2022 for the appeal, the Defendant raised a further argument that he had sold the Property to the Plaintiff’s father in or around the year 2013 on the condition that the Defendant could continue to reside in the Property for as long as he wanted by paying the Plaintiff $3,800 per month, or that he could buy back the Property from the Plaintiff at an agreed price. This new ground of defence was neither pleaded in the Amended Defence nor mentioned in any of the Defendant’s affidavits. It was also based only on the bare assertion of the Defendant.

24     There were no good reasons for me to consider the defences which were not pleaded by the Defendant. The matters which the Defendant sought to rely on in his defence were well within his knowledge and could easily have been stated in his Defence or Amended Defence. This was a separate matter from the Defendant’s intention to apply for interrogatories and to make further amendments to his Amended Defence. Even though the Defendant was unrepresented and unfamiliar with civil procedure, there were no good reasons why he did not plead the defences which he already knew of. There was nothing exceptional to warrant a departure from the general rule that only pleaded defences should be considered.

## Conclusion

25     I dismissed the appeal because the Defendant failed to show that he had an arguable defence.

26     I awarded costs of $1,500 plus $250 disbursements to the Plaintiff for the appeal.
