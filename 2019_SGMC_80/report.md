### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, a 42-year-old female Singaporean (the “**Accused**”), faced 16 charges of sending false messages under Section 45(b) of the Telecommunications Act (Chapter 323, 2000 Rev Ed) (“**TA**”). Pursuant to a plea offer by the Prosecution, the Accused pleaded guilty to three of the charges – namely the 1st, 2nd and the 15th Charge – and consented to the remaining 13 charges being taken into consideration (“**TIC**”) for the purpose of sentencing.

2       Having heard the parties, I sentenced the accused to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the 1st and 2nd Charges, and 3 weeks’ imprisonment for the 15th Charge. I ordered the imprisonment terms for the 1st and 2nd Charges to run consecutively, and the 15th Charge, concurrently, resulting in a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused is dissatisfied with her sentence and has filed the present appeal against her sentence.

## THE CHARGES

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

5       The material portions of the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) relating to the Proceeded Charges which the Accused admitted to without any qualification are as follows:

>   
| 

**_STATEMENT OF FACTS_**

_1_      _The accused is Michelle Choo Xin Yi, female 41 years old. …. She is working as an Administrator._

_2_      _The complainant is one Toh Yim Hoe, male, aged 60 years old. At the material time, the complainant was residing at Blk 640 Yishun Street 61, #xx-xxx, Singapore 760640._

**_BACKGROUND FACTS_**

_3_      _The accused has a younger brother by the name of Ronald Choo, who divorced his ex-wife (i.e. Sharon). Due to previous familial disputes, the accused was under the impression that Sharon and her parents had always ill-treated Ronald Choo and the accused’s mother over several years before the accused’s mother passed away in 2015. As such, the accused intended to make a series of calls to ‘995’ and ‘999’ in order to seek revenge from and cause inconvenience to Sharon and her parents. At the material time, Sharon’s parents were residing at Blk 640 Yishun Street 61, #xx-xxx, Singapore 760640, while Sharon was staying at Blk 318C Yishun Avenue 9, #xx-xxx, Singapore 763318._

_4_      _Before the accused’s mother passed away in 2015, the accused’s mother had purchased an insurance policy from an insurance agent known to the accused as “Jade Ng”. The accused was of the view that Jade was not honest in the way she managed the medical bills insurance claim process when the accused’s mother fell ill, which led to the accused having to pay large amounts of medical bills._

**_FIRST INFORMATION REPORT_**

_5_      _On 10 October 2017 at about 8.54pm, the complainant lodged a police report, stating that earlier at about 6.30pm, about five paramedics went to his unit upon receiving information that a 70-year-old man required medical assistance. However, none of the complainant’s family members or himself called for ambulance. The complainant further informed that a similar incident took place before on 4 May 2017. The incident location was reported to be Blk 640 Yishun Street 61, #xx-xxx, Singapore 760640._

**_FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1_** _st_ **_CHARGE (MAC-901684-2019)_**

_6_      _On 5 March 2017 at about 1.30pm, the accused was in the vicinity of Boat Quay Singapore. Using a public telephone, the accused called the emergency hotline ‘995’. She then said to a Singapore Civil Defence Force officer “my 70-year-old father fainted at Block 640 Yishun Street 61 at unit #xx-xxx”. The incident location was given to be Blk 640 Yishun Street 61, #xx-xxx, Singapore._

_7_      _In response to the accused’s call, an ambulance and five paramedics were sent to the said incident location. Upon arrival, the paramedics approached the complainant who in turn informed them that he did not call for assistance. Thereafter, the paramedics left the incident location._

_8_      _At the time of making the call, the accused knew that the complainant did not require assistance and she fabricated the fact that he had fainted at home._

_9_      _By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of sending a false message, punishable under Section 45(b) of the Telecommunications Act (Cap 323, 2000 Rev Ed) (“_ **_Telecommunications Act_** _”)._

**_FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2_** _nd_ **_CHARGE (MAC-901685-2019)_**

_10_      _On 10 October 2017, at about 6.37pm, the accused, while using a public telephone in the vicinity of Blk 536 Upper Cross Street, Singapore, dialed the emergency hotline “995”. She then informed a Singapore Civil Defence Force officer “my father fainted at 640 Yishun Street 61 at unit #xx-xxx”, a fact which she knew to be fabricated when she made the call to the hotline. As a result of her information to the officer, paramedics was activated to Blk 640 Yishun Street 61, #xx-xxx, Singapore 760640. Upon arrival, the paramedics approached the complainant who in turn informed them that he did not call for assistance. Thereafter, the paramedics left the incident location._

_11_      _By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of sending a false message, punishable under Section 45(b) of the Telecommunications Act._

**_FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 15_** _th_ **_CHARGE (MAC-901698-2019)_**

_12_      _On 18 May 2017 at about 12.30pm, the accused dialed ‘999’ and informed a Police officer that there are illegal vice and gambling activities at Blk 640 Yishun Street 61, #xx-xxx and Blk 318C Yishun Avenue 9, #xx-xxx by stating “There are vice activities and illegal gambling at both places here.” The accused knew that the information that she had given was fabricated. When the Police officer asked for her name, the accused gave her name as “Jade Ng”, which the accused knew was false._

_13_      _By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of sending a false message, punishable under Section 45(b) of the Telecommunications Act._

 |

  
  

## ANTECEDENTS

6       The Accused is untraced.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

7       The prescribed punishment for the offence of sending a false message under section 45(b) of the TA is a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or both.

8       The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of at least 8 weeks for each for the three Proceeded Charges, with two to run consecutively, yielding a total imprisonment term of at least 16 weeks. The Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors: (a) the Accused faced an extremely large number of charges; (b) the offences were committed over an extended period of time, from April 2015 and October 2017; (c) public resources were deployed and wasted to deal with the false messages sent by the Accused; (d) the Accused acted with malice when making the calls, with the specific intent of causing inconvenience to her ex-sister in-law and her family; and (e) there was a further victim of the calls - namely Jade Ng - who was falsely identified by the Accused as the caller in a few of the calls.

## MITIGATION PLEA AND SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY DEFENCE

9       In a written plea-in-mitigation (the “**Mitigation Plea**”), counsel urged the court to sentence the Accused to a high fine of $15,000 instead, being a fine of $5,000 per proceeded charge. Defence counsel highlighted the following factors:

> (a)     The calls the Accused made did not involve the making of any bomb threats; they fell within the category of “prank/nuisance-calls”;

> (b)     The Accused displayed remorse by pleading guilty and cooperating with the police;

> (c)     The Accused has no criminal antecedents;

> (d)     The Accused’s previous failed love relationship when she was only 13 years of age, while unconnected with the present case, had scarred her so deeply and had caused her to develop unhealthy self-destructive coping methods against people who have offended her. These manifested themselves in the form of nuisance calls which targeted her ex-sister-in-law and her family whom she felt had offended her by ill-treating her brother and her mother[^1].

10     The Accused’s mental and psychological state was detailed in two reports prepared by the Accused’s private psychiatrist, one Dr Lim Yun Chin of Raffles Hospital (“**Dr Lim**”). Dr Lim opined that the accused’s past history of being betrayed repeatedly whilst being in an intimate relationship, albeit unconnected with the present case, “has morphed her behaviour into \[that of an\] disturbed and emotionally unstable woman” with an acquired rage and hatred “towards the world for \[her\] personal injustice ….. which has become an integral part of her self-destructive coping resources as evident in the current offences”[^2]. Dr Lim was, however, clear in opining that at the time of the offences, the accused “was not labouring under any categorical psychiatric disorder \[and\] was essentially displaying vindictiveness towards people who seemed to have offended her”[^3]. This temperament “stemmed from her past history of being betrayed which she couldn’t get over” [^4].

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

11     General deterrence is the primary consideration when sentencing offenders who have committed acts in contravention of section 45(b) of the TA. False messages sent to the Police, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“**SCDF**”) and other similar public authorities, especially when acted upon by such authorities, will necessarily lead to the wastage of valuable public resources and diversion of such resources away from genuine and/or more pressing needs.

12     That general deterrence features prominently in such cases is borne out by the sentencing table tendered by the Prosecution[^5]. The precedents cited therein suggest that cases in which public resources have been despatched in response to a false message will generally attract a starting sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

13     In _Public Prosecutor v Ng Chin Keat Kelvin (MAC-903830-2016) (unreported)_, the accused was charged with three offences under s 45(b) of the TA (two proceeded with and one TIC), and two other separate offences. In relation to the s 45(b) TA offences, the victim was one Paramasivam S/O Maniam (hereinafter, the “victim”). In relation to the first proceeded charge, the accused had identified himself as the victim and called the police emergency hotline from a public phone to report that his friend, who lives on the 11th floor of the flat, is planning to jump down from the 12th floor of the building. The accused gave the victim’s address as the incident location. A total of 10 officers from the police and the SCDF were despatched to the incident location, but were unable to locate anyone on either the 11th or 12th floors. The police officers proceeded to the victim’s unit and interviewed the victim, who informed them that he had not called the emergency hotline. In relation to the second proceeded charge, the accused called the police emergency hotline from a public phone and stated that his friend Kelvin was drunk and had run out of his unit ten minutes ago, saying that he wanted to go to the 16th floor. The accused again provided the victim’s address as the incident location. As a result of the message, nine officers from the police and the SCDF were despatched to the incident location, but no one matching the description provided by the accused was found. The police proceeded to the victim’s unit and was informed that he did not call the emergency hotline. When the accused was eventually traced, he admitted he had called the police on the two occasions because he had a dispute with the victim and his brother. Being bored and angry, he decided to disturb them by using their identities to transmit false information. The accused was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment per proceeded charge, yielding a global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment.

14     In _Public Prosecutor v Than Aung (MAC-906737-2017 & Ors) (unreported)_, the accused faced four charges under s 45(b) of the TA, with two charges proceeded with and two TIC. In the first ‘999’ call, the offender reported “_someone had taken the glass out of \[his\] window”_, and provided the address of the incident location. Police officers were despatched to the location, but found that the flat number given did not exist. In the second ‘999’ call, the offender reported that someone wanted to open his window. Once again, police officers were despatched to the incident location and searched the block, but found that the flat number given did not exist. When apprehended, the accused admitted that his ex-girlfriend stayed in the mentioned block. He wanted the police to check on her to create trouble for her, and to prevent her from meeting her new boyfriend. The accused was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment per proceeded charge, with both sentences to run concurrently, yielding a global sentence of 8 weeks.

15     In _Public Prosecutor v Irwan Syazwani Bin Muhammad (DAC-919519-2018 & Ors) (unreported)_, the accused faced one proceeded charge under s 45(b) of the TA, and four other proceeded charges and four TIC charges for separate offences. In respect of the s 45(b) TA charge, the accused had called ‘999’, stating “_My brother got stabbed at the chest area and doesn’t seem to be alive now”._ The incident location was given as Bugis Junction. Police was despatched but it was discovered that no one was injured at Bugis Junction. Investigations revealed that the offender accused had gone to a restaurant and was allegedly slapped and threatened by a waiter. He called the police and when the police did not arrive after 30 minutes, this angered the offender. He decided to call ‘999’ while pretending to be his older brother. The accused was sentenced to 1 month’s imprisonment for the s 45(b) TA charge.

16     In _Public Prosecutor v Dineshgar s/o Vadivellu (MAC-904880-2019 & Ors) (unreported)_, the accused faced five charges under s 45(b) of the TA and two other charges for separate offences. Two of the s 45(b) TA charges were proceeded with, and the remaining three TIC. The offender made the first call to ‘999’ stating, “Got fighting here. You do not ask alot just come.” Two minutes later, the accused called again, stating “I called earlier. I gave the wrong block number earlier. It should be at Block 17”. Three other calls were made to the police relating to the same incident, and form the subject matter of the TIC charges. The police responded to the calls made by the accused, but foot patrol conducted by the officers did not reveal that any fight had occurred. The accused subsequently admitted that he was the person who had called the police. At the material time, the accused was talking incoherently and smelt strongly of alcohol. The accused admitted that he had made a false call to the police emergency line out of frustration, as he was unhappy with his girlfriend’s male acquaintance who was disturbing his girlfriend. The accused was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment in relation to each of the proceeded s 45(b) TA charge.

17     Based on the cases set out in the sentencing tables, it is evident that s 45(b) TA offences which led to the deployment, and consequently wastage, of police and similar public resources generally attracted custodial sentences of four weeks as a starting point. Admittedly, in _Than Aung’s_ case, the judge imposed a sentence of eight weeks per charge. However, he ordered the 8-week sentence for each of the two proceeded s 45(b) TA charges to run concurrently. The global sentence of eight weeks in _Than Aung’s_ case for the two proceeded charges is therefore consistent with the starting benchmark of four weeks per charge.

18     Defence Counsel, however, cited to me the case of _Public Prosecutor v Naganantini d/o Sommosundram Kannan_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGMC 4</span> in which a non-custodial sentence was meted out for a s 45(b) TA offence. The case involved a _single_ count of sending false message to the police contrary to s 45(b) of the TA. The accused in that case had called “999” from a public phone stating “_there is a fight going on in the house_”, and specifying the incident location. When the police arrived, it was ascertained from the owner of the unit, one Abdul Jalil, that no fight had occurred. The call was traced to the accused. Investigations revealed that the accused was the ex-girlfriend of Abdul Jalil and previously lived at the said location. The couple had broken up after a dispute. The accused was unhappy with her ex-boyfriend and made the call to inconvenience him. The learned District Judge took into account, among other things, the accused’s remorse, her personal circumstances, the fact that the act was done at the spur of the moment, and the minor inconvenience caused to the victim. He sentenced the accused to a fine of $5,000, and in default, 25 days’ imprisonment.

19     Defence Counsel relies on _Naganantini_’s case and the mitigating factors set out in paragraph 9 above in submitting that the Accused should similarly be sentenced to a fine of $5,000 per charge, resulting in a total fine of $15,000.

## MY DECISION

20     In my opinion, a non-custodial sentence is clearly inadequate in the present case given that general and specific deterrence feature very prominently in cases where the transmission of a false message has led to the unnecessary wastage of public resources to the detriment of the general public. In this regard, I consider _Naganantini’s_ case, a dated 2011 decision, to be an anomaly. _Naganantini’s_ case is clearly out of line with the four recent cases cited by the Prosecution which suggest that a custodial sentence is generally warranted in cases where false messages were made leading to the despatch of essential public services.

21     I also agree with the Prosecution that there are a significant number of aggravating factors in the present case which would militate against a non-custodial sentence.

22     First, the offences were committed on a significant number of occasions, 16 in all. The offences spanned an extended period, some two and a half years, from 19 April 2015 to 10 October 2017.

23     Secondly, public resources were dispatched needlessly to respond to the Accused’s calls, when they could have been used to attend to genuine cases, and in some cases, possibly to save lives.

24     Defence Counsel pointed out that it was not expressly mentioned (and hence not expressly admitted) in the SOF that resources were deployed to the incident location(s) on the occasion covered by the 15th Charge, as well the occasions covered by the 13 TIC charges. In my mind, it is clear, however, that SCDF resources were at the very least despatched to the incident location for the calls which are the subject matter of the 1st and 2nd Charge. While there is no clear evidence that police resources were despatched to the incident location(s) on the _other_ occasions, police resources would necessarily have to be expended to trace the calls made by the accused, as the modus of the accused seems to be to make these call from a public phone. Valuable police resources were consequently wasted as a result, albeit in a different form on these other occasions.

25     Thirdly, the Accused acted with malice when she made the calls. By her own admission, she was unhappy with her brother’s ex-wife and her parents as she was “under the impression that Sharon and her parents had always ill-treated \[her brother\] and the accused’s mother over several years before the accused’s mother passed away in 2015”[^6]. She made the calls with the express intent “to seek revenge from and cause inconvenience to Sharon and her parents”[^7].

26     I gave due regard to the Accused’s psychiatrist, Dr Lim’s, opinion that the accused’s history of being betrayed in an earlier relationship may have shaped her current temperament and caused her to be unable to “harbour cordial or positive feelings towards other people”[^8], and indeed, to acquire rage and hatred “towards the world for \[her\] personal injustice”[^9] suffered. However, I noted that Dr Lim was equally clear in opining that at the time the offences were committed, the accused “was not labouring under any categorical psychiatric disorder”[^10]. Dr Lim went on to state that the Accused was “essentially displaying vindictiveness towards people who seemed to have offended her”[^11]. So construed, Dr Lim’s opinion does not in any way contradict the Accused’s Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report dated 11 October 2018 which states, among other things, that: (a) the accused does not currently have a mental illness; (b) her actions in the context of the offences were “goal directed and motivated by intent to sabotage” the victims; and (c) her actions during the alleged offence were not contributed by any underlying psychotic processes[^12]. Against this backdrop, the Accused’s temperament does not, in my opinion, render her any less culpable for her acts. In fact, they fortify the conclusion that the accused was aware that her actions were wrong, and she was motivated by malice and vindictiveness when she committed the said offences.

27     For completeness, I address the case of _Public Prosecutor v Cheong Hock Lai and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 203</span> cited by the Defence for the proposition that the objectives of general and specific deterrence may be achieved by the imposition of a sufficiently high fine. In my mind, _Cheong Hock Lai’s_ case must be viewed in its proper context. That case dealt with sentencing for market misconduct in contravention of s 102(b) of the then Securities Industry Act (Cap 289, 1985 Rev Ed) (“**SIA**”), in which the maximum fine that could be imposed for the index offence was $250,000. As noted in the judgment, the SIA had in fact, on 6 December 2000, been amended to increase the statutory fine limit from $50,000 to $250,000, to give the courts “more flexibility in the exercise their sentencing discretion when sentencing s 102(b) offences” \[at 33\]. Against the backdrop of such a high statutory fine limit and the legislative history of the SIA, it was understandable why the High Court in that case opined that high fines of up to the statutory limit of $250,000 would achieve the general effect of deterrence.

28     The present case, however, deals with an offence where the maximum fine that could be imposed for a s 45(b) TA offence is only $10,000. Given the significantly lower statutory fine limit, I am unable to accept Counsel’s submission that the same deterrent effect could be achieved by imposing a fine of $5,000 for each of the three proceeded charges. This is so especially having regarded to the aggravating factors mentioned above: see also _Cheong Hock Lai_ at para \[47\].

## SENTENCE

29     As noted above, the recent cases suggest that the benchmark sentence for cases where false messages were made leading to the wastage of essential public services is four weeks as a starting point.

30     Using four weeks as a starting point, an uplift is necessary here given the large number of TIC charges. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[38\], “if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased….. This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. This would _a fortiori_ be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature.”

31     The precedent cases in which four-week imprisonment terms per charge were imposed all involved significantly fewer TIC charges. In the present case, the Accused faces a total of 16 charges, three proceeded with and 13 TIC. For the 1st and 2nd Charge, I am of the view that an uplift of two weeks each, i.e. six weeks per charge, is appropriate having regard to the number of TIC charges and the aggravating factors noted above. A four-week uplift (i.e. to eight weeks per charge) pressed for by the Prosecution is, in my view, excessive as it entailed a doubling of the starting benchmark of four weeks per charge for s 45(b) cases where public resources were despatched. I also took into account the fact that police would in all likelihood have taken the later calls less seriously after hoax calls involving the same location were repeatedly received, and moderated their commitment of resources accordingly.

32     For s 45(b) TA offences, higher imprisonment terms are usually imposed where police or similar resources have been despatched to the incident location because of the hoax calls. For the 15th Charge, as it is not clear if police resources were despatched onsite, I would sentence the accused to three weeks’ imprisonment for this charge.

33     I order the sentence for the first two charges to run consecutively and the 15th to run concurrently, resulting in a total sentence of **12 weeks.** This, in my view, is proportionate with the culpability of the accused as borne out by the number of hoax calls made.

34     The Accused, being dissatisfied, has appealed against the sentence. She is presently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
