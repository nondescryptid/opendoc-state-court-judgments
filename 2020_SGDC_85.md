### District Judge Terence Tay:

## Introduction

1       The surety posted bail of $20,000 for his friend, one Balasubramanian Kamaraj (the “**Accused Person**”), who was charged with one count of rioting with a deadly weapon under section 148 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) which was punishable with up to 10 years’ imprisonment and caning.

2       The bail was furnished in the form of $5,000 monetary and $15,000 non-monetary securities, and the surety had executed the following document that sets out his obligations (the “**Bond**”):

![]([2020] SGDC 0085_Image/[2020] SGDC 0085_image2.png)

3       On 2 September 2019, the Accused Person failed to show up for a pre-trial conference at PTC Chamber 1. The district judge issued a warrant of arrest against the Accused Person and fixed a mention in District Court 26 of the State Courts Building on 14 October 2019 at 9:00 am for the surety to show cause as to why the court should not forfeit the full amount of the Bond. A mention for a review of the warrant of arrest against the Accused Person was also fixed for 14 October 2019 in District Court 26 (the “**Warrant Review**”).

4       According to a report dated 14 October 2019 which was prepared by the investigation officer for the Warrant Review:

> (a)     the investigation officer had made several calls to the Accused Person at his last-known mobile telephone number but the number was no longer active;

> (b)     the investigation officer checked on the last-known address of the Accused Person and was told by the property owner that the Accused Person was not staying there;

> (c)     the passport of the Accused Person was in the custody of the chief investigation officer;

> (d)     screening with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority disclosed that the Accused Person was still in Singapore; and

> (e)     the Accused Person was placed on the Police Gazette as a wanted person.

5       The Accused Person remains at large to date.

## The mentions for the surety to show cause

#### The 1st mention on 14 October 2019

6       At the 1st mention, the surety was invited to show cause by telling the court what he had done to ensure the attendance of the Accused Person in court and the steps that he had taken to look for the Accused Person after the Accused Person went missing.

7       The surety told the court that he knew that the Accused Person had gone missing some time ago and he had filed a police report on 29 July 2019. The surety then requested for time to locate the Accused Person as he had purportedly received news that the Accused Person was seen in the vicinity of Boon Lay.

8       I acceded to the surety’s request and fixed a further mention in District Court 26 on 12 November 2019 at 2:30 pm.

#### The 2nd mention on 12 November 2019

9       The surety failed to turn up in District Court 26 for the 2nd mention.

10     At 4:10 pm, I forfeited the full amount of the Bond.

11     I ordered $5,000 to be recovered from the monetary security and ordered the balance of $15,000 to be paid in full a month later, _ie._ 12 December 2019.

#### The 3rd mention (ad hoc) on 30 December 2019

12     On 30 December 2019, the surety showed up unannounced at District Court 4A of the State Courts Towers and requested a mention to address the court. The 3rd mention was held forthwith for him to do so.

13     The surety told the court that he did not turn up for the mention on 12 November 2019 as he had to rush to the hospital to attend to a relative. The surety did not furnish any further details and he informed the court that he did not have any supporting documents with him.

14     I gave the surety some time to put together the supporting documents and fixed a further mention on 10 January 2020 at 2:30 pm for the surety to make further submissions.

#### The 4th mention on 10 January 2020

15     The surety failed to turn up in District Court 4A for the 4th mention.

16     At about 3:15 pm, I affirmed my order of 12 November 2019 for the full amount of the Bond to be forfeited.

#### The 5th mention (ad hoc) on 15 January 2020

17     On 15 January 2020, the surety again turned up unannounced at District Court 4A and asked for a mention to address the court. A mention was held forthwith for him to do so.

18     I called on the surety to explain his failure to turn up for the 4th mention and he replied in a terse and indignant tone that he did not have any documents to show that he had attended to a medical emergency on 12 November 2019, _ie._ the date of the 2nd mention.

19     The surety was also given a further opportunity to show cause or mitigate in relation to the Bond. The surety started mitigating.

20     In his mitigation, the surety told the court that he had financial difficulties and asked the court to allow instalments for the payment of the balance of the Bond, _ie._ $15,000. When I asked the surety for more details of his financial difficulties and for his proposal for an instalment plan, the surety had nothing to say.

21     I affirmed my earlier order for the Bond to be forfeited in full and did not offer any instalment plan to the surety as such an instalment plan would not have been meaningful given the lack of information on his financial position.

22     On 28 January 2020, the surety filed an appeal against my forfeiture order.

## The law

23     The relevant legislation on the duties of sureties and the procedure for the forfeiture of a bond can be found in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012):

> **Duties of surety**

> **104.** –(1) A surety must –

>> (a)    ensure that the released person surrenders to custody, or makes himself available for investigations or attends court on the day and at the time and place appointed for him to do so;

>> (b)    keep in daily communication with the released person and lodge a police report within 24 hours of losing contact with him; and

>> (c)    ensure that the released person is within Singapore unless the released person has been permitted by the police officer referred to in section 92 or 93 (as the case may be) or the court to leave Singapore.

> **Procedure for forfeiture of bond without sureties**

> **107A.** –(1) This section provides for the forfeiture of the following bonds:

>> (a)    a bond with one or more sureties; …

> (2)    If it is proved to a court’s satisfaction that –

>> (a)    the released person for whose appearance a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(a) was executed has, without reasonable excused, failed to comply with any duty imposed on the released person to surrender to custody, to be made available for investigations, or to attend court on the day and at the time and place appointed for the released person to do so; …

> the court –

>> (d) must record the basis of such proof;

>> (e)    must forfeit the bond, as far as it relates to the relevant person;

>> (f)    may summon before the court each person bound by the bond;

>> (g)    may call upon each surety bound by the bond to explain why the bond, as far as it relates to that surety, should not be forfeited; and

>> (h)    may call upon the relevant person to pay a sum, being the whole or any part of the amount of the bond, or to explain why the relevant person should not pay that sum.

> (3)    If the explanation given by a surety is inadequate, and it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that –

>> (a)    in relation to a bond mentioned in subsection (1)(a), the surety is in breach of any of the surety’s duties mentioned in section 104; …

> the court –

>> (d)    must record the basis of such proof; and

>> (e)    may, having regard to all the circumstances of the case –

>>> (i)    must record the basis of such proof; and

>>> (ii)   forfeit the whole or any part of the amount of the bond, as far as it relates to the surety; and

>>> (iii)   order the surety to pay the amount forfeited.

24     In _Cher Ting Ting v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 13</span> (“**_Cher’s_** **case**”) at \[19\]-\[20\], Chan Seng Onn J explained the nature of a surety’s duties as follows:

> 19    Courts in Singapore and England have taken pains to underscore the cardinal importance of sureties’ obligations. It is therefore unsurprising that consequences of significant gravity potentially attach to any breach of such obligations. As Yong Pung How CJ observed in _Ram Mahtani_ at \[4\], “\[i\]t has often been emphasised by the courts that the obligation which comes with standing bail for an accused is not merely a moral one, but _has serious legal consequences attached with it_. The bailor undertakes real risks, when an accused fails to surrender to his bail.” \[emphasis added\]. Similarly, in _R v York Crown Court, ex parte Coleman and How_ (1988) 86 Cr App R 151 (“_Coleman_”), May LJ held as follows (at 156–157):

>> … The standard in these bail cases has been shown by the authorities to be a heavy one. I respectfully agree, bearing in mind, in particular, the serious nature of the obligation which is undertaken by sureties in these cases. It is indeed, as has been said in one of the authorities, _one of the foundations of the proper administration of criminal justice_. It should not be thought that it is otherwise than very difficult for a surety to escape the basic obligation of his recognizance willingly undertaken.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> 20    Indeed, the importance of sureties’ obligations has received parliamentary affirmation. In reply to a question by Member of Parliament Mr Lim Biow Chuan on the duties imposed on sureties during the debate on the Criminal Procedure Code Bill, Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam provided the following response (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (19 May 2010) vol 87 at cols 560–561):

>> Insofar as the duties of the sureties in the Bill are concerned, we do not think they are too onerous. A surety has to maintain daily contact with the offender. It is also not unreasonable to require the surety to take steps to ensure that the offender does not leave the country, for instance, by taking custody of the offender’s travel documents. Ultimately, the Courts still retain the discretion to take into account the totality of the facts in determining whether to forfeit the whole or any part of the bond. But, people must also understand that _taking on the duties of a surety can have consequences and they must be aware of those consequences before they voluntarily become sureties_.

>> \[emphasis added\]

25     Chan J went on to set out the following two-stage analysis for the forfeiture of a bond:[^1]

>   
| 

First stage:

 | 

whether the surety has shown sufficient cause for the non-forfeiture of the bond amount.

 |
| 

Second stage:

 | 

if the court finds that the surety has failed to show sufficient cause, the court will determine, in the exercise of it discretion, the extent to which the bond is to be forfeited.

 |

  
  

26     Chan J gave further guidance on how the first stage of the two-stage analysis was to be undertaken at \[27\]-\[36\] of _Cher’s_ case:

> 27    In my view, while it is certainly correct that the court should consider the circumstances of the case in determining whether the surety has shown sufficient cause against forfeiture,… it will nevertheless assist if the core concept behind the somewhat Delphic phrase “sufficient cause” is identified and brought into the open.

> (1)    Reasonable due diligence

> 28    I take the view that the key consideration in determining the existence of sufficient cause is whether the surety is able to show that he _exercised reasonable due diligence in the discharge of his duties as surety_. In _Royaya bte Abdullah & Anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 MLJ 670</span> (“_Royaya_”), the court discussed the notion of sufficient cause at \[33\] in a passage which also appears in _Tan & Mohan_ at paras 2305–2350:

>> …there cannot be sufficient cause if the surety never took the trouble to ensure that the accused would appear on the date stipulated in court. The surety is not required to do what is superhuman; but at the least _he must have been diligent in undertaking his obligations_. _He must have made diligent attempts to remind the accused of the date of appearance and seek an assurance from him that he would be appearing._

> \[emphasis added\]

> …

> (2)    General principles concerning sufficient cause

> 34    It is uncontroversial that the surety bears the burden of satisfying the court that sufficient cause exists such that forfeiture should not take place. It is for the surety to lay before the court evidence of want of culpability: see _Ling Yew Huat_.

> …

> 36    Without attempting to be prescriptive or exhaustive, the following general and non-categorical propositions can, in my view, be gleaned from the case law:

>> (a)    Mere reliance on faith alone that the accused will show up for court hearings, without more, is not sufficient for a surety to discharge the onerous duty of ensuring the accused’s attendance in court: see _Mahtani_at \[6\].

>> (b)    A surety’s duties are personal to the surety. When he chooses to delegate those duties to another person, he runs the risk of being in breach of his duties should the accused fail to attend court or should the person to whom he has delegated the responsibility fail to keep in daily communication with the accused. It is not open to the surety to say that he has delegated the duty to another: see _Public Prosecutor v An Wei_<span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 182</span> (“_An Wei_”) at \[19\].

>> (c)    When the accused goes missing, the making of a police report by the surety, without more, will not be sufficient to excuse the surety. Taken alone, this does not provide sufficient cause: see _Mahtani_ at \[7\] and _Public Prosecutor v Ho Boon Lim_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 90</span> (“_Ho Boon Lim_”) at \[17\]. In this regard, I also note that under s 104(1)(_b_) of the CPC, it is a statutory duty of the surety to lodge a police report within 24 hours of losing contact with the accused.

>> (d)    When the accused goes missing, passively waiting and hoping for the accused to return does not amount to compliance with a surety’s obligations: see _Public Prosecutor v Pililis Georgios_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 142</span> at \[10\] and \[12\]. It is relevant to consider whether the surety expended effort to look for the accused after the accused has gone missing: see _Mahtani_ at \[7\]; _Ho Boon Lim_ at \[16\]; and _Public Prosecutor v Rahilah Binte Kifley_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 210</span> at \[11\].

>> (e)    Where the accused is travelling, a surety’s omission to obtain from the accused details that would allow the surety to contact or locate him is demonstrative of negligence on the part of the surety: see _Public Prosecutor v Chou Tai Chuan & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1988\] 1 MLJ 511</span> and _Mahtani_ at \[6\].

>> (f)    If the surety turns a blind eye toward suspicious circumstances that indicate that the accused had the intention to abscond, the surety will have failed to exercise due diligence: see _Public Prosecutor v Wang Choong Tsuey_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 212</span> (“_Wang Choong Tsuey_”) at \[21\]. In _Wang Choong Tsuey_, the surety was aware that the accused had left Singapore, despite the accused’s claims that he was ill and unfit to attend court (at \[16\]). She also knew that the accused was prohibited by the conditions of bail from leaving Singapore without the permission of the court, and that he had not sought to obtain such permission (at \[20\]). The court found at \[21\] that, in light of the dubious circumstances, the surety should have known that something was amiss, and that by turning a blind eye to these circumstances and allowing the accused to leave the country, she had failed to exercise due diligence to secure the appearance of the accused in court. Thus, the court held at \[24\] that the surety failed to show the existence of sufficient cause against forfeiture.

>> (g)    It may be relevant for the court’s consideration that the surety had taken sufficient steps on previous occasions to ensure the accused’s attendance in court and the accused had so attended: _Ramlee & Anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 1 MLJ 42</span> (“_Ramlee_”). However – and this is an important qualification – it would go too far to say that such circumstances, taken alone, provide sufficient cause: see _Loh Kim Chiang_at \[26\].

>> …

## Court’s decision

27     Despite the numerous opportunities that were given to the surety in the present case, he had failed to provide any meaningful or justiciable grounds for the court to consider in deciding whether there was sufficient cause not to forfeit the Bond, for instance, whether the surety had communicated with the Accused Person daily, reminded the Accused Person to attend court and obtained the Accused Person’s assurance that he would attend court, _etc._

28     The surety also failed to show any steps that he had taken to try to locate the Accused Person or to procure the surrender of the Accused Person after the Accused Person went missing.

29     The surety’s attitude throughout the entire show-cause exercise was flippant and callous. His failure to turn up twice for the 2nd mention on 12 November 2019 and the 4th mention on 10 January 2020, without good and substantiated reason, only to show up unannounced and much later (on 30 December 2019 and 15 January 2020, respectively) to request to address the court, demonstrated his disregard for court orders and court proceedings.

30     Even during the final stages of the 5th mention, when I was prepared to consider the surety’s request for an instalment plan for the payment of the balance of the Bond, the surety declined to offer any information to assist the court. This suggested that the surety was not serious about his request.

31     In totality, I found that no cause had been shown as to why the Bond should not be forfeited. I also found a remarkable lack of remorse and contrition on the part of the surety throughout the entire show-cause exercise from the first mention on 14 October 2019 until the final mention on 15 January 2020.

32     In the circumstances, I affirmed my order of 12 November 2019 for the Bond to be forfeited in full.
