Criminal Law and Sentencing – Offences – Criminal Breach of Trust Carrying on Business of Money-Changer without a Valid Licence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9597/2020/01.\]

12 August 2020

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Background

1       The accused, Ng Ah Ghoon, a 64 year-old Singaporean female, initially claimed trial to 26 charges. 25 charges were for criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) while the 26th charge was for carrying on the business of a money-changer without a valid licence under s 5 of the Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Act (Cap 187, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MCRBA”). On the 19th day of the trial, after the Prosecution had called its last witness (PW29) and was about to close its case, the learned Defence Counsel, Mr Steven Lam, informed the court that his client now wished to plead guilty to the charges. The case was then adjourned to the next day for the parties to do the necessary preparation for the accused to enter her guilty plea.

2       On 9 June 2020, the accused pleaded guilty to seven CBT charges under s 406 of the PC (“the CBT charges”) and one charge of carrying on the business of a money-changer without a valid licence under s 5 of the MCRBA (“unlicensed money-changer charge”). She consented to the remaining 18 charges under s 406 of the PC to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). On 30 June 2020, I sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 in default four weeks’ imprisonment. I also allowed her application to defer commencing her sentence until 11 August 2020.

3       On 7 July 2020, the accused being dissatisfied with her sentence, appealed against my decision. She has since been granted bail pending appeal.

4       I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The charges

### The proceeded charges

5       The CBT charges that the accused faced were all similarly framed except for the specific particulars relating to the offence periods, names of the victims and amounts misappropriated. As such, I have only reproduced the first CBT charge that the accused pleaded guilty to below. For ease of reference, I have also set out the pertinent details of all seven proceeded CBT charges in a table below.

> (a)     First CBT charge in DAC-929640-2017 read as follows:

>> 1st Charge (amended)

>> You, are charged that you, on or about **_30 January 2015 to 10 February 2015_**, in Singapore, being entrusted by **_Ong Siew Tee_** with property, to wit, cash amounting to **_$40,000_** for the purposes of changing into foreign currencies, did dishonestly misappropriate that property, and you have committed an offence punishable under Section 406 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

>> \[emphasis added in italics and bold\]

> (b)     The specific particulars relating to the seven proceeded CBT charges were as follows:

## Statement of facts

8       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts (“SOF”) without qualification:

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

> 1.    The accused is Ng Ah Ghoon, a 64-year-old female Singaporean bearing NRIC no. XXX. At the material time, she was working as a sales merchandiser. Her areas of deployment included NTUC Fairprice at Tampines Mall and Mustafa Centre.

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORTS**

> 2.    On 26 February 2015 at about 10.48 p.m., the accused lodged a First Information Report (F/20150226/2203) at the Sengkang Neighbourhood Police Centre alleging that she had given “Jenny Tan” a sum of S$61,000 belonging to herself and her family members to change into foreign currencies, and that “Jenny Tan” had become uncontactable.

> 3.    Shortly after, about twenty police reports were lodged against the accused by different victims, alleging that they had given sums of money to the accused for the purpose of changing the money to various foreign currencies, which the accused had failed to fulfil.

> **BACKGROUND**

> 4.    Sometime around the end of 2013, the accused told the victims, her fellow sales merchandisers and/or promoters, that she was able to help them change their Singapore currency to a foreign currency at rates which were 10-20% better than the market rates. However, she told them that it would take about 10 to 14 days for her to give them the promised foreign currency. The victims thus began giving the accused sums of Singapore dollars to be exchanged into various foreign currencies. Over time, the accused received larger and larger sums of Singapore currency for the purpose of changing into foreign currencies as the victims changed larger amounts, and as more people started handing monies to the accused for the purpose of foreign exchange. The accused recorded these transactions in a notebook.

> 5.    In the lead-up to Chinese New Year in 2015, which was in mid- to end-February 2015, the victims gave the accused larger sums to change to foreign currencies due to the favourable exchange rates offered by the accused. Sometime on or after 13 February 2015, the accused began defaulting on transactions and failed to give the victims their foreign currencies within the stipulated time period. At the time, the accused had been entrusted with at least $444,760 from 25 different victims. She had dishonestly misappropriated the monies by using subsequent collections to fulfil the earlier money-changing transactions, as well as using the monies for her own purposes.

> 6.    When the victims asked the accused for their promised foreign currencies, the accused told some of the victims that she had given the Singapore currencies belonging to the witnesses to “Jenny Tan” for the purpose of making the foreign currency exchange. However, the accused claimed that “Jenny Tan” had disappeared with the victims’ monies. The accused lodged a police report concerning “Jenny Tan” on 26 February 2015 as indicated in paragraph 2 above.

> 7.    During police investigations, the accused gave multiple statements to the police maintaining her claim that she had given the Singapore currencies she had collected from the victims to “Jenny Tan” for the purpose of foreign currency exchange. She claimed that she acted solely as an intermediary by handing all the Singapore currencies she had received from the victims to “Jenny Tan” in exchange for the requisite foreign currencies, which she then returned to the victims. In particular, the accused stated that she contacted “Jenny Tan” at mobile number XXX.

> 8.    In reality, “Jenny Tan” was a fictitious person made up by the accused.

> 9.    Investigations revealed that the mobile number 9002 1021 was utilized by Chu Sor Cheng (“**Chu**”), a 60-year-old female Singaporean, throughout the material period. Chu was unknown to the accused and not related to the money-changing transactions. Chu first heard about the name “Jenny Tan” and the money-changing transactions when she received a call from mobile number XXX sometime in the morning on 25 February 2015. Thereafter, Chu received multiple calls from the same number as well as from other numbers unknown to her asking her about “Jenny Tan” and demanding the return of their monies. Concerned, Chu lodged a police report. The user of XXX continued to call Chu frequently, asking for the return of the monies, contacting her even up until 7 May 2015. The mobile number XXX was established to belong the accused.

> 10.    Further, investigations revealed that in the period of about June to December 2014, the accused had gone to Kokila Trading & Moneychanger located at Bedok Central multiple times into order to exchange Singapore currency into foreign currencies. To avoid having her personal particulars noted down pursuant to the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s requirements that any money-changing transaction above S$5,000 would have to be recorded, the accused changed less than S$5,000 for each transaction. In February 2015, the owner Namachivayam Rajamohan, having noted that the accused had not frequented his business since December 2014, called the accused to ask whether she would be returning.

> **FACTS RELATING TO THE 1** st **CHARGE (DAC-92960-2017)**

> 11.    The victim is Ong Siew Tee (“**Penny**”), a 59-year-old female Singaporean. At the material time, she was working as a sales merchandiser deployed at NTUC Fairprice located in Bedok.

> 12.    Penny first started changing money with the accused in 2014 and changed money with the accused weekly. The accused offered to help Penny change currencies at an exchange rate 10-20% more favourable than the market rate by claiming that she had an arrangement with an Indian person, who was a moneychanger. The accused told Penny that she could give Penny the foreign currency as promised within 10 to 14 days. Penny would usually meet the accused at the McDonalds located at Tampines Mall for the moneychanging transactions. Over time, Penny entrusted the accused with larger sums of money for the money-changing transactions as the accused was able to give her the promised foreign currencies within the stipulated due date.

> 13.    In relation to the following transactions, Penny had entrusted the accused with the following sums for the purpose of changing her Singapore currency into foreign currencies, which the accused had failed to carry out:

> 56.    The above transactions were recorded in both the accused’s notebook and Hui Zhen’s own notebook.

> 57.    When Hui Zhen asked the accused to account for her monies after the stipulated deadline had passed, the accused told her that her that her neighbour had run away with the monies. In fact, the accused had dishonestly misappropriated the sum of S$61,000.

> 58.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused, on or about 1 January 2015 to 10 February 2015, being entrusted by Hui Zhen with at least S$61,000 for the purpose of changing the monies into foreign currencies, did dishonestly misappropriate the monies and has committed an offence punishable under section 406 of the Penal Code.

> 59.    To date, no restitution has been made.

> **FACTS RELATING TO THE 26** th **CHARGE (MAC-907471-2017)**

> 60.    Between 2013 and February 2015, the accused offered to buy Singapore dollars from the witnesses in the table below and to sell foreign currencies to them. The accused offered foreign exchange rates which were 10-20% better than those offered in the market to the witnesses. This meant that the witness would obtain more foreign currency for their Singapore dollar if they were to transact with the accused compared to other moneychangers.

> 61.    The accused imposed a condition that the promised foreign currency would only be given to the witnesses after a stipulated due date of 10 to 14 days. This would enable the accused to rollover the funds by using current collections for herself and then use any subsequent collections to fulfil the earlier transactions when the stipulated date was due for the earlier transactions.

> 62.    The accused also imposed a condition requiring the witnesses to change at least S$1,000 to a foreign currency before she agreed to the transaction.

> 63.    As news of the accused’s favourable exchange rates spread, more and more witnesses flocked to the accused to do their foreign currency exchange. It also resulted in the witnesses transacting more frequently and in larger sums with the accused over time. Until about 13 February 2015, the accused fulfilled all the money-changing transactions with the witnesses.

> 64.    There were two main groups of witnesses who handed monies to the accused for the money-changing transactions:

> a.    The sales promoters and merchandisers who were working at Tampines Mall at the material time (“the TM group”); and

> b.    The sales promoters and merchandisers who were working at Mustafa Centre at the material time (“the MC group”).

> 65.    Witnesses belonging to the TM group would regularly gather at the McDonalds located within Tampines Mall at around 8 to 8.30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays to hand the accused their Singapore dollars in order to change into their desired foreign currencies as well as to receive the promised foreign currencies from the accused. Alternatively, they met the accused at the pantry located within the NTUC Fairprice at Tampines Mall.

> 66.    Witnesses belonging to the MC group would regularly gather at the toilets at Mustafa Centre to meet the accused to hand the accused their Singapore dollars in order to change into their desired foreign currencies as well as to receive the promised foreign currencies from the accused.

> 67.    There were also witnesses who belonged to neither group who regularly met the accused at the void deck of her HDB block in Rivervale in order to carry out the moneychanging transactions.

> 68.    The accused kept a record of all the money-changing transactions with the witnesses in her notebook. She would the name of the witness, the date on which the Singapore dollars she received from the witness, the amount of Singapore dollars she received, the foreign currency desired by the witness, the exchange rate she promised to the witness, as well as the stipulated date on which she expected to give the witness the promised foreign currencies. During investigations, a notebook containing most of her collections for the moneychanging transactions between 31 December 2014 and 13 February 2015 was obtained.

> 69.    The table below summarises the money-changing transactions between the accused and the witnesses:

> 70.    At the material time, the accused did not possess a valid money-changer’s licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

> 71.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused, between 2013 and February 2015, did carry on a money-changing business when she was not in possession of a valid money-changer’s licence, to wit, by collecting Singapore currency from the aforementioned witnesses and getting the said Singapore currency changed into various foreign currencies, and has thereby contravened section 5(1) of the Money-Changing and Remittance Business Act, which is an offence punishable under section 5(2) of the said Act.

> **CONCLUSION**

## Antecedents

9       The accused had no antecedents.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

10     The Prosecution urged the court to impose a global sentence of at least 46 months’ imprisonment in respect of the CBT charges and a fine of at least $10,000 in respect of the unlicensed money-changer charge. The breakdown of the Prosecution’s proposed individual sentences is as follows with the sentences where the Prosecution proposed to run consecutively highlighted in bold:

11     The Prosecution highlighted the following factors for the court’s consideration:

> (a)     General deterrence was the predominant sentencing consideration where the offences involved multiple offences: _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25\]. In the present case, the accused had misappropriated money from no less than 25 victims.

> (b)     Significant harm was caused. The accused misappropriated a total amount of $444,760 and made minimal restitution of $6,100.

> (c)     The accused’s actions were premeditated which was an aggravating factor. She had devised an elaborate scheme to offer foreign currency exchange at rates 10 to 20% higher than the market rates so as to attract people to change money through her. She lied to her victims that she could get favourable rates from her acquaintance. She was in fact covering her losses by fulfilling the initial transactions with the funds she collected from the subsequent transactions. By using this method of “Rob Peter to pay Paul”, the accused appeared to be fulfilling her obligations to the victims, thereby earning their trust and avoiding detection. This in turn led to the victims increasing their volume of transactions and enabled the accused to collect at least $444,760 from at least 25 different victims within a short span of two weeks giving rise to no less than 25 offences.

> (d)     The accused attempted to evade detection by claiming that she had given all the moneys to one “Jenny Tan” who was a fictitious person. She even lodged a false police report alleging that she too was a victim and maintained her false claim during police investigations. She also implicated an innocent stranger, Chu Sor Cheng (“Chu”), by giving Chu’s telephone number to the police and the victims which led to many people calling Chu to ask for their moneys and scared Chu into lodging a police report herself. The accused also continued to call Chu up until May 2015 to keep up with her pretence.

> (e)     The accused demonstrated a lack of remorse in her subsequent conduct. She claimed trial despite overwhelming evidence that “Jenny Tan” did not exist. She only decided to plead guilty after 19 days of trial where 29 Prosecution witnesses were called and subjected to lengthy cross-examination. The accused also failed to make further restitution aside from the initial minimal amount of $6,100.

> (f)     The accused’s culpability was enhanced by the 18 TIC charges: _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[38\].

> (g)     The accused carried on her unlicensed money-changing business in a deliberate and flagrant manner over more than a year (2013 to February 2015).

12     The Prosecution also sought for compensation orders against the accused pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) for the reasons that a civil suit would be an inadequate and impractical remedy for the victims and that the quantum of losses caused by the accused was readily and easily ascertainable

## Mitigation plea

13     In respect of the CBT charges, the Defence submitted for a global sentence of no more than three years’ imprisonment and without any compensation order. In respect of the unlicensed money-changer charge, the Defence submitted for four weeks’ imprisonment. It urged the court to consider the following circumstances and exercised leniency in sentencing:

> (a)     The accused, aged 64, lived with her husband and their 34 year-old son. Her highest educational level was Primary 5. At the time of the offences, she was working as a merchandiser at Tampines Mall and Mustafa earning a monthly salary of about $2000. Since 2019, she had been working as a factory packer.

> (b)     Around 2014, the accused told her colleagues at Tampines Mall and Mustafa that she would be able to help them change their Singapore dollars to foreign currencies at rates that were 10 to 20% better than the rates offered by licensed money-changers around Singapore and that the minimum amount for the transaction was S$1000. Up until 13 February 2015, the accused had been able to hand the foreign currencies to her colleagues within the agreed timelines of about 14 days. On or about 13 February 2015, the accused did not hand her colleagues their foreign currencies within the stipulated time periods and at that time she had collected about $444,760 from 25 of them.

> (c)     She had no antecedents.

> (d)     She had pleaded guilty before the full trial was completed and had thus saved some of the Court and the State’s resources.

> (e)     With her limited means, she had made partial restitution of $6,100 at an early stage, before the charges were pressed against her. Her pro-active actions demonstrated her remorse.

14     In order to arrive at its proposed global sentence of no more than 3 years’ imprisonment, the Defence submitted specifically for 13 months’ imprisonment each to be imposed in respect of the 11th and 22nd charges (involving $81,000 and $61,000) and 4 weeks’ imprisonment to be imposed in respect of the unlicensed money-changer charge. It also submitted that only these three sentences should run consecutively. It further proposed an uplift of six months’ imprisonment to bring the total sentence to 36 months’ imprisonment in view of the aggravating factors present, that there were 25 victims, the total sum involved was $444,760 and that the accused had no means to make any compensation[^1]. The Defence did not submit on how the uplift of six months’ imprisonment could be reflected in the sentences.

15     For ease of reference, I have tabulated below the respective sentencing positions of both the Defence[^2] and the Prosecution with the parties’ proposed consecutive sentences highlighted in bold. It would be noted that based on its submissions as set out at \[14\] above, the Defence had miscalculated its desired global sentence because its recommendations merely led to a total sentence of 32 months’ and four weeks’ imprisonment and not its suggested global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment.

## My decision

### CBT charges

#### Prescribed punishment

16     The punishment prescribed for a CBT offence under s 406 of the PC is an imprisonment term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.

#### Sentencing principles and considerations

17     The relevant sentencing principles for CBT offences would be that of retribution and deterrence as discussed in the Malaysian case of _PP v Mohammad Abdullah Ang Swee Kang_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] 2 MLJ 368</span>. The retributive factor was to show the court’s disapproval or abhorrence on behalf of the community of such a criminal conduct and the deterrent factor was to discourage likely offenders. Deterrence would also be the dominant sentencing principle where the offences involved multiple victims such as in the present case (see _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 814</span> at \[25\]).

18     In respect of CBT offences, the three-judge High Court in the widely known City Harvest Church case in _PP v Lam Leng Hung and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> (“_CHC Case_”) held at \[367\] that the starting consideration ought to be the value of the property misappropriated. In _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_ \[1990\] 2 SLR (R) 361), Chan Sek Keong J noted at \[18\] that in an offence like CBT, “it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more server the sentence of the court”. _In Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> which was a case involving an offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated that the primary sentencing yardstick would often be the value of the property involved.

19     The High Court in the _CHC Case_ also emphasized at \[368\] that while the value of the property misappropriated ought to be the starting point when deciding the appropriate sentence, the court’s discretion is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the quantum in question. It further reiterated that sentences for CBT offences do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the amounts involved. It held that aside from considering the value of the property in question, the appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived after also having regard to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case.

20     The _CHC Case_ held that the following non-exhaustive factors are relevant to the offence of CBT (see \[369\]): (a) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender; (b) the period over which the act was perpetrated; (c) the use to which the money or property that was dishonestly taken was put; (d) the effect on the victim; and the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence.

21     For CBT offences, the court should also draw guidance from the High Court case of _PP v Teo Cheng Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 129</span> (“_Teo Cheng Kiat_”) where Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he was then) held at \[26\] that in a case where there were multiple charges, it was of no real practical significance what the individual sentences ought to be. In _Teo Cheng Kiat_, the offender pleaded guilty to ten charges of CBT as a servant under s 408 and he also consented to TIC 15 similar charges and one non PC charge for the purpose of sentencing. The ten proceeded charges in _Teo Cheng Kiat_ involved sums of money ranging from S$988,000 to $6 million. JC Tay did not try to tailor each sentence according to the amounts misappropriated; instead he imposed consecutive imprisonment sentences to arrive at an appropriate aggregate term of imprisonment. In other words, where there are multiple charges, like the present case, aside from considering the individual sentences, it is the cumulative sentence that takes a greater practical significance. The appropriate aggregate sentence must be one which reflects the total amount of money misappropriated in the proceeded charges and charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing and it must also take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors.

#### Aggravating factors and mitigating factors

22     In sentencing the accused, I took into account the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     I agreed with the Prosecution that significant harm was caused to the victims because the accused had misappropriated a total amount of $444,760 which was not a small sum by any means. The accused also failed to make any meaningful restitution. Her restitution of $6,100 which was a mere 1.37 per cent of the total amount misappropriated was minimal.

> (b)     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s actions were premeditated. In order to entice her fellow sales merchandisers and promotors to exchange money through her, she had deceived them into believing that she was able to obtain foreign currencies at far better rates than what they could get in the market. She was also careful to fulfil her initial obligations to hand over the foreign currencies to her victims thereby building up their trust in her so that they would continue to transact with her and at the same time, she could avoid detection. The table at \[69\] of the SOF at pages 18 and 19 above reflected the extent of her elaborate scheme. Between 31 December 2014 and 13 February 2015, the 25 victims transacted a massive sum of $1,256,880 with the accused out of which she failed to account for $444,760. It would be noted that the accused had collected the misappropriated sum of $444,760 easily from the 25 victims over a mere two weeks. It was clear from the volume of the transactions which were amassed over a short period of time as well as the high number of victims involved that the accused had committed the offences with planning and deliberation.

> (c)     I also agreed with the Prosecution that it was aggravating that the accused, instead of coming clean when her game was up, chose to devise another elaborate scheme to conceal her crimes. She intentionally sent the victims on a wild goose chase by falsely claiming that she had given their moneys to one “Jenny Tan” who had gone missing. To bolster her false claim, the accused even lodged a false police report alleging that she too was a victim because Jenny Tan had become uncontactable after taking $61,000 from her. The accused also wrongly implicated an innocent stranger by providing the stranger’s telephone number to the police and the victims which naturally led to numerous calls demanding for moneys being made to the innocent stranger. Eventually the harassed and worried innocent stranger was compelled to lodge a police report herself. In this regard, it would be noted that the accused kept up her pretence by calling the innocent stranger continually until May 2015.

> (d)     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s subsequent conduct of claiming trial and persisting with the fictitious defence that that it was Jenny Tan who was the real culprit demonstrated her lack of remorse. She only pleaded guilty after the Prosecution had called 29 witnesses including the 25 victims who had to suffer rigorous cross-examination in addition to their financial losses.

> (e)     As highlighted by the Prosecution, the accused also had 18 TIC charges the effect of which was to enhance the sentence to be imposed in respect of the proceeded charges particularly when they were similar in nature (see _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR (R ) 500</span> at \[38\]).

> (f)     During mitigation, upon the court’s query, the learned counsel, Mr Steven Lam, told the court that he was unable to obtain any instructions regarding what the accused did with the huge sum of money that she misappropriated. The accused was clearly not being candid or forthcoming by refusing to disclose or reveal how she had used the money up to the point of sentencing. In my view, this was an aggravating factor as it showed her lack of remorse, particularly when the restitution she had made was insignificant and the victims were looking to her for compensation.

23     In so far as the mitigating factors were concerned, the only mitigating factor was the accused’s guilty plea just before the case for the Defence was called. Although her guilty plea had come very late in the day, I gave it some weight, as there was some savings in resources. Aside from this, there were no other real mitigating factors. While I noted that the accused had no antecedents, this fact could hardly be regarded as a mitigating factor given the number of offences she had committed in the present case and the severity of the offences.

#### Sentencing precedents

24     In arriving at the individual and global sentences in the present case, I had also considered the sentencing precedents cited before me.

25     The Prosecution tendered a table of ten precedents. For ease of reference, I have tabulated below brief information about these cases and the respective sentences imposed by the court. It would be noted that with the exception of the offenders at serial number seven and ten, the rest of the offenders did not have any antecedents.

28     S 307(1) of the CPC stipulates that where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least two of those offences to run consecutively. In this regard, Sundaresh Menon CJ observed in _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> (“_Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam”_) at \[80(e)\] that the court would need to have regard to the totality of the criminal behaviour of the offender in considering which sentences should run consecutively. Further that the consideration of which sentences should run consecutively is likely a multi-factorial consideration in which the court assesses what would be a proportionate and adequate aggregate sentence having regard to the totality of the criminal behaviour of the accused person. Thereafter, the sentencing judge should then apply the totality principle to check against an excessive overall sentence (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam_ at \[81(h)\]).

29     On the facts of this case, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was necessary to order five of the seven proceeded CBT charges to run consecutively in order to reflect the accused’s overall culpability. In my view, the cumulative sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment (_ie_, three and a half years’ imprisonment) for the CBT charges was an appropriate and just sentence given the circumstances of this case.

#### Compensation orders

30     Under s 359 of the CPC, it is incumbent on the court to consider whether or not to make a compensation order and if it is of the view that such an order is appropriate, the court has a further duty make the order.

31     The accused claimed that she did not have the financial means to make any compensation and therefore the court should not make any such orders against her. In this regard, the law is clear that compensation orders are meant simply to provide redress to the victim and are not intended to punish the offender nor are they part of the sentence imposed (see _Soh Meiyun v PP_ \[2014\] 3 SLR (R) 323 at \[56\]). Compensation orders are essentially a shortcut to the remedy that a victim can obtain in a civil suit against the offender and are especially practical for victims who are impecunious. Since a compensation order is not a punishment, the court must be mindful that it should not be oppressive to the offender but it should be realistic in that the court must be satisfied that the accused either has the means or will have the means, to pay the compensation within a reasonable time (see _PP v Donohue Enilia_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 248</span> at \[26\]). .

32     In the present case, as it was not shown that the accused had the means or that she would have the means to make compensation to the victims, I declined to make any compensation orders.

### Unlicensed money-changer charge

#### Prescribed punishment

33     The punishment prescribed for an offence of carrying on business as a money-changer without a valid licence under s 5(2) of the MCRBA is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.

#### Sentencing principles

34     The MCRBA was repealed on 28 Jan 2020 and the accused was prosecuted under the old s 5 of the MCRBA for carrying on the business of a money-changer without a valid licence.

35     The MCRBA was enacted in 1979 for the purpose of regulating money-changers and remittance shops. Under s 7(1) of the MCRBA, a person who wished to obtain a money-changer’s licence must first apply to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) in such form and furnish such information as the MAS might require. Under s 7(4), the MAS in considering whether or not to grant a money-changer’s licence, might take into account factors such as the good character and financial condition of the applicant and if the public interest would be served by the granting of the licence. As money-changing businesses catered mainly to the man-in-the street, only persons who were found fit and proper to conduct money-changing business would be issued the licences in order to protect the interests of the small customers and ensure that these businesses were operated prudently and properly. In supervising these activities, the MAS was also focusing on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

36     Having regard to the above, general deterrence would therefore be the primary sentencing principle for offences under the MCRBA.

#### Aggravating and mitigating factors

37     I took into account the following aggravating factors. The accused committed the offence over a period of more than one year from 2013 to Feb 2015. The transactions were voluminous involving as many as 25 different customers. The total amount of money transacted was a huge sum of $1,256,880 collected over just two months between Jan and Feb 2015.

38     The only mitigating factor of limited weight was that the accused decided to plead guilty without going for a full trial.

#### Sentencing precedent

39     Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the relevant precedent would be _PP v Fazal Mohamed_ (see above at \[25\]) where a sentence of $10,000 fine with a default sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was imposed for a similar offence under s 5 of the MCRBA.

#### Sentence imposed

40     Having considered the above, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $10,000 in default four weeks’ imprisonment for the unlicensed money-changer charge. In this regard, the Defence had urged the court not to impose a fine but to impose a jail term of four weeks’ imprisonment instead because the accused was not able to pay any fine. Given that a fine was an appropriate sentence in this case, I was of the view that it should remain as such. The accused would still have the option of paying the fine should she be in a position to do so after she had served her imprisonment term for the CBT charges.

## Conclusion

41     All things considered, in my view, a global sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 in default four weeks’ imprisonment was a just and reasonable sentence in the present case and could not be said to be manifestly excessive.

42     The accused is presently on bail pending appeal and I have also ordered a stay on the payment of the fine.
