27 May 2019

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was tried on a charge of rioting with three others (the charge alleged that there was another unknown person) under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). After a 14-day trial, I acquitted the accused and the other three accused on the rioting charge. Against the accused, I framed a lesser charge under s 323 of the Penal Code, to which he pleaded guilty. The charge reads as follows:

> are charged that you, on the 7th day of September 2016 at about 3.44am, along Hastings Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Logeeswaaran a/l Shunmugam, by punching him on his face, swinging him down onto the road, dragging him on the road by his left hand, throwing him against the railings and kicking him, and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       In addition, the accused faced two charges under s 186 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for obstructing a police officer in the discharge of his duties. These two offences were committed on 8 April 2018 whilst he was on court bail. The prosecution proceeded on one charge and the other charge was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence with the consent of the accused.

3       The accused was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment on the s 323 charge and to the maximum fine of $500 on the s 186 charge. He has paid the fine. He has brought this appeal only against the six-month imprisonment term.

## Summary of facts

4       The accused was a floor manager at Sorgam Pub situated along Dalhouise Lane and Aashiyana club at nearby Dunlop Street. The backdrop to the charge is that the victim, Logeeswaaran a/l Shunmugam (‘Logeeswaaran’), went to the Sorgam Pub on the night of 6th September 2016 with three friends. The friends who were with him were Selvarajan a/l V Subramaniam (‘Selvarajan’), Punithan a/l Kanniappan (‘Punithan’) and Krishna Moorthy Anaye (‘Krishna’).

5       At about 2.45am on 7th September 2016, when Logeeswaaran and his three friends wanted to leave, they were prevented from bringing along their unfinished bottle of whiskey. This led to an argument between them and the staff of the pub. Amongst the four accused, only Pang Weng Khong Tony (‘B2-Tony’) was not present during the argument. The accused was initially present but stepped aside after B1-Haji Mohamed s/o Shaik Allauddin (‘B1-Haji’) and B4-Chandran s/o Thambusamy (‘B4-Chandran’) arrived. B1-Haji is the owner of both pubs. The accused and B4-Chandran were his employees.

6       At 3.08am, B1-Haji called for the police. After the police had arrived, the police informed B1-Haji that Logeeswaaran and his friends were asking if they could return to the pub and consume the liquor. B1-Haji then falsely informed the police that the liquor had already been consumed. The exchange which took place outside the pub in the presence of the police is captured in the police body wear camera (see P26 & P26T). At about 3.37am, the four victims left the scene in a taxi hailed by the police.

7       Shortly before 3.44am, all four of them returned in the same taxi. The taxi stopped just before the junction of Clive Street and Dalhouise Lane. Selvarajan and Krishna were the first to alight from the taxi. They alighted from the rear right passenger seat which is not captured in the Polcam footage. Thereafter, Punithan and Logeeswaaran alighted. The Polcam footage shows Punithan walking down Clive Street ahead of Logeeswaaran on the left hand side of the taxi.

8       On the evidence of the taxi driver, Ramanathan s/o Mennappan (‘Ramanathan’), Selvarajan and Krishna walked along the double yellow lines on the right of his taxi and crossed in front of his taxi. On his evidence, there were four to six persons about two car lengths ahead of his taxi at around the manhole at Clive Street before the stop line of Dalhouise Lane. This group of four to six persons included Selvarajan and Krishna. He said he did not look at the commotion throughout as he turned towards his rear passenger to collect the fare. He stated that when the commotion moved closer to his taxi, he drove off.

9       B2-Tony’s evidence on where he first saw the commotion was identical to Ramanathan’s. He marked the area with a blue circle in Photo P12. The Polcam footage also lends some support to Ramanathan and B2-Tony’s evidence that the initial incident was along Clive Street as it shows Logeeswaaran looking ahead in that direction.

10     Logeeswaaran, who is a Malaysian, did not return to give evidence. His statement (P44) which was recorded on 7 September 2016 was admitted as evidence. His statement was not helpful in determining what precisely happened at the junction of Clive Street and Dalhouise Lane. However, the Polcam footage does show that he (Logeeswaaran) stopped in his tracks near the junction shortly upon alighting from the taxi.

11     In his statement P28, B2-Tony stated that he saw a bald-headed man behaving in a funny manner. The bald-headed person was established to be Selvarajan. He stated he saw the accused, B1-Haji, and B4-Chandra, and decided to go forward. He stated that he has a habit of trying to stop fights as he does not want any problem for his acquaintances and friends. It was not in dispute that the accused, B1-Haji, and B4-Chandran are known to him. B2-Tony stated that he “immediately moved” in to try to prevent the accused and B4-Chandra from attacking Selvarajan and Krishna. However, he was unable to as the accused and B-4 had started to assault Selvarajan and Krishna. B2-Tony then intervened and the accused and B4-Chandran stopped. He stated that Selvarajan and Krishna walked away thereafter.

12     I found that both Selvarajan and Krishna were assaulted along Clive Street and the junction of Dalhouise Lane. However, on the evidence I was unable to determine the precise events prior to the assault. Further, there was no description of the nature of the assault in B2-Tony’s statement, and I was unable to determine the nature of the assault on Selvarajan by the accused. As regards Krishna, based on B4-Chandran’s statement, I found that B4-Chandran had slapped him on his left cheek.

13     The next two persons who were assaulted were Logeeswaaran and Punithan. I accepted the accused’s evidence that there was an exchange with Logeeswaaran where he asked Logeeswaaran why he came back and what he wanted. Logeeswaaran then retorted with a vulgarity. This led him to punch Logeeswaaran on the mouth. B4-Chandran who was walking close-by gave a blow to the back of Logeeswaaran’s head. Subsequently, the accused continued with the assault on Logeeswaaran as seen in the footage (see exh P25).

14     As a result of the assault by the accused, Logeeswaaran was conveyed in an ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. On examination, he was found to have suffered the following injuries:

> 1.     a small subcentimetre laceration on his nasal bridge;

> 2.     two missing front teeth from his upper jaw;

> 3.     one missing front tooth from his lower jaw;

> 4.     a 3cm laceration on his external lower lip;

> 5.     a 2cm laceration on his internal lower lip;

> G.     a 1 x 1 cm superficial abrasion over the back of his right elbow.

His lip lacerations were sutured.

## Antecedents

15     In August 2007, the accused was placed on 21 months’ probation for impersonating a public servant and one count of theft, with a charge of causing hurt taken into consideration. He breached the probation order and was sentenced to reformative training in March 2008.

16     In December 2007, he was sentenced to a fine of $1,800 and disqualified from driving for 12 months for taking a motor vehicle without consent, driving without a licence and insurance coverage.

17     In April 2008, he was sentenced to reformative training for an offence under the National Registration Act (Cap 201) relating to an identity card and another count of fraudulent possession of property.

18     In January 2013, he was fined $2,700 and disqualified from driving for two years for an offence of taking a motor vehicle without consent, driving without licence and insurance coverage.

19     In May 2013, he was fined $500 for using threatening or abusive language.

20     In April 2015, he was placed on record by the Registrar of Societies for being a member of an unlawful assembly.

## Mitigation

21     The accused is 28 years old. He is single. It was submitted that he is remorseful and the offence was committed on the spur of the moment when the victim had uttered a vulgarity.

22     Learned counsel associated himself with the submission of the prosecution for a sentence of at least one month’s imprisonment.

## Sentence

23     The maximum punishment for voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code is a term of two years imprisonment, or with fine up to $5,000, or with both.

24     Offences of hurt under s 323 cover a wide spectrum of behaviour and consequences. The sentence is governed primarily by an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, which in turn rests on the harm caused by the accused, together with his culpability.

25     The factors which are particularly relevant to harm are the extent and nature of the injuries and the degree of violence. Generally, the graver the injury, the more serious the offence.

26     Here, with respect to the harm suffered, the victim described it as follows in his statement (exh P44) at \[9\]:

> I realised that the 2 upper front tooth and one lower front tooth dropped as a result of the assault. My lips were torn. I was given stiches on my lips. I also suffered bodily pain and unable to move my right arm much. The doctor attended to me and I was discharged with 3 days medical leave.

The injuries were plainly severe. It resulted in three teeth being knocked completely out. It would obviously follow that these three missing teeth would have resulted in the victim having some difficulty to eat and drink until he sought dental treatment. Further, the lacerations on the lips were also severe as they had to be stitched.

27     The assault is also aggravated by the fact that it involved a series of acts. It started off with a punch at the mouth and progressed to swinging the victim down onto the road, dragging him on the road by his left hand, throwing him against the railings and ended with kicking him. It was plainly a violent attack. In my assessment, based on the harm and degree of violence, it would have fallen at the high end of a sentencing range of between six to 12 months imprisonment.

28     Turning now to culpability. The main issue here is whether the accused’s conduct is mitigated by his assertion that the victim uttered a vulgarity at him. Whilst I accepted that the vulgarity was deplorable and would have caused the accused to be aggrieved, such provocation must be considered low level provocation. In determining the reduction in the accused’s culpability, the context and proportionality are key considerations.

29     With respect to the context, the accused was a floor manager at the Sorgam pub. Part of his duties would have encompassed to keep order and to ensure that he does not end up becoming violent. He was aware of the incident outside the Sorgam pub before the victim and his friends returned to the scene. In fact, he had engaged with the victims for about 15 minutes during which vulgarities had been uttered. When the victims returned to the scene, the accused had at first assaulted the victim’s friend, Selvarajan. In this regard, I disbelieved the accused’s evidence that he was at Abbas Restaurant and did not assault Selvarajan. After assaulting Selvarajan, it was the accused who approached the victim and asked why he had returned to the scene and what he wanted, which then led to the victim retorting with the vulgarity. The accused did not stop after giving the heavy blow to the victim’s mouth. After the victim had turned and walked away, he followed him. The victim was then hit on the back of his head by B4-Chandran. Thereafter, the accused continued to escalate his violence on the victim. His act of swinging the victim down onto the road, dragging him on the road by his left hand, throwing him against the railings and kicking him involved a high degree of violence and were disproportionate to the provocation by the utterance of the vulgarity.

30     Whilst I agreed that I should give some weight to the low level provocation, I did not agree with the prosecution and defence that it should be to the extent of reducing the sentence to one month’s imprisonment.

31     As for the offender-specific aggravating factors, the accused had a similar antecedent under s 323 of the Penal Code taken into consideration in 2007. However, I noted the antecedent was about nine years ago when the accused was 18 years old. I therefore gave it minimal weight. Since then, the accused has not kept a clean record. In particular, he was fined for using threatening or abusive language in 2013, and was placed on record by the Registrar of Societies for being a member of an unlawful assembly in 2015. Whilst the latest two antecedents were not directly similar, they are relevant in showing a continuing disobedience of the law. In addition, the accused also had an offence of obstructing a police officer in the discharge of his duty under s 186 of the Penal Code taken into consideration. This offence was committed whilst he was on court bail.

32     As for the offender-specific mitigating factors I noted that the accused pleaded guilty after the charge was amended. However, the weight to be accorded must be assessed in light of the fact that the Polcam footage had captured the entirety of the assault on the victim. Accordingly, I gave minimal weight to his plea.

33     In conclusion, I found the sentencing objectives of retribution and both general and specific deterrence were relevant. Taking these sentencing objectives and balanced against the reduced culpability and the harm and degree of violence, I assessed the appropriate sentence to be six months’ imprisonment, which is at the lowest end of the sentencing range which I had deemed appropriate for the level of harm and violence.
