Civil Procedure – Mareva injunctions – Factors indicating real risk of dissipation of assets

25 March 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:

## Introduction

1       This is the plaintiff’s application for a Mareva injunction against the defendant pursuant to Order 29 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) to prevent the defendant from removing its assets out of Singapore or from disposing of them within Singapore. For the reasons set out in this judgment, I allow the plaintiff’s application.

2       The plaintiff and the defendant are companies involved in the food business. In 2017, they agreed to collaborate and to carry on a business of pork rib soup restaurant (colloquially known as _bak-kut teh_) located at 530 North Bridge Road #01-01 Singapore 188747 (the “Premises”). The plaintiff was the original sub-tenant of the Premises and when parties began negotiations in 2017, the plaintiff was operating a pork rib soup business at the Premises.[^1] The plaintiff was renting the Premises from which it had operated for close to two years.

3       The parties do not dispute that the broad terms of their collaboration are as follows:[^2]

> (a)     The defendant would operate the business at the Premises (“Business”);

> (b)     The plaintiff would pay the defendant the sum of $24,000. This sum reflected 40 percent of the deposit required to rent the Premises ($24,000 of the $60,000 rental deposit). The defendant would be responsible for the remaining 60 percent ($36,000 of the $60,000 rental deposit); and

> (c)     The plaintiff and the defendant would share in the profit and loss of the Business in the ratio of 40 percent to 60 percent.

4       It would appear that the defendant was incorporated in 2017 specifically to run the Business with the plaintiff. It is important to appreciate at the outset the nature of the commercial arrangements between the parties. Whilst parties disagreed on various matters, it is not disputed that the agreement reached by the parties was for the defendant to operate the Business at the Premises and both parties would share in the profit in the proportion of 60 percent to the defendant and 40 percent to the plaintiff. The Business therefore forms the substratum of the agreement between the parties. Essentially, the defendant was to operate the Business at the Premises from where the plaintiff had previously operated a similar business. The plaintiff was to take a share of 40 percent of the profit and loss. In other words, the plaintiff was to take a back seat whilst the defendant operated the Business.

5       On 14 June 2017, the defendant entered a two-year sublease for the Premises with J’wels Holdings Pte Ltd (“Landord”) (“Lease”) for the period from 1 November 2017 to 31 October 2019. The Lease provided that the defendant was to pay the equivalent of two months’ rental of $60,000 as deposit. The plaintiff agreed to contribute an amount equivalent to 40 percent of the rental deposit required under the Lease, which amounted to $24,000. Payment of the $24,000 was effected as follows. The plaintiff’s deposit in the sum of $60,000 which was previously paid to the Landlord under the plaintiff’s tenancy expiring on 31 October 2017 was retained by the Landlord and treated as deposit paid by the defendant under the Lease. In apportioning the parties’ respective share for the said deposit, the plaintiff then issued an invoice for $36,000, being the defendant’s 60 percent share of the said deposit, for which the defendant duly made payment.[^3]

6       The defendant started operating the Business out of the Premises in August 2017,[^4] first under the plaintiff’s earlier tenancy agreement, and subsequently under the Lease. The parties differ in their positions in regard to the question of whether the parties’ collaboration was profitable. The defendant says that business was tepid. The plaintiff’s case is that it did not know the financial status of the Business, as the defendant did not furnish accounts of the Business.[^5] One of the plaintiff’s claims in the action is for an account to be taken of the Business. It is not disputed that the defendant closed the Business and terminated the Lease in October 2020, without informing the plaintiff.

7       The plaintiff’s claims against the defendant are as follows:

> (a)     Refund of the sum of $24,000 paid as its contribution towards the rental deposit.

> (b)     Damages to be assessed or alternatively an order for an account to be taken in respect of its share of the profits.

8       The plaintiff’s case is based on a written agreement which it says the parties executed sometime between August 2017 and October 2017. Its claims are premised on the terms set out in that written agreement.

9       The plaintiff applied for a Mareva injunction to prevent the defendant from removing its assets out of Singapore or from disposing of them within Singapore. The plaintiff contends that with the defendant’s closure of the Business, coupled with the defendant’s failure to inform the plaintiff of the closure of the Business, there is a real risk of dissipation of the defendant’s remaining known assets of the Business. These assets would include the monies in its bank account, the equipment used in the Business, and the refund of the rental deposit under the Lease for which the plaintiff contributed $24,000.

## Issues

10     For the Court to exercise its discretion to grant a domestic Mareva injunction under O 29, the following elements are to be satisfied:

> (a)     there is a valid cause of action over which the court has jurisdiction;

> (b)     there is a good arguable case on the merits of the plaintiff’s claim;

> (c)     the defendant has assets within the jurisdiction; and

> (d)     there is a real risk that the defendant will dissipate his assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the court.

(_Singapore Civil Procedure 2020_, vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th ed, 2020) at para 29/1/58)

11     Out of the four elements above, the two key requirements would be a good arguable case and a risk of dissipation. In _Yves Charles Edgar Bouvier & Anor v Accent Delight International Ltd and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 558</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[36\] that a Mareva injunction would be granted where there is: (a) a good arguable case on the merits of the plaintiff’s claim; and (b) a real risk that the defendant will dissipate his assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the Court.

12     It is over these two requirements that the parties disagreed. In deciding whether to grant the plaintiff’s application for a Mareva injunction, the issues to be determined by me in this case are therefore firstly, whether the plaintiff has a good arguable case, and second, whether there is a risk that the defendant will dissipate its assets.

## Analysis and findings

### Good arguable case

13     The test to determine whether the plaintiff has a good arguable case is uncontroverted. The plaintiff in its written submissions referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision in _JTrust Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 159</span> (“_JTrust_”) at \[38\]. The Court of Appeal adopted the classic test in _Ninemia Maritime Corporation v Trave Schiffahrtgesellschaft mbH und Co KG_ \[1983\] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 600 and held that a good arguable case is one which is more than barely capable of serious argument, but not necessarily one which the judge considers would have a better than 50 percent chance of success.

14     I will begin the analysis of the question of whether the plaintiff has a good arguable case by examining the respective cases of the parties.

15     The plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the parties entered into a written agreement, which is undated but signed in late August 2017 or no later than end October 2017 by their respective representatives (“Agreement”). In consideration of entering into the Agreement, the plaintiff agreed to contribute an amount equivalent to 40 percent of the security deposit required under the Lease, which amounted to $24,000. Pursuant to clause 6 of the Agreement, the plaintiff and defendant agreed to share, in the proportion of 40 percent and 60 percent respectively, both the profit and loss of the Business.

16     Pursuant to clause 5 of the Agreement, amongst others, the defendant is required to submit to the plaintiff a complete set of accounts of the Business in the form as prescribed by the plaintiff in reasonable detail on a monthly basis. The plaintiff contends that defendant has failed to furnish the accounts since the date of the Agreement, thereby breaching clause 5 of the Agreement. The plaintiff says that the defendant has also failed to account and make payment to the plaintiff in respect of the plaintiff’s 40 percent entitlement to the profit of the Business, thereby breaching clause 6 of the Agreement. The plaintiff holds that by reason of the breaches, the plaintiff has suffered loss and damage. The plaintiff claims the return of the sum of $24,000 and an account of the profit of the Business. It should be noted that it is not disputed that the plaintiff notified the defendant of its intention to terminate the Agreement by way of a solicitor’s letter dated 2 March 2020.

17     The defendant’s pleaded case on the other hand is that whilst the parties had signed the Agreement, the defendant is not bound by it. Instead, an oral agreement made in June 2017 governs the relationship between the parties. Its defence is premised on the oral agreement. The defendant contends that the terms of the oral agreement between the parties are as follows:

> (a)     the defendant would operate the Business at the Premises;

> (b)     the plaintiff would pay the defendant a sum equivalent to 40 percent of the security deposit amounting to $24,000; and

> (c)     the plaintiff and the defendant would bear the loss and share in the profit of the Business in the proportion of 40 percent to the plaintiff and 60 percent to the defendant.

18     As seen, the terms of the oral agreement contended by the defendant are similar to that of the Agreement asserted by the plaintiff. As alluded to above, the parties in fact agree on the broad terms of their collaboration. The key difference in the parties’ respective positions is that the defendant contends that it is not legally obliged under the oral agreement to furnish to the plaintiff accounts of the Business.[^6] The defendant also relies on the argument that the obligations set out in the Agreement constitute past consideration in support of its position that the Agreement is not valid nor enforceable.

19     It is apparent therefore that the defence is anchored on its contention that the Agreement is invalid, and that the obligations of the parties are determined instead by the oral agreement it had pleaded.

20     However, the question of whether it is the Agreement or the oral agreement that governs the relationship of the parties has now being settled. Pursuant to an O 14 application filed by the plaintiff, the court has on 17 February 2021 made a finding that the Agreement is valid. In so finding, the court also concluded that the defendant has breached Clause 5 of the Agreement which imposed an obligation to furnish accounts on the defendant, and that the defendant has failed to do so. In fact, an interlocutory judgment has been granted against the defendant for damages to be assessed for failure to furnish the accounts.

21     With that being the case, as the defence is rooted on the contention that the Agreement is invalid, and that the obligations of the parties are determined instead by the oral agreement it had pleaded, the contrary finding of the court resolved the question of whether the plaintiff has a good arguable case in its favour. As the plaintiff’s claims are founded on its contention that the Agreement governs the relationship of the parties, the finding that the Agreement is valid largely settles the question of the merits of the action. Further, there is now an interlocutory judgment entered against the defendant for breach of a term of the agreement between the parties. I therefore find that the plaintiff has established a good arguable case.

### Risk of dissipation

22     As for the test of whether there is real risk of dissipation of assets, both parties refer me to the Court of Appeal decision of _Guan Chong Cocoa Manufacturer Sdn Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 157</span> (“_Guan Chong_”). The Court of Appeal in _Guan Chong_ at \[20\] lay down guidelines for determining whether there is a real risk of dissipation in a given case. The Court of Appeal listed the following matters to be considered:

> (a)     the nature of the assets which are to be the subject of the proposed injunction, and the ease with which they could be disposed of or dissipated;

> (b)     the nature and financial standing of the defendant’s business;

> (c)     the length of time the defendant has been in business;

> (d)     the domicile or residence of the defendant;

> (e)     if the defendant is a foreign entity, the country in which it is registered and the availability of reciprocal enforcement of local judgments or awards in that country;

> (f)     the defendant’s past or existing credit record, such as a history of defaulting in debts;

> (g)     any intention expressed by the defendant about future dealings with his local or overseas assets;

> (h)     connections between a defendant and other companies which have defaulted on awards or judgments;

> (i)     the defendant’s behaviour in respect of the claims, including that in response to the claimant’s claims; and

> (j)     any good grounds for alleging that the defendant has been dishonest.

23     I note that it is not necessary for a plaintiff to show an actual intent on the part of the defendant to dispose of or dissipate the assets; instead, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to show a real risk of disposal of assets: _Guan Chong_ at \[18\]. However, there must be some “solid evidence” to substantiate the said risk, and not just bare assertions to the effect: _Guan Chong_ at \[8\], \[63\] & \[93\].

24     The plaintiff further points to other matters to consider, referred to in _Guan Chong_ at \[18\] in determining the question of whether there is a risk of dissipation:

> (a)     Direct evidence that the defendant has previously acted in a way which shows that his probity is not to be relied on.

> (b)     The type of company the defendant is (whether it is incorporated, what are its corporate structure and assets, and so on) so as to raise an inference that the company is not to be relied on.

> (c)     The fact that inquiries about the characteristics of the defendant have led to a blank wall.

25     It is also stated in _Guan Chong_ at \[19\] that “a good piece of evidence” establishing a real risk of dissipation would be “where the defendant, for no sufficient reason, starts to put his property up for sale or where a company just ceases business”.

26     In the matter before me, the plaintiff’s case for the assets of the defendant to be frozen is pivoted on the defendant closing the Business without the plaintiff’s knowledge. The defendant had closed the Business and terminated the Lease in October 2020. The plaintiff says that the closure of the Business warrants the Mareva injunction to be granted to preserve the defendant’s assets, as there is a clear risk of dissipation of assets. I note that the plaintiff found out about the cessation of the Business and the termination of the Lease in the midst of litigation through an online media report. The plaintiff learnt on 30 September 2020 from the report that the Business would close on 1 October 2020. The plaintiff also found out by inference from the report that the defendant had terminated the Lease.

27     The defendant does not deny that it closed the Business. It contends however that the closure of the Business does not amount to good evidence of risk of dissipation of assets. The defendant contends that it had closed the Business because it was unable to continue operation in view of the fallout following the global pandemic. It should therefore not be seen as evidence of risk of dissipation. The defendant places great store in its argument that it had sufficient reason to cease the Business. The defendant refers to _Guan Chong_ at \[23\] and argues that the present case should be distinguished from _Guan Chong_ as there is an explanation for the closure of the Business. The Court of Appeal states in _Guan Chong_ at \[23\] as follows:

> 23    Of the five factors listed in \[21\] above, the two most critical were: (i) the fact that the respondents had sold the _Langsa_, and (ii) the respondents had ceased to carry on business. It was significant that no reason was offered to explain why the respondents had to dispose of their only asset, the _Langsa_. This could not be a transaction in the ordinary course of business. Unless an explanation was offered it would, _prima facie_, be an act of dissipation. This factor alone would have sufficed for the court to grant a Mareva injunction.

28     The defendant submits that unlike the facts in _Guan Chong_ where it was established that the defendants there have sold their only asset and did not offer any explanation for their action, the defendant in the present case provided an explanation for the closure of the Business.

29     In my view, the key matter to note in the analysis of the question of risk of dissipation in the present case is that the Business is _the_ vehicle of the parties’ commercial undertaking. In fact, it forms the substratum of the agreement between the parties. And that agreement is now the subject matter of the litigation before the court. With that being the case, the closure of the Business has a significant bearing on the question of risk of dissipation. It also gives rise to a risk that the defendant will frustrate judgment.

30     Further, it is significant that the defendant had closed the Business and terminated the Lease without consultation with the plaintiff. The plaintiff had to learn of the closure through the media. The plaintiff had to find out for itself that the subject matter of its commercial enterprise with the defendant has shut down. It is noteworthy that the defendant had closed the Business after commencement of the action. The plaintiff was not informed of the defendant’s decision to close the Business and to terminate the Lease. Moreover, given the absence of the defendant’s Business accounts, which the defendant is contractually obliged to furnish to the plaintiff under clause 5 of the Agreement, the plaintiff is unable to determine whether the closure of the Business is due to its precarious financial situation, or for the purpose of dissipating its assets. The plaintiff has a legitimate interest in knowing the reason for the closure – it has a 40 percent stake in the Business. The question of the refund of the rental deposit under the Lease for which the plaintiff contributed $24,000 is an added consideration.

31     In the face of the defendant’s failure to furnish any accounts of the Business, the defendant’s explanation that it closed the Business because it failed appears to me to be inadequate. This is particularly so when the defendant persists in not furnishing the accounts even after the commencement of action and the plaintiff’s specific request to produce them.

32     In any event, in my view the defendant’s contention that the reason for closing the Business was that it had failed does not answer the question of whether the closure of the Business amounts to evidence of a risk of dissipation. As discussed above, the Business was the substratum of the agreement between the parties. It is now closed down by the defendant. The defendant had shut it without first informing the plaintiff. At the same time, there is no evidence of the financial state of the Business at all, as the defendant has failed to provide the accounts to the plaintiff. That failure is now the subject matter of an interlocutory judgment against the defendant. Putting these factors into the mix yields a picture of a real risk of dissipation of assets. That the defendant might have closed the Business because it failed does not by itself refute the contention that there is a clear risk of assets dissipation and that the closure warrants the granting of a Mareva injunction. The manner of the closure of the Business, together with the failure to provide information on the state of the Business raises a real prospect of a risk of dissipation of assets.

33     I note as well that no attempt has been made by the defendant to explain why the plaintiff was not informed of the defendant’s decision to close the Business and to terminate the Lease. Coupled with the undisputed fact that the defendant has failed to furnish the accounts of the Business to the plaintiff, even after legal proceedings have been commenced, I find the absence of an explanation troubling. This is particularly so against the backdrop of the commercial arrangement between the parties, where the plaintiff was to take a back seat whilst the defendant operated the Business. The plaintiff would be wholly dependent on the defendant for information on the financial status of the Business.

34     I would suggest that the approach laid down in _Guan Chong_ should be modified when applied to cases where the business that the defendant had ceased to carry on is also the business that is the subject matter of the dispute between the parties. In such cases, when the defendant unilaterally closes the business, a _prima facie_ case of a risk _of_ dissipation of assets is immediately established, _whether or not_ a reasonable explanation is given for the closure. The circumstances surrounding the closure of the business would then have to be examined closely to determine if the _prima facie_ case should be displaced. The circumstances should go beyond a reasonable explanation for ceasing the business. It would include in particular, factors such as whether the plaintiff was consulted on the closure, and whether the plaintiff had been kept informed of the financial position of the business. In my view, a lower threshold should be afforded to the plaintiff in establishing a risk of dissipation of assets when the business the defendant caused to cease operation is the same business that gave rise to the dispute, as opposed to the defendant’s own business. The lower burden is justified as the defendant is essentially disposing of the asset that is the subject matter of dispute of the parties. By unilaterally disposing of such a business, a reasonable explanation for the disposal by itself would not be sufficient for the defendant to discharge the _prima facie_ case of a risk of dissipation.

35     Returning to the present case, I also find merit in the plaintiff’s contention that there is a lack of probity in the defendant’s conduct. In _JTrust_ (\[13\] _supra_) at \[65\], the factors the Court of Appeal considered to be relevant in assessing whether there is a real risk of dissipation include whether there are good grounds for alleging that the defendant has been dishonest and whether the defendant has any characteristics which suggest that he can and will frustrate judgment. A defendant’s behaviour in response to the plaintiff’s claims was also held to be relevant. It was held at \[66\] that the alleged dishonesty must be of such a nature that it has a real and material bearing on the risk of dissipation.

36     In my view, the inexplicable failure of the defendant in the present case to inform the plaintiff of its intention to close the Business, and to terminate the Lease gives rise to the spectre of dishonesty on the part of the defendant. The refusal of the defendant to furnish the accounts of the Business from inception is further evidence of a lack of probity. I find that the defendant’s lack of probity is of a nature that has a material bearing on the risk of dissipation. I also find that it gives rise to a risk that the defendant will frustrate judgment.

37     I turn now to the question of the quantum of the Mareva injunction sought by the plaintiff. The counsel for the plaintiff submitted at the hearing before me that the plaintiff’s basis for requesting for a sum of up to $100,000 to be frozen is based on the expectation that the plaintiff would receive a share of profit of $120,000 from the Business. Its expectation of the profit of $120,000 is in turn based on a profit figure of $300,000 referred to by the representative of the defendant before the parties entered into agreement. As the plaintiff is to have a 40 percent share, the profit it expects to receive is in the sum of $120,000. I note that the expected profit figure of $120,000 is an estimate and there is no certainty that the Business would turn a profit. However, the defendant has not proffered any alternative approach to arrive at a different quantum. Against the backdrop of the defendant’s failure to furnish the accounts of the Business, I have no reason not to accept the estimated profit figure of $120,000 proposed by the plaintiff. In this light, I find the quantum of the Mareva injunction sought by the plaintiff at $100,000 to be reasonable.

## Conclusion

38     I find that the plaintiff has established a good arguable case. This is in the light of the finding that the Agreement governed the relationship between the parties. As the plaintiff’s case is founded on the Agreement, whereas the defendant’s case is predicated on the contention that the Agreement did not apply, a good arguable case has been established by the plaintiff. Further, interlocutory judgment has been entered against the defendant for failing to furnish the accounts of the Business to the plaintiff.

39     I also find that the plaintiff has established that there is a real risk of dissipation of assets by the defendant. The closure of the Business by the defendant without informing the plaintiff gives rise to a _prima facie_ case of risk of dissipation. I find that the _prima facie_ case is not displaced in the light of the defendant’s failure to furnish accounts of the Business from its onset. The defendant also terminated the Lease without informing the plaintiff. Finally, I am unable to find any reason not to accept the quantum of the Mareva injunction sought by the plaintiff.

40     For all of the above reasons, I allow the plaintiff’s application. Parties are to file their submissions on costs, limited to five pages each, within 14 days of the date of this judgment.
