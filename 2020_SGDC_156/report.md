### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       Two accused persons, Rajendran s/o Nagarethinam (“Rajendran”) and Arumaikannu Sasikumar (“Sasikumar”), were co-owners of a club, Kollywood (“the club”) that engaged female Hindi and Bangladeshi performing artists. The performing artistes were supposed to dance and entertain the club’s customers, and the tips received from these customers, and the liquor sold to them, constituted revenue for the club.

2       Sasikumar originally operated as the sole owner and director of the club. Towards the end of 2015, he sold half of his shares to Rajendran, who invested a sum of $40,000 for this purpose. Rajendran also became a director of the club thereafter. It was alleged that in January 2016, both accused persons, together with their Bangladeshi accomplice, Roky, procured one of the performing artiste, a female Bangladeshi, Victim 1 (“V1”), for the purpose of prostitution. They also lived in part on her earnings of prostitution. The actions of the accused persons formed the basis of two charges under s 140(1)(_b_) and 146(1) of Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) respectively, both read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”).

3       Aside from the WC charges involving V1, it was also alleged that Rajendran alone recruited another Bangladeshi performing artiste, Victim 2 (“V2”), by threatening her with bodily harm for the purpose of exploitation. This constituted an offence under s 3(1)(_a_) punishable under s 4(1)(_a_) of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“PHTA”).

4       When several of the Bangladeshi performing artistes, including V1 and V2, left their residence (provided to them by the club) without permission, it was alleged that both accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, intentionally obstructed the course of justice by arranging for their accomplice, Roky to leave Singapore to evade arrest. The accused persons’ actions constituted offences punishable under s 204A read with s 34 of the PC.

5       Both accused persons claimed trial to all their charges. They were originally tried together with the accomplice, Roky (B2), who had been arrested after he subsequently returned to Singapore, despite having been told by Rajendran that he was banned. However, in the midst of the joint trial of the accused persons and Roky, the latter absconded. He has not been found by the police since. The trial against the two accused persons then continued without Roky.

6       At the end of a trial lasting more than 25 days, and after going through the notes of evidence (“NE”), the exhibits, and the submissions of parties, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to establish the respective cases against the accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted them on all their charges. Further dates were then taken for sentencing.

7       Thereafter, following the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the mitigation pleas for the accused persons, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 30 month’s imprisonment and $3,000 fine (in default 3 weeks’ imprisonment) on Rajendran, and an aggregate sentence of 16 month’s imprisonment and $1,000 fine (in default 1 week’s imprisonment) on Sasikumar.

8       Both accused persons have since filed appeals against their conviction and sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## Elements of the charges

9       There was little dispute on the elements of the charges against the accused persons.

### The WC charges

10     Both accused persons faced two WC charges each.

11     As regards the charge of procurement under s 140(1)(_b_) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC, it was alleged that sometime in early January 2016, the accused persons together with Roky, in furtherance of their common intention, procured V1 for the purpose of prostitution within Singapore. With respect to the key elements of the offence, the following legal definitions were instructive:

> (a)     As to the meaning of procure, I accepted the position that in line with _Public Prosecutor v Chong Mun Moi_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 268</span>, at \[49\], procure generally means to persuade, or to bring about a course of conduct which V1 would not have embarked on spontaneously or of her own volition; and

> (b)     As for the meaning of prostitution, it is stated at s 2 of the WC that prostitution “means the act of a female offering her body for sexual penetration for hire, whether in money or in kind”.

12     As regards the WC charge of knowingly living in part on the earnings of the prostitution of V1 in furtherance of their common intention under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC allegedly committed sometime in early and mid-January 2016, the case of _Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 716</span> (“_Liew Kim Choo_”) is instructive. In _Liew Kim Choo_ at \[32\], the High Court set out the following elements that have to be proven for a 146(1) WC charge:

> (a)     the fact that prostitution had taken place;

> (b)     that earnings had been made from that prostitution;

> (c)     that the whole or part of those earnings or the benefit of those earnings had been received by the accused persons; and

> (d)     that the accused persons received those earnings or their benefit with the knowledge that they were earned through prostitution.

13     For both WC charges, it was necessary also to prove that the offences were committed with common intention under s 34 of the PC. In _Public Prosecutor v Imran bin Mohd Arip & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 155</span> at \[22\], the court made it clear that the following three elements must be present before constructive liability could be imposed pursuant to s 34, namely:

> (a)    the criminal act element: this concerns the aggregate of all the diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offenders which collectively give rise to the offence that they have been charged with;

> (b)    the common intention element: this focuses on the common intention of the offenders to do something or achieve some goal or purpose; and

> (c)    the participation element: this requires a secondary offender to participate in the specific criminal act committed by the actual doer which gives rise to the offence charged or participate in some other criminal act that is done in furtherance of the common intention of all the offenders.

### The PHTA charge

14     The Prosecution has to show that:

> (a)     Rajendran recruited V2;

> (b)     He did this by threatening her with bodily harm; and

> (c)     This was done for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation is defined in section 2 of the PHTA, to mean “…sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery or any practice similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of an organ”. Sexual exploitation in turn means “the involving of an individual in prostitution, sexual servitude or the provision of any other form of sexual service, including the commission of any obscene or indecent act by the individual or the use of the individual in an audio or visual recording or representation of such act”.

### The PC charge

15     In respect of the charge for obstruction of justice under s 204A read with 34 of the PC (“obstruction of justice charge”), the Prosecution has to show that

> (a)     in furtherance of their common intention;

> (b)     they intentionally obstructed the course of justice by arranging for Roky to leave the country;

> (c)     in order for him to evade arrest.

## Agreed facts

16     At the commencement of the hearing, parties put up a “Statement of Agreed Facts”. I have summarised the main agreed facts below:

> (a)     Rajendran and Sasikumar are both directors of Nine Silver Pte Ltd, a company which operated Kollywood Music Lounge (“Kollywood”). Sasikumar was appointed as director on 26 June 2014, and Rajendran was appointed as director on 30 November 2015. Both of them hold equal shares in the company.

> (b)     V1 and V2 are both Bangladeshi nationals, who arrived in Singapore on 7 September 2015 and 16 January 2016 respectively.

> (c)     On 11 February 2016, Roky departed Singapore via Tuas checkpoint at 8.36 pm. He re-entered Singapore via Changi Airport Terminal 2 on 8 November 2016 at 5.07 am.

> (d)     On 12 February 2016, CID officers conducted a check at Kollywood in the presence of Rajendran and seized items from its premises (as reflected in a seizure report).

> (e)     On 22 December 2016, at 10 am, Roky was placed under arrest. On the same date at 1.10 pm, both Rajendran and Sasikumar were also placed under arrest.

## The Prosecution’s evidence

17     Aside from the facts already agreed, the Prosecution called a total of nine witnesses to prove its case. In addition, the Prosecution adduced numerous exhibits, including a statement recorded from Roky (P21), and two statements recorded from Sasikumar (P26 and P27), as well as records from the club.

18     I will outline the Prosecution’s main evidence below.

### Evidence on the vice charges under s 140(1)(b) and 146(1) of the WC

19     Both WC charges involved V1, a 26-year-old female Bangladeshi girl. She testified that she originally worked as a dancer at wedding ceremonies in Bangladesh, and that she came to Singapore to be a dancer[^1] at Kollywood, after she was informed that she would get a good salary of 100,000 Taka per month. V1 had arrived in Singapore on 7 September 2015, where she was met by Roky and Sasikumar. Roky had introduced Sasikumar to her as her boss.

20     When she came to Singapore, she handed her passport to Roky. She was told that she had a monthly earnings target of $6,000 per month. This was told to her to her by Sasikumar, who used Roky as the Bengali interpreter to convey the message, as V1 herself could not understand English.[^2] Her earnings were supposed to come from the customers who watched her dance, as they would put the money in collection boxes. V1 was also told that she would not get her salary if she did not meet her monthly earnings target. She was very sad when she heard this and replied that she would try her best.

21     V1 said that subsequently, she was paid twice, once a sum of 50,000 Taka (in October or November 2015), and another time, a sum of 33,000 Taka (in November or December 2015). She received a smaller sum on the second occasion as she had told Roky that she needed a phone and asked him to deduct the cost of this from her salary, and to remit the remaining money to her home in Bangladesh as her family needed it because of financial problems. She was under the impression that the money given was part of her salary, and that she would receive the rest of her salary when she went back to Bangladesh.

22     V1 testified that when she first came to the club, Sasikumar was the boss, and Rajendran (known to her as “Raj Kumar”) only came to the club about 3 months later. She said that one day, Sasikumar came to the club and told them that Rajendran was the new boss.

23     V1 said that Sasikumar would come to the club about 2 or 3 times a week. She described Sasikumar as a good man. As for Rajendran, he was initially a guest at the club, and when he became a boss, he would come 2 or 3 times a week, and give “headache to the girls” by confiscating their mobile phones when the collection was not enough, and only return the phones when the collection was better. V1 said that she had her phone confiscated by Rajendran many times.[^3] Rajendran would also threaten the girls that he would not pay them their salary if they could not collect more money.

24     V1 said that when Rajendran entered the club, the girls were very afraid as he was someone who could stop their food and their salary, and would also scold them as well as Roky. In contrast, she did not observe Sasikumar scolding Roky. Sasikumar also did not talk much when he came to the club. V1 further said that she did not communicate with him as she could not speak English and he could not speak Bengali.

25     As for Roky, V1 said that his role was to sweep or clean the club, serve alcohol and help the Bangladeshi girls. She described him as a nice person whom she respected as an elder brother.[^4]

26     In respect of the charge against the accused persons under s 140(1)(_b_) of the WC for procuring V1 for the purpose of prostitution, V1 testified that there were two occasions when she was told by Sasikumar, through Roky, to engage in sex with different customers of the club. This happened in January 2016, after Rajendran had joined and been introduced as the new boss in December 2015.

27     On the first occasion, which occurred in the early part of January 2016, V1 was told by Roky that Sasikumar asked her to go out with a client to have sex. Roky had said: “Boss has told --- His friend has given you lot of collection, so you go out with him”.[^5]This conversation took place in the club at around 1.30 am to 2.00 am.

28     V1 said that she initially refused the request, and asked Roky to inform Sasikumar, but Roky said that she would be sent back if she refused. Sasikumar also told Roky to “(m)ake her understand that my friend has given her lot of collection”. She then agreed. V1 explained why she changed her position:[^6]

> “Because the reason is I have come here to earn money. My salary supposed to be 100,000 Taka per month and he threatened me. He will not pay me the salary if I don’t give consent. And if I don’t get money, my family will be starving in Bangladesh. Because of these compelling reasons, I had to agree.”

29     V1 described what happened next.[^7]

> “After that I left the club, went to our Jalan Bukit Merah apartment. Then I got freshen up, boss \[i.e. Sasikumar\] was waiting downstairs, and boss’s friend was waiting inside the taxi. Then boss asked me to follow his friend in the taxi. I went in, then he took me in the taxi and then I don’t know where the taxi took us. Then we went to a room and the person took out the key, opened the door, then he asked me to enter the room. Then I entered the room, then he closed the door, then he got undressed. Then he started touching all over my body. I was trying to push him---I mean, I was trying to avoid his advances. Then he made me sleep. He undressed me and had sex”.

30     After the sexual intercourse, the customer offered her $500. However, V1 shook her head and refused to take it since she believed that she had sex with him because he had given her collection. After the sexual act, the customer was talking and watching a movie over his mobile phone, and V1 was also looking at her mobile phone.

31     V1 returned to her apartment at about 12 noon or 1.00 pm that day. When the taxi she was travelling in reached her apartment with the customer, he again offered her $500 in $50 notes. She was inside the taxi at that time and Sasikumar was waiting outside for her and looking at the man offering her the money. She then passed the $500 to Sasikumar as he had indicated to her, with his hand gesture, for her to do so. V1 said that Sasikumar kept the money and did not say anything to her. She then followed Sasikumar, who opened the gate to the house, and she went to her room.

32     After this incident, there was a second occasion when V1 was asked to go out with another customer, who was supposedly Sasikumar’s friend, for sex. This was about 15 to 20 days after the first incident.

33     V1 said that this told to her at the club by Sasikumar through Roky, after a party there. At around 2.00 am to 2.30 am that night, Roky had said to her that “Boss is asking you to go out with customer again”.[^8] V1 said that prior to saying this to her, Sasikumar and Roky were conversing in front of her in English, and she was seated next to them. After their conversation, Roky had asked her if she would like to go. V1 she initially told him that she didn’t like this and did not want to go. Roky then said to her “Please go. Boss said he will pay you salary”.[^9] This conversation took place after the club had already closed for the night and there was nobody else at the club at that time.

34     V1 testified that she eventually agreed to go. At that point in time, she had already worked at the club for 4 ½ months, and would have been expecting 450,000 Takas in salary. Yet, she had only received payments twice, as they had sent 50,000 Takas and 33,000 Takas to her family on separate occasions. They had also purchased a mobile phone worth $300 for her.

35     After she agreed to go have sex with the customer, she went back to her apartment to freshen up. There, she received a phone call from Roky that Mohan, the deejay was waiting for her. When she went downstairs, she saw Mohan, and followed him to a car. The customer was at the wheel of the car. She entered the car and he drove and took her to a room, and reached there at around 4.00 am to 5.00 am. V1 said that she had seen the customer earlier that same night, and had danced with him on stage.

36     In the room, he kissed her, undressed himself and her, before having sex with her. After this, she said that they rested, and the customer used his mobile phone and so did she. He also gave her $500, in denominations of $100 notes, in the room after sex. They subsequently got up from bed and the customer drove her back to the apartment at around 12 noon. When she arrived, she saw Mohan waiting there. She then followed him to the apartment where he opened the door. V1 said that she did not have the keys to the apartment. She said that other than for work, the girls were not allowed to leave the apartment.

37     Later that night, at the club, when both Rajendran and Sasikumar were seated with Roky also present in the same room, V1 gave them the money.[^10] While initially unsure precisely whether it was Rajendran who had asked her for the money, V1 subsequently confirmed that Rajendran had said in English “give me money”. She then handed over $500 to him. When questioned, V1 explained that she initially could not remember if it was Rajendran who had asked her for the money as this incident happened more than 2 and a half years before.[^11]

38     V1 said that she considered the money she earned this way from the two incidents of sex with the customers would go towards her meeting her monthly earnings target of $6,000. She confirmed that both incidents where she was sent for sex took place after the meeting when Sasikumar had informed that Rajendran was the new boss.[^12]

39     It should also be noted that as stated in the ACRA screening of Kollywood (P12), and as agreed by parties, Rajendran was appointed as a director on 30 November 2015. At that time, Roky was also employed as a handyman and paid $1,500 a month, and in addition, was paid commission (see P19 – payment voucher signed by Rajendran) for bringing customers to the club.

### Evidence on the human trafficking charge under the PHTA

40     The human trafficking charge involved Rajendran only, and the alleged victim was another Bangladeshi performing artiste, V2.

41     V2 had arrived in Singapore on 16 January 2016. She testified that she came to Singapore thinking that she was to work here as a maid, as arranged by an agent in Bangladeshi. She was also told that her salary would be 100,000 Takas per month. However, when she arrived in Singapore and met Roky at the airport, he told her that she would not be working as a maid, but that she had to dance at the club instead. Roky also told her that her working hours as a dancer started from 10.00 pm to 3.00 am in the morning, and that her salary would be 50,000 Taka per month. She was also told that she would be given $50 for every $400 she made in collections. V2 was then brought to her place of residence at Jalan Bukit Merah where she was introduced to the other girls there. Later that night, she followed them to the club where she learnt from the other girls how to dance.

42     V2 said that Rajendran went to Kollywood “daily” to check if everyone was dancing, and would instruct Roky to tell a dancer if she did not dance well or if her collection was not good. V2 testified that the tips given by the customers would be counted by the cashier or by Roky before being handed over to Rajendran. On two occasions, she also saw Rajendran counting the money. She mentioned that: “Most of the time the Raj boss is the one who is the last person who left the club because he actually count the money and take the money and left the club.”[^13]

43     V2 said that Rajendran had told the artistes that if their monthly collection was above $6,000, they would be paid their salary. As she worked for only 26 days, V2 said that she was not paid any salary. V2 further said that while she signed against her name on the collection book on 16 and 21 January, it was not she who signed on 19 January, 20 January and 31 January. Also, there were occasions when one dancer would sign for another when the other dancer was busy.

44     V2 described Roky’s role at the club as being there to serve drinks to customers and to act on the instructions of the bosses. As for Sasikumar, he was a boss who came about once a week and he would stay for half an hour to one hour. The dancers would make requests to him through Roky. As for Rajendran, he was also a boss but he would come daily and stay at the club throughout the time it was open. He also watched the dancers dance, and would give instructions and make comments on their dancing. This was done through Roky.

45     V2 mentioned that on one occasion, which was about two weeks after she had arrived in Singapore, Rajendran, who was standing next to Roky in the club, had told her, through Roky, that one of his friends liked her and wished to take her out for sex. Roky had said that Rajendran’s friend, by the name of Anwar, was willing to pay $2,000, and that she could keep half the money while the boss would keep the other half. However, V2 replied that she would not go out with him.

46     After her reply was told to Rajendran, Roky approached told V2 again and said that “Boss is getting very angry, he wants you to go.”[^14]This was said outside the smoking room. However, V2 still refused. She observed that Rajendran looked very angry. He then asked her, through Roky, to go to the smoke room as it was very noisy outside. This was at about 12.45 am or 1.00 am.

47     After Rajendran had entered the room, he closed the door and spoke in English, mentioning Anwar’s name. He then took out a bundle of $50 and $100 notes from his pocket and offered money to her and told her to go with the customer. He did this by holding on the notes in both hands with one hand showing “This is yours” and showing with the other hand that “Is mine”.[^15] He also spoke in English, which V2 did not understand, although Rajendran mentioned Anwar’s name again and again. She said that there were only two of them present in the room at that time.

48     When she still refused by shaking her hand, Rajendran got very angry, raised his voice and scolded her in English. He then slapped her forcefully on her cheek with his right hand, leaving a mark. Then, as he raised his left hand and was about to hit her again, V2 held onto his wrist and then ran out of the smoke room. She went to the deejay’s place where she was approached by two or three dancers. She then told 2 Bangladeshi girls, \[AB\] and Sahanas, that “Boss is asking me to go out with customer to have sex. I refuse, I don’t want to go.”[^16] She also told them that she was slapped when she refused to go. V2 further said that she did not want to stay there and wanted her passport back so as to return to Bangladesh. Her passport had earlier been taken away by Roky and given to one of the bosses.

49     V2 said that Rajendran then gripped her from behind by her neck and said something in English that she did not understand. She then freed herself and went into the makeup room. When this was happening the other dancers did not react as “they know that this boss is a very bad person, he’s like a devil”.[^17] V2 said that she did not see a doctor as they would not let her do so. She also did not know that the Singapore General Hospital was just across the road. In addition, she did not call the police was she had no knowledge of what to do. Instead, she just went to the make-up room and sat down. V2 said that she told Roky about the matter as he also spoke Bengali. However, she did not tell him to report the matter to the authorities.

50     V2 said that subsequently, on 10 February 2016, at about 10.00 am to 10.30 am, both Rajendran and Sasikumar came to their apartment and brought two bottles of alcohol, and bottles of 7Up and other food items. The accused persons talked with all the girls inside the room. Rajendran also apologised to her and said to her “Whatever happen has happened, I---please forgive me”.[^18]He spoke in English and his words were interpreted by \[AB\] to V2.

51     Alcohol was offered to the girls present and they all took the drinks except for V2 who initially refused to do so. However, she subsequently relented when they insisted. She said that she took about two or three pegs of alcohol before she vomited in the hall, and again in the bathroom. After vomiting, she went to rest. Sasikumar eventually left, followed by Rajendran.

52     V2 said that at about 3.00 am that same day, \[SB\] told three of the girls (\[AB\], V1 and V2) to get ready to leave the apartment. The four of them (including \[SB\]) then left because they were not paid their salaries. They took a taxi to Mustafa centre, and an unnamed Bangladeshi person subsequently took them to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) where they revealed to the officer that they were not paid their salaries and also about being sent out with customers. Subsequently, they went to the police.

53     V2 testified that she was finally paid her salary (as indicated in P10 - discharge of claims form) of a sum of $525. This was paid by Rajendran in Sasikumar’s presence.

54     V2 also testified that she had heard from three other Bengali girls, \[AB\], V1 and \[SB\], that they had each gone out with their customers (Ronnie, Tapas and Anwar respectively) and had sex. V2 also said that she had seen Tapas taking out money from his pocket but she was not sure who he handed the money to. This money was paid for Tapas to bring V1 out for sex. Tapas had taken V1 from the apartment about 2.45 am to 3.10 am. When she returned at 1.00 pm that afternoon, she was crying and told them that she had sex with Tapas.[^19] V2 said that besides Tapas, V1 had also gone out with another Bangladeshi man by the name of Fazlu. V2 testified that she was not very friendly with V1.[^20]

### Evidence on the obstruction of justice charge under the PC

55     The evidence on this charge was largely adduced from the statement of Roky (P21 - admitted under the hearsay exception in section 32 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) without objection from the Defence), which was also corroborated by two statements made by Sasikumar (P26 and P27) that were admitted under section 258(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (CPC).

56     In essence, in P21, a statement recorded on 8 November 2016, the date that Roky returned to Singapore from Bangladeshi, Roky had stated that:

> (a)     When he was working at the club, Rajendran and Sasikumar would ask him to go with them to fetch Bangladeshi dancers at the airport, and bring them for medical check-up, and to the lodging house. Roky would also act as the interpreter to these dancers, by conveying instructions from Sasikumar and Rajendran to them in Bengali, a language which neither accused person understood (see \[5\]).

> (b)     On 11 February 2016, Sasikumar had called Roky and asked to meet him at the back lane behind the club. When he reached there, both Rajendran and Sasikumar were present. Roky stated at \[7\] that:

>> …Once I met up with 'Sasikumar', 'Raj' was there too. **'Sasikumar' told me that the dancers had ran away from the lodging house, he told me to go return back to my country.** I asked him and he did reply me and told me to return back. 'Raj' also asked me to return back too. **'Sasikumar' continued to tell me that his friend would pick me up and drove to Malaysia, he would hand over my passport to his friend.** Both of them told me to stay in Malaysia for two days and they would let me know the outcome. **'Raj' passed me $200/-.**

>> \[emphasis in bold added\]

> (c)     On that same day, Sasikumar's friend came and picked Roky, and drove him to Malaysia, where Roky stayed with a friend. Roky subsequently called Rajendran, and gave him his contact number. Later, when Roky called Rajendran again and asked him whether he could return to Singapore because he did not have much money left, Rajendran told Roky that his work permit had been cancelled and asked Roky to go back to Bangladesh. Roky did so on 23 February 2016.

> (d)     After returning to Bangladesh, Roky called Rajendran again, and Rajendran informed him that he had been banned and not able to return to Singapore.

> (e)     Nevertheless, Roky returned to Singapore on 8 November 2016 after he had applied for a job here and obtained in principle approval for this. At the Singapore Airport Terminal 2, Roky was told to report for a police investigation and he did so.

> (f)     Roky also confirmed that he was the “middle person” to speak to the Bangladeshi dancers as they did not understand English and the accused persons did not speak Bengali (answer to Q3). Roky also said he had heard from the dancers that they went out with customers (answer to Q4), although he claimed not to know if the customer can bring the dancers out, saying that “(t)his is control by the bosses” (answer to Q22).

> (g)     Roky said that the dancers had to hit an earnings target of $6,000 a month (answer to Q25). If they did not hit the target the bosses would get very angry, and threaten not to give them their salaries.

> (h)     When asked about various aspects about what the dancers did, or about their dealings with the accused persons, Roky often claimed that he did not know.

57     In ascribing weight and deciding on the veracity of Roky’s statement, I considered that – as with evaluating all statements involving persons alleged to have committed offences (including Roky who had started the trial as a co-accused person) - a court must consider both the incriminatory and exculpatory portions of a statement to determine the truth of the matter, “although it is usually the case that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas excuses would not carry the same weight” (see _Chan Kin Choi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 111</span> at \[34\] and \[35\]).

58     Thus, while there were possible “self-serving” aspects in Roky’s statement which may be regarded with greater circumspection – such as when Roky had suggested that he was not aware of, or involved in, certain illicit matters that allegedly took place at the club, or about the interactions between the victims and the accused persons which may possibly implicate him - in so far as contents of his statement were corroborated by other evidence, those aspects of Roky’s evidence were more likely to be believed. This was especially important since I was acutely aware that Roky was not present in court to be cross-examined, or to elaborate on, or explain the contents of his statement.

59     In this regard, the strongest evidence that supported Roky’s account – particularly as regards the circumstances of his sudden departure from Singapore in the evening of 11 February 2016 - came from the statements of one of the accused person, Sasikumar. It is to such evidence, I now turn my attention to.

60     In Sasikumar’s statement to MOM, which was recorded on 29 November 2016 (P26), Sasikumar confirmed that he had made use of Roky as an interpreter with the Bangladeshi performing artistes. When Sasikumar found out at 6 pm on 11 February 2016 that they had run away from their lodging place in Bukit Merah, he had contacted Roky to look for them. At around 8 pm, when he found out that they had lodged a police report at CID, Sasikumar contacted Roky and asked Roky to flee to Malaysia for a few days, since he had asked Roky to interpret for him and also fetch them from the airport.

61     Sasikumar confirmed that he told Roky to pack his stuff and arranged for transport to bring Roky to Malaysia. Sasikumar also cancelled Roky’s work permit the following day (12 February 2016), and subsequently contacted Roky and told him to find ways to leave Malaysia for Bangladesh. Sasikumar also confirmed that Rajendran was aware that the performing artistes had run away, and that Sasikumar had sent Roky to Malaysia. When questioned why he had instructed Roky to leave for Malaysia and not Bangladesh, Sasikumar made the following damning admission (answer to question 6):

> I was afraid of more trouble**. I wanted Roky to immediately leave the country and\_hence I have asked and\_ arrange for Roky to leave to Malaysia first.** If buy the airticket for Rocky, it will take a few days and during this few days, **Police might arrest Roky and hence I decided to send Roky to Malaysia.**

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

62     In Sasikumar’s further statement to MOM, which was recorded on 14 December 2016 (P27), Sasikumar elaborated on his earlier account and said that that he had asked Rajendran to hand over $200 to Roky when they sent him to Malaysia. He also reiterated that he had instructed Roky to leave for Malaysia instead of Bangladesh as he was afraid of more trouble and he wanted Roky to leave Singapore immediately and hence decided to send him to Malaysia, since it would have taken a longer time to send Roky to Bangladesh.

63     I would add that while Sasikumar’s counsel, Mr Fernando, took issue with the fact that the Prosecution had sought to make use of P26 and P27 in the present trial, as these were statements recorded by MOM in relation to investigations carried out for possible breaches of the Employment Act rather than statements recorded by the Police in relation to the PC offence, I agreed with the Prosecution that s 258(1) of the CPC clearly permits the admission and use of such evidence. This provision reads:

> 258.— (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), where any person is charged with an offence, **any statement made** by the person, whether it is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after the person is charged and **whether or not in the course of any investigation** carried out by **any law enforcement agency**, is admissible in evidence at his trial; and if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit

> \[emphasis in bold and underline added\]

64     In the present case, since Sasikumar did not allege that either of his two statements (P26 and P27) was involuntary, and since the MOM statements dealt with matters relevant for the current trial, I saw no reason why they should be excluded from consideration, bearing in mind the width of s 258(1) of the CPC.

65     I would add that the real issue concerning these statements was the weight to ascribe to them. In this respect, I noted that in both P26 and P27, despite being recorded more than two weeks apart, Sasikumar had essentially given the same account in both statements. Further, for each statement, Sasikumar had even explicitly confirmed that he was aware that it would be an offence to give a false statement, and even went so far as to say (twice) that he was willing to undergo a polygraph test, presumably to show that he was genuinely telling the truth about the reasons and circumstances of Roky’s sudden departure from Singapore. Accordingly, I was of the view that both these statements should be given due weight, as should Roky’s admissions in P21.

## Calling for the Defence

66     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I heard submissions from both the Prosecution and the counsel for Rajendran and Sasikumar on whether I should call the defence of the accused persons on the charges against them. Before deciding on this matter, and in order to satisfy myself that things were in order, I looked at the consents tendered by the Prosecution in relation to both the WC and PHTA charges, and noted that they had been signed by a Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”), rather than the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) himself.

67     While section 156 of the WC allows the consent for the WC charges to be signed by a DPP, the PHTA mentions that the consent of the PP was required to initiate a prosecution under that Act.

68     While this issue was not raised by counsel for Rajendran, Mr Naidu, even though it was his client who was facing the PHTA charge, I nevertheless asked DPP Chew, who was conducting the prosecution before me, if her colleague who had signed the consent, had been internally authorised or delegated the power to sign the consent on behalf of the PP for the prosecution of Rajendran on the PHTA charge. DPP Chew then said that she would check on this issue. [^21]

69     However, after verification, DPP Chew informed me that her colleague, had actually not been delegated the power to sign the consent on behalf of the PP for the PHTA charge. I then stood down for parties to address me on this.

70     DPP Chew subsequently submitted that notwithstanding the fact that no consent of the Public Prosecutor had been provided prior to initiating the prosecution of Rajendran for the PHTA charge, a purposive reading of section 10(2) of the CPC[^22] permitted Rajendran’s continued prosecution on this charge. She further undertook to obtain the consent of the Public Prosecutor as soon as practicable. The DPP also argued that no substantive injustice had been caused to Rajendran in any event.

71     Mr Naidu, however, when alerted to this matter, argued that since there was no valid Public Prosecutor’s consent tendered on the PHTA charge against Rajendran, this was prejudicial to him, and submitted (initially) that a discharge amounting to an acquittal should be granted on this charge.

72     I then stood down the matter and asked parties to address me further on this issue, including the effect of s 423 CPC, if applicable. This provision reads:

> **When irregularities do not make proceedings invalid**

> **423**.    Subject to this Code, **_any judgment, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction may not be reversed or altered on account of_** —

>> (a) an error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in an inquiry or other proceeding under this Code;

>> (b) **_the lack of any consent by the Public Prosecutor as required by law_**; or

>> (c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence,

>> **_unless the_** error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or **_lack of consent has caused a failure of justice_**.”

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

73     On the following day, DPP Chew tendered the written consent signed by the PP, Mr Lucien Wong SC, confirming that the PP has consented to the prosecution of Rajendran on the PHTA charge. In any event, DPP Chew submitted that any (initial) want of consent of the PP could be cured when no failure of justice has resulted (citing Halbury’s Laws of Singapore, Volume 8(2), “Criminal Procedure” at \[95.017\]). In this regard, she highlighted the case of _Chiew Poh Kiong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 4 MLJ 280</span> (“_Chiew Poh Kiong_”), where the Malaysia High Court had taken the position that the lack of a sanction in respect of a prosecution under the Penal Code, could be cured in light of s 422 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (which is equivalent to s 423 of our CPC), as there was no failure of justice caused. Moreover, the accused there was defended by counsel who did not raise any objection during the trial, a matter that the court took into consideration, in coming to its decision.

74     DPP Chew argued that in the present case, the lack of a consent at the earlier part of the trial could also be remedied if there was no failure of justice. Here, there has in fact been no failure of justice because:

> (a)     The necessary evidence has been adduced for the charge;

> (b)     The consent eventually tendered was for the charge that was framed against the accused; and

> (c)     Similar to the situation in _Chiew Poh Kiong_, the accused here (Rajendran) was represented by counsel (Mr Naidu) who did not raise any objection during the trial as regards the want of the Public Prosecutor’s consent.

75     In response, Mr Naidu, argued that the court in _Chiew Poh Kiong_ referred to a sanction that was missing, while what was deficient here was a consent. He also cited cases where the consent of the PP was not obtained prior to prosecution (_eg_, _Public Prosecutor v Nagalingam Mathiyooke and another_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] SGHC 18</span>), or where the consent obtained did not cover the scope of the amended charges before the court (_Public Prosecutor v Wong Cheong Yoon_ \[1992\] I CLAS News 37), and suggested that the court should grant a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. However, tellingly, Mr Naidu did not address the court on s 423 CPC, or the fact that the Public Prosecutor has since given his consent to the prosecution, and that the scope of that Public Prosecutor’s consent, while belated, was _prima facie_ broad enough to cover the PHTA charge and prosecution before this court.

76     Having considered the arguments of parties, I noted that the requisite consent has since been provided by the PP, who has thus exercised his mind and his discretion to decide that a prosecution under the PHTA was appropriate. Further, while the consent was only given in the midst of the trial, there was hardly any issue of Rajendran being in any way prejudiced as a result, since the want of consent was never a point of contention when the evidence was being led. Moreover, the same charge had remained. There was also no evidence or allegation made that Rajendran did not understand, or that he was confused over the charge that he faced, or about the allegations that were made against him by V2. Simply put, the elements of the charge, as well as the evidence led before the consent was produced, remained the same even after the consent was produced. In addition, Rajendran was also represented by counsel throughout.

77     Further, in line with the decision in _Chiew Poh Kiong_, and as provided in s 423 CPC (which specifically mentioned that the lack of the PP’s consent could be cured), I was of the view that the late tendering of the consent, in the midst of the case but before Rajendran’s defence had been called, did not prejudice him since he would still be able to prepare his defence in any manner he chooses (if his defence was called). The irregularity had also effectively been remedied through the requisite consent being granted, and this was done even before his defence was called. It was thus abundantly clear that while the consent had been tendered later than it should have been, there was clearly no failure of justice that had occasioned. Nor was there any other reason that would render the proceedings invalid.

78     Having dealt with the issue of the PP’s consent, the only issue that remained for me to consider at that stage was whether, in line with section 230(1)(j) of the CPC, there was evidence adduced before me, which was not inherently incredible and which satisfied each and every element of the charges framed against the accused persons. In this regard, I was of the view that there was indeed sufficient evidence, and I called on them to enter their defence.

## The Defence’s evidence

79     Both Rajendran and Sasikumar elected to testify.

### Rajendran’s evidence

80     Rajendran testified that he was a HR Manager and that he was in full time employment with another company in 2016 where his daily working hours were from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm and sometimes up to 9.00 pm. He became involved with Kollywood after he was approached by Mohan, a deejay of the club, sometime in October 2015. Mohan had informed Rajendran that the club was running at a loss, and was looking for an investor.

81     Rajendran then met Sasikumar who had informed him that the club needed to be renovated to attract more customers to the club. Sasikumar also said that the club had done well formerly, but that it was now sustaining losses due to overheads, rentals, utilities and from purchases of liquor, and that he needed to fork out money of his own to pay for the club’s losses.

82     Rajendran subsequently agreed to invest because Mohan assured Rajendran that he knew the operations of the club. Sasikumar also assured Rajendran that he would make money. Rajendran then signed an agreement (D9), and paid Sasikumar a total of $40,000. This money was to pay for the club’s renovation and debts, and payment of electricity and other bills, and for the purchase of liquor. Part of the money (about $5,000) was also used to pay Roky, the agents of two dancers, \[SB\] and V2.

83     Rajendran said that he expected to be able to get a return on his investment within three to six months, and that Sasikumar had informed him that the business would improve after the renovations were done, but Sasikumar did not tell him how, nor did Rajendran ask him.[^23] Rajendran also said that the profits and losses were to be split equally. Rajendran further testified that he has never carried out any investment in business on such a scale in Singapore before.By 30 November 2015, Rajendran was listed as a director of the club.

84     Rajendran said that after 30 November 2015, as he had full time work of his own, he only frequented the club once or twice weekly at about 9.00 or 9.10 pm, and would go mostly to make payments for liquor and amenities bought for the club. He claimed that he would not stay beyond 10.00 pm as his wife would call him if he was not home by 10.00 pm.

85     Rajendran also said that sometime in December 2015, he had seen a customer Tapas go on stage to hug and dance with V2, V1 and an Indian girl. Rajendran said that V2 and V1 looked happy. This happened after he had invested in the club. After this incident, Rajendran said that he asked the deejay, Mohan, to tell the girls that they should they should stop this. They were apparently unhappy with him thereafter. He said that he knew this as whenever he visited the club, the Bangladeshi girls would go to the changing room and not come out until he left. Mohan also told Rajendran that they were unhappy with him about his comments that they should not dance in a sleazy way with the guys, and said that Rajendran should not come to the club. This was something that the girls had told to Roky who, in turn, had told Mohan. Rajendran subsequently did not tell them to stop this behaviour again.

86     Rajendran admitted that he had seen the customers give tips to the dancers when they requested for songs, although he claimed that he himself did not participate in the counting of the collection in the tips boxes, nor did he actually know about the money deposited into the cash register. Rajendran also said that he assumed that the money in the cash register and the tips box was placed in the safe, and that when the daily taking was insufficient, Mohan would call Rajendran who would then use his own cash to pay for liquor, water bills and electricity. However, Rajendran claimed that he did not know how much the club collected as revenue, or how much of this came from collections or from liquor sales. Nor was he aware of what the main expenditure items were.[^24] However, Rajendran did say that the tips collected for dancers were for payment of liquor, electricity, amenities and food for the dancers and other expenses.

87     Rajendran claimed that he did not know if the commissions for the dancers depended on their collection, nor about their salaries or remuneration, or about giving them instructions on collections. As regards the collections set out in P14 (Purple notebook containing record of tips received at the club in December 2015) he said that he was not aware of the arrangements made for the bonuses, although he admitted that Mohan did pass this book to him.

88     In addition, Rajendran said that he did not give anyone feedback about the collections, nor did he set a monthly earnings target of $6,000 for the dancers to meet. He said that he did not even knew of such a target. In addition, Rajendran, denied that he and Roky had gone down to the airport to fetch dancers, or that he or Sasikumar had threatened to withhold their salaries if their collections were no good. Rajendran further said that he does not speak Hindi or Bengali, and claimed that he did not speak to the dancers, nor had not scolded them, or confiscated their mobile phones when their collections were not good. In fact, Rajendran said that he has not spoken to any dancer except for Sri Devi whom he knew, although Rajendran agreed that Sasikumar should have introduced him as the new boss of Kollywood to the dancers. Rajendran also said that the processing for the dancers was done by Sasikumar and not him, and he does know who selects them. As for the club’s current account, it was Sasikumar who was the sole signatory of the cheque book. In short, Rajendran claimed not to be involved in the club’s operations.

89     However, Rajendran admitted that he had started the practice of having a police visit book and also a NEA (“National Environment Agency”) visit book. It was also he who had brought up to Sasikumar the idea to move the artistes from their accommodation at the club to a rented location at Bukit Merah, as it was against regulations for the artistes to stay in the club. In addition, Rajendran, said that Mohan would highlight to Sasikumar and him about anything that goes on at the club. Further, Rajendran would go down to the club to see whether the renovations were done, and whether debts and liquor had been paid for. He would also check the books for the liquor payments when he went down to the club, about once a week. Rajendran said that he started to go down around December 2015 or January 2016 to check on the books and the renovation. At that time, he found out that the club was still loss making.

90     Rajendran said aside from the $40,000 that he had invested in the club, by the middle of January 2016, he was asked to come up with about $200 for liquor. He also paid another $10,000 sometime around February to the landlord, and Sasikumar paid the same amount of money. This was after the landlord threatened to sue them for the rental payment. Rajendran said that he felt that Sasikumar had not been truthful with him about the problems that had been existing at the club, which he only found out when the debts surfaced. Rajendran claimed that he did not ask Sasikumar about the finances of the club, but trusted Sasikumar “blindly”.[^25] By February 2016, he realised that his $40,000 investment was lost.

91     Rajendran described Roky as an agent who was not an employee of the club. He was introduced to Roky by Mohan who had informed him that Roky was an agent for the girls and also did some works like plumbing at the club. In addition, Rajendran said that he had seen Roky doing the toilet plumbing and some piping works, although he did not ask Roky if he was a contractor.Rajendran said that he did not give Roky any instructions and neither has he seen Sasikumar do so.

92     However, Rajendran admitted that he had paid Roky. This included a sum of $5,200 for two artistes, V2 and Prishana, to be employed by the club. Their names had been obtained from Roky and he had filled in a payment voucher (P18). Rajendran had also made another payment of $1,200 to Roky in the month of January as commission for the months of September, October and December.

93     Rajendran claimed that neither he nor Sasikumar had used Roky as a translator or interpreter for the Bengali dancers, claiming that he did not understand Roky’s English. He also initially said that he did not know that Roky was employed at one of Sasikumar’s companies until after MOM’s investigations into the club’s employment of illegal workers. Rajendran also said that there was no bad blood between Roky and him.[^26] Rajendran claimed that from 30th November 2015, Roky has not contacted Rajendran on his mobile phone. Nor had Rajendran spoken to Roky to inform him that he has been banned from Singapore, or to speak about Roky’s work permit.

94     As regards the allegations made against him by V1, Rajendran denied that V1 had made payments to him or to Sasikumar when they were sitting next to each other. Rajendran also said that he has never sat next to V1 at the club. He said that, in fact, he has never even met V1 at the club or spoken to her. Neither has she handed him money before. Further, he claimed that neither V1 nor any other artiste had come over to where he was seated when he was at the club. Rajendran further denied that he lived on the immoral earnings of V1, and said that he does at not need this money as he is a paid employee with a monthly income.

95     Rajendran, however, claimed that around January 2016, Mohan had called him at around 11.30 pm to 12.00 am and informed him that there were two girls and two guys fighting in the club. The two guys were Montin and Tapas and the two girls were V2 and V1. Rajendran, however, did not witness this incident. Rajendran also said that Montin is V1’s boyfriend.

96     As for V2, Rajendran denied her allegation that a customer, Anwar, had given some money to him, and that he had asked her to go out with that customer for sex. Rajendran also denied that he showed V2 $2,000, or that he had indicated to her that a sum of $1,000 was for her, while the rest of the $1,000 was for him. Rajendran further denied that he had been to the smoking room at the club, which he said was only for the lady dancers. He also said that he did not slap V2 inside the smoking room, after offering her money to go out with customers, nor had he threatened her or assaulted her. Rajendran said that there was a CCTV recorder in the smoking room, although it has been taken by the landlord as the accused persons owed two months of rental. He reiterated that he does not even speak to V2, or to any of the other dancers except for Sri Devi whom he knew.

97     Rajendran also said that he had never been to the Bukit Merah premises except during the police investigations, and one other time, during the Chinese New Year when he had passed food to the dancers. On that occasion, he had arrived there after being informed by Lewin, the deejay, that they had no food. Sasikumar went there later that same day.

98     Rajendran said that on that occasion, both he and Sasikumar had stayed with the dancers for a while. Rajendran said that he did not bring alcohol and does not remember whether there was any alcohol there. Rajendran, however, denied that there was any occasion when he and Sasikumar had gone to the Bukit Merah premises where alcohol was poured for V2 and she resisted drinking it. He also denied having had sex with any of the dancers there.

99     On 11 February 2016, Rajendran learnt from one of the dancers that the girls did not return to their accommodation. Rajendran subsequently spoke to Sasikumar and they met just outside the club near to a “Cheers” store. At that time, Roky came to the location. Rajendran said that this encounter with Roky was a coincidental meeting.

100    When they met, Roky had started by talking to Sasikumar for one or two minutes. Subsequently, as all three of them were walking, Roky asked Rajendran to lend him $500 to send back to his father who had suffered an injury or an accident. Rajendran only agreed to lend Roky $200 as he said that he could only afford that amount. Rajendran said that the money was given to Roky “because he said he has no money to eat.”[^27] Roky said he would return the money after he got his salary. Rajendran and Sasikumar then continued walking to Cantonment Police Station to make a report, while Roky went to Outram MRT Station.

101    Rajendran denied the allegation that he and Sasikumar had intentionally obstructed the course of justice by arranging for Roky to leave Singapore in order to evade arrest. Rajendran also denied knowing that Roky’s work permit was cancelled by ASR, or that he had asked Roky to go to Malaysia. In addition, he claimed that he did not tell Roky that he was banned and could not come back to Singapore. Further, Rajendran said that he did not meet nor communicate with Roky after giving him the $200.

### Sasikumar’s evidence

102    Sasikumar testified that he owns a few companies in Singapore and India, including ASR Mixed Construction Private Limited and Nine Silver Private Limited. The latter company ran Kollywood, which employed dancers from India and Bangladesh. Sasikumar said that his businesses in India were successful, while Nine Silver was manageable. Sasikumar said that as he was a very busy man, he had very little time for the management of the club, and basically left the deejays to run the place for him.The deejay and the floor manager would make decisions on revenue and expenses, and he would approve them.

103    Sasikumar said that Roky was a Bangladeshi construction worker whom he employed to work at ASR Mixed Construction Private Limited. Roky did not work in Kollywood but he would go there for drinks. After Roky found out that Sasikumar was the boss of the club, Roky had told Sasikumar that he could bring his friends there to the club. Roky also subsequently offered to work on a part-time basis as a handyman to repair toilet bowls and air-conditioners. Roky was not paid for such work, but he was allowed to have drinks for free.

104    Sasikumar communicated with Roky in English. Sasikumar said that Roky’s work permit was applied for on 25 March 2015 and it was cancelled on 12 February 2016 by Sasikumar, as Roky had told him on the 11th of February that he wanted to go back. Sasikumar had said to Roky if he wanted to go back to Bangladesh, then Sasikumar would cancel his work permit

105    Sasikumar said that after Rajendran joined the club, he had given Roky $1,200 (as shown in a payment voucher P19), as a commission for introducing Rajendran to Sasikumar. At that time, Sasikumar had wanted to sell the club even though he said that financial situation of the club was manageable and Roky had thus introduced him to Rajendran. The latter became his partner on 30 November 2015, after paying Sasikumar a sum of $40,000 for a 50% share.

106    According to Sasikumar, Rajendran agreed to be an active partner. Sasikumar had then introduced him to the staff and informed them that from 1 December 2015, Rajendran was a partner. Sasikumar said that he had also told Mohan to take out all the books, passport, ATM card, cheque, chequebook, and the keys to the premises and to hand them to Rajendran. Sasikumar said that after this, he only went to the club about once or twice, and was no longer involved in the business. However, Rajendran would still ask Sasikumar if the latter’s approval was required or when there was money to be paid. Sasikumar also claimed that after November 2015, he “did not speak to anybody about anything”,[^28] and that from 1 December 2015 to 11 February 2016, he had no dealings with the accounts of the club. Rajendran also did not speak to him about the dancers after he took over. In addition, Sasikumar denied that there were renovations done at the club, and that Rajendran was asked to top up another $10,000 for this.

107    For V1, who was employed as a dancer, Sasikumar testified that her application for a work permit was made on 28 April 2015, and issued on 12 September 2015. It was due to expire on 7 March 2016. She was engaged through Roky who had provided her photograph. Sasikumar said that the money involved for hiring her was given to her Bangladeshi agent through Roky, who had sent it through Western Union. Roky was not paid for his services.

108    Sasikumar said that there were also other Bangladeshi girls hired and their salary range was between $800 - $900 monthly, or about 50,000 Taka. This was the quantum of their salary even though in their in-principle approval (“IPA”), their salaries were stated to be $1,350 per month. Sasikumar said that the higher amount in the IPA had been incorrectly indicated by his secretary.

109    As for housing the Bangladeshi girls, before 1st December 2015, they resided at 75A Kampong Bahru. After the 1st week of December 2015, they were housed at a flat in Bukit Merah. When asked about a payment of $5,200 made to Roky on 15 December 2015, Sasikumar said that Rajendran had informed him that the money was for recruiting V2 and \[SB\]. This money consisted of $1000 each from Rajendran and Sasikumar, with the rest of the money taken from the club’s income.

110    Sasikumar said that D3 was a payment voucher for V1’s salary. He said that he was told by his then deejay, Robin, that V1 had signed on the voucher to acknowledge that $1,042 had already been paid to her through the transfer made by Roky to her agent Mamun on the 9th of September 2015. When confronted by the DPP that D3 showed V1’s salary was $1,042 for 18 days of work, which would mean that her salary for the entire month would be $1737 or about 95,000 Takas, Sasikumar first claimed that he does not know how D3 was prepared, before later saying that the amount stated in D3 was not the salary for 18 days of work for the month of September 2015. He insisted that the salary for each dancer was 50,000 Takas per month.

111    Sasikumar also explained that there was a Western Union remittance slip, D4, which showed that V1’s salary of S$907.23, or about 50,000 Takas for the month of October 2015, was remitted to her mother. Sasikumar also said that a later sum of only 33,000 Takas was remitted as $300 had been deducted from her salary for that month because she wanted to buy a mobile phone. For her December 2015 salary, Sasikumar said that Rajendran had informed him that the money was remitted through Western Union, and that V1 had signed on the payment voucher D5 to acknowledge this. Sasikumar also explained that after the complaint was made at MOM by the dancers, a MOM officer had indicated that the difference between the salary stated in the IPA, and the agreed salary, came up to $2,702. Sasikumar said that this was amount was paid to V1, and that she had signed P11 to acknowledge receipt of this payment. Sasikumar said that he had not previously spotted that the wrong amount of salary was indicated in the IPA for each and every dancer.[^29]

112    Sasikumar also denied V1’s claim that she was required to reach an earnings target of $6,000 per month. He said that neither he nor Rajendran had set any target for the dancers to achieve, nor had he told Roky of this, even though this figure of $6,000 was mentioned in Roky’s statement (P21).

113    As regards the system of tips, Sasikumar said that if a customer likes a performing artiste, he would give her a tip to drop into a compartment in a box bearing her name. The box for the tips was opened each evening by the deejay and witnessed by all the artistes, and the amount of tips would be recorded in a monthly sales account book. If the performing artiste receives a tip of $300 or $400, she would be given an incentive of $50 that same day, although Sasikumar insisted that there was no minimum amount of tips that each of them had to collect. When a performing artiste gets the incentive, she would have to acknowledge and sign in the sales account book.

114    Sasikumar, however, said that because he was busy and has many businesses to take care of, he had not actually seen the incentive payments being made to the performing artistes nor had he seen their signing to acknowledge receipt of payment, although the deejay would Whatsapp him with the information. The remaining moneys from the tips and liquor sales were banked into the company’s account. Sasikumar also said that he paid for the daily necessities of the artistes and the expenses they incurred when they went on a trip to visit Marina Bay Sands on 12 December 2015.

115    Sasikumar said that he did not have any disagreements with V1 when was she working at Bollywood, nor had she told him that she was unhappy working at the club. He was not aware of her relationship with Monti, or about any boyfriend that she had when she was employed at Kollywood

116    As regards the two incidents mentioned by V1 concerning being asked to have sex with customers, Sasikumar denied involvement with either incident.

> (a)     As regards the first incident, which allegedly happened after the club had closed for the night, Sasikumar denied that Roky had told V1 to go out and have sex with clients, or that this was done by Roky after Sasikumar had given him such instructions. Sasikumar said that he does not stay until the club closes as he has many projects. Neither had he gone to meet V1 downstairs at her Bukit Merah flat on this occasion. He also denied that she had handed $500 to him which she received from the man that she had slept with. Sasikumar claimed that these claims were fabrications made by V1 against him.[^30]

> (b)     As regards the second incident mentioned by V1, about having been told by Roky to have sex with another customer and that her salary would be paid if she did so, Sasikumar denied having said this to Roky. Instead, Sasikumar said that all their employees’ salaries had been settled and that there was in fact $1,000 in the club at that time. Sasikumar also said that when he goes to the club, the only thing he says to Roky is “Hi, how are you?” [^31] In addition, Sasikumar denied knowing that V1 had been driven out by a man to have sex with him. Further, he denied that V1 had given $500 to Rajendran in Sasikumar’s presence in the club, which was money allegedly paid by the man for having sex with him. Sasikumar claimed that V1 had fabricated this account, and about Sasikumar having instructed her, through Roky, to have sex with customers. In fact, Sasikumar said that from 1 December 2015 until February 2016, he did not even meet Rajendran.

117    Sasikumar also said that he does not know anything about Rajendran having asked V2 to go out with Anwar for sex. However, Sasikumar admitted that he did not tell any of the dancers about the police hotline number, or that they could call the police if a wrong had been committed against them.[^32] Further, he was not aware about any raid to remove duty unpaid cigarettes from the flat at Bukit Merah, even though this was mentioned by Rajendran in court.

118    Sasikumar testified about the visit that he and Rajendran had made to the Bukit Merah flat where the artistes were staying. This was during Chinese New Year. There were five artistes there: Ashwini, V1, \[AB\], \[SB\], and V2. While Rajendran and Sasikumar had brought food there, the girls requested for $200 from them to buy additional food, cigarettes, alcohol and a lot of things for themselves. Rajendran and Sasikumar had given them the money. After waiting 45 minutes there for food to be delivered, Sasikumar had left, followed by Rajendran. Sasikumar said that when they were at the premises, none of the girls consumed alcohol. Also, none of them voiced any discontent or dissatisfaction about working at the club. Instead, they looked happy and were enjoying themselves.

119    Sasikumar said that one of the girls, \[SB\] had taken a photograph of him with her phone. Sasikumar had asked her to delete the photograph. He said that he suspected that this was the reason why the four girls had run away two days later on 11 February 2016. Aside from this, he does not know why they would run away. He said that there were no unhappy incidents that occurred at Bukit Merah between Rajendran and Sasikumar with \[AB\], V1 or V2.

120    Sasikumar said that on 10 February 2016, he had gone to Malaysia and returned that same day. On the following day, he discovered a few missed calls from Rajendran. Sasikumar then contacted Rajendran who had told him that the performing artistes from the club had gone missing. He also asked Sasikumar to go the club immediately.

121    Sasikumar said that he later met Rajendran outside the club at a row of shop houses. While they were talking, Roky came towards them and said that he had been informed about the girls going missing. According to Sasikumar, Roky also informed him that he wanted to go back home.

122    Sasikumar claimed that Roky was like a troublemaker to him. So when Roky said he wanted to go back, Sasikumar said that he would cancel Roky’s work permit and give him a special pass. However, Roky told him not to do this and instead said that he would go to Malaysia to see a friend or relative, and then leave for home from there. Roky also said that he would go immediately. He then asked Sasikumar for money. When Sasikumar said that he did not have money, Roky went to speak to Rajendran, who then gave money to Roky.

123    After this, both Rajendran and Sasikumar went to Cantonment as Rajendran wanted to make a police report. Roky then allegedly informed Sasikumar that he would follow Rajendran’s friend, Siva, who were involved in the catering business to Johor Bahru. Sasikumar claimed that Roky’s passport had earlier been given back to him as Roky had wanted to travel to Malaysia or Bangladesh. Roky did not return the passport to him after that.

124    After this encounter with Roky on 11 February 2016, Rajendran and Sasikumar went to the police station, and were told to go back and return with the passports of the girls. Sasikumar said that on the following day (12 February 2016) he had informed his secretary to cancel Roky’s work permit.

125    Sasikumar said that he has not seen Roky since then nor had he spoken to Roky. Sasikumar denied that he and Rajendran had arranged for Roky to leave Singapore so that Roky would not be arrested. He also denied having told Roky that his friend would pick him up and drive him to Malaysia and that Sasikumar would hand Roky’s passport to his friend. Instead, Sasikumar said that it was Roky himself who wanted to leave Singapore.

126    When asked about what Roky had stated in his statement (P21), Sasikumar admitted that it was his company, ASR Mixed Construction Private Limited, which was employing Roky. However, he denied that he had informed Roky that he would be working at the club. Sasikumar initially also denied that Roky worked or stayed at premises above the club. Instead, he claimed that Roky worked at construction sites from March to September 2015, and that he only came to the club in the evenings as a customer with his friends. Sasikumar, however admitted that Roky worked in the club on a part time basis repairing toilet bowls, “aircons” and did some electrical works, although Roky did not get any salary for working there.

127    Sasikumar also denied the account in Roky’s statement that he and Rajendran had given Roky instructions to follow them to the airport to fetch the dancers, or to bring them for medical check-ups or to the lodging house. Sasikumar further disagreed with Roky’s statement that they had set the monthly earnings target of $6,000 for the dancers to reach. While he agreed that Roky had acted as an interpreter for him when conversing with the Bangladeshi dancers, Sasikumar said that he does not know if Roky continued playing this role after Rajendran joined the club. Sasikumar reiterated that after 11 February 2016, he had not spoken to Roky, and only saw him again in court.

128    Sasikumar was also questioned about various discrepancies between his account in court and the accounts in two statements (P26 and P27) that he had given to an MOM statement recorder. I will discuss this aspect of his evidence at a later part of this Grounds of Decision.

## General approach on assessing the evidence

129    The Prosecution argued that the case had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Its arguments could be summarised as follows:[^33]

> (a)     The court ought to accord full weight to V1’s and V2’s testimonies, the material aspects of which were internally and mutually consistent. Both of them were unusually convincing witnesses whose testimonies alone warranted convicting the accused persons on all charges. In addition, their accounts were corroborated by MOM discharge of claims forms, tips collection notebooks and P21 (Roky’s statement).

> (b)     V1 and V2 have no motive to falsely implicate the accused persons. In particular, they were happy with Sasikumar and V1 consistently testified that he was a “good boss” and “good man”.

> (c)     The accused persons were not credible witnesses, and only provided bare denials to the charges. Apart from their evidence not being corroborated by external evidence, there were stark inconsistencies (i) within their testimonies, (ii) between their testimonies, and (iii) against their previous statements given to two different enforcement agencies, which showed that they were not able to provide a coherent or credible account. The accused persons’ credit were successfully impeached, and they were proved to be habitual liars who spun elaborate stories to exonerate themselves in Court.

130    In assessing the evidence tendered, it was clear that the main evidence against the accused persons on the vice-related WC and PHTA charges came from the testimonies of the alleged victims, V1 and V2, although there were other pieces of corroborative evidence put forward in terms of the documents related to the performing artistes’ earnings and salaries, as well as the contents of Roky’s statement. As for the obstruction of justice charge, the evidence against the accused persons, was largely contained in Roky’s statement and in Sasikumar’s statements, as well as aspects of the testimonies from the two victims concerning the events that led up to Roky’s departure from Singapore.

131    In so far as the assessment of the credibility of a witness is concerned, Yong Pung How CJ in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> had set out clear guidelines for the court to adopt. At \[9\], his Honour held that a judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following: - (a) his demeanour, (b) the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence, and (c) the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and the extrinsic evidence. Further, it is clear that where the evidence of a witness is uncorroborated, his/her evidence must be _“unusually convincing”_ in order to constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt.[^34]

132    The law, however, recognises that the presence of discrepancies in the evidence of a witness does not _ipso facto_ mean that the witness should not be believed.

133    In _Osman Bin Din v Public Prosecutor_ \[1995\] 2 SLR 129 (“_Osman bin Din_”), the Court of Appeal at \[39\] cited with approval the following reminder of Abdul Hamid J in _Chean Siong Guan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span>:

> Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. **Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies**. Absolute truth is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. **In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court**…

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

134    Similarly, in _Public Prosecutor v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)_ <span class="citation">\[1977\] 1 MLJ 15</span>, Raja Azlan Shah FJ stated:

> I shall be almost inclined to think that **if there are no discrepancies, it might be suggested that they have concocted their accounts of what had happened or what had been said because their versions are too consistent. The question is whether the existence of certain discrepancies is sufficient to destroy their credibility...**

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

135    Further in _Ng Kwee Leong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> (“_Ng Kwee Leong_”) at \[13\], Yong Pung How CJ had this to say:

> Counsel for the appellant sought to make a great deal out of these discrepancies. In the appeal to this court, the trial judge was criticised for having accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses despite the presence of these discrepancies. **The short answer to this was that the discrepancies relied on by the appellant were all immaterial discrepancies, that is, they had no direct bearing on the facts in issue. In other words, they had nothing to do with the question whether it was the appellant who committed the offence.** In my judgment, the trial judge was perfectly entitled to find that these discrepancies did not detract from the general veracity of the prosecution witnesses on the material issues and to accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses on those issues.

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

136    Finally, in _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> (“_Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy_”) at \[82\], V K Rajah J (as he then was) stated that:

> “It is trite law that **minor discrepancies in a witness’s testimony should not be held against the witness in assessing his credibility.** This is because human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is both common and understandable: Chean Siong Guat v PP <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span> (“Chean Siong Guat”) at 63–64; Ng Kwee Leong v PP <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> at \[17\]. Inconsistencies in a witness’s statement may also be the result of different interpretations of the same event: Chean Siong Guat… **But a court is perfectly entitled, notwithstanding minor inconsistencies, to hold that a particular witness is in fact a witness of truth and to accept the other aspects of his testimony which are untainted by discrepancies****_”._**

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

137    Bearing in mind the guidance set out by the courts on the approach to take in assessing the evidence and the credibility of witnesses, I now turn to discuss the evidence before me, and the arguments put forward by the parties.

## Evaluating the evidence against the accused persons on the WC charges

138    V1 was the victim named in the two WC charges that both the accused persons as well as Roky were alleged to have been guilty of, namely that they had procured her for the purpose of prostitution, and had knowingly living in part on her earnings from prostitution.

139    Having assessed her evidence and the other evidence put up by the Prosecution, I was of the view that V1 was unusually convincing, and that her evidence, together with other corroborative evidence, made out the charges framed by the Prosecution.

### V1 was highly believable and her evidence was compelling

140    V1 was put on the stand for about 9 days, during which she was subjected to detailed questioning from the DPP (during examination-in-chief and re-examination), and to intense and rigorous cross-examination by three different sets of counsel (for the two accused persons and Roky).

141    In particular, V1 was asked and challenged on various aspects of her evidence including:

> (a)     Her previous life in Bangladeshi prior to coming to Singapore and joining the club as a performing artiste;

> (b)     Her history and activities at the club, including her working and living conditions, and her salary and earnings;

> (c)     Her interactions with the accused persons, and with Roky, the performing artistes and others at the club;

> (d)     The two incidents where she had sex with the customers and handed over the money to the accused persons;

> (e)     The incident at the Bukit Merah flat where the accused persons allegedly came over with alcohol and food which they consumed with the performing artistes;

> (f)     The unexpected departure of the Bangladeshi performing artistes from the flat on 11 February 2016; and

> (g)     The actions taken to recover the rest of her earnings from the accused persons.

142    Having carefully observed her demeanour and examined the responses she gave to the forceful questions and challenges put to her, I was of the view that she was steadfast and believable, even when she was put under extreme scrutiny. Clearly, she gave a highly credible, coherent and consistent account of the circumstances and commission of the offences by the accused persons, which essentially established the elements of the WC charges.

143    As for matters raised by counsel, which they argued amounted to discrepancies in V1’s evidence, such as the amount of money that V1 received in the various months that she worked there, her evidence concerning her salary, and whether she was asked by the accused persons for the money given by the customer after the occasions of sex with them etc., I agree with the Prosecution that many of the issues raised were not actually discrepancies, or if they were, they were clearly minor in nature, or on immaterial matters, or they were explained away by her in the course of her evidence. In short, matters raised by the Defence had little effect on V1’s credibility and her evidence on the material issues were left intact (see _Osman Bin Din v Public Prosecutor_, _Ng Kwee Leong v Public Prosecutor_ and _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ at \[132\] above).

144    In this regard, in considering her evidence, I noted that V1 maintained that she had been informed that she was to be paid 100,000 Takas a month, although she and her family actually only received a total of 83,000 Takas (50,000 Takas on one occasion and 33,000 Takas on another) together with a mobile phone purchased on her behalf, for the entire four and a half months that she worked at the club. I will discuss further the evidence that corroborated V1’s claim on this issue at a later part of this GD. Suffice to say that in evaluating her evidence, I also noted that the incidents took place in January 2016, while V1 only testified about them (over several tranches) in 2018, which was almost two and a half years later. In this regard, I would repeat the words of VK Rajah J where His Honour had stated that “…human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is both common and understandable” (_Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy_ at \[82\]).

145    All in all, on material matters relating directly to the crux of the charges against the accused persons, it was obvious that V1 was coherent, and her evidence cogent and compelling.

### V1’s evidence clearly implicated the accused persons and Roky

146    To reiterate, as regards the two instances of prostitution:

> (a)     V1 had testified that the first incident took place in early January 2016, after Rajendran had joined the club. In this regard, it was an agreed fact that Rajendran was already a director and a shareholder by then. It was also not disputed that Rajendran had already been introduced to the staff of Kollywood as the boss by Sasikumar by the time of this first incident.

> (b)     On this occasion, Sasikumar, V1 and Roky were seated when Sasikumar spoke to Roky in English, following which Roky immediately translated to V1 in Bengali stating that Sasikumar wanted her to have sex with a customer who had given collections. While she initially refused the request, Sasikumar persisted and told her (through Roky) that his friend has given her a lot of collections. As V1 was worried that he would not pay her salary, she reluctantly agreed. After she returned to the Bukit Merah flat, Roky called to go down, and when she did so, Sasikumar was waiting downstairs next to a taxi. He gestured for her to follow his friend in the taxi. V1 recognised the friend to be someone whom she had danced with on stage and who given her collections the night before. They subsequently had sex. While she initially refused $500 that he offered her, she eventually took the money when he sent her back in a taxi to her Bukit Merah flat, and he re-offered her the money. At that stage, Sasikumar, who saw the money being offered to V1, gestured for her to take the money. She did so and then passed the money to Sasikumar.

> (c)     V1’s second instance of prostitution occurred after a party at Kollywood in January 2016. Sasikumar, Roky and V1 were seated on the brown sofa as shown in P1(9). Again Sasikumar had spoken to Roky following which Roky had said to V1 “Boss is asking you to go out with customer again.” When V1 again refused, Roky told V1 to go as “Boss said he will pay you salary.” Because her salary was important and she wanted to be paid, V1 gave in. Similar to the first occasion, V1 returned to the flat, and was then told by Roky to go downstairs. There, deejay Mohan was waiting and he led her to a car which the customer was driving. V1 recognised this customer as someone who had danced with her on the stage. He later brought her to a room where they had sex. The second customer gave V1 $500. This time, she took the money immediately. Subsequently she returned to her flat at Bukit Merah. Later that same night at the club, when Sasikumar and Rajendran were together, she handed the money to them. Roky was also present.

147    When questioned, V1 denied the suggestion that she had voluntarily had sex with the customers. She also testified that she could not have done this without the bosses’ knowledge, because the dancers were “under lock and key all the time”[^35] V1 further said that the monies that she made from these acts of prostitution, that V1 passed to them, were not shared with her. She also explained that she had sex because she was concerned that she would not get her promised salary of 100,000 Takas if she did not do so.

148    While counsel for Sasikumar argued that V1’s evidence on this issue was inconsistent with her testimony that she expected to get all her money when she returned to Bangladesh,[^36] with respect, I saw no inconsistency in her account. In this regard, V1 was clear that the amount that she had been paid (including 50,000 Taka on the first occasion and 33,000 Taka on the second occasion) fell short of what she was promised (100,000 Taka per month). While she believed that she would get the rest of the money from the accused persons when she returned to Bangladesh in February 2016, it was not surprising that – in January 2016 when she was told to have sex with the customers – she would be concerned that she would not be paid the outstanding salary (by the time she left Singapore) if she refused the request to have sex with the customers on each of the two occasions. In fact, V1 said that Rajendran had previously threatened the girls that he would not pay them their salary if they could not collect more money.

149    Thus, when asked to explain why she finally agreed to have sex with the customers despite her initial hesitation, V1 had explained that she did so because she was concerned that she would not be paid her salary if she refused. In other words, when she actually complied with their instructions to have sex with the customers, she did so as she believed that the money she “earned” this way would go towards reaching her monthly target of $6,000. It was thus not surprising that she would then have no reason to fear – by the time she left for Bangladesh in February 2016 – that she would receive what she expected to be paid _ie_, her full salary of 100,000 Takas a month, if she compiled with what she was asked to do by the accused persons. In other words, contrary to the claim of the Defence, V1’s evidence on these issues was a lot more cogent and coherent than what the Defence suggested.

150    As for the fact that V1 and the accused persons did not speak the same language, and while V1 did not speak directly to the accused persons on both occasions leading up to the sex and her transfer of the prostitution money to them, I noted that the accused persons’ instructions to V1 were often communicated through Roky, and that this would be done immediately after they had said something to Roky in her presence.

151    In addition, I noted that Sasikumar’s subsequent actions, and further instructions to Roky to get her to change her mind on both occasions when she initially refused to have sex with the customers, were fully consistent with his understanding that she was refusing to do what she was asked. They also showed that there was in fact clear communication between Sasikumar and V1 throughout, and that this was carried out through Roky acting as the interpreter between them, which was also a role that Roky confirmed that he performed.

152    Further, Sasikumar’s actions in facilitating the acts of prostitution thereafter, by meeting V1 at the taxi that was to send her to the first customer’s place for sex, and in collecting the proceeds from her prostitution on that very same day that she was paid for the sex, all pointed to his clear understanding, involvement and role in the process, despite never having spoken the same language as her. The same could be said about the payment collected by the accused persons (when sitting together) from V1 in the club, on the date after she had sex with the second customer. That this money was collected directly by Rajendran (in Sasikumar’s presence) from V1,, and that this was not money she put into the tip box, also showed that they were all aware that the $500 was not normal tips that she received for dancing for customers in the club.

### V1’s evidence was externally consistent and corroborated

153    Further, I agreed with the Prosecution that V1’s evidence was externally consistent in material particulars, and corroborated by other pieces of evidence. In this regard, I noted that:

> (a)     V1 herself explained that she had engaged in the acts of prostitution, despite her initial refusal, because she was pressured and wanted to be paid her salary. In this regard, I accepted that she had been promised a monthly salary of 100,000 Takas, but that she was never paid this full amount by the accused persons before the offences. Further, I also noted that V1’s evidence on this important issue was corroborated by the following evidence:

>> (i)       V2, who was another Bangladeshi performing artiste, confirmed that she too was told that as a performing artiste, she would be paid 100,000 Takas a month;

>> (ii)       D3, a defence exhibit, was a pay advice that stated that V1’s salary for her (18 days of work in September 2015) was $1,042. Extrapolating this figure for the entire month, her full month’s pay would come up to around $1,737 (~95,535 Taka), and not $800 (~50,000 Taka) that Sasikumar had claimed. While Sasikumar tried to suggest that he did know how D3 was prepared or who prepared it, I noted that this was a document prepared when Sasikumar was the sole director, and it was also an exhibit that he sought to rely on.

>> (iii)       D3 was not the only document that supported V1’s (and V2’s claims). P10 and P11, which were the Discharge of Claims documents by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), stated that Nine Silver paid _outstanding_ salaries of (a) $2,702 to V1, and (b) $525 (approximately 38,000 Takas) to V2 for the period 17 January 2016 to 11 February 2016. As Sasikumar testified that the outstanding salary of $2,702 was paid to V1 only for January 2016 and for 11 or 12 days of work in February 2016),[^37] this again showed that V1’s full month’s pay would come to around 106,150 Takas, certainly higher than the 50,000 Takas that Sasikumar claimed.

>> (iv)       While Sasikumar insisted that V1’s salary of $1,350 stated in her IPA (see above at \[108\]) was a wrong figure, and that it should be 50,000 Takas (about $800-$900), I agreed that Sasikumar’s claim that V1’s salary was only 50,000 Takas was inconsistent with all the above documents. Even though Sasikumar sought to blame his secretary for allegedly indicating the wrong salary amount in the IPA, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that his claim could hardly be believed. In this regard, Sasikumar neither named this secretary nor called her to testify. Further, it was hardly likely that the salary amount had been wrongly stated for the application of every single Bangladeshi performing artistes since 2014, and that this had not been noticed by Sasikumar even though he received every single IPA after it was approved.[^38]

>> (v)       Further, I noted that while Sasikumar denied that he had said to Roky (for the latter to convey to V1) that he would pay V1’s salary if she had sex with the customer since he claimed that he paid the performing artistes their salaries every month, Sasikumar’s claims were clearly inconsistent with the fact that he subsequently had to, and did, pay V1 for the outstanding salary owed to her when he was confronted at MOM.

>> (vi)       This issue about the correct figure for V1’s salary was an important issue, since it went to the heart of why V1 agreed to having sex with the customers despite her initial reluctance, and despite not receiving a direct cut of the profits.

> (b)     V1 testified that she was constantly pressurised by the accused persons (her bosses) to earn $6,000 a month as a performing artiste. While this was denied by the accused persons, the evidence clearly supported V1’s account:

>> (i)       First, V2, who came to Singapore on 16 January 2016 and worked for barely a month at the club before fleeing, similarly testified that she was told that her total monthly collection has to be above $6,000 before she was paid;

>> (ii)       Roky who had stated in his statement P21 that he was used by the accused persons to communicate with the Bangladeshi performing artistes like V2 and V1, something confirmed by Sasikumar in his statement P27, had also said that the Bangladeshi performing artistes had an earnings target of $6,000 (answer to Q25). If they failed to meet this target, the bosses (i.e. the accused persons) would be very angry.

>> (iii)       It was thus no wonder that V1 felt pressurised to accede to the request to have sex with the customers, and to pass on these “takings” from her prostitution to her bosses. She also did not ask for a cut of the money, as she considered the money earned would go towards meeting her monthly target of $6,000.

> (c)     V2, who joined the club in January 2016, testified that she knew that other Bangladeshi artistes, including V1, had gone out with customers to have sex.[^39] V2 mentioned that she had witnessed a customer paid money to someone in Kollywood (she cannot remember who), so that he could take V1 out for sex. The following day at about 1 pm, V1 had returned crying and had told the artistes that she had sex with Tapas.[^40] While Mr Fernando took issue with the fact that what V2 said she saw was not even corroborated by V1 herself, I noted that V2 had not said anything about V1 having seen the customer pay the money in the club (for her to have sex). It could well have been that this payment was witnessed by V2 but not by V1 herself. As for the argument raised by Mr Fernando that V1 had not mentioned that she cried when she returned to the apartment, this did not appear to be something that was expressly asked of her. While I also noted that V2 had testified that V1 said that she had sex with Tapas (rather than with a Tamil speaking person), I noted that V2’s testimony was given more than two years after the event. Further, by her own account, she was not very friendly with V1. Thus, what V2 could recall of that conversation with V1, or what or how much V1 may actually have told V2, was not entirely clear.

### V1 has no reason to lie and falsely implicate the accused persons

154    Having considered the totality of the evidence, it must be said that V1, and apparently the rest of performing artistes, had a much better relationship with Sasikumar than with Rajendran. This was explained by the difference in the way the accused persons treated the performing artistes.

155    That said, there was nothing on the facts presented to show that V1 had any reason to lie, fabricate evidence or to falsely implicate Rajendran, let alone to do the same to Sasikumar or Roky (who was also jointly charged for the offences), especially since it was clear that she had a relatively good impression of the latter two persons.

156    I would add that I agreed with the Prosecution that until the Defence has shown that the complainant (_ie_, V1) has a motive to falsely implicate an accused, the burden does not fall on the Prosecution to disprove that motive. This position is set out in _Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 374</span>, where Yong Pung How CJ had explained at \[33\] the Prosecution’s burden in relation to the issue of motive as follows:

> \[W\]here the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to disprove that motive. **This does not mean that the accused merely needs to allege that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him. Instead, the accused must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. Only then would the burden of proof shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive.** To hold otherwise would mean that the Prosecution would have the burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the accused in literally every case, thereby practically instilling a lack of such a motive as a constituent element of every offence.

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

157    This same position was reiterated by Aedit Abdullah J in the recent case of _Public Prosecutor v Roger Yue Jr[^41]_ where His Honour had made it clear at \[49\] that “…as the Defence did not raise evidence of any motive on the part of the Victim to make false allegations against the Accused, the burden on the Prosecution to disprove such motive did not arise.”

158    On the facts of the present case, I accepted that V1 had no reason to lie about the accused persons, or about Roky, and certainly not to fabricate damning account of what she said they did to her. To suggest further that she would do so in a way that was highly embarrassing to herself, by saying that she had prostituted herself and sold her body for money, was difficult to believe.

159    Further, I noted that even as V1 ultimately gave in and provided sex to the two customers at the persistent requests of Sasikumar, so that she would be paid her salary, V1 continued to maintain that Sasikumar was a “good man” and a “good boss” who provided them with daily necessities and treated them well.On the other hand, even though Rajendran was apparently less directly involved (than Sasikumar) with getting her to have sex with the customers, V1 said that in contrast to Sasikumar, Rajendran was “not very good boss”,[^42] and was a “headache” to the artistes, as Rajendran confiscated their phones and threatened to withhold their salaries if their collections were not satisfactory.[^43]

160    I thus agreed that if V1 really wanted to cook up a story against Rajendran, there was no reason for her to also falsely implicate Sasikumar, with whom her relationship was relatively good, or to lie about the involvement of Roky, her countryman, with whom she respected as an elder brother. Instead, she would have solely implicated Rajendran since he (alone) was someone who she (V1) apparently did not like.

161    Indeed, Sasikumar was not able to suggest any reason why V1 would falsely implicate him. He also admitted that he did not have any disagreements or unhappiness with V1, that he even brought them for outings and paid for their expenses.[^44]While Sasikumar did, somewhat belatedly, allude to the incident at the Bukit Merah flat, where one of the performing artistes, \[SB\] had taken a photo of him without his permission, and said that he had asked her to delete the photograph, it was relevant to note that this had nothing to do with V1 (or V2 for that matter). In any event, as pointed out by the Prosecution, there was no suggestion that the photograph showed Sasikumar being inappropriate dressed or in any kind of compromising position. Also, the photograph had been deleted. I agreed that this account was just a red herring.

162    Neither was Rajendran able to say why V1 would make such serious allegations against him, aside from alluding to an incident in December 2015, where he had allegedly caught V2 and V1 dancing together on stage and had expressed disapproval. However, this claim of Rajendran was clearly untrue since V2 was not even in Singapore until 16 January 2016.[^45] Other attempts made by Rajendran to cast aspersions against V1 and V2 such as suggesting that they were involved in a fight at the club, as well as suggesting that they were involved in cigarette smuggling, both incidents of which the Police had to be called, were also debunked by objective evidence that the Police were not activated on either occasion. These alleged incidents were in any event denied by the victims, and also were not corroborated by Sasikumar.

163    Further, I also agreed with the Prosecution that the suggestion made by Rajendran’s counsel that V1 had made false allegations in order to extend her stay in Singapore, simply held no water. Instead, when she lodged the report, V1 thought that she would be allowed to return to Bangladesh, as she did not have a job in Singapore, and was worried about how she would survive here.[^46] In this regard, the Investigation Officer (IO) Serene Goh confirmed that V1 and V2 “very often” asked when they could return home.[^47]

164    In short, I saw no reason for V1 to lie against either of the accused persons, and nothing that suggested that she did so. Instead, her evidence against them was compelling, consistent on material points, and corroborated by other witnesses and evidence. All in all, I accepted her account which clearly implicated the accused persons in the commission of the WC offences.

## Evaluating the evidence against Rajendran on the PHTA charge

165    In respect of the PHTA charge, Rajendran was alleged to have committed the offence in that he had recruited V2 by threatening her with bodily harm for the purpose of the exploiting her.

166    Having assessed the evidence, and similar to my assessment of V1 in relation to the WC charges, I found V2 to be an unusually convincing witness, and her evidence to be consistent and corroborated by other evidence. Also, as with V1, I found that there was no motive for V2 to lie, nor was it shown that she did so. I will elaborate on my reasons for accepting her evidence below.

### V2 was also a compelling witness who implicated Rajendran on the charge

167    Like V1, V2 was subjected to forceful questioning. In all, V2 was on the stand for about 4 days, although by the time she testified, Roky had dropped out of the picture and V2 was only questioned by the counsel for the two accused persons, Rajendran and Sasikumar, and also by the DPP. Also, as V2 had spent a considerably shorter period of time working at the club, and as she was named as the victim in only one charge, and further, as her allegations largely concerned Rajendran only (albeit some aspects of her evidence also implicated Sasikumar as regards V1’s WC charges), V2’s time spent on the stand was considerable shorter than the time V1 took to testify.

168    Nevertheless, it was clear that V2 also acquitted herself well, and her evidence was no less convincing than that of V1, as it similarly contained a “ring of truth” that made her highly believable. Like V1, V2 explained her dire financial circumstances in Bangladesh, and about how she came to become a performing artiste in the club, something which she did not originally expect to do. She also spoke about her working and living conditions at Kollywood, and the expectations for the performing artistes to earn $6,000 a month. Lastly, she spoke about how she became victimised by Rajendran, how she resisted him, and ultimately about the girls escaping from the flat at Bukit Merah.

169    As regards the PHTA offence involving Rajendran, to recap (see \[45\]-\[49\] above), V2 had essentially testified that Rajendran had slapped her on the left cheek after she rejected his request (conveyed through Roky) to have sex with his friend Anwar. This was even though Rajendran had informed her that she would receive $1,000 for doing so. Aside from slapping her once, he had tried to slap her again when she still refused the offer. He later also grabbed her by her neck.

170    Subsequently, Rajendran and Sasikumar had visited the performing artistes at their flat at Bukit Merah where Rajendran apologised to her and sought her forgiveness. Clearly, that Rajendran apologised to V2, also reinforced V2’s evidence about his earlier assault and threat made to her in order to get her to agree to sex with Anwar for money. V2 was clearly still upset even after she received the apology from Rajendran, as she moved away from him despite his saying sorry to her.

171    All in all, as with V1, V2’s account of the incident was clear and consistently maintained by her despite strong challenge from counsel, particular Mr Naidu who represented Rajendran. While Mr Naidu took issue with what he claimed were “lies” about several matters including whether Rajendran was present at the airport when V2 arrived in Singapore, about what she was told by her Bangladeshi agent about her work in Singapore, about the frequency of Rajendran’s visits to the club when she was present (from 16 January 2016 onwards), about whether she had been in the club’s smoking room before _etc_, with respect, there was nothing to show that she had lied in her evidence on these matters. In any event, the apparent discrepancies in her evidence, if at all they existed, were minor and on immaterial matters. Further, to expect V2 to have a perfect recollection of relatively unimportant things that occurred more than two years before testifying, was unrealistic and unreasonable.

172    All in all, contrary to the claims of Rajendran’s counsel, I found V2 to be a credible witness, and was of the view that her account of the material aspects of the case was highly believable.

### V2’s evidence was externally consistent and corroborated

173    In addition, I would add that V2’s account about the high monthly earnings target of $6,000 set for the performing artistes, and also that they had been promised a monthly salary of 100,000 Taka a month, was corroborated and consistent with the evidence from V1, and also reflected in Roky’s statement) (see \[153(a)\] and \[153(b)\] above).

174    In addition, V2’s account that she had informed the other artiste about the incident was corroborated by V1, who said that V2 had complained to V1 that “Boss grabbed (her) neck and pushed her.”[^48]

175    I would add that Rajendran’s insistence in getting V2 to have sex with Anwar in January 2016, in expectation of a reward of $2,000, was also consistent with the fact that the club was not doing well at that time, even though Rajendran had already invested a hefty sum of $40,000, and also had to periodically come up with further sums of money to purchase alcohol _etc_. He was also told by Sasikumar to put in even more capital.

176    Indeed, that Rajendran was clearly concerned about the finances of the club, could be seen from the fact that he would look through the liquor book and the artistes’ tips collections books whenever he went to the club to look at the sales figures. Further, Rajendran admitted that he was worried about the low figures, and even questioned Sasikumar about the low collections. This was hardly surprising since Rajendran had apparently been promised by Sasikumar that he could make money, and he admitted that he expected profits in three to six months from the time of his investment. Under those circumstances, it was not surprising that Rajendran had resorted to violence and threats when he recruited V2 to provide sex to Anwar. The large pay out that was promised by Anwar was clearly too tempting an incentive for him to do so.

177    All in all, I was satisfied that various pieces of evidence further corroborated V2’s account that Rajendran had committed the PHTA offence.

### V2 also has no reason to lie and falsely implicate the accused persons

178    As set out above (see \[156\] and \[157\]), where the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to disprove that motive. As in the case with V1, despite attempts by the Defence to taint V2 with such ulterior motive, no such motive was shown. Instead, the evidence suggested that there was no reason for V2 to falsely implicate Rajendran, and to make such a serious allegation against him.

179    In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the attempt by Rajendran to impute bad motive on the part of V2 and to suggest that she had fabricated evidence against him fell completely flat.

> (a)     First, Rajendran apparently suggested that the artistes might have disliked him because “they feel that (he was) intruding their own personal life”.[^49] This was apparently because of an incident “sometime in December \[2015\]” when he claimed to have seen V2 and V1 dancing with and hugging Montin and Tapas on stage. Rajendran had allegedly instructed Mohan to tell the artistes that such behaviour should not happen in the pub.[^50] However, his evidence was challenged by the Prosecution. As stated above, I agreed with the DPP that this incident clearly could not have taken place as alleged since V2 was not even in Singapore in December 2015, as it was not disputed that V2 only arrived in Singapore on 16 January 2016, as set out in the Agreed Facts.

> (b)     Second, as pointed out by the Prosecution, Rajendran’s omission to mention the alleged hugging incident in his police statement was inexplicable.

Thus, there was serious doubt whether the above incident claimed by Rajendran ever happened at all. Instead, as suggested by the Prosecution, it would appear that this claim by Rajendran was “blatantly false” and “nothing but a pack of lies”.[^51]

180    I would add that Rajendran also agreed that apart from the above possible “motive”, he could not think of any other reason why V2 (or V1 for that matter) would make false accusations against him. In fact, he agreed that they had never conveyed their unhappiness to him directly or indirectly.[^52]

181    Finally, I would add that as in the case with V1, V2 would have received no benefit from making any false allegation against Rajendran. Indeed, as noted above, it was clear that giving evidence in court against both accused persons was not something she was enthusiastic about, since the IO confirmed that like V1, V2 “very often” asked when she could return home.

182    All in all, I accepted that V2’s evidence against Rajendran on the PHTA charge was compelling and credible, and clearly also implicated him in the commission of the offence.

## Evaluating the evidence on obstructing the course of justice

183    As regards the obstruction of justice charge which involved both accused persons, it was alleged that they had arranged for Roky to leave Singapore to evade arrest. This alleged offence had occurred on the same day that the Bangladeshi performing artistes had left their residence without permission, and had gone to the CID. Roky’s help had been sought to contact them, and this had failed.

184    For this charge, one of the main pieces of evidence against the accused persons was Roky’s statement (P21). Amongst other things, Roky had stated that when he was working at the club, he acted as the interpreter for the accused persons to convey instructions to the Bangladeshi performing artistes. Roky had also stated that on 11 February 2016, Sasikumar had called Roky and asked to meet him at the back lane behind the club. There, Roky had met both accused persons and was then told the dancers had run away. Roky was then told by both of them to return to his country. Sasikumar also made arrangements for his friend to transport Roky to Malaysia, and Rajendran gave Roky $200 before he left. Rajendran subsequently told Roky that his work permit was cancelled, and also that Roky was banned from returning to Singapore.

185    Sasikumar’s statements to MOM (P26 and P27) were also tendered in evidence. In his statements, Sasikumar had confirmed the material details in Roky’s statement about having asked Roky to flee to Malaysia to avoid being arrested by the police, and about having made transport arrangements for this to take place. He stated that this had taken place with Rajendran’s knowledge, and that Rajendran had given $200 to Roky before he left for Malaysia.

186    It was clear that the evidence set out in Roky’s statement implicated both Sasikumar and Rajendran in that they had arranged for the transport and also given money to Roky to leave Singapore. They had settled on getting him out of Singapore by the quickest possible means, which essentially meant that he would go to Malaysia by road, rather than Bangladesh by air. Sasikumar admitted in his statements that this arrangement was made as he was afraid that the air-route to Bangladesh would result in delay, and may cause Roky to be arrested by the police before he could leave Singapore.

187    Further, I also considered that the discussion that Rajendran and Sasikumar engaged in with Roky took place almost immediately after they realised that the “escape” of the performing artistes from their lodgings would put both of them in danger. That they then arranged to meet Roky in a back lane, rather than at the club itself, also suggested that the accused persons wanted the discussion to take place in a “safe” and secluded place, and away from the club, where they may possibly be apprehended by the police whom the performing artistes had already approached for help. The haste with which the accused persons took action to facilitate Roky’s absence, even extended to their cancelling Roky’s work permit the very next day after Roky left Singapore.

188    I would add that in court, Sasikumar and Rajendran did not deny that they had met with Roky on 11 February 2016 at the back lane and that this took place after the performing artistes had left their residence without notice. Nor was it denied that Rajendran had given $200 to Roky that very same night that he left Singapore. It was also not in dispute that Roky’s work permit with Sasikumar’s company was cancelled the day after they met up with Roky. Thus, the admissions by the accused persons in court, strongly corroborated the contents of Roky’s statement (P21). Further, I noted that P21 was recorded from Roky on the very same day (8 November 2016) that he returned to Singapore, after “fleeing” from Singapore. These considerations suggested that what Roky said about the accused persons’ effort to get him out of Singapore was likely to be true.

189    As stated above, the other compelling piece of evidence against the accused persons were the two voluntary statements given by Sasikumar.

190    The first statement recorded on 29 November 2016 (P26), also corroborated Roky’s account about the meeting they had on 11 February 2016, and that this meeting was initiated by Sasikumar to ask Roky to flee to Malaysia immediately to escape arrest by the police. In it, Sasikumar also revealed that the meeting took place after he had tried (unsuccessfully) to locate the Bangladeshi performing artistes, and subsequently found out that they had lodged a police report at CID. Sasikumar also implicated Rajendran in P26.

191    Moving on to Sasikumar’s second statement (P27), which was recorded about 2 weeks after P26 it was especially pertinent to note that not only did Sasikumar not deny his damaging account in P26 when he was next questioned by MOM, he essentially affirmed that account in P27. Further, in P27, Sasikumar had confirmed that he wanted Roky to leave Singapore immediately, and had even asked Rajendran to “hand over S$200 to Roky when we send him to Malaysia” (see \[8\] of P27).

192    In court, when Sasikumar subsequently tried to disavow the admissions he had made in P26 and P27 (which also implicated his co-accused Rajendran), and give an inconsistent account, the DPP made an application to impeach his credit, and for the court to accept the version he had given in P26 and P27.

193    Having evaluated his evidence, and the attempts which he made to explain away the damning accounts he gave in P26 and P27, I was of the view that Sasikumar was not able to do so, and his attempts at doing so only served to do further damage to his own credibility. I elaborate below:

194    First, as regards P26, I noted that:

> (a)     When questioned generally about statements that he had made to the police and to MOM, Sasikumar initially said that he had no complaints against the police or MOM officers who had recorded his statements. Specifically as regards P26, Sasikumar confirmed that there was no inducement, threat or promise made to him in connection with the recording of the statement, and that he had given his statement and signed it voluntarily.

> (b)     Sasikumar also confirmed that the statement recorder had read it back to him and asked if he wished to make any amendments, and Sasikumar had made two amendments: by adding in the words “or Kumar” at the first page and counter-signed against this amendment, as well as making another amendment that appeared at page 4 with the words “Roky had been deployed to help me under Nine Silver Private Limited between early April 15 to February 2016.”

> (c)     However, in court, Sasikumar claimed that there were a lot of mistakes in the statement, but that he had chosen not to make any (further) amendments because it didn’t occur to him to do so and as he was allegedly under a lot of pressure. He even claimed that he did not understand much of the statement even though he was the one “…who voluntarily asked for the statement to be recorded in English.”[^53]However, when pressed on this point, I noted that that aside from claiming not to understand the meaning of the word “escorting”, there were no other words in the statement that he did not understand. [^54]

> (d)     Nevertheless, Sasikumar admitted that the substance of the statement was what he had told the recorder, and that he did not make any amendments because he agreed with the substance of the statement.[^55]In relation to paragraph 16 of his statement where it was stated that Sasikumar asked Roky to leave Singapore for Malaysia, Sasikumar initially agreed that the part “could be correct too” before changing his evidence and denying this to be accurate. [^56]

> (e)     Sasikumar, however, could not explain why the evidence that he gave in court - where he had stated that he never arranged for any transport for Roky to enter Malaysia - was different from paragraph 17 of his statement where he had said that he had “… arranged for a transport to bring Roky into Malaysia for a few days and I will arrange for Roky to leave from Malaysia.” Neither could he explained why he had given an account in paragraph 18 that “Roky understood that he had also committed an offence by helping me to interpret and to fetch artists under Nine Silver Private Limited. Roky agreed and he left Singapore”, which differed from what he had stated in court. Further, Sasikumar could not explain why he had testified that he had never spoken to Roky after he and Sasikumar when to lodge a police report on 11 February 2016, and yet said something different in paragraph 19 of his statement.

> (f)     As regards various other aspects of his statement, Sasikumar similarly could not explain why they differed from his version in court, even though he admitted that the recorder had read the statement to him after recording, and Sasikumar had only chosen to make the two amendments at the first and fourth pages, and had signed on every page of the statement. He also agreed that the recorder had read the affirmation to him, and that he (Sasikumar) had signed on the statement to confirm that it was true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, and that he was aware that the statement could be tendered as evidence. In addition, Sasikumar confirmed that he had no prior dealings with the recorder and there was no reason for the latter to inaccurately or improperly record his statement.[^57]

195    Next, for P27, which was the second statement that he had given:

> (a)     Sasikumar also agreed that this was a voluntary statement. Sasikumar had stated at paragraph 8 that he had asked Rajendran to hand over $200 to Roky “…when we sent him to Malaysia’. This differed from his account in court where he stated that he did not send Roky to Malaysia, he did not ask Rajendran to hand any money to Roky, and that Rajendran gave Roky money of his own accord and that he (Sasikumar) did not know how much this was.While Sasikumar conceded that he had given the version in P27, he claimed that he could not remember how he had told the recorder these.

> (b)     Further, while Sasikumar admitted that he had stated in paragraph 16 that: “I was afraid of more trouble. I wanted Roky to immediately leave the county and hence I sent Roky to Malaysia”, Sasikumar claimed that he was not able to explain why he had given such a “wrong answer” to the statement recorder, even though he agreed that the recorder had read the statement back to him, and he had signed on several page of his statement without making any amendments.

196    I also noted that the recorder of these statements, IO Yan Xiang, confirmed that he had recorded P26 and P27 accurately based on the answers given by Sasikumar, and that he did not try to guess what Sasikumar meant.[^58]IO Yan Xiang further testified that as he read back the statement to Sasikumar, he had used his finger to point at every word as he read.

197    All in all, it was obvious that while Sasikumar made desperate attempts to dissociate himself from the damning contents of his two statements, and also tried to explain why their contents differed from his account in court, his efforts fell flat, and his denials were clearly unbelievable. Instead, I was of the view that the accounts given by Sasikumar in P26 and P27, which were versions that he gave much closer to the events in question, and recorded on two separate occasions about two weeks apart, were reliable and should be given full weight.

198    I would add that I similarly gave full weight to Roky’s statement (P21) as his departure from Singapore for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, I accepted that Roky’s statement P21 had been accurately recorded by IO Serene Goh through the use of a certified Bangladeshi interpreter. He was also given a chance to make amendments to it, and he signed against each amendment he made, and at the bottom of every page. In addition, he did not have any complaint or make any request during the statement recording.

> (b)     Next, I noted that P21 was recorded on the same day that Roky returned to Singapore, after he had earlier been (falsely) told by Rajendran that he (Roky) was banned from Singapore. In those circumstances, I did not see any reason why he would lie about his earlier departure from Singapore.

> (c)     Further, I accepted that Roky has nothing to gain by framing Sasikumar and Rajendran to say that they had arranged for him to leave Singapore if it was not true. Moreover, Rajendran also confirmed that he had no bad blood, problems or disputes with Roky.

> (d)     Finally, Sasikumar’s two statements was consistent with and corroborated Roky’s account in P21 about the role played by Sasikumar and Rajendran in obstructing justice. I would add that the fact that both Sasikumar and Rajendran went to such lengths not only to get Roky out of Singapore, but also to try to keep him out in order to avoid Roky being arrested by the police, showed that both of them were afraid that he would implicate them in the commission of the offences involving the performing artistes.

199    Further, the haste and extent to which _both_ Sasikumar and Rajendran worked to remove Roky from Singapore to prevent his arrest, showed that they were worried that Roky would implicate them in offences that _both_ Rajendran and Sasikumar were involved in. These would in fact be the WC offences, rather than mere Employment Act offences, since Rajendran was never involved in the employment of Roky, and Roky was in fact supposed to be working for one of Sasikumar’s companies. Thus, Rajendran would not have been involved in facilitating Roky’s removal from Singapore, and also in trying to prevent his return (by telling him that his work permit had been cancelled and that he was banned from Singapore), but for the fact that Rajendran was also afraid that Roky would be arrested and implicate Rajendran in the vice offences in which the three of them (Sasikumar, Rajendran and Roky) were all involved. In other words, the justice that both accused persons sought to obstruct by facilitating Roky’s removal from Singapore, had to do with Roky’s involvement (as the interpreter) with the accused persons in the commission of the vice offences, rather than with any employment related offences _per se_.

200    In summary, there was overwhelming evidence that clearly established the obstruction of justice charges against the accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Other reasons to reject the defence

201    Aside from aspects of the accused persons’ evidence already discussed, there were other matters raised and set out in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions that reinforced the position that the denials and exculpatory accounts of the accused persons could not be believed.

202    In the case of Rajendran, aside from the discrepancies and unbelievable aspects of his evidence already highlighted, the following matters reinforced the conclusion that Rajendran was not a witness of credit.

> (a)     First, I noted that Rajendran initially tried to debunk V2’s claim that he had slapped her by suggesting during his examination-in-chief that there was a CCTV recording that would support his position. However, no such footage was produced to the police. Subsequently, when questioned about the CCTV camera in the club, Rajendran backtracked by saying that he did not know if the CCTV camera was functioning and that he had never checked the recording. Instead, his position now was simply said that “I don’t know about the CCTV.”[^59]

> (b)     Second, I agreed with the Prosecution that Rajendran’s claim about his supposed lack of involvement and interest in the club, and about his apparent indifference to the club’s poor finances and earnings, were not believable.

>> (i)       For one, Rajendran had admitted that he had invested a considerable amount of $40,000 in November 2015 in the club, and that he had never made investment in business in Singapore on such a scale before. Further, Rajendran had admitted that he initially expected to be able to get a return on his investment within three to six months, but was soon asked, after his initial investment of $40,000, to make various additional contributions to pay for liquor and also to come up with $10,000 to pay for the rent. Yet despite all these huge outlays and the increasingly uncertain prospects of getting his expected returns, and despite operating a club that was clearly bleeding money, Rajendran suggested that he continued to adopt a lackadaisical and hands-off attitude.

>> (ii)       In fact, Rajendran even claimed that despite the fact that he had invested in a dance club (which presumably would operate till late every night), he would not stay beyond 10.00 pm at the club because his wife would call him if he was not home by 10.00 pm. Clearly, Rajendran’s evidence was difficult to believe.

>> (iii)       I also noted that his claim on this aspect was in fact contradicted by the much more believable evidence of the victims that Rajendran was very much the boss in charge at the club, and that he was very involved and concerned about the earnings and tips of the artistes and the finances of the club; so much so in fact, that Rajendran was the one who conveyed instructions through Roky for the dancers to dance better and to increase their collections.

> (c)     Third, Rajendran – again in a bid to suggest his lack of knowledge and involvement in the club’s operations – even claimed not to know about the system of commissions, or about the various bonuses recorded in P14. Yet, he admitted that he went through the collection books each time he visited Kollywood. Further, in P14, the word “Bonus” appears beside the artistes’ names nine times, something that would have been obvious when he checked the book. Clearly, his attempt at feigning ignorance belied his real involvement in the operations of the club and interest in the earnings of the artistes.

> (d)     Fourth, I also agreed that Rajendran had taken an inconsistent position over whether V2 would have known that she could report to the police if she had indeed been hit by him. In this respect, Rajendran’s counsel (presumably on his instructions) had put it to V2 that if she had indeed been hit by Rajendran, she was “fully aware (of her) rights” and “would have definitely reported it”. V2’s reply was that she did not know that she had a right to inform the Police at that time. In cross-examination, Rajendran back-pedalled and admitted that (1) he did not know if V2 was aware of her rights to call the Police, and (2) there was no reason for him to believe that V2 was aware of her rights to call the Police. Clearly, this change of position cast further doubt on his claim.

203    The DPP also applied to impeach Rajendran’s credit with a statement (P25) that he had made to the police on 8 April 2016 (which was about 3 months after the date of the alleged offences) that contained accounts that Rajendran made that were inconsistent with his evidence in court. [^60] In essence, when questioned, Rajendran was not able to reconcile various inconsistencies in his evidence, including about how he came to know about Kollywood and to become involved with the club; about whether he knew about any incident where the artistes kept tips for themselves, and gave feedback about this to Roky or Sasikumar about this; about the extent of his involvement with the club; about whether he knew if Roky was paid for his work in Kollywood; about whether he had visited the performing artistes at the Bukit Merah flat; about his meeting with Roky outside Kollywood on 11 February 2016 and about his involvement in getting Roky to leave Singapore. While it was possible that some of these discrepancies could be explained by a lapse of memory, taken as a whole and considering the materiality of the issues involved, Rajendran’s inability to account for the different versions, cast grave doubts on his credibility, and the veracity of his denials.

204    As for Sasikumar’s evidence, as noted above, he was unable to explain why his account in court differed from his statements in P26 and P27 concerning the circumstances and reasons for Roky’s sudden departure from Singapore. Further, while Sasikumar tried to disparage Roky’s conduct, and to downplay his role at the club – in particular whether Roky had acted as the interpreter and intermediary for the Bangladeshi performing artistes - I noted that Sasikumar’s testimony was either at odds or were not supported by his earlier MOM statements (P26 and P27) which he had voluntarily given in 2016. [^61]

205    Suffice to say, each accused person was clearly trying to downplay his own role and about his involvement in the club, as well as his own involvement in the commission of the offences, but their credit and the veracity of their evidence was both highly suspect. Instead, I was satisfied that both accused persons, who were directors and co-owners of the club at the material time, were clearly implicated by the victims and by Roky, and to some extent by their own evidence, as being at the heart of the various offences, with the exception of the PHTA offence which involved Rajendran only.

206    In summary, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against both accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted them on all charges.

## Sentencing Phase

207    Having found them guilty of the charges proceeded with, I now deal with the issue of sentencing.

### Prescribed punishment for the WC, PHTA and PC charges

208    In respect of charges under s 140(1)(_b_) and 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000.

209    For the charge of trafficking in persons under s 3(1)(_a_) punishable under s 4(1)(_a_) of the PHTA, the prescribed punishment is a fine not exceeding $100,000 and imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and the offender shall also be liable to caning not exceeding 6 strokes.

210    The prescribed penalty for the offence of obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice under s 204A read with s 34 of the PC is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

211    The DPP tendered written submissions on the proposed sentences.

212    For Rajendran: An aggregate sentence of at least 33 months’ imprisonment and $6,000 fine, consisting of 3 consecutive imprisonment sentences as follows:

> (a)     For the charge of procuring V1 for prostitution under s 140(1)(_b_) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC: At least 8 months imprisonment;

> (b)     For the charge of knowingly living off prostitution earnings of V1, under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC: At least 8 months imprisonment (consecutive) and a fine of $4,000;

> (c)     For the charge of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, by arranging for Roky to leave Singapore to evade under s 204A read with s 34 of PC: At least 10 months’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> (d)     For the charge of recruiting V2 by means of threatening her with bodily harm, for the purpose of exploiting her under s 3(1)(_a_) punishable under s 4(1)(_a_) of the PHTA: At least 15 months’ imprisonment (consecutive) and a fine of $2,000.

213    For Sasikumar: At least 18 months’ imprisonment and $4,000 fine, consisting of 2 consecutive imprisonment sentences as follows:

> (a)     For the charge of procuring V1 for prostitution under s 140(1)(_b_) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC: At least 8 months imprisonment;

> (b)     For the charge of knowingly living off prostitution earnings of V1, under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 PC: At least 8 months imprisonment (consecutive) and a fine of $4,000;

> (c)     For the charge of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, by arranging for Roky to leave Singapore to evade under s 204A read with s 34 of the PC: At least 10 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)

#### Vice Related Offences

214    The Prosecution argued that the deterrence should be the overriding sentencing principle for the vice-related offences, citing the decision in _Public Prosecutor v Poh Boon Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> (“_Poh Boon Kiat_”), where the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had set out extensive guidelines in the context of sentencing for charges under ss 140, 146 and 148 of the WC.

215    In the present case, the DPP argued that:

> (a)     Both V2 and V1, had come to Singapore intending to perform other roles, but had been pressured or threatened to provide sexual services. Further, female migrant workers like V2 and V1, were particularly vulnerable because of their poor social-economic backgrounds, limitations in language skills, and lack of familiarity with Singapore. They should thus be protected from the exploitative and coercive practices of the accused persons.

> (b)     The above factors, plus the masked nature of the operations, the tight control and supervision exercised over them, and the transient nature of their stint in Singapore, made such offences against these victims extremely difficult to detect.

> (c)     Furthermore, the court in _Poh Boon Kiat_ had set out at \[84(b)\] the sentencing consideration against international trafficking of women, as such a practice brings disrepute to Singapore. Deterrent sentencing is thus especially crucial here as the present case involves the procurement of foreign nationals.

#### The sentences for the WC charges

216    Specially, as regards the WC charges, applying the framework set out in _Poh Boon Kiat_, the DPP submitted that the present case fell within “Culpability B” and “Category 2 Harm”.

217    As regards the level of culpability, the DPP emphasised the following:

> (a)     The substantial and instrumental roles played by the accused persons in the entire operation of Kollywood. As the co-owners and equal shareholders of the club, both of them were actively involved in the daily operations of Kollywood, and in keeping track of its finances. Further, while Sasikumar was solely responsible for recruiting V1, both accused persons recruited V2.

> (b)     In addition, both accused persons had full authority and control over the vulnerable victims, and they kept a close eye on them and their daily collections. The accused persons also devised schemes to increase the artistes’ collections, including telling them that they had to reach a monthly target of $6,000 or they would not be paid their salaries. Rajendran also confiscated their mobile phones, and threatened them if their collections were not good.[^62]

> (c)     The accused persons also pressured V1 to go out with the customers for sex, and pocketed the benefits solely for themselves. V1 did not receive a single cent, or any increased bonus as a result.

218    As regards the level of harm, the DPP argued that this case should be assessed as falling within the upper end of “Category 2 Harm” because of the following factors:

> (a)     The accused persons had used threats and coercive methods to pressure V1 to agree to provide sexual services, with Sasikumar threatening not to pay her salary and to send her back. This made V1 feel “very bad” and very pressurized as her family would starve if she was not paid. Ultimately, Sasikumar also betrayed V1’s trust as he did not pay her salary even though he twice assured her that he would do so. Given her poor economic background and reason for coming to Singapore, such financial-related penalties would have been extremely severe, and would have placed her under a high degree of distress.

> (b)     Further, the level of distress and exploitation in the present case was high, as V1 was promised a job as a dancer, and was never informed that she would have to provide sexual services to customers.

> (c)     There were other exploitive practices that the artistes were subjected to such as (i) confinement in their lodging house throughout the day, (ii) confiscation of their passports and hand phones, (iii) being forced to drink alcohol with the accused persons, (iv) having low quality food, and (v) not having their salaries paid.

219    Under the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework, offences that fell within “Culpability B” and “Category 2 Harm” would give rise to an indicative starting point of 6 months’ imprisonment, and an indicative range of 3 months’ imprisonment to 1 year 6 months’ imprisonment.

220    In the present case, the DPP argued that there were other aggravating factors, which warranted a sentence of at least 8 months’ imprisonment for each WC charge, with an additional fine of $4,000 for the charge under s146(1) of the WC. These aggravating factors included the actions of the accused persons in actively limiting the freedom of the victims, the deception practised on them during recruitment, and the application of undue pressure to procure the victim’s prostitution. In addition, the DPP argued that there was an international element in the commission of the offences as they involved the bringing of foreigners into Singapore to work as performing artistes, but then procuring them as prostitutes (citing \[84(b)\] of _Poh Boon Kiat_). Further, as the offences were committed within the context of a legitimate business, they were more difficult to detect, especially due to the restrictions placed on the victims’ liberty and constant supervision of their movements.

221    The Prosecution also submitted that a sentence of at least 8 months’ imprisonment was supported by the decision in _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar v Public Prosecutor_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9247 of 2018) (“_Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_”). This was a case involving similar facts where the offender, a General Manager of a nightclub, was convicted after trial of an offence of procuring the prostitution of a Bangladeshi dancer. The District Court had decided that the offender fell within “Category 2 Harm” and “Culpability B”, and he was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment (for a global sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment).

222    As for asking for a fine of $4,000 for each charge under s 140(1)(_b_) of the WC, the DPP argued that fines were justified to disgorge the profits of crime, and to achieve the sentencing objectives of having a punitive and deterrent effect. In deciding on the quantum of the fine, the DPP highlighted that in _Public Prosecutor v Quek Chin Choon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1169</span> (“_Quek Chin Choon_”) and _Public Prosecutor v Zhang Weida_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9114 of 2017 of 01) (“_Zhang Weida_”), both of which were cases that involved offenders convicted of charges under s 146(1) of the WC, the courts had imposed fines that exceeded the profits made. Specifically, in _Quek Chin Choon_, the total fine imposed was $15,000 (and four weeks’ imprisonment) for an estimated profit of $3,300, and in _Zhang Weida_, the total fine imposed was $3,000 (and six months’ imprisonment) for an estimated profit of $1,850.

223    In the present case, the Prosecution argued that while the accused persons received at least $1,000 (comprising two payments of $500 each) for V1’s two instances of prostitution, it was not known what were the total profits that they had received, save that it was unlikely that the $500 paid on each occasion represented the customer’s entire payment for sex with V1, seeing that the price for V2’s prostitution was $2,000. Hence, it could be inferred that the ballpark figure for each instance of prostitution for V1 would similarly be around $2,000. Hence, a fine of $4,000 should be imposed.

#### The sentence for offence under s 3(1) of the PHTA

224    The Prosecution argued that one key reason that Parliament had enacted the PHTA was to provide for severe penalties to ensure deterrence against trafficking in persons (citing the speech of MP Christopher De Souza at the Second Reading of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill).[^63].

225    In the present case, the victim, V2, was a vulnerable young foreign woman who had come from Bangladesh to Singapore as an economic migrant. After arriving in Singapore, she was held under exploitative conditions, and Rajendran inflicted violence on her to pressure her to prostitute herself. The DPP argued that in the circumstances, the punishment meted out for the PHTA charge must be sufficiently severe to incorporate a strong element of general deterrence in line with the clear legislative policy against such offences.

226    The DPP also argued that for such offences, the court in _Public Prosecutor v BSR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 64</span> (“_BSR_”) had recognised that the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework provides a good starting point for sentencing, but that the necessary upward modifications in the starting points and ranges should be made to account for the full range of sentence provided for a PHTA offence.

227    In line with this approach, the DPP suggested that an adjusted-_Poh Boon Kiat_ framework could be applied for claim trial PHTA cases, to take into account the fact that such offences are more serious, and that the maximum imprisonment term of 10 years was double the maximum imprisonment term (of 5 years) for WC offences. Her proposed adjusted framework is set out below.

228    The DPP argued that the proposed sentencing framework was in line with the sentence imposed by the High Court in _BSR_, where the court had categorised the level of harm and level of culpability as “High”. The court there had sentenced the offender to 6 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane and a fine of $6,000 fine for each PHTA charge, where the offence fell within the “Category 1 Harm” and “A Culpability”.

229    On the facts of the present case, the DPP argued that Rajendran’s culpability must be assessed as moderate in line with the factors set out for the WC offences. Further, V2, the victim for the PHTA offence, was even more vulnerable than V1, the victim for the WC offences, and Rajendran exhibited no qualms in exploiting V2’s vulnerability. In this regard, the Prosecution highlighted that V2 came from a village in Bangladesh, was illiterate, and was lured to work in Singapore under the false pretence of working as a domestic helper in Singapore. The offence against her was also committed a mere two weeks after she arrived in Singapore on 16 January 2016, and she would be even less familiar with Kollywood and Singapore than V1 who had been in Singapore for 4 months before the offences against her began.

230    As for the consideration of harm, the DPP argued that Rajendran’s offence should fall at the higher end of “Category 2 Harm”, as there were elements of abuse, significant curtailment of personal autonomy, violence and coercion used to make V2 engage in sexual activity, even if she eventually did not have sex with the customer despite Rajendran’s efforts. Not only did Rajendran use money as bait, Rajendran also resorted to violence, where he forcefully slapped her left cheek “very hard”, leaving a mark on her cheek. He also raised his hand to try to slap her a second time. Even after she managed to break free, he pursued her out of the smoking room and gripped her neck with his hand in front of everyone. Rajendran’s vicious tactics led V2 to describe him as a “_devil_”.

231    The DPP submitted that due to the highly aggravated nature of the PHTA offence, a sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment was warranted. This would also be in line with the precedents for PHTA sex trafficking offences, where sentences of between 12 months’ and 6 years’ imprisonment have been imposed. The DPP further suggested that the proposed sentence may be reduced to at least 15 months’ imprisonment in light of the totality principle.

232    In addition to the custodial sentence, the Prosecution proposed a fine of $2,000 be imposed for this charge, even though V2 eventually did not have sex with the customer, and it was possible that Rajendran had to return the $2,000 to him. Nevertheless, the DPP argued that a sufficiently deterrent fine was warranted in light of the gratuitous violence that Rajendran had inflicted on V2, and his exploitation of her vulnerability.

#### The sentence for the obstruction of justice charges

233    The Prosecution submitted that both general and specific deterrence should be the primary sentencing considerations for offences of perverting the course of justice.

234    As regards the need for general deterrence, the DPP cited the learned authors of _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Edition, 2013) (“Sentencing Practice”), who had stated (at p 1080) that “\[u\]ndoubtedly, the sentencing philosophy underpinning the commission of such offences would be that of general deterrence”, that such offences “contaminate the rule of law” and that “the ‘default’ starting sentence for an offence under s 204A of the Penal Code should be a custodial one”. The DPP also referred to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in _R v Andrew_ (1973) 57 Cr App. R 254, where the court had stated at 259 that:

> there are few more serious offences possible in the present day, if one excludes violent offences, than those which tend to distort the course of public justice and prevent the Courts from producing true and just results in the cases before them.

235    In addition, the DPP referred to the following checklist of factors for offences under s 204A of the Penal Code as set out in Sentencing Practice at p 1080:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.96%"> <col width="49.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Checklist of factors affecting sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Seriousness indicators (+)</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Seriousness indicators (-)</em></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Minor offences</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sophisticated scheme, for example, the use of layers of intermediaries to mask the identity of the actual offender.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No personal benefit to the offender, for example, a misguided sense of loyalty.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Personal gain, especially monetary gain.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cessation of the misconduct at an early stage.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious consequences, such as, leading the tribunal to make an erroneous finding.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Voluntary disclosure of the misconduct thereby averting serious consequences.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><em>This is not an exhaustive list.</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

236    Further, the DPP highlighted the following considerations.

> (a)     First, the accused persons had instructed Roky to act as an intermediary between them and the Bangladeshi performing artistes, and Roky was the person who conveyed their instructions to V1 and V2 as regards the principal offences under the WC and PHTC. Roky was thus “a primary (and in fact, the best) witness of the accused persons’ culpability”[^64]. The accused persons, being afraid that Roky would implicate them if he remained in Singapore, had thus sought to eliminate testimony from Roky, a key witness.[^65]

> (b)     Second, as s 204A involves the commission of acts that seek to frustrate the administration of justice, there is an inextricable link between the seriousness of the underlying predicate offences and the efforts undertaken to stymie investigations into them. In this case, by the time the offence under s 204A read with s 34 of the PC was committed on 11 February 2016, the accused persons had committed serious WC and PCHT offences, which carried hefty prescribed punishments.

> (c)     Finally, the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution showed that offenders who perverted (or tried to pervert) the course of justice, by hiding evidence or influencing witnesses, received sentences ranging from one week to two months’ imprisonment in six of these cases, and from nine to 15 months’ imprisonment for four of the other cases. The Prosecution argued that the sentence imposed in the present case should be based on the second lot of cases, in light of the fact that:

>> (i)       There are multiple predicate charges in the present case, all involving serious offences which carried heavy imprisonment terms of up to five and 10 years. Further, the accused persons had taken very active and drastic steps to obstruct justice, by arranging for Roky, a key co-conspirator, to flee from Singapore to evade arrest. By sending Roky overseas and telling him he was banned from Singapore, they intended to keep him out of Singapore indefinitely in order to deprive the Police of any chance of tracing him and of obtaining his statement.

>> (ii)       The accused persons’ actions were premeditated and sophisticated, such that when they met Roky outside Kollywood on 11 February 2016, they had already conceived a scheme to send Roky out of Singapore, through arranging for Sasikumar’s friend to pick Roky up and drive him to Malaysia. They also did not inform Roky that they would cancel his work permit, or that he would have to return to Bangladesh, even though this was part of their grand plan. Further, after Roky left Singapore, Sasikumar had cancelled Roky’s work permit, and Rajendran had informed Roky of this and then ordered Roky to return to Bangladesh.[^66] Even after Roky returned to Bangladesh, Rajendran had lied to him that he was banned and not able to return to Singapore. With Roky out of the way, the accused persons then lied during investigations and denied the commission of the offences. While Roky did return to Singapore on 8 November 2016, by then, Roky was convinced that he had to deny his and the accused persons’ involvement in the offences.

>> (iii)       Unlike most of the offenders involved in the precedent cases who had pleaded guilty,[^67] the accused persons here had demonstrated a blatant lack of remorse, and had persisted in claiming trial at the expense of the victims who had to remain in Singapore against their wishes so as to testify. The victims were each also subjected to offensive cross-examination which magnified the shame and emotional distress that they suffered as a result of the accused persons’ misdeeds. In addition, when Sasikumar was confronted with his MOM statements where he admitted that he had deliberately sent Roky to Malaysia so as to evade arrest, Sasikumar continued to deny responsibility, and even maligned the statement recorder, IO Yan Xiang.

237    In all, based on the precedent cases, the DPP submitted that a sentence of at least 10 months imprisonment was appropriate for each PHTA charge.

#### Global Sentence

238    As regards the total sentence to be imposed, the Prosecution cited the decision in _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span>(“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”), where Menon CJ had made it clear that there should be consecutive sentences imposed for unrelated offences. This avoids giving offenders unwarranted discounts from having sentences run concurrently, where they would escape, at least in part if not entirely, punishment for the corresponding offences.

239    Thus, in respect of Rajendran, who was convicted of four charges, the DPP submitted that three of the custodial sentences should run consecutively, as these involved offences that concerned distinct legally protected interests. Nevertheless, in light of the totality principle, the Prosecution recognised that the proposed sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment for the PHTA charge could be reduced to at least 15 months’ imprisonment, resulting in aggregate sentence of at least 33 months’ imprisonment. An additional fine of $6,000 should also to be imposed.

240    As for Sasikumar, in light of the three custodial sentences to be imposed, the Prosecution argued that it was sufficient that the sentence for the charge under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC, and the sentence for the PHTA charge, run consecutively, for a total sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment. An additional fine of $4,000 should also to be imposed.

### The mitigation plea and the defence’s submissions on sentence

#### Rajendran’s mitigation plea

241    In his mitigation plea for Rajendran, Mr Naidu emphasised that his client is untraced, and that as far as the dealings and management of the club and the performing artistes were concerned, it was Sasikumar and Roky (rather than Rajendran) who were largely involved.

242    As for the WC offences, based on the _Poh Boon Kiat_ framework:

> (a)     Rajendran would fall under the level of “C Culpability” as he was not closely involved in the work of the performing artistes, and he neither operated the business nor had control of the performing artistes’ finances, their choice of clients, or working conditions. Further, he argued that there was no premeditation or planning on the part of Rajendran, but that as a result of his badly-made decision to invest in the club, he had in fact suffered a loss of about $40,000. As for the consideration of harm, Mr Naidu argued that this would be a “Category 2 Harm” case, as Rajendran could not be said to have used oppressive or cruel means or treated the performing artistes cruelly or oppressively.

> (b)     As for the aggravating and mitigating factors, it was argued that Rajendran was not the mastermind nor had he been much involved in the operation of the business, and also that he had not benefited monetarily from the profits of the transactions. As far as recruitment of the performing artistes, Rajendran did not have any say in who was recruited. While acknowledging the transnational element of the performing artistes who were employed from abroad, Mr Naidu argued that the other aggravating factors highlighted by the learned Chief Justice Menon in _Poh Boon Kiat_ were not present. As for the case of _Thakkar Hardjk Anilkumar_ (above at \[221\]), Mr Naidu argued that the facts of that case were more egregious than that of the present case.

243    As for the PHTA offence, Mr Naidu argued that the present case does not have the kind of aggravating factors as were present in _BSR_, where the accused was sentenced to six years' imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and a fine of $6,000 for the offence. In _BSR_, the offender had placed the victim, his wife, in fear of being physically assaulted if she refused to prostitute herself. Further, while the facts of that case would have placed it in the Category 1 Harm/A Culpability, adopting a similar framework adapted from _Poh Boon Kiat_, Mr Naidu argued that the victim (_ie_, V2) in the present case was “far removed” from Rajendran, as she was (just) an employee of the club in which he had invested. Mr Naidu also argued that Rajendran never physically assaulted or verbally abused her, and that he was not operative mind behind the business nor had he benefited monetarily from such vices. Thus, he argued that Rajendran would fall in the equivalent Category 2 Harm/C Culpability under Menon CJ’s framework even for the PHTA charge, and should receive a sentence of up to 3 months imprisonment. Also, no fine should be imposed since V2 had refused to accept any payment or to provide the sexual service.

244    As for the obstruction of justice charge, Mr Naidu repeated the claim that Rajendran had extended help to Roky solely out of good will, and that an imprisonment term of 2 weeks to 1 month would be appropriate in light of Rajendran’s low culpability.

245    Finally, as for the aggregate sentence to be imposed, bearing in mind the "one-transaction rule" and s 307 of the CPC, Mr Naidu requested that the sentences for the WC and PHTA charges run concurrently, and consecutively with the sentence for the PC charge.

#### Sasikumar’s mitigation plea

246    As regards the WC offences, Mr Fernando argued that this case fell within “Category 2 Harm” and “C Culpability”, with the indicative sentencing range of between 1 day and 3 months' imprisonment.

> (a)     Specifically, on the issue of Sasikumar’s culpability, Mr Fernando argued that the offences occurred in January 2016, after Sasikumar had already sold off half his shares in Kollywood. Rajendran had largely taken over the management and running of the business by then, and the evidence of both V1 and V2 was also that Sasikumar was hardly around in the club. Mr Fernando also argued that Sasikumar had little interaction with the performing artistes, and they had the freedom to decide who they wished to dance with. He also denied that V1 was coerced by Sasikumar to have sex with a customer against her will. Thus, his situation fell outside “B culpability” which only arises when the offender was closely involved with the work of the prostitutes, for example through the control of the prostitutes' finances, choice of clients, and working conditions. This was unlike in _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_, where the offender fell within “B culpability” because he was more involved in the management and operation of the clubs, and had exercised greater control and authority over the girls, who were young, unsophisticated and working in a foreign country. The offender there was also the main person involved in securing the transactions between the club's customers and the girls, and was primarily responsible for pressuring the girls to go out with the customers.

> (b)     As for the level of harm caused, Mr Fernando submitted that the case fell into “Category 2 Harm” as the usual factors present in “Category 1 Harm” were all absent. Mr Fernando also argued that there was absent any of the aggravating factors highlighted in _Poh Boon Kiat_, and the fact that Sasikumar had claimed trial cannot be counted as an aggravating factor, since he “...ran a rigorous defence and did not misuse the Court's time and resources by putting forth a frivolous defence.” As for the mitigating factors, Sasikumar has no prior convictions and is a respectable family man who works hard to make a living. Thus, that the appropriate sentence would be 2 weeks’ imprisonment per WC charge, with the sentences to run consecutively.

247    As regards the charge under s 204A of the PC, Mr Fernando argued that a crucial factor in determining the sentence for such an offence was the gravity of the predicate offence in which justice was sought to be obstructed by the accused person. In this regard, Mr Fernando argued that the facts of the case was such that it was unclear as to whether Roky was asked to leave by Sasikumar and Rajendran due to their fear that Roky would reveal their involvement in the WC offences, or in order for Sasikumar not to get into trouble with Employment Act offences. In light of the lack of clarity, the gravity of the predicate offence cannot be used as a factor in the present case to establish the sentence that ought to be imposed. In addition, Mr Fernando highlighted that in _Public Prosecutor v Ng Ang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 340</span> at \[26\], the court had found that the fact that the defendant did not threaten or coerce the witness, or seek to induce the witness by payment, were indicative of low culpability. Similarly in the present case, there was no evidence that Sasikumar had threatened or coerced Roky to leave the country or used Roky as a scapegoat for himself. Further, the duration of the misconduct and the harm caused by the obstruction of justice was negligible as Roky was located and brought back to Singapore to be jointly tried. Hence, the offence did not have any long term or irreversible implication.

### Prosecution’s reply on sentence

248    DPP Chew tendered a written reply to the mitigation pleas/sentencing submissions of the Defence. Her arguments are summarized below

249    As regards the WC offences, she submitted that the accused persons fall under “B Culpability”, and that they share many of the similarities with the offenders in _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_ (above at \[217\]), including “….many common aggravating factors and features, in terms of the level of exploitation, victims’ vulnerabilities, transnational element, and the offender’s lack of remorse.”[^68] In this regard, DPP Chew highlighted the evidence showing both accused persons’ involvement in running the club as co-owners, in overseeing its finances and operations, including Sasikumar’s involvement in terms of visiting the club, and also in reacting to the requests of the performing artistes.

250    For the obstruction of justice charge (s 204A of the PC), the DPP made several rebuttals to the arguments made by counsel. Essentially:

> (a)     DPP Chew argued that contrary to the argument mounted for Sasikumar that the court should ignore the predicate offence in determining sentence for the s 204A PC, this was “…entirely without merit, wholly unsupported by well-established case law and contradicted by the evidence led at trial.” (citing inter alia _Ng Ang Heng_). DPP Chew argued that clearly the offence under s 204A of the PC was committed to escape liability for the WC offences. As for the decision in _Ng Ang Heng_, DPP Chew highlighted that the court there had considered at \[26\] that it “…. was also not a case where he sought to influence the testimony of the witness for his own benefit”, whereas in the present case, both accused persons had instructed Roky to leave Singapore so he would not implicate them. She also sought to distinguish the sentence imposed in _Ng Ang Heng_, as the predicate offences, as well as the actions of the offender and its effects, were all less serious in that case. In the same vein, DPP Chew also argued that the sentence imposed in _Seah Hock Thiam_ was also inapplicable as the predicate offence (which carried only three demerit points and a $120 fine) was much less serious than the imprisonment sentences likely to be imposed for the WC and PHTA offences here. Further, Roky was clearly a key witness in the present case against Sasikumar and Rajendran.

> (b)     In addition, it was not correct for the Defence to argue that the duration of the misconduct and harm was negligible since the authorities did not locate Roky or bring him back to Singapore, but he had returned on his own accord. Moreover the actions of the accused persons had effectively kept Roky out of Singapore for nine months, during which Police investigations were ongoing. This period that Roky was deprived as a key witness far outstrips the duration of absence in the precedent cases. In addition, by the time Roky returned, “the ramifications were effectively “irreversible”, as he denied the WC offences and maintained this for three years all the way until trial.”[^69]

251    Finally, for the PHTA charge, DPP Chew argued that Rajendran falls within “B Culpability”, not “C Culpability, and that his submission for a sentence of up to three months’ imprisonment was not supported by precedent.

## Decision on sentence

252    There were essentially two main categories of offences placed before the court. These were the vice-related offences, and the obstruction of justice offence. The vice-related offences were set out in the 2 WC charges faced by both accused persons, and the PHTA charge faced by Rajendran alone, while the obstruction of justice charge under the PC involved both accused persons. I will first deal with the vice related charges.

### The WC charges

253    As regards the charges under s 140(1)(_b_) and 146(1) of the WC, both parties were broadly in agreement that the sentencing framework set out by the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Poh Boon Kiat_, was relevant in deciding the sentence. Broadly, this framework can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     Offenders convicted of charges under s. 140 and s 146 of the WC “should be subject to a mandatory imprisonment term” (see _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[57\] and \[114\]),

> (b)     The severity of such offences was closely related to (i) the culpability of the offender in carrying out the offence and (ii) the harm resulting from the offender's actions, which would be factors to determine the starting point and range of sentences within which the offender ought to be sentenced (see _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[74\]);

> (c)     Bearing in mind that the courts should endeavour to utilise the full range of the sentences prescribed by Parliament, the appropriate range of imprisonment sentences for first-time offenders ought to follow the matrix below (see _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[77\]).

> (d)     A fine for the disgorgement of profits may be imposed in appropriate circumstances (see _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[77\]).

254    In _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[75\], the CJ explained the difference between an "C Culpability" and a "B Culpability" offender as follows:

> (a)    The lowest level of culpability which I refer to as “C Culpability” arises when the offender performs limited functions under directions or where there is evidence that the offence was committed on a one-off basis with little or no pre-meditation.

> (b)    The next level of culpability which I refer to as “B Culpability”, arises when the offender is closely involved with the work of the prostitutes, for example, through the control of the prostitutes’ finances, choice of clients, working conditions. The offender here plays a more substantial as opposed to an ancillary role in the vice operation.

255    As for considering the degree of harm caused, the learned Chief Justice identified and defined the two categories of harm as follows (see \[76\]):

> (a)    The most serious level of harm which I refer to as "Category 1 harm" includes situations when the offender has secured the prostitute's continuance of her services through oppressive or cruel means or has treated the prostitute cruelly or oppressively while she was a part of the vice ring, including in the following respects:

>> (i)    the offender has detained the prostitute against her will,

>> (ii)   the offender has used violence or threats of violence against the prostitute or her family and friends;

>> (iii)   the offender has levelled sustained and systematic psychological abuse against the prostitute;

>> (iv)   the offender has forced or coerced the prostitute to participate in unsafe or degrading sexual activity; or

>> (v)    the offender has forced or coerced the prostitute into servicing any customer against her will.

> (b)    "Category 2 harm" refers to situations where the factors in Category 1 are absent.

256    Based on the facts of _Poh Boon Kiat_, the CJ decided that, the case fell within “B culpability” as “….the appellant...played an integral role by masterminding the entire operation”, and that the case “…fell within "Category 2 Harm". His Honour also accepted that there were various aggravating factors which operated in that case, including the use of the Internet for the commission of the offences, the transnational element of the offences, the use of residential property, and the amount of money earned by the offender ($8,070). The CJ further decided that little weight should be given to the offender’s plea of guilt based on the circumstances of the case. The short period of offending, the fact that the offender was not part of a criminal syndicate, and that he was apprehended swiftly, were also of little mitigating weight.

257    I next turn to _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_ (see above at \[221\]), a decision which the Prosecution highlighted in view of its many similarities with the present case.

> (a)     There, the offender who was the General Manager of a nightclub, was convicted after trial of various charges, including a charge of procuring a female person, a female Bangladeshi (who had been engaged as a dancer), by way of threat, to have carnal connection with a male person whom she was not married to (s 140(1)(_c_) read with s 140(1)(_j_) of the WC).

> (b)     As regards the issue of harm, the Prosecution had highlighted that the offender there had used threats in the form of non-payment of wages and refusal to send the victims back to their home country, and also subjected to financial sanctions in the form of hefty fines for non-compliance. The victims were also pressured to have sex with customers, to make up for their lagging tip collection, and were not paid their full salary, or given any money for having sex with the customer. In addition, they were confined to their lodging house during their off-work periods and were placed under constant supervision. The operation was transnational in nature, involving the use of overseas agents and foreign workers.

> (c)     On the issue of culpability, the offender as general manager, oversaw and managed its operations and practices, and had full authority and control over the dancers. He was the main person involved in securing the transactions between the club’s customers and girls.

> (d)     The court there found that the offender fell within “Category 2 Harm” and “B Culpability”.

258    The present case contains many of the same factors and features as that in _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_ which the court considered in deciding that it fell within “Category 2 Harm” and “B Culpability”. In this regard, the clear and overriding control exerted by the two accused persons, who were both directors and equal shareholders of the club, over the female performing artiste, through the recruitment of the artistes from overseas, and the control of their work environment and conditions, their salaries, their living quarters and even their meals when working in the club, as well as the roles the accused persons played in persuading and pressuring V1 to engage in the sexual activities, including by preying on her economic and financial vulnerabilities, were all important considerations. Further, the rewards that the accused persons obtained from V1’s prostitution, which were not shared with her afterwards, as well as the transnational elements of the offences, were factors considered by the High Court in _Poh Boon Kiat_, and possibly also in _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_, where the High Court upheld the sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment imposed by the district judge.

259    In the premises, I agreed with the Prosecution that this case was one of “Category 2 Harm” and “B Culpability”. Further, as was the case in _Thakkar Hardik Anilkumar_, which also involved a first offender who had claimed trial, I was also of the view that in line with the similar sentencing considerations that operated in both cases, a similar sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for each of the WC charges would also be appropriate.

260    As for the fine to be imposed, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument – supported by the cases that it cited – that a fine should be additionally be imposed to disgorge profits and to serve as a deterrent. In _Quek Chin Choon_ (above at \[222\]), which involved a single offender who had earned $3,300 from his offences, the offender was given an additional fine of $15,000, and in _Zhang Weida_ (above at \[222\]), the total (additional) fine imposed was $3,000 for an estimated net profit of $1,850 (as contended by the appellant) . Thus, based on these cases cited, the additional fines ranged from about one and a half times to four and a half times that of the profit made.

261    In the present case, as regards V1, it has been shown that she received a total of $1,000 for the two acts of prostitution, which were the moneys she handled over to the accused persons. In the absence of contrary evidence, this sums of monies was presumably to be shared by both the accused persons in a 50/50 division, as they were both equal shareholders and directors of the club. While the Prosecution suggested that what was paid by the customers for V1’s prostitution was more likely in the region of $2,000 per transaction, using the amount offered for V2, with respect, this proposed figure was speculative since whatever applied to V2, a different victim who was to be presumably to be paid by a different customer, may not necessarily apply to V1. Thus, without any further evidence to the contrary, I accepted that the profit made by the accused persons was a total of $1,000 in respect of V1’s prostitution. In the circumstances, an additional fine of $1,000 per accused person (in default one week’s imprisonment), which is double of what each accused person presumably received in profits, would be sufficient to disgorge profits and to act as deterrent bearing in mind the custodial sentences that were also imposed.

### The PHTA charge

262    For Rajendran, who faced a charge under s 3(1) of the PHTA, the prescribed punishment for first offenders is relatively high, namely a fine not exceeding $100,000, and imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and caning not exceeding 6 strokes. I agreed with the Prosecution that the severity of the possible punishment reflects the seriousness with which the legislature regards such offences.

263    As far as sentencing precedents were concerned, Prosecution cited the High Court decision of Chan Seng Onn J in _BSR, a_ case where the accused was convicted of numerous sex and vice related charges under the PC, the WC, and the PHTA. Chan J, who described the acts of the accused being “best described as monstrous” (_BSR_ at \[1\]) imposed a global sentence of 25 and a half years’ imprisonment, 24 strokes of the cane and a $12,000 fine (in default two months’ imprisonment).

264    In respect of the PHTA charge, Chan J noted that “…the similarities between the respective Women’s Charter and PHTA provisions \[and\]….found _Poh Boon Kiat_ and the aggravating factors listed by Menon CJ to be an instructive starting point in determining the appropriate sentence for the Accused.” (see \[27\]). In adopting the same Harm/Culpability framework applied in _Poh Boon Kiat_, Chan J considered that the accused’s acts fell under Cat 1 Harm/A Culpability (see \[29\]). For the charge under s 3(1)(_a_) punishable under s 4(1)(_a_) of the same PHTA, the sentence imposed was six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and a fine of $6,000 (in default one month’s imprisonment).

265    In the recent decision of _Public Prosecutor v Bhattacharya Priyanka Rajesh & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 124</span> (“_Bhattacharya Priyanka Rajesh_”), a case which involved facts similar with the present case, the offenders jointly managed two entertainment clubs that engaged Bangladeshi performing artistes. The offenders were charged with committing similar vice-related offences under the WC (ss 140(1)(_b_), s 146(1) and 147(2) of the WC) and the PHTA (s 3(1) punishable under s 4(1)(_a_) of the PHTA read with s 34 of the PC). Upon conviction, they were each sentenced to a global sentence of five years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and fine $7,500 in default six weeks’ imprisonment. The court applied the sentencing methodology used in _BSR_ for the PHTA charges, and the sentences imposed ranged from two to four years imprisonment, and a fine of $2,500, in default two weeks’ imprisonment.

266    In the present case, as in _Bhattacharya Priyanka Rajesh_, I adopted the approach used in _BSR_ of assessing the accused’s acts within the context of the Harm/Culpability framework set out in _Poh Boon Kiat_, noting of course that the maximum imprisonment prescribed for a PHTA charge is double that for charges under ss 140 and 146 of the WC, and bearing in mind that I had to consider the full spectrum of sentences prescribed by Parliament in determining the appropriate sentence.[^70]

267    In this regard, as far as Rajendran’s culpability was concerned, I agreed with the DPP that it was moderate (_ie_, “B Culpability”) in line with the factors set out for the WC offences, especially as Rajendran had exploited V2’s vulnerability within a short time of her arrival in Singapore. As for the question of harm, I agree that it could be assessed as “Category 2 Harm”, following the factors set out in _Poh Boon Kiat_, since there was actual and threatened violence inflicted, as well as other means of coercion used. However, as highlighted by the Prosecution, I recognised that V2 did not ultimately engage in the sexual activity, and to that extent, Rajendran did not succeed in getting his way on this matter. In light of all the relevant circumstances and the prescribed punishment for such offences, I was of the view that it would be sufficient to impose – at the first cut – a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment.

268    As for imposing a fine, I noted that in _Bhattacharya Priyanka Rajesh_ the fine imposed was $2,500 per charge totalling $15,000, with the quantum guided by the financial gains received by them. In this present case, I agree a fine of $2,000, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment, should be imposed. This is the amount that Anwar paid for sex with V2. The fine imposed would also serve as the deterrent, even if it was not entirely clear if the amount paid had been returned by Rajendran to Anwar.

### The PC charge

269    As for the charge of obstruction of justice under s 204A of the PC, there was really no dispute that both general and specific deterrence should be the primary sentencing considerations for such offences. In this regard, I noted the wide disparity of sentences imposed in the cases set out in the Prosecution’s sentencing table. For such offences, as accepted in _Public Prosecutor v Tay Tong Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 58</span> at \[34\], the following factors are relevant:

> (a)     The gravity of the predicate matter in which justice was sought to be obstructed;

> (b)     The manner in which justice was sought to be obstructed;

> (c)     The duration of the misconduct, including whether the offender ceased his conduct at an early stage, or voluntarily disclosed his misconduct;

> (d)     The potential for harm that could arise from the misconduct;

> (e)     Whether and how the offender stood to gain from obstructing justice.

270    In the present case, the accused persons essentially met up with Roky at the back lane, and told him to leave Singapore once they found out that the performing artistes had gone to the police. At this stage, the accused persons would have been involved in various offences, all of which carried heavy punishments (see \[199\] above), and for which Roky was both an accomplice and a possible witness against them.

271    Roky was told to leave the country and the accused persons also carried out planning and arrangements to effect his removal from Singapore. Subsequently, they took action to cancel his work permit, and Roky was also told that he would be banned from Singapore. Thus, the accused persons acted not only in words but also in deeds, and they acted quickly and with deliberation after the discovery about the victim’s escape from the premises.

272    Their actions were clearly intended to deprive the enforcement agency of important evidence that was relevant to the investigations, and which could have resulted in the accused persons evading the law. Other acts were also subsequently carried out by the accused persons to ensure that Roky remained out of Singapore, and would have further frustrated police efforts at investigations. The accused persons’ actions also showed a complete lack of remorse on their part. In addition, unlike the situation in some of the cases set out in the Prosecution’s sentencing table, the accused’s actions did result in Roky leaving the country and hence did pervert the course of justice.

273    Having considered the sentencing precedents, I agreed that the sentences imposed in the first four precedent cases in the Prosecution’s table served as more useful guides since they shared many of the same features as in the current case, including in the seriousness of the predicate offences, and the extent of involvement of the accused persons in the perversion of justice.

274    Bearing in mind that the sentences imposed for the four cases ranged from nine to 15 months’ imprisonment, including in cases where the offenders had pleaded guilty, it would seem that at first glance, a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment per accused person would not be inappropriate for this charge.

### Overall sentence

275    In _Raveen Balakrishnan_ (at \[238\] above), Menon CJ had set out various useful guidelines to guide the courts in determining whether imprisonment sentences should run consecutively or concurrently in cases involving accused persons convicted of multiple charges:

> (a)     As a general rule, a multiple offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively (see \[41\] of _Raveen Balakrishnan_). Sentences for related offences forming part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement for at least two sentences to run consecutively under s 307(1) of the CPC. (see \[54\] of _Raveen Balakrishnan_);

> (b)     The general rule is subject to three qualifications, namely (1) the totality principle, (2) where it may be appropriate for the court to choose not to run the sentences for unrelated offences consecutively for which the court should explain why it is appropriate not to do so; and (3) any statutory provision that abridges the operation of the general rule (see _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[64\] – \[67\]).

276    In the present case, as regards Sasikumar, his sentence for the WC offences should run concurrently in line with the one transaction rule. Further, in light of the totality principle, I was of the view that the sentence for the charge under s 204A read with 34 of the PC can be reduced to eight months’ imprisonment, bearing in mind also that he is a first offender. This sentence should run consecutively with the sentence for the charge under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 of the PC for a global sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment. A fine of $1,000 (in default one week’s imprisonment) for the offence under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 PC is additionally to be imposed.

277    As for Rajendran, who was convicted on four charges, I agreed that in line with the different protected interests under the WC, PC and PHTA, the sentences for the offence under s 146(1) of the WC read with s 34 PC, which should similarly be eight months’ imprisonment, should run consecutively with the sentences for the PC and PHTA charges, and concurrently with the sentence for the s 140(1)(_b_) WC charge. At the same time, I also agreed that the PC and PHTA sentence should be reduced in light of the totality principle to a sentence of eight and 14 months’ imprisonment respectively. The aggregate sentence imposed is thus 30 months’ imprisonment. An additional fine of $3,000 (in default three weeks’ imprisonment) is also to be imposed.

278    The accused persons, being dissatisfied, have filed appeals against their convictions and sentence. They are both currently on bail.
