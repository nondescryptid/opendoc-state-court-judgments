Tort – Conversion – Damages – Chattels

Evidence – Admissibility of evidence – Hearsay

7 January 2022

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       In these assessment of damages proceedings (the “**AD proceedings**”), the Plaintiff makes the novel argument that the contents of an expert report was admissible in evidence despite the expert’s absence at these AD proceedings, because the report had already been admitted into evidence at the trial on liability. For the reasons set out in this decision, I rejected the argument. In my view, in a bifurcated trial, evidence must be admitted and received in the usual course for _each_ distinct part of the trial. These AD proceedings also raised interesting issues on how to assess damages for converted goods and the issue of costs where the Plaintiff succeeded in proving conversion for only around half of the items claimed.

2       The AD proceedings took place before me on 21 April 2021 and I gave my decision on 31 May 2021. My decision on costs was separately rendered on 30 June 2021. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Background

3       These proceedings arose out of the Plaintiff’s claims against the 1st and 2nd Defendants for conversion of 280 bottles of high-end and commercial wines. The factual background had been set out in the decision of the trial judge in _Hock Tong Bee Pte Ltd v Quek Hock Tiong and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 81</span>. I will summarise only the salient facts relevant to these AD proceedings.

4       The Plaintiff, Hock Tong Bee Pte Ltd, is in the business of selling wines. It is one of the largest wine distributors and retailers in Singapore.[^1] From 2011 to 2013, one of the Plaintiff’s relationship manager, Ms. Luciana Lim (“**Luciana**”), dishonestly converted 14,698 bottles of the Plaintiff’s wines. Luciana was convicted for criminal breach of trust under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224).

5       Some of the wines misappropriated by Luciana were sold by Luciana to the 1st and 2nd Defendants, and the Plaintiff commenced the present suit against the Defendants for conversion of 280 bottles of wine. The suit was bifurcated and the trial on liability took place over five days between September 2019 to March 2020. At the end of the trial, the trial judge found the Defendants liable in conversion for all 280 bottles. The Defendants appealed against the decision of the trial judge and their appeal was allowed in part. The High Court Judge found the Defendants liable for conversion of 150 bottles of wine (instead of all 280 bottles) listed at **Annex A** (the “**Misappropriated Bottles**”). The Plaintiff’s damages for the conversion of the Misappropriated Bottles were to be assessed.

## The Issues

6       The parties’ positions and the main issues before me in these AD proceedings can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     First, there was a preliminary issue as to what evidence I could and should have regard to in assessing the Plaintiff’s damages. The particular issue arose in this case because the Plaintiff’s expert witness did not attend to be cross-examined at the AD proceedings. The Plaintiff submitted that notwithstanding, the expert’s evidence was admissible because he was cross-examined during the trial on liability, and his expert report was admitted into evidence then. The Defendants objected to the admission of the Plaintiff’s expert evidence. I shall refer to this as the “**Evidential Issue**”.

> (b)     Second, I had to determine how to assess the value of the Misappropriated Bottles. The Plaintiff argued that the correct measure was the “_market value_” or the hypothetical _selling_ price of the wines, whereas the Defendants contended that I should use the “_replacement cost_”, or the hypothetical _purchase_ price of the Misappropriated Bottles at the time of conversion. I shall refer to this as the “**Assessment Issue**”.

> (c)     Third, the Defendants contended that the Plaintiff had failed to mitigate its losses because the Plaintiff “\[failed\] _to verify…the orders placed by Luciana Lim_”, and therefore “_assumed responsibility for its own mistake in allowing Luciana Lim to misappropriate the wines_”.[^2] I therefore had to consider whether deductions should be made on account of any alleged failure by the Plaintiff to mitigate its losses. I shall refer to this as the “**Mitigation Issue**”.

> (d)     Lastly, there was the issue of costs. Specifically, the Defendants contended that the Plaintiff should only be entitled to 44% of the usual costs, since it only succeeded in proving conversion of 150 bottles out of the 280 bottles claimed. The Plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that it should be entitled to the full costs of the claim since it succeeded in proving the “_fundamental issue in the suit_”.[^3] I shall refer to this as the “**Costs Issue**”.

7       I set out my decision on each of the four issues in that order.

## The Evidential Issue

8       The Evidential issue arose in respect of the admissibility of the evidence of Mr. Tay Ngee Beng (“**Mr. Tay**”).

### Background

9       Mr. Tay is an expert in the trading, sales and distribution of wine and spirits, and was the Plaintiff’s expert witness at the trial on liability. Mr. Tay had affirmed an affidavit of evidence in chief dated 21 May 2019 and produced an expert report dated 21 May 2019 (“**Expert Report**”). The Expert Report addressed, amongst other things, the retail market value of the Misappropriated Wines.

10     As the Plaintiff’s expert witness, Mr. Tay attended the trial on liability on 8 January 2020 and his evidence, including the contents of the Expert Report, was subjected to cross-examination by the Defendants’ counsel on that occasion.

11     By the time of the AD proceedings, however, I was informed by the Plaintiff’s counsel that Mr. Tay had been rendered bed-ridden by terminal liver cancer and was unable to attend the assessment of damages hearing. For compassionate reasons and out of respect of his privacy, the Plaintiff decided not to ask Mr. Tay for any documentary proof of his medical condition, and there was therefore no such evidence before me.[^4]

### Parties’ Positions

12     Notwithstanding Mr. Tay’s absence, the Plaintiff sought to rely on the contents of the Expert Report in these AD proceedings, and contended that I could have regard to them as well. The reason, as the Plaintiff submitted, was because the Expert Report had already been admitted into evidence by virtue of Mr. Tay’s attendance at trial on liability.[^5] Accordingly, the Plaintiff submitted that there was no issue of admissibility with respect to Mr. Tay’s evidence. The only issue was the appropriate weight to be given to the Expert Report in light of Mr. Tay’s inability to attend the AD proceedings to be cross-examined. In this regard, the Plaintiff submitted that some weight should nevertheless be given to the Expert Report as it has high probative value.[^6]

13     Unsurprisingly, the Defendants objected to the use of the Expert Report for the obvious reason that Mr. Tay did not attend the assessment of damages hearing to give evidence and be cross-examined. This, the Defendants submitted, was clearly not in compliance with Order 38 Rules 1 and 2(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (the “**ROC**”), which provided that any evidence of witnesses shall be proven by the examination of the witness in open Court and that unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties agree, such a witness shall attend trial for cross-examination. Accordingly, if the witness did not attend for examination, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.[^7] The relevant portions of Order 38 of the ROC are set out below:

> General rule: Witnesses to be examined (O. 38, r. 1)

> 1.    Subject to these Rules and the Evidence Act (Cap. 97), and any other written law relating to evidence, **any fact required to be proved at the trial** of any action begun by writ **by the evidence of witnesses shall be proved by the examination of the witnesses in open Court**.

> Evidence by affidavit (O. 38, r. 2)

> 2.—(1)    Without prejudice to the generality of Rule 1, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ, evidence-in-chief of a witness shall be given by way of affidavit and, **unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties to the action otherwise agree, such a witness shall attend trial for cross-examination and, in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court**.

> …

> (4)    Notwithstanding paragraph (1), (2) or (3), the Court may, if it thinks just, order that evidence of a party or any witness or any part of such evidence be given orally at the trial or hearing of any cause or matter.

\[emphasis added in bold\]

### My Decision

14     The requirement for a witness giving evidence to attend at the trial with the opposing party having the corresponding opportunity to cross-examine and test the evidence of that witness is fundamental to our adversarial system, and I need not cite any authority for that. The question was how that should be applied in a bifurcated trial.

15     At first glance, there might be some superficial attraction in the Plaintiff’s submissions because a bifurcated trial can be seen as one single trial that had simply been split into distinct and separate parts. The cause of action, the suit and the inquiries remained the same, only the manner in which the trial is conducted is separated into two (or more) distinct parts. On that view, I could see some force in the Plaintiff’s submissions that evidence admitted for the trial on liability is deemed as having been admitted for the _entire trial_, including the trial on damages.

16     Despite that superficial attraction, I was ultimately unable to accept these submissions as I found the position to be contrary to the evidential regime, case authorities and, fundamentally, the rules of fairness. In my view, in a bifurcated trial, evidence must be admitted and received in the usual course for each distinct part of the trial.

17     I start first with the evidential regime.

18     Although none of the parties referred to the provisions of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“**EA**”), I considered it of particular relevance that Section 33 of the EA sets out _specific conditions_ that must be met before evidence given by a witness in one judicial proceeding can be relevant to prove the truth of the facts which it states in a _subsequent_ judicial proceeding, or even in a _later stage_ of the _same_ judicial proceeding. Section 33 of the EA states:

> Relevancy of certain evidence for proving in subsequent proceeding the truth of facts therein stated

> 33.     **Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding**, or before any person authorised by law to take it, **is relevant for the purpose of proving in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states**, when the witness is dead or cannot be found or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case the court considers unreasonable **subject to the following provisions**:

>> (a)    the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in interest;

>> (b)    the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine; and

>> (c)    the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding.

> _Explanation_—A criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed to be a proceeding between the prosecutor and the accused within the meaning of this section.

\[emphasis added in bold\]

19     The fact that Section 33 of the EA imposed specific conditions before evidence of the _same_ witness can be admissible in a subsequent proceeding or a later stage of the _same_ proceeding must necessarily mean that if the stated conditions were not met, the default position would be that evidence given by a witness in one judicial proceeding cannot be used to prove the truth of the facts it states in a _subsequent_ judicial proceeding or even in a later stage of the _same_ judicial proceeding. Otherwise, Section 33 of the EA would have no utility.

20     In _Teo Wai Cheong v Credit Industriel et Commercial and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 573</span> (“**_Teo Wai Cheong_**”), the Court of Appeal considered the application of Section 33 of the EA in the context of a re-trial. In that case, trial had taken place but on appeal, a re-trial was ordered because certain material documents were not disclosed during the first trial. By the time of the re-trial, however, the defendant was unable procure the attendance of one of its key witnesses who attended the first trial. That witness was by then no longer employed by the defendant and could no longer be found. The defendant therefore made an application under Section 33 of the EA for leave to admit, in the re-trial, that witness’ affidavit of evidence in chief and oral evidence given at the first trial. For reasons specific to the facts of _Teo Wai Cheong_, the Court of Appeal refused to allow the evidence to be admitted, save for parts relating to certain background facts which was admitted because no objection was taken by the opposing party.

21     The Court of Appeal in _Teo Wai Cheong_ examined the underlying policy of Section 33 of the EA and noted that it constituted an exception to the rule against hearsay and represents “_an exceptional jurisdiction and so its requirements must be strictly satisfied before it may be invoked_” (_Teo Wai Cheong_ at \[23\] and \[24\]):

> 23    Section 33 of the EA provides that in the prescribed circumstances, evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding or before any person authorised by law to take such evidence is relevant for the purposes of proving in a subsequent judicial proceeding the truth of the facts it states. In our judgment, **s 33 represents an exceptional jurisdiction and so its requirements must be strictly satisfied before it may be invoked**. In Chainchal Singh v Emperor AIR 1946 PC 1, Lord Goddard noted the same saying (at \[4\]):

>> Where it is desired to have recourse to this section on the ground that a witness is incapable of giving evidence, that fact must be proved, and proved strictly. **It is an elementary right of an accused person or a litigant in a civil suit that a witness who is to testify against him should give his evidence before the Court trying the case which then has the opportunity of seeing the witness and observing his demeanour and can thus form a better opinion as to his reliability than is possible from reading a statement or deposition**. It is necessary that provision should be made for exceptional cases where it is impossible for the witness to be before the Court, and it is only by a statutory provision that this can be achieved. But the Court must be careful to see that the conditions on which the statute permits previous evidence given by the witness to be read are strictly proved. \[emphasis added\]

> 24    Section 33, in common with the EA as a whole, has its origins in the English common law (see Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, A Digest of the Law of Evidence (MacMillan and Co Ltd, 12th Ed, 1936) at pp 52–53). This section traces its origins to the 19th century case of Wright v Doe d Tatham (1834) 1 Ad & E 3, amongst others. Various theories have been advanced to rationalise the reception of such evidence, including a suggestion that the rule is sui generis_._ **In our view, the rule operates within an overall framework that is designed to ensure that, as far as possible, the best evidence is placed before the court while permitting narrow exceptions where necessary and to the extent that there are sufficient safeguards to assure the reliability of the evidence**. It will usually be the case that the best evidence will require the presence and oral testimony of the witness concerned. **Where for some reason this is not possible, such as in the circumstances prescribed in s 33, then hearsay evidence may be resorted to.** Under s 33, the hearsay evidence concerned is of a specific sort, namely that which had been given at a previous “judicial proceeding” or “before any person authorised by law to take it”. As with all exceptions to the rule against hearsay evidence, this is subject to certain preconditions. These preconditions in s 33 are found in the requirement that the witness be practically unavailable and in the three provisos to the section.

\[emphasis added in bold\]

22     The observations made by the Court of Appeal in _Teo Wai Cheong_ made it abundantly clear that evidence given by a witness at a previous judicial proceeding, or at an _earlier stage_ of the _same_ judicial proceeding, is hearsay insofar as a _later or subsequent_ proceeding is concerned. This applied in the context of a _re-trial_ in _Teo Wai Cheong_ and, in my view, would apply with even greater force in the context of a _bifurcated_ trial, where the issues arising are likely to be materially different.

23     In this case, the Plaintiff submitted that prior to the trial on liability, parties had proceeded on the basis that the trial would deal with issues of both liability and damage, and all the affidavit evidence (including the Expert Report) were prepared on that basis. It was only at the start of the trial on liability that the trial judge decided to bifurcate the issues of liability and damage. Accordingly, the Defendants had the opportunity to adduce their own expert evidence (which they chose not to) and to cross-examine Mr. Tay on matters relating to the market retail value of the Misappropriated Bottles, as that was already addressed in the Expert Report. Accordingly, there was no prejudice to the Defendants in admitting the Expert Report for the AD proceedings without the attendance of Mr. Tay.[^8]

24     With respect, these submissions missed the point. In a liability / damages bifurcated trial, parties would have understood and proceeded on the basis that specific and distinct issues were being addressed at different stages of the proceedings. This was the same even if the bifurcation order was made only at the start of the trial. Mr. Tay’s Expert Report may have addressed issues of both liability and quantum, but the Defendants’ counsel would only have cross-examined Mr. Tay insofar as his evidence touched on the issue of liability at the liability trial. In fact, if the Defendants’ counsel had sought to cross-examine Mr. Tay on issues relating to damage at the trial on liability, he would likely have been stopped in his path because those questions would not have been relevant to the trial on liability and it would defeat the purpose of bifurcation to have evidence taken on all the issues at the liability trial.

25     Ultimately, the matter did not turn on the label of “_bifurcation_” and whether the proceeding is to be viewed as one single trial or two (or more) separate trials on different issues. The answer may well be different depending on the purpose of the inquiry. What mattered was the substance of events that transpired. In the circumstances of a liability / damages bifurcated trial where parties would legitimately expect, and be expected, to address only issues relating to liability at the liability trial, _to the exclusion_ of issues relating to damage, then evidence admitted at the liability trial cannot, without more, constitute evidence received at the subsequent proceeding for the assessment of damages. If any of the parties wished to admit such evidence without the attendance of the witness, the appropriate application for leave should be made.

26     In this case, the Plaintiff did not even seek to rely on Section 33 of the EA, or to seek leave to admit the Expert Report without Mr. Tay’s attendance at the AD proceedings. Furthermore, and despite the greatest of sympathies to Mr. Tay, the fact of the matter was that there was an absolute lack of evidence on Mr. Tay’s medical condition and the reason(s) for his inability to attend the AD proceedings. All that was available were submissions from the Plaintiff’s counsel. In fact, according to the submissions of the Plaintiff’s counsel, the Plaintiff made a _deliberate decision_ not to procure any evidence relating to Mr. Tay’s medical condition or his inability to attend these AD proceedings.[^9] In those circumstances, the Plaintiff would not have been able to bring itself within the ambit of Section 33 of the EA in any event, even if such an application had been made.

27     Accordingly, on the Evidential Issue, I disagreed with the Plaintiff and found that the Expert Report was not admitted in evidence for the AD proceedings, and I ought not to have regard to its contents in assessing the Plaintiff’s damages.

28     As a result, the only evidence before me in these AD proceedings was the evidence given by the Plaintiff’s Mr. Ang Kim Tuan Clinton (“**Mr. Clinton Ang**”).

## The Assessment Issue

29     The second issue, and at the heart of the contention between the parties, was how the Plaintiff’s losses for the Misappropriated Bottles should be assessed.

### The Legal Framework

30     At the highest level of abstraction, damages awarded in tort seek to compensate the claimant as best as possible for the loss of damage he suffers by reason of the conversion. The damage for tort is compensatory in nature and seeks to put the claimant in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong: see _Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co_ <span class="citation">(1880) 5 App Cas 25</span> at 39. The precise measure of damages may vary according to the circumstances of the case: see _Brandeis Goldschmidt & Co Ltd v Western Transport Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 864</span> at 870.

31     At a more specific level, damage for conversion may generally consist of two components: see _Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v Comtech IT Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 1010</span> (“**_Chartered Electronics_**”) at \[17\] and \[19\]:

> (a)     The first is the “_value of the goods_”.

> (b)     The second is _“any consequential damage flowing from the conversion_”, including loss of profits and loss incurred through being deprived of the use of the goods. This is subject to the principles of remoteness of damage.

32     Subsequent to _Chartered Electronics_, the Court of Appeal elaborated on the appropriate measure of damages for conversion in _Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd v Fairmacs Shipping & Transport Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 541</span> (“**_Marco Polo_**”). The follow principles can be summarised:

> (a)     First, affirming _Chartered Electronics_, damage for conversion generally consists of the value of the goods converted, plus any consequential losses: see _Marco Polo_ at \[29\].

> (b)     To determine the value of goods, courts typically first ascertain whether a “_market_” exists for the converted goods. That “_market_” must be one with willing sellers and willing buyers after negotiations, in which the claimant is a participant: see _Marco Polo_ at \[30\] to \[32\].

> (c)     If there is a relevant “_market_”, then the value of the goods converted should generally be determined by reference to the “_market price_” of the converted goods in that relevant market: see _Marco Polo_ at \[30\].

> (d)     If there is no such relevant “_market_” or the relevant “_market_” or “_market price_” cannot be determined on the evidence, then the value of the goods can be determined by reference to the “_cost of replacement_”. “_Cost of replacement_” _typically_ refers to the price at which the goods were bought: see _Marco Polo_ at \[33\].

> (e)     Lastly, where no market exists in which to replace the goods, then the value of the converted goods may be fixed at what the claimant could get by sale to a solvent buyer: see _Marco Polo_ at \[33\].

33     Both the Plaintiff and the Defendants in this case relied on _Chartered Electronics_ and _Marco Polo_ in their closing submissions, and neither disputed the correctness of the principles stated in these cases. I therefore adopted the framework as set out at \[32\] above. I would, however, add two points before proceeding with the application of the law to the facts.

34     The first is a reminder that it is the claimant who bears the burden of proving his damage. This naturally goes without saying but in this specific context, it meant that the Plaintiff ultimately bears the legal burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, the existence of the relevant market, the relevant market price, and any consequential losses: see _Marco Polo_ at \[43\] and _Chartered Electronics_ at \[17\] and \[22\]. In other words, the Plaintiff must adduce sufficient evidence to show both the _fact_ of damage and its _amount_: see _Biofuel Industries Pte Ltd v V8 Environmental Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 199</span> at \[41\].

35     The second point relates to the relevant date of assessment.

36     There was no dispute between the parties in this case that damage should be assessed at the date of conversion,[^10] but neither party submitted on what _precisely_ those dates were in respect of _each_ of the Misappropriated Bottles. Both the Plaintiff and the Defendants appeared to accept that the date of conversion in this case referred _generally_ to the period of September to November 2012, which was the “_approximate date of transaction and delivery_” for the Misappropriated Bottles.[^11] There was no evidence or arguments advanced as to the _precise_ date of conversion for each bottle of wine. Neither was it suggested that the _precise_ date made any material difference to the quantum of damage. In these circumstances and given the arguments raised, I adopted the period of September to November 2012 _generally_ as the date of conversion for all the Misappropriated Bottles.

### The High-End Wines

#### Parties’ Positions

37     As mentioned, parties did not dispute the framework set out in _Chartered Electronics_ and _Marco Polo_, but differed as to their application.

38     The Plaintiff argued that the relevant “_market_” in this case should be the market in which the Plaintiff was selling high-end wines to retail customers and smaller wine merchants, which the Plaintiff referred to as the “**_Retail Market_**”. This was because there were a number of “_markets_” for the trading of high-end wines, and the Plaintiff was a participant in the Retail Market where large wine merchants (like the Plaintiff) would purchase high-end wines from the wineries through a medium known as the “_Négociants_”, and then on-sell them to retail customers and other wine merchants.[^12] The Plaintiff further submitted that the value of the Misappropriated Bottles _in the Retail Market_ was reflected in the Plaintiff’s price list for high-end wines as at late 2012, which the Plaintiff referred to as the “**_Grand Cru Price List_**”.[^13]

39     The Defendants, on the other hand, submitted that the Grand Cru Price List should not be accepted as evidence of the value of the Misappropriated Bottles in the Retail Market, because it was:

> (a)     prepared by the Plaintiff;[^14]

> (b)     uncorroborated;[^15]

> (c)     inconsistent with the price of high-end wines reflected on the Plaintiff’s sales confirmation forms for actual transactions;[^16] and

> (d)     not reflective of the discounts given by the Plaintiff to its customers.[^17]

40     Instead, the Defendants urged me to use the price of the Misappropriated Bottles on a platform called “_Liv-ex_”, which listed the wholesale market price for wine trades between wine merchants. The Defendants’ case was that the “_Liv-ex_” prices showed the “_replacement cost_” for the Misappropriated Bottles.[^18]

#### My Decision

41     On my part, I did not consider that evidence must necessarily be “_corroborated_” or independently prepared before it could be accepted or given weight. I was, however, not convinced that the Grand Cru Price List evidenced the value of the Misappropriated Bottles on the Retail Market.

42     As a starting point, I was prepared to the Plaintiff’s submissions that there are various “_markets_” for the sale and trading of high-end wines, and the Plaintiff was, at the time of conversion of the Misappropriated Bottles (and remains so), a participant in the Retail Market. The evidence from the Plaintiff’s Mr. Clinton Ang was cogent and clear in this regard, and was not seriously challenged by the Defendants. Mr. Clinton Ang explained the supply chain of high-end wines as follows:

> A:    …These are high end wines (Grand Cru wines). **The cost price is released once a year as a wine futures, which means you buy the right to obtain the wines, currently in barrel, and when released in bottles, which normally takes 2 years to receive the physical stock.** From there it gets traded throughout the world and relevant mark-ups (depending on whether it is B2B or B2C) **This system is called** **_en-primeur_****. It is the system to buy the wine futures.** Once the bottles are released, it is just a physical sale.

> Ct:    Is the trading of the futures on a platform?

> A:     **In April every year, top 500 wine merchants from the whole world travel to France to taste the wine**. Depending on vintage, quantity, the **wineries will sell to a middleman we call the “négociant”. The mark-up to the négociant is 20%. The négociant will sell at a 20% mark up to wine merchants like ourselves. We also sell en-primeur – i.e. we sell to individuals at 20% \[mark-up\] as futures. Once we hold it for two years, the price moves to market price and that is where Live-Ex comes in.** Live-Ex only invite top 500 wine merchants in the world to ensure transparency and accountability. You cannot buy any of the previous wine futures once the wine is listed on Live-Ex. It is quite a vast and complex process. If, today, I am a new merchant and I want to buy a $1500 futures, you would not be able to get the allocation because the allocation is historical and you usually have to buy a lot of wine to get the allocation. There is a lot of cash tied up for you to get into the system and for you to get your necessary allocations.

\[emphasis added in bold\]

43     Based on Mr. Clinton Ang’s evidence, I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submission that the various “_markets_” for high-end wines may be depicted in the following chart, and the Plaintiff was a participant of the Retail Market:

![]([2021] SGDC 0296_Image/[2021] SGDC 0296_image1.png)

44     The identification of the relevant “_market_”, however, was only half of the inquiry. If there were insufficient evidence of the value of the converted goods in the relevant “_market_”, then the theoretical identification of such a “_market_” would be of little utility. As the Court of Appeal explained in _Marco Polo_, however one defines a “_market_”, it must, minimally, consist of _willing_ sellers and _willing_ buyers _after negotiations_: see _Marco Polo_ at \[31\]. To put it rather differently, there can be no “_market_” without a “_market price_” because there can be a _theoretical_ market at nearly every price.

45     The problem with the Plaintiff’s case was that having identified that the relevant market was the Retail Market, the Plaintiff relied almost exclusively on the evidence of Mr. Tay to demonstrate that the Grand Cru Price List evidenced the value of the Misappropriated Wines in the Retail Market.[^19] As I have found at \[27\] above that Mr. Tay’s evidence and the Expert Report were not admissible in these AD proceedings, I was unable to have regard to them in determining the value of the Misappropriated Bottles in the Retail Market. That being the case, all that was left of the evidence before me insofar as this issue was concerned was Mr. Clinton Ang’s evidence that the Grand Cru Price List reflected “_the prices which the Plaintiff is putting the bottles out for sale_” and that as the “_oldest wine merchant in South East Asia_”, the prices stated on the Plaintiff’s Grand Cru Price list was “_competitive_” and “_transparent_”.[^20]

46     This aspect of Mr. Clinton Ang’s evidence was challenged by the Defendants and as the Defendants rightly pointed out, the Plaintiff’s position that the Grand Cru Price List evidenced the price of the wines in the Retail Market was contradicted by Mr. Clinton Ang’s own evidence during the AD proceedings that the Plaintiff would _in fact_ sell high-end wines to its retail customers at prices which were _lower_ than those stated on the Grand Cru Price List:

DC:

**Would you accept that wines will sometimes be sold at a discount to your customers, despite what is stated in the Grand Cru price list?**

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**We do offer limited discounts to some customers, yes.**

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

We have seen the confirmation given in the sales confirmation forms – for eg Pg 14 of DBOD, discounts up to 30% were given?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

This was the price Plaintiff was willing to sell at?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

There is a difference – first and second wines are commercial wines.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

I am just saying there were wines sold by the company at these discounts?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

For commercial wines, yes. **For open market wine, the discounts are limited.**

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

**There is still a 10% discount.**

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**As it appears.**

47     Furthermore, the Defendants also referred to various inconsistencies between the prices stated on the Grand Cru Price List, and those reflected on the Plaintiff’s sales confirmation forms.[^21] These sales confirmation forms were the Plaintiff’s documents and akin to invoices or purchase orders issued by the Plaintiff when a sale is made. Mr. Clinton Ang confirmed in these AD proceedings that “_apart from the_ \[fact that\] _the name is fake, everything else in the_ \[sales confirmation\] _form is real_”, including the prices stated.[^22] As the Defendants pointed out, the prices stated on the Plaintiff’s sales confirmation forms were generally _lower_ than those stated on the Grand Cru Price List, and that again suggested that the Grand Cru Price List did _not_ reflect the _actual_ market prices of the Misappropriated Bottles.

48     Considering the evidence in totality, I was of the view that while the Grand Cru Price List may show that the Plaintiff was a _willing seller_ of the Misappropriated Bottles at the listed prices, it did not and could not, without more, demonstrate that there were also _willing buyers after negotiation_ for those products and _at those prices_. In view of the countervailing evidence showing that actual transactions were being conducted at a discount to the prices stated on the Grand Cru Price List, to assess the value of the Misappropriated Bottles based on the Grand Cru Price List would in effect confer upon the Plaintiff the benefit of profits which it would likely not have obtained in actual transactions. In other words, I was not satisfied that the Plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence to prove that the prices stated on the Grand Cru Price List was reflective of the _value_ of the goods in the Retail Market.

49     How then should the Plaintiff’s losses be assessed?

50     The alternative to the Grand Cru Price List put forward to me by the Defendants were the prices reflected on the “_Liv-ex_” platform at the material time in late 2012.

51     “_Liv-ex_” is short for the London International Vintners Exchange (“**Liv-ex**”). In the Plaintiff’s own words, Liv-ex is “_the global fine wine market_” which provides “_trading, settlement and data services to wine merchants around the world_”.[^23] The Liv-ex indicators are based on the activity of over 400 fine wine merchants based in 41 countries worldwide, whose activity accounts for an estimated 90% of fine wine turnover globally. In fact, it is the evidence of the Plaintiff’s Mr. Clinton Ang that Liv-ex is “_the world’s most comprehensive database of fine wine prices_”.[^24]

52     The Plaintiff placed heavy reliance on the prices of the Misappropriated Bottles as listed on Liv-ex during the trial on liability to demonstrate that the prices at which the Misappropriated Bottles were sold to the Defendants were heavily discounted. To explain the credibility of the Liv-ex prices, Mr. Clinton Ang explained as follows:[^25]

> “**Liv-ex data is the only source of data based on real merchant transactions, rather than advertised prices which can be inaccurate and out of date**. Liv-ex data is regularly quoted by media outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. The Liv-ex data shows the cheapest wholesale market prices for wine trades between wine merchants, excluding tax and duties….These prices are obviously much lower than retail prices which wine merchants like HTB would sell to retail customers at. Auction prices on the market are also generally lower than retail prices or even whole sale prices…”

\[emphasis added in bold\]

53     In a way, Mr. Ang’s evidence reinforced the Defendants’ objection and my reluctance with adopting the Grand Cru Price List as evidence of the market value of the Misappropriated Bottles, as such “_advertised prices_” can, in Mr. Ang’s words, be “_inaccurate_”.

54     The Plaintiff, however, objected to the use of the Liv-ex data for the purposes of the AD proceedings, for two reasons. First, the Plaintiff submitted that the Liv-ex prices did not include “_tax, duties, shipping costs, insurance and other associated costs of receiving delivery of the wines_” (“**Additional Costs**”). Second, even if these Additional Costs were accounted for, the aggregate would only constitute “_the cost of replacement of the Converted Wines_” and not their “_market value_”.[^26]

55     I accepted the Plaintiff’s first objection in that I agreed that the Additional Costs should be accounted for, and I would elaborate on this below. It did not, however, mean that the Liv-ex data could not provide a useful starting point for the assessment.

56     As to the Plaintiff’s second objection, in my view, the Plaintiff’s preoccupation with labels and dogmatism was obscuring the real inquiry.

57     Putting aside the concepts of “_market value_” or “_replacement costs_”, the basic object of an award of damages in tort is of course to put the injured party in the same financial position as he would have been in if the tortious act had not occurred.

58     In this case, the Plaintiff was a wine wholesaler and retailer.[^27] 150 bottles of wine in the Plaintiff’s warehouse were stolen by Luciana and sold to the 1st and 2nd Defendants, who were now having to pay damages for that conversion. So, what is the damage that would put the Plaintiff back in the position as if the tort did not occur? It my view, it ought to be what it would cost, in late 2012, to put those 150 Misappropriated Bottles back into the Plaintiff’s warehouse. That was the position which the Plaintiff would have been in, had the tort not occurred.

59     If, at the time of the conversion, the Plaintiff had existing orders for the Misappropriated Bottles which it was unable to fulfil as a result of the conversion, then, of course, the Plaintiff would be entitled to put forward evidence to prove consequential losses such as loss of any profit which the Plaintiff could have made on the Misappropriated Bottles, or penalties or additional costs it had to pay for failing to fulfill those orders. This is again because the Plaintiff is entitled to be put back in the same position it would be in as if the tort did not occur, only in that situation, that position is no longer a claimant with 150 bottles of wine in a warehouse waiting to be sold, but a claimant with pending orders for the 150 bottles waiting to be fulfilled. Similarly, if the Plaintiff could show that there is a ready market for the 150 bottles and the prices of the goods in that market, the Plaintiff would be entitled to be restored, as far as damage can do it, to a seller in that position. That is why there is no universal rule for assessment of damages and the precise measure should always yield to fit the contours of the case. Concepts such as “_market value_” or “_costs of replacement_” are convenient starting points and may even be the endpoint in some cases, but they are not the be-all and end-all of the inquiry in every case and no useful purpose is achieved by fixation on the label.

60     With that in mind, I return to the Plaintiff’s objection that even with the Additional Costs accounted for, the Plaintiff would only be compensated for the “_costs of replacement_”, which was not the appropriate measure in this case. There are two points to this.

61     First, the Liv-ex price(s) reflected the “_market price_” for wines of the same brand and vintage as the Misappropriated Bottles at the time of conversion, except that it is the _wholesale_ market price and not the _retail_ market price. But the Plaintiff is _both_ a wholesaler and a retailer of the Misappropriated Bottles,[^28] and therefore it is a participant of the wholesale market as well.

62     Second, even if the Liv-ex price(s) (together with the Additional Costs) were to be labelled as the “_replacement costs_”, there was nothing inappropriate with adopting this measure, because the Plaintiff has failed to put forward sufficient evidence to discharge its burden in showing the existence of a market (i.e. the presence of willing sellers _and_ willing buyers after negotiation) for the Misappropriated Bottles at the prices listed on the Grand Cru Price List. Since the Plaintiff failed to prove the existence of such a market and/or the “_value_” of the converted goods in that market, it is entirely consistent with the framework set out in _Chartered Electronics_ and _Marco Polo_ to assess the Plaintiff’s damages on the basis of the “_replacement costs_” of the goods instead.

63     The Liv-ex prices, however, only provided a starting point. As mentioned earlier, there were Additional Costs (i.e. tax, duties, shipping costs, insurance and other associated costs of receiving delivery of the wines) which needed to be accounted for.

64     In this regard, it was the consistent evidence of Mr. Clinton Ang that the Liv-ex prices did _not_ include tax, duties, shipping charges and delivery costs.[^29] There was no reason to doubt this aspect of Mr. Clinton Ang’s evidence and the Defendants did not seriously challenge this either.

65     In my view, in order to put the Plaintiff in the position it would be in as if the Misappropriated Wines were still in its warehouse in late 2012, the Plaintiff must be compensated for the Additional Costs it would have had to incur in order to bring those wines into Singapore. The problem, however, was that there was a dearth of evidence before me as to the quantum of the Additional Costs. Although the evidence is poor, I must assess the Plaintiff’s damages as best as I could on this poor foundation. 

66     What little evidence given by Mr. Clinton Ang on the Additional Costs could be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The traders on Liv-ex are generally based in London. To bring in the physical bottles of wine purchased on Liv-ex into Singapore, the Plaintiff would need to arrange for the wine to be shipped on refrigerated containers which costs approximately five times more than a dry container. In addition, the Plaintiff would have needed to pay customs duty on the wine;

> (b)     The customs duty payable on alcohol imported into Singapore is a customs-directed tax and it is at the rate of _“$88 per litre per alcohol percentage_”; and

> (c)     The estimated “_all in_” Additional Costs is approximately $20 per bottle, but it could vary.

67     Since there was no evidence on the alcohol percentage of the Misappropriated Bottles or the costs of shipping by refrigerated containers, I would take as a starting reference the “_all in_” Additional Costs indicated by Mr. Clinton Ang at $20 per bottle of wine. On that basis, the Additional Costs for the 116 bottles of converted wine would work out to be $2,320 (I would explain later why this calculation related to only 116 bottles).

68     Adding this to the Liv-ex prices of the 116 Misappropriated Bottles (as tabulated in the table below),[^30] the total value or the landed costs of the 116 bottles would be $92,265.05 (i.e. $89,945.05 + $2,320) (“**116 Aggregate Value**”).

69     To ensure that this was not a gross over or under estimation of the Plaintiff’s losses, I then checked this against the other evidence before me.

70     In his affidavit of evidence in-chief, Mr. Clinton Ang indicated that the Plaintiff “_never sold high-end wines at more than 20% discount on its retail price_” because this would “_wipe out \[the Plaintiff’s\] profit margin_”. Assuming then that the Plaintiff’s profit margin was around 20% of the retail price listed on the Grand Cru Price List, the value for the 116 bottles, less the Plaintiff’s profit margin, would be around $115,910.56 (“**116 Sans Profit Value**”)

71     The 116 Aggregate Value was therefore clearly not an over-valuation of the Plaintiff’s losses. Was it, however, an under-valuation? In my view, it was not. It was clear that apart from shipping and customs duties, the Plaintiff as a wine retailer and wholesaler would have other overheads costs and sunk costs, such as rental, fixtures and equipment, manpower, corporate tax etc. All of these were additional overheads which the Plaintiff would have had to incur, with or without the tortious acts being committed. In other words, these are costs which the Plaintiff would have to incur, and presumably be factored into the selling price of its products, regardless whether it has 116 bottles of the Misappropriated Bottles sitting in its warehouse or not. Accordingly, it was only natural that there would be some disparity between the 116 Aggregate Value and 116 Sans Profit Value, and such discrepancy did not, in my view, demonstrate that the 116 Aggregate Value was a gross under-estimation.

72     Accordingly, I assessed the Plaintiff’s damage for the conversion of the 116 bottles of high-end wines listed at items 1 to 16 of Annex A at **$92,265.05**.

### Commercial Wines

73     As noted earlier, the analysis above related to only 116 bottles of the converted wines. This was because not all 150 of the Misappropriated Bottles were listed on Liv-ex or the Grand Cru Price List, which only reflected the prices for high-end wines. It was not disputed by the parties that 34 of the Misappropriated Bottles were what may generally be referred to as “_commercial wines_”, which are wines that would typically cost less than $100 per bottle.

74     For these 34 bottles of commercial wines, the Plaintiff submitted that I should use the prices listed on the Plaintiff’s Wholesale Price List for September 2012,[^31] while the Defendants submitted certain sums which the Defendants said were “_based on computation of average market price_”.[^32]

75     For the same reason why I could not accept the prices listed on the Grand Cru Price List as evidencing the market price of the 116 bottles of the high-end wines, I similarly could not accept that the Plaintiff’s Wholesale Price List as a useful or accurate indicator of the value of the wines, since there was no evidence that there were “_willing buyers_” for the wines at those prices. In fact, Mr. Clinton Ang’s evidence was that for commercial wines, supply generally outstrips demand and discounts are not infrequently given on such commercial wines.[^33] This reinforced my view that the Plaintiff’s Wholesale Price List could not be adopted without adjustment.

76     However, unlike high-end wines, there was no platform like Liv-ex used for the trading of commercial wines, and the Defendants’ submission of the prices “_based on computation of average market price_” was wholly unsatisfactory as no explanation of any sort was provided to explain how this “_average market price_” was gathered or computed, or its evidential basis. I therefore could not accept such bald submission.

77     Of the 34 bottles of commercial wines, 24 were bottles of “_Saint Clair Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2011_”. This type of wine was listed on the Plaintiff’s Wholesale Price List at $39 per bottle,[^34] whereas Luciana had sold 12 of these bottles to the Defendants at the price of $27.12 per bottle.[^35] A sales confirmation form dated 22 November 2011 indicated that the sale of “_Saint Clair Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2011_” to the Defendants was at a 35% discount before tax.[^36] The sales confirmation form was submitted to the Plaintiff’s finance department for approval and Mr. Clinton Ang’s evidence was that prices were actual retail prices, except that the name(s) of the customer was fabricated by Luciana on some of these sales confirmation forms.

78     In the circumstances and in the absence of better evidence, I adopted a 35% discount from the prices listed on the Plaintiff’s Wholesale Price List in assessing the value of the 34 bottles of commercial wines. The total assessed value of the commercial wines was therefore **$998.40** (\[65% x $39 x 24\] + \[65% x $60 x 10\]). To be clear, I did not add any component for Additional Costs to the value of the commercial wines. This was because this value, which was approximately 35% discount off the retail price, already represented the _landed price_ of the commercial wines. If the Plaintiff would sell the commercial wines at a 35% discount off the price listed on the Wholesale Price List, it must be assumed that any additional costs such as transport, storage and tax would have already been taken into account in that discounted selling price. Therefore, I did not consider it necessary or appropriate to add further Additional Costs to the sum of $998.40.

## The Mitigation Issue

79     The last issue standing between the Plaintiff and its damage was the Defendants’ submission that the damage ought to be reduced, because the Plaintiff had failed to mitigate its loss. The Defendants submitted that the “_Plaintiff was negligent in failing to verify that the orders placed by Luciana Lim and the invoices subsequently generated were accurate_”, and therefore “_assumed responsibility for its own mistake in allowing Luciana Lim to misappropriate the wines_”.[^37]

80     I found no merit in this submission.

81     The Defendants’ arguments bore striking similarity to those raised by the respondent in the Canadian case of _Vale v. Schwartz et al._ (2020) MBQB 127 (“**_Schwartz_**”). _Schwartz_ similarly involved a claim in conversion – this time of stolen nickel from the claimant’s mine. In _Schwartz_, the defendant similarly argued that the claimant had failed to mitigate its loss by failing to put in place systems and steps to prevent the detect the theft (and the consequential losses) earlier. The court rejected this argument and found that it was in essence an allegation of contributory negligence, which has no application to a claim in conversion. The conducts complained of were acts and omissions _prior to_ the conversion, and therefore has no relevance to the concept of mitigation (see _Schwartz_ at \[38\], \[40\] and \[48\]):

> \[38\]  I am satisfied, on a review of the case law provided, that **a plaintiff’s actions prior to the conversion** being committed **relate to apportionment of liability and constitute an allegation of contributory negligence**.  The concept of **mitigation of one’s losses relates to the issue of damages and the requirement of a plaintiff after a tort has been discovered to reduce their losses.**

> …

> \[40\]   **Mitigation could certainly be a live issue in a conversion case if, after learning of the conversion, the plaintiff took no, or inadequate, steps to reduce their loss**.

> …

> \[48\]  A review of the case law suggests that, while the point is not often stated in reasons, or perhaps even argued, the **application of the principles of contributory negligence and mitigation apply to actions taken by a party either before and contributing to the loss, or after and failing to reduce or cap the loss, respectively**.  Although not bound by the court in Abitibi-Price Inc. v. Voith Hydro Inc. et al., I agree with their statement of the law as follows, (at paras. 89 and 91):

>> Under legal theory, it is quite easy to distinguish between contributory negligence and mitigation.  In practice the line may not be so easily drawn.   Contributory negligence arises when a loss occurs because of two or more causes.  In this case the allegation is that one cause was an act or omission of the Plaintiff.  **In contributory negligence the actions giving rise to the loss occur prior to or at the time of the loss.**  The theory of contributory negligence is that those who are responsible for the loss bear their proportion of the liability.

>> ….

>> **The duty to mitigate arises after the breach or wrongful act and after the plaintiff becomes aware that the defendants wrongful acts have caused a loss**….. 

\[emphasis added in bold, citations omitted\]

82     In fact, there is no need to look that far. As the Plaintiff pointed out, the Court of Appeal had made it clear in _The “Asia Star”_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 1154</span> that the “_evaluation of the aggrieved party’s conduct in mitigation ought to start from the date of the defaulting party’s breach_” (at \[24\]). In other words, mitigation of damages involves an inquiry as to the reasonableness of the innocent party’s action or inaction _after_ the defendant’s breach, not _before_.

83     In this case, the issues of “_mitigation_” raised by the Defendants related to steps which the Plaintiff could have taken to _detect and prevent_ the fraudulent scheme perpetuated by Luciana– such as verifying and investigating the invoices generated and orders placed by Luciana, and putting in place an “_adequate audit system_” to guard against such fraud.[^38] All of these were steps which the Plaintiff could have taken _prior to_ the losses arising, and if so taken the losses would not, according to the Defendants, have arisen at all. In this regard, it was telling that the Defendants’ submission on this issue referred to the Plaintiff’s inaction “\[a\]_s at September 2012_”, which was prior to the conversion of the Misappropriated Bottles:

> “As at September 2012, the Plaintiff’s outstanding sum for wines purchased but unpaid was close to $3 million. Despite this, the Plaintiff did not take any steps to avoid loss to itself. As the sales with the largest outstanding amount belonged to Luciana Lim, it should have been obvious to the Plaintiff to look into her sales and investigate the reasons for the delayed payments. It chose not to do so.”

84     It was clear that the essence of the Defendants’ grievance was that if the Plaintiff had been more vigilant, then Luciana would likely have been stopped in her path, and the losses to the Plaintiff would have been averted. In my view, this was an argument of contributory negligence, and not mitigation. If the losses were averted, then there would be nothing to mitigate at all.

85     I therefore rejected the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff’s damages should be reduced because the Plaintiff had failed to mitigate its losses.

## Costs

86     My decision on the assessment of the Plaintiff’s damages was delivered orally on 31 May 2021. Parties then requested for time to tender written submissions on costs for both the liability trial (which was reserved to me) and these AD proceedings. Parties also agreed that costs may be decided by way of a “_document-only_” hearing. Submissions were duly filed by parties on 21 June 2021 I gave by decision on costs on 30 June 2021.

87     The main dispute between the parties on the issue of costs was whether and to what extent the cost order should reflect the fact that the Plaintiff did not succeed _wholly_ in its claim against the Defendants, particularly for the trial on liability. In this regard, the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants was for conversion of 280 bottles of wine and the Plaintiff eventually succeeded in respect of 150 bottles only.

88     The general rule is that costs ought to follow the event: see Order 59 Rule 3(2) of the ROC. In this case, I was of the view that the Plaintiff had succeeded in its claim in conversion against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, and should be entitled to the costs of the action – including the costs of the trial and the AD proceedings.

89     Further, the Defendants had initially mounted a counterclaim against the Plaintiff, which they withdrew at the commencement of the trial on liability.[^39] As such, the Plaintiff ought to be entitled to the costs of the counterclaim or its costs occasioned by the counterclaim being withdrawn pursuant to Order 59 Rule 3(7) of the ROC.

90     Having said that, I agreed with the Defendants that some deductions should be made in view of the fact that the Plaintiff did not succeed on all of its claims. The Plaintiff’s position on this was that because it had succeeded in proving the “_fundamental issue in the suit_”, it should be entitled to the full costs of the claim, even if there were aspects in which it did not succeed.[^40] In my view, this might be appropriate in some cases but in a situation such as the present where the Plaintiff only succeeded in establishing its claim for conversion for around half of the goods in issue, I would be wearing a blinker if I did not account for the substantial aspect of the Plaintiff’s claim in which it had not succeeded.

91     At the same time, however, I could not accept the Defendants’ submission that the matter was capable of such arithmetic precision and that the Plaintiff should only be entitled to “_44%_” of the costs of the trial on liability. Although the Plaintiff’s claim related to conversion of 280 bottles of wine (and it ultimately succeeded in respect of 150 bottles), the circumstances under which the claims arose were substantially similar for all 280 bottles, and, as a result, many of the factual and legal issues arising were overlapping. For example, the _modus operandi_ of the conversion for the 280 bottles was similar and the nature of the Defendants’ involvement was also similar. The nature of most of the defences and arguments mounted by the Defendants were also of general applicability to all of the Plaintiff’s claims, and not “_item-specific_”. In those circumstances, the parties would have needed to address those same issues in the successful prosecution of the Plaintiff’s claim for the 150 bottles of wine in any event, so to make a proportionate deduction to the Plaintiff’s cost entitlement as suggested by the Defendants would effectively be giving the Defendants a “_free-ride_” for those issues which it chose to dispute but failed in doing so. This was not a case where the facts and law were substantially different and had to be separately and distinctly addressed and considered for each and every item converted.

92     For these same reasons, I also could not accept the Defendants’ submission that the costs or complexity of these proceedings had been “_unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted_” by the Plaintiff within the meaning of Order 59 Rule 6A of the ROC, because of the additional claims raised by the Plaintiff (on which it did not succeed). The mere fact that the Plaintiff did not succeed on some of the issues or claims did not mean that the proceedings was “_unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted_”: see _Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrea G_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 2 SLR(R) 501</span> at \[23\] – \[24\].

93     In arriving at the appropriate quantum of costs with the appropriate deductions to be made, I took into account the following factors:

> (a)     The factual and legal issues involved in both the liability trial and the assessment of damages proceedings were not particularly difficult or complex. Insofar as the legal issues were concerned, they touched on settled areas of law which were not novel. Further, although the suit was bifurcated, no additional affidavit of evidence in chief was filed or new evidence adduced for the assessment of damages hearing.

> (b)     Damages was ultimately assessed at $93,263.45, and the costs to be awarded ought to be proportionate to the sum awarded.

> (c)     Both the Plaintiff and the Defendants had raised issues and arguments at the trial for liability and assessment of damages which were not successful. In the Plaintiff’s case, it did not succeed on its claim in conversion for 130 bottles of wine, on the admissibility of the expert’s evidence and on establishing the relevant “_market price_” at the assessment of damages hearing. As for the Defendants, their “_defence_” on mitigation failed entirely, and I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submissions that the Defendants had also failed on a number of the defences raised at the liability trial.[^41]

> (d)     As for the Defendants’ counterclaim which was abandoned, there were some overlaps between the factual background of the counterclaim and the Defence, and the quantum of the counterclaim was relatively low – in the region of less than $10,000. If the Defendants had filed the counterclaim as a separate suit in the Magistrate’s Court, the costs to be allowed where the claimant failed in such a claim would have been between $3,000 to $6,000: see Part IV to Appendix 2 of Order 59 of the ROC.

94     Considering all the circumstances, I ordered that costs of DC 2197/2018 (including DC/AD 192/2020) be paid by the 1st and 2nd Defendants jointly and severally to the Plaintiff, fixed at the sum of $28,000 (plus GST if applicable).

95     As for disbursements, I was of the view that the Plaintiff’s reasonable disbursements incurred in connection with DC 2197/2018 (including DC/AD 192/2020) ought to be paid by the 1st and 2nd Defendants jointly and severally. However, as no submissions were made by the Defendants on the quantum of disbursements (save to say that the Plaintiff should only be entitled to “_44% of the disbursements_”), I ordered that the Plaintiff’s reasonable disbursements be taxed (on standard basis) if not agreed.

## Conclusion

96     To summarise, I assessed the Plaintiff losses from the conversion of the Misappropriated Bottles at $93,263.45, with interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of the judgment. Costs of the proceedings were to be paid by the 1st and 2nd Defendants to the Plaintiff, fixed at $28,000 (plus GST if applicable). The Plaintiff’s reasonable disbursements were to be paid by the Defendants as well, with the quantum to be taxed if the parties were unable to agree.

97     Lastly, I would like to record my appreciation to counsel for both the Plaintiff and the Defendants for their efficient conduct of the AD proceedings and their detailed and helpful written submissions.
