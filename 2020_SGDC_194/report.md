CRIMINAL LAW – Offences – Property – Cheating

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9766/2020/01.\]

20 August 2020

### District Judge Samuel Hwa Kuan Chua:

## Background

1       The Accused is Subashini d/o Thanakodi, a 38-year-old female Singapore citizen. She claimed trial to four charges, namely, two charges under section 420 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and two charges under section 420 r/w section 511 Penal Code. Over the first two days of trial, the Prosecution called five witnesses and tendered 11 case exhibits. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Accused was called upon to enter her defence. She elected to give evidence. During her examination-in-chief on 6 August 2020 (i.e. 3rd day of trial), the Accused decided to plead guilty. Time was given for parties to take the necessary instructions and to prepare the relevant documents for the plead guilty hearing.

2       On 7 August 2020 (i.e. 4th day of trial), the Accused pleaded guilty to three charges, namely, two charges under section 417 Penal Code and one charge under section 417 r/w section 511 Penal Code. She admitted to one additional charge under section 417 r/w section 511 Penal Code and consented for it to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Charges

3       The charges were as follows:

## Criminal Antecedents

7       The Accused was not traced with any criminal antecedents.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted for the Accused to be sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment comprising:

> DAC-935696-2018 ($1,615.95, paid out) – 8 weeks’ imprisonment (consecutive)

> DAC-935697-2018 ($955.80, paid out) – 6 weeks’ imprisonment (concurrent)

> DAC-935699-2018 ($1,171.92, not paid out) – 4 weeks’ imprisonment (consecutive)

9       In support of their submission, the Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors in the present case:

> (a)     SCDF was a public institution and the monies cheated were public funds.

> (b)     The Accused abused her position and authority as Mess Treasurer in her Division and perpetrated the fraud as an insider within SCDF.

> (c)     The commission of the offences was premeditated as the Accused had hatched an elaborate plan of recruiting two other persons as proxies to file the fraudulent claims in their names, in order to circumvent SCDF’s policy which forbade Mess Treasurers from making reimbursement claims due to a conflict of interest.

> (d)     In relation to the two charges involving Doris, the Accused amended the AORs after they had been approved by Major Keith.

10     In support of its submission on sentence, the Prosecution highlighted the following cases involving first-time offenders who pleaded guilty to section 417 Penal Code charges and made full restitution:

> (a)      **_Idya Nurhazlyn binte Ahmad Khir v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“**_Idya Nurhazlyn_**”);

> (b)      **_PP v Jonathan Lai Hanyao_** (SC-901830-2018) (“**_Jonathan Lai Hanyao_**”);

> (c)      **_PP v Neo Sea King_** (SC-901454-2017) (“**_Neo Sea King_**”); and

> (d)      **_PP v Ng Ta Wee_** (“**_Ng Ta Wee_**”) (SC-901359-2015).

## Mitigation Plea

11     In mitigation, Defence Counsel Mr K. Jayakumar Naidu submitted for the Accused to be sentenced to a fine on the following grounds:

> (a)     There was no elaborate planning in committing the offences.

> (b)     The quantum involved in the four charges was relatively low.

> (c)     The Accused did not have any criminal antecedents.

> (d)     The Accused made full restitution almost immediately after the matter came to light.

> (e)     The Accused fully cooperated with the Police throughout investigations.

> (f)     The Accused was deeply remorseful for her actions.

> (g)     The Accused pleaded guilty, albeit during her examination-in-chief after being called to enter her defence.

> (h)     The Accused lost her job with the SCDF as a result of the offences.

> (i)     The Accused suffered from various medical ailments including Vitamin B12 deficiency and depression.

12     Mr Naidu referred to the following section 417 Penal Code-related cases in his mitigation plea:

> (a)      **_Wuu David v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 83</span> (“**_Wuu David_**”); and

> (b)      **_PP v Toh Beng Hua_** <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 506</span> (“**_Toh Beng Hua_**”).

13     When the Court asked Mr Naidu for case authorities and sentencing precedents to substantiate his submission for the Court to impose a fine on the Accused, he was unable to produce any relevant case authority or sentencing precedent apart from the abovementioned two cases. In oral submissions, he urged the Court to sentence the Accused to one month’s imprisonment for DAC-935696-2018 ($1,615.95, paid out), in line with the sentence that was imposed in **_Idya Nurhazlyn_** for a section 417 Penal Code charge involving $1,800. Mr Naidu was, however, unable to explain why a one month’s imprisonment term was appropriate for DAC-935696-2018, given that the present case was more aggravated than **_Idya Nurhazlyn_** in that it involved cheating a public institution of public funds, and the Accused recruited a third party to facilitate the cheating offence. Mr Naidu was subsequently content to leave sentencing to the Court’s discretion.

## Analysis and Decision on Sentence

14     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 417 Penal Code is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or fine or both. For an offence under section 417 r/w section 511 Penal Code, the prescribed punishment is imprisonment for a term which may extend to one and a half years or fine or both.

15     I agreed with the Prosecution that there were the following offence-specific aggravating factors in the present case:

> (a)     The Accused, a public servant, had cheated SCDF, a public institution, of public funds. The total sum claimed by the Accused in respect of the four charges (including the charge that was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing) was $4,809.01. The amount that she had successfully cheated SCDF of was $2,571.75.

> (b)     The Accused had abused her position and authority as Mess Treasurer in her Division, and the trust that her superiors had reposed in her as signatory for Payment Vouchers and co-signatory for Cheques, to commit the offences.

> (c)     The commission of the offences was premeditated as the Accused had devised an elaborate plan to recruit two other persons, namely, Tan Kevin and Doris Lim Swee Noi, to file the fraudulent reimbursement claims in their names, in order for the cheques to be paid out in their names, for them to deposit the cheques into their personal bank accounts, and for them to thereafter transfer the full sums to her bank account. As Mess Treasurer, the Accused was co-signatory for cheques that were issued. It was evident that the Accused had recruited Tan Kevin and Doris Lim in order to circumvent SCDF’s policy forbidding Mess Treasurers from making reimbursement claims due to a conflict of interest since they were co-signatories for the cheques that were issued. In this regard, I did not accept Mr Naidu’s submission that there had been no elaborate planning in the commission of the offences.

> (d)     In relation to DAC-935699-2018 involving the fictitious claim allegedly made by Doris Lim, the Accused committed forgery to facilitate the cheating offence, by amending the AOR to increase the total approved amount from “$100” to “$1,000”, after the AOR had been approved by Major Keith.

16     I noted the following offender-specific aggravating factor and mitigating factors:

> Aggravating factor

> (a)     The Accused faced one additional section 417 r/w section 511 Penal Code charge that had to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

> Mitigating factors

> (b)     The Accused was not traced with criminal antecedents when she committed the offences in October 2017.

> (c)     The Accused made full restitution, albeit only after her superiors discovered the offences. As a result of the restitution, the financial loss to SCDF had been made right.

> (d)     The Accused did not plead guilty at the earliest possible opportunity but claimed trial to the offences. She pleaded guilty only on the 4th day of trial, after the Prosecution had called five witnesses and tendered 11 case exhibits, and closed its case. Very little mitigating weight (if any) ought to be given to her belated decision to plead guilty to the Prosecution’s offer to proceed against her on the reduced charges.

> (e)     There was nothing to suggest that the Accused’s medical ailments had a direct causal link to the commission of the offences.

17     With the offence-specific and offender-specific factors in mind, I considered the sentencing precedents that the Prosecution and the Defence had highlighted to assist the Court.

18     In **_Idya Nurhazlyn_**, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges under the Passports Act and two charges under section 417 Penal Code in respect of $1,800 and $10,509. The High Court reduced the accused’s sentence for the section 417 Penal Code charge involving $1,800 from two months’ imprisonment to one month’s imprisonment. The accused had told her relatives that she was able to purchase electronic items from a supplier and offered to place orders for them. An aunt duly placed an order and transferred $1,800 to the accused’s bank account according to her instructions. The accused never delivered the items.

19     At paragraph 47 of the grounds of decision, the High Court held that “a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value”. In the same paragraph, the High Court also noted that “custodial terms of between four and eight months’ imprisonment have been imposed for cheating offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000”. At paragraph 48, the High Court held that while “the primary yardstick will often be the value of the property involved”, “where the offence entails the misuse of a financial instrument or facility which threatens the conduct of legitimate commerce, the need for general deterrence is likely to take centrestage”, referencing **_PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span>.

20     In reducing the accused’s sentence from two months’ imprisonment to one month’s imprisonment, the High Court especially noted at paragraph 52 that “the offence did not involve the use of cheques or financial instruments”, “it was Idya’s first offence” and “there was full restitution”.

21     While the present Accused was not traced with any criminal antecedents when she committed the offences in October 2017 and while the Accused made full restitution upon the discovery of the offences by her superiors in SCDF, the Accused’s culpability in the present case remained significantly higher than the culpability of the accused in **_Idya Nurhazlyn_**.

22     While the accused in **_Idya Nurhazlyn_** had committed the Cheating offence in her personal capacity, the Accused in the present case had committed the offence in her official capacity as a public servant, Mess Treasurer and co-signatory of the cheques that were issued.

23     While the victim in **_Idya Nurhazlyn_** was the accused’s aunt and involved the aunt’s personal funds, the victim in the present case was SCDF, a public institution, and involved public funds. In **_PP v Koh Seah Wee_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 292</span>, the High Court held at paragraph 57 that:

> “Offences involving public funds committed against public institutions have to be dealt with sternly as they amount to an assault on the common weal and undermine good administration. It is worse when such assaults come from within the organisation and are initiated by people trusted to handle public funds and to ensure fair play in commercial dealings with the organisation. Fraud which is carefully planned and coolly played out is often more difficult to uncover even with good checks and balances. It becomes even more elusive when there is collaboration and collusion from within the organisation defrauded.”

24     While the modus operandi in **_Idya Nurhazlyn_** did not involve the use of financial instruments such as cheques, the modus operandi in the present case fundamentally involved the use of cheques that the Accused herself had prepared and co-signed, as a vehicle for reimbursing the fictitious claims.

25     While the accused in **_Idya Nurhazlyn_** had operationalised the cheating offence herself, the Accused in the present case had recruited two other persons to facilitate her cheating offences.

26     In **_Jonathan Lai Hanyao_**, the accused faced 18 charges under section 417 Penal Code. He pleaded guilty to six proceeded charges, with twelve charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused, who was untraced with criminal antecedents, created a WeChat account with the gender of the profile set as “female” and used a photograph of a female with a bird tattoo on her back as his profile picture. He met the victim through WeChat and introduced himself as a 23-year-old female known as “Jesslee”. He then deceived the victim that he needed money for various reasons. He told the victim to transfer money to him as a gesture to show his sincerity so that he could get a date with “Jesslee”. He then deceived the victim that “Jesslee” owed unlicensed moneylenders money and had been kidnapped, and that “Jesslee” had been forced into prostitution and needed money for her abortions. On 18 occasions over ten months, the victim transferred a total of $7,185 to the accused’s bank account. The accused made full restitution to the victim. For charges involving $450 to $550, the accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment per charge. For the charge involving $1,000, the accused was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment. For the charge involving $1,500, the accused was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. The total sentence was seven weeks’ imprisonment.

27     For the same reasons that I had highlighted in distinguishing the present case from **_Idya Nurhazlyn_**, the present case was more aggravated than **_Jonathan Lai Hanyao_** and attracted a sentence that was higher than four weeks’ imprisonment for each section 417 Penal Code charge.

28     In **_PP v Neo Sea King_**, the accused pleaded guilty to 15 charges under section 417 Penal Code, with 53 similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was employed as an Operations Executive by the victim company, which was in the business of supplying cleaners. The accused’s responsibilities included employing and overseeing cleaners and their attendance. He conceived a scheme to cheat his company by submitting salary claims for phantom employees. From April 2012 to December 2013, the accused obtained a total of $74,640.02 in fictitious salary claims. The accused, who had property-related criminal antecedents (namely, Extortion, Robbery and Robbery with Hurt in 1989, and Robbery with Hurt in 2000), made full restitution to his company. He was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment on each charge for sums ranging from $1,299.65 to S1,791.74. His total sentence was 40 weeks’ imprisonment.

29     While the accused in **_Neo Sea King_** had similarly committed the offences in the course of his employment, abused the trust that his company had reposed in him and made full restitution, **_Neo Sea King_** did not involve the cheating of a public institution of public funds, the use of financial instruments such as cheques, or the recruitment of third parties to carry out the cheating offences. On the other hand, while **_Neo Sea King_** involved 68 charges and the accused was traced with property-related criminal antecedents, the present case involved four charges and the Accused was untraced. With the abovementioned factors in mind, I placed the present Accused’s culpability relatively lower than the culpability of the accused in **_Neo Sea King_**.

30     In **_Ng Ta Wee_**, the accused pleaded guilty to six charges under section 417 Penal Code, with 11 similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused was employed as a technician in a company where his job included procuring CCTV parts and products for the company, looking into the sale and installation of CCTVs and maintaining the inventory. He deceived the victim (i.e. his boss) by quoting higher prices for the CCTV parts and products procured and pocketing the difference after paying off the supplier the actual price. The total amount involved was $5,974.52. The accused, who was untraced with criminal antecedents, made full restitution to his company. He was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment on each charge for sums ranging from $269.52 to $1,377.34. His total sentence was three months’ imprisonment.

31     The culpability of the Accused in the present case was higher than the culpability of the accused in **_Ng Ta Wee_**. While the accused in **_Ng Ta Wee_** had similarly committed the offences in the course of his employment, abused the trust that his company had reposed in him and made full restitution, **_Ng Ta Wee_** did not involve the cheating of a public institution of public funds, the use of financial instruments such as cheques, or the recruitment of third parties to carry out the cheating offences.

32     In **_Wuu David_**, the accused stole the victim’s handbag in a bar, removed two credit cards from the handbag, threw away the handbag and its other contents, used one of the credit cards to purchase a bottle of liquor and threw away the credit card. He did not leave the bar with the bottle of liquor but stayed at the bar for almost two and a half hours, sharing the bottle with his friends, until he was arrested. On being arrested, the accused admitted to the offences immediately. The victim’s handbag and all its contents (without the credit cards) were recovered and full restitution of the cost of the bottle of liquor was made. The accused pleaded guilty to a section 417 Penal Code charge, with a theft charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. On appeal, the High Court reduced his sentence from nine weeks’ imprisonment to a $3,000 fine. Noting the manner in, and the intent with, which the offences were committed, the High Court characterised the accused as a “one-off” offender, who had intended to use the stolen credit card to make only one purchase and no more, and distinguished the accused’s case from the typical type of credit card abuse cases described in **_Fernando Payagala_**, which warranted a custodial sentence.

33     In the present case, the Accused committed four distinct offences, involving four sets of fictitious transactions, payment vouchers and cheques. She also recruited the assistance of two persons, namely, Tan Kevin and Doris Lim Swee Noi, to operationalise her cheating offences. She could not be considered a “one-off” offender. Her offending was also not on the spur of the moment and opportunistic as in **_Wuu David_**, but involved a series of premeditated acts including (a) choosing an appropriate event or reason to form the basis of the fictitious transactions; (b) recruiting and enlisting the assistance of the two persons as proxies for the transactions; (c) preparing the AORs, payment vouchers and cheques, (d) signing on the payment vouchers; (e) signing on the cheques as co-signatory; (f) submitting the AORs, payment vouchers and cheques to LTC Betty for her signature; and (g) instructing Tan Kevin to transfer the reimbursed sums to her bank account. The Accused’s culpability was significantly higher than the culpability of the accused in **_Wuu David_**, and warranted a custodial sentence to be imposed on her, as Mr Naidu subsequently conceded when he urged the Court to sentence the Accused one month’s imprisonment for DAC-935696-2018.

34     In **_Toh Beng Hua_**, the accused, a property agent representing the sellers of a flat, pleaded guilty to one charge of engaging in a conspiracy with some others to cheat United Overseas Bank Limited to approve and deliver $316,000 as a mortgage loan to the buyer of a flat, under section 417 r/w section 109 Penal Code. The accused and his co-conspirators agreed to deceive the bank into believing that the intended purchase price of the flat was $340,000 when they knew that the purchase price was in fact $275,000. In consequence of the conspiracy, the buyer of the flat submitted the Option to Purchase to the bank, falsely declaring the purchase price to be $340,000 in her application to the bank for the mortgage loan of $316,000. The bank approved the loan application and delivered $316,000 as mortgage loan to the buyer. In sentencing the accused to the maximum fine of $10,000 instead of a custodial term, the District Judge noted the following “significant mitigating factors”:

> (a)     The accused was a “one-off” offender.

> (b)     In the whole “chain of conspiracy”, the accused was the lowest in culpability in that he had played a minor role, had not facilitated, instigated or aided in the commission of the offence, and his involvement was in continuing to act as the sellers’ agent despite knowing that the selling price had been inflated by them.

> (c)     The accused did not gain financially from the offence and did not receive any share of the loan of $316,000 from the bank. He received only his usual agency commission as the sellers’ agent.

> (d)     The accused did not have any criminal record.

> (e)     The accused pleaded guilty and indicated his intention to do so at the first pre-trial conference.

35     Evidently, the culpability of the present Accused was higher than the culpability of the accused in **_Toh Beng Hua_**. The Accused faced not one but four charges in respect of four distinct offences, and was therefore not a “one-off” offender. The Accused received the financial proceeds of her offending behaviour. The Accused recruited the assistance of two persons to operationalise the offences. The Accused played the primary and the most active role in the commission of the offences as described above. Rather than plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, the Accused claimed trial and pleaded guilty only after the close of the Prosecution’s case.

36     Having considered the offence-specific and offender-specific factors, and having surveyed the relevant sentencing precedents, I determined that the primary sentencing consideration in the present case was specific and general deterrence, and that the custodial threshold was clearly crossed.

37     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s culpability was higher than the culpability of the accused persons in the sentencing precedents who were sentenced to about one month’s imprisonment for section 417 Penal Code offences involving about SGD 1,000 to SGD 1,800, and that an imprisonment term that was significantly higher than one month’s imprisonment was warranted for both section 417 Penal Code charges, namely, DAC-935696-2018 in respect of SGD 1,615.95 and DAC-935697-2018 in respect of SGD 955.80.

38     Since the maximum term of imprisonment for a section 417 r/w section 511 Penal Code offence is one-half of the prescribed term of three years’ imprisonment for a section 417 Penal Code offence, I calibrated the sentence for the proceeded section 417 r/w section 511 Penal Code charge, namely, DAC-935699-2018 in respect of SGD 1,171.92, to about half the sentence imposed for DAC-935696-2018.

39     I was required under section 307(1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2010 Rev Ed) to order two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively. In determining which of the three sentences to run consecutively, I was guided by the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences in **_PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>. In this regard, I noted that all three proceeded charges were similar in nature and involved the same modus operandi and the same victim, namely, SCDF. Be that as it may, I noted that while DAC-935696-2018 and DAC 935697-2018 concerned completed Cheating offences involving fictitious reimbursement claims purportedly made by Tan Kevin, DAC-935699-2018 concerned an inchoate Cheating offence involving a fictitious reimbursement claim purportedly made by Doris Lim Swee Noi. In addition, DAC-935699-2018 involved the amendment of the approved sum in the AOR from “$100” to “$1000”, after it had been signed by Major Keith. In my judgment, I found it appropriate to order the imprisonment terms for DAC-935696-2018 and DAC-935699-2018 to run consecutively.

## Conclusion

40     I therefore sentenced the Accused to a total of 10 weeks’ imprisonment as shown in the table below, which aggregate sentence was in my judgment proportionate to her overall criminality and was not excessive. The Accused was nevertheless dissatisfied with my decision and appealed against her sentence. She is currently on bail pending appeal.
