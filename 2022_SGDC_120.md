### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

## Introduction

1       Parties to time-sensitive commercial transactions often agree to certain key terms within their immediate contemplation and leave the remaining terms to be negotiated. The failure to come to a clear agreement on such remaining terms may, as the parties in the present suit have come to realise, lead to a time-intensive dispute without an easy solution.

## Facts

2       Kings Global Services Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”) is a freight forwarder, while SNK Marine Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”) is a non-vessel operating container carrier providing ship broking services.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) In June 2021, the Defendant contacted the Plaintiff to seek a quotation for the transloading of cigarettes from Singapore. The Plaintiff promptly responded with quotations for “container clearance” and “transloading charges”, along with a caution that storage for the cargo was not recommended given the “extremely high” storage charges.[^2]

3       However, the intended shipment was delayed until early July 2021, when the Defendant sent the Plaintiff another request for the transloading of 1,150 cartons of cigarettes. A quotation was then provided by the Plaintiff, with such a quotation once again excluding, amongst others, storage charges for the cigarettes.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Following this, the 1,150 cartons of cigarettes were released to the Plaintiff in Singapore. Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant of the storage charges, which was in excess of $1,000 per day.

4       As the Defendant’s intention was for the cigarettes to be shipped out of Singapore promptly, the Defendant did not appear fazed by the storage charges. However, the issue of the storage charges began to surface when the carrier cancelled the Defendant’s export booking for 1,000 cartons of cigarettes.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) As the bulk of the cigarettes remained in the Plaintiff’s possession, the Plaintiff started reminding the Defendant of the storage charges that continued to accrue. On 30 July 2021, the Plaintiff issued an invoice seeking payment of $24,705 for about 15 days of storage.[^5]

5       The Defendant contested such charges as exorbitant and being outside the parties’ agreement, but the Plaintiff refused to release the cartons of cigarettes until the charges, which continued to increase by the day, were paid by the Defendant. After about two months of back-and-forth between the parties’ representatives, the charges had risen to about $63,000, and the Defendant therefore instructed the Plaintiff to dispose of the cigarettes. However, the Plaintiff continued to claim for the unpaid charges, while the Defendant issued an invoice to the Plaintiff for $51,000 as “detention and demurrage” charges for withholding its cigarettes.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

## Procedural history

6       In November 2021, the Plaintiff commenced the present suit, claiming the sum of $84,279.57. Much of this sum was allegedly incurred for storage charges from the time the cigarettes were in the Plaintiff’s possession until they were disposed of on 14 September 2021.

7       The Defendant admitted that the parties had agreed for the Plaintiff to carry out stuffing and unstuffing for the containers shipped to the Plaintiff.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) While the Defendant had agreed for the Plaintiff to carry out transloading of its cigarettes, it did not agree to any storage charges for the cigarettes.[^8] Hence, the Plaintiff’s refusal to release the cigarettes until payment for storage was made amounted to a breach of contract between the parties, and caused the Defendant to incur “detention and demurrage” charges[^9] in the sum of $51,100.[^10]

8       Being of the view that the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim (“DCC”) was a concocted attempt to delay payment, and further that the counterclaim was unsustainable as the Defendant had not suffered any loss for demurrage or detention,[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) the Plaintiff took out the present summons, seeking:

> (a)     a striking out of the DCC for being scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, for tending to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action, or for being an abuse of the process of the Court; and

> (b)     final judgment against the Defendant for the sum of $84,279.57 or part thereof, along with interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of commencement of the action to the date of payment.

## The summary judgment application

9       I begin my assessment by considering the merits of the Plaintiff’s application for a summary judgment in respect of its claim for $84,279.57.

### Applicable principles

10     For summary judgment to be entered in a plaintiff’s favour without trial, a plaintiff has to first show that he has a _prima facie_ case for judgment. Once that is done, the burden shifts to the defendant who, in order to obtain leave to defend, must raise an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried, or show that there ought for some other reason to be a trial. A bare assertion does not raise a triable issue, and there must be some cogent evidence supporting the defendant’s assertions: _DBS Bank Ltd v Lam Yee Shen and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 1202</span> at \[13(_b_)\], citing _Calvin Klein, Inc and another v HC International Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 1183</span> at \[45\].

11     Here, the Plaintiff has established a _prima facie_ case for judgment as its claim is based on the cigarettes which were indubitably in its possession from July to September 2021. For these charges, the Plaintiff repeatedly sent invoices to the Defendant, and these invoices now provide some support for its claim.

12     The Defendant does not appear to directly contest the presence of such invoices. Rather, much of the Defendant’s contention boils down to the storage and removal fees, as well as the parking and chassis charges (collectively, the “Additional Charges”), which were quoted by the Plaintiff _after_ the cigarettes were released to the Plaintiff. These charges, the Defendant maintains, are not part of the agreement between the parties as the Defendant had only agreed to the Plaintiff’s quotes for stuffing and unstuffing of the containers containing the cigarettes.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

13     To this, the Plaintiff contends that the parties came to an agreement for the Additional Charges by way of email correspondence. In this regard, reference is made to s 11(1) of the Electronic Transactions Act 2010, which provides that “an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of electronic communications”. Furthermore, the Defendant’s representative repeatedly “noted” the Plaintiff’s quotations, including the quotations for the Additional Charges. Given the lack of objection to these Additional Charges, any alleged dispute on these rates and the alleged lack of contract _vis-à-vis_ these charges are “but an afterthought”, raised as a means to evade liability.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

### The Initial Charges

14     The questions of whether the parties entered into an agreement and the terms that were incorporated to such an agreement “turn\[s\] on ascertaining the parties’ objective intentions”. This is to be “gleaned from their correspondence and conduct in light of the relevant background as disclosed by the evidence”: _R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 521</span> (“_R1 International_”) at \[51\].

15     On the facts before me, it appears that the parties came to an agreement for the Plaintiff to provide transloading services for the Defendant’s cigarettes. This can be discerned from the parties’ correspondence in June 2021, when the Plaintiff provided quotations for the unstuffing, stuffing, permit, handling, and labour charges (collectively, “the Initial Charges”) for the transloading of the Defendant’s cargo.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) The Defendant did not dispute these quotations, but the intended June shipment was cancelled as Mr Upul of the Defendant informed the Plaintiff that the shipper had not confirmed the rates, and so the Plaintiff should “kindly ignore the job”.[^15]

16     However, this did not spell the end of the parties’ relationship as on 7 July 2021, Mr Upul sought another quotation from Mr Kingsley Lam (“Mr Kingsley”), the Director of the Plaintiff. In response, Mr Kingsley again provided quotations for the Initial Charges. As per the June quotation, however, Mr Kingsley stressed that his quotation excluded, amongst others, “detention, demurrage, PSA storage, parking fees if incurred”.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) On 8 July 2021, Mr Upul replied that the Defendant’s intention was to transload two sets of cigarettes, with the first set consisting of 1,000 cartons of cigarettes to be sent to Jebel Ali, Dubai by a Full Container Load (“the FCL cargo”) and the second set consisting of 150 cartons of cigarettes to be re-exported by Loose Cargo Load (“the LCL cargo”).[^17] In shipping terms, FCL refers to the buying and selling of full container spaces (_ie_, the entire container), while LCL refers to the buying and selling of loose container spaces (_ie_, part of the container).

17     Mr Kingsley then provided the LCL rates, which included ocean freight, export permit and labour charges and stated that “Bonded Storage charges will be included if incur\[red\]”. He requested for Mr Upul to confirm such rates before proceeding. To this, Mr Upul replied “Noted”,[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) and the Defendant released the 1,150 cartons of cigarettes to the Plaintiff on around 12 July 2021.[^19]

18     On the evening of 12 July 2021, the Plaintiff then informed the Defendant of that its storage charges were $45 per cubic meter (“CBM”) per day for storage, and $45 per CBM per week for removal.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) However, storage charges did not appear to be a significant issue at that point, and on 13 and 14 July 2021, the Defendant provided the Plaintiff with the export bookings for the 1,000 and 150 cartons of cigarettes respectively.[^21]

19     I pause at this juncture to note that by this point, the Defendant appeared to have accepted the Plaintiff’s quotations for the Initial Charges as no objections were raised to such quotations before the Defendant released its cargo to the Plaintiff for transloading. As the Court of Appeal summarised at \[53\]–\[54\] of _R1 International_:

> 53    … \[A\]lthough silence by one party may not by itself constitute acceptance of the terms sent by the other party, it does not follow from this that silence is fatal to a finding that the terms sent have been accepted. The effect of silence is context-dependent. In many cases, while there may not be actual communication of acceptance, the parties’ positive, negative or even neutral conduct can still evince acceptance: _Midlink Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 258</span> at \[50\] and \[52\].

> 54    Thus, a failure to object might in the circumstances be found to constitute assent to the incorporation of the other party’s terms. …

20     Here, the Defendant does not strenuously dispute the Plaintiff’s claim for the Initial Charges. In fact, the Managing Director of the Defendant, Ms Janapria Satgunam (“Ms Priya”), has given evidence that the Defendant “does not dispute” a tax invoice dated 22 July 2021 with respect to certain items, such as container stuffing, banker’s guarantee, and permit fee, amounting to $4,200.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

### The Additional Charges

21     However, even if the parties had agreed on the Initial Charges, such agreement does not necessitate that the Defendant thereby agreed to any subsequent fee quotations provided by the Plaintiff. Per _R1 International_ at \[52\]:

> \[I\]t is not uncommon for parties to first agree on a set of essential terms which the parties may be bound by as a matter of law and on the basis of which they may act, even while there may be ongoing discussions on the incorporation of other usually detailed terms. The fact that the latter issue has yet to be resolved does not prevent the contract based on the essential core terms from coming into existence. …

22     As stated at \[18\] above, the issue of storage charges did not appear to be operating heavily on the minds of either party when the cigarettes were delivered to the Plaintiff. This could have been because the Defendant’s intention was to ship the cigarettes out of Singapore promptly. Per Mr Upul’s email to the Plaintiff on 8 July 2021, the Defendant would “\[a\]rrange to re-export \[the\] 1000 cartons to Jebel Ali, Dubai”, and the “\[r\]emaining 150 \[cartons\] we will advice with in (_sic_) a week to export by LCL”.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) Consistent with this, the Defendant provided the export bookings for both the FCL and LCL cargos by 14 July 2021, about two days after the cigarettes came into the Plaintiff’s possession.[^24]

23     The issue of the storage charges, which formed a significant portion of the Additional Charges, only began to come to the fore when the export booking for the 1,000 cartons of cigarettes (_ie_, the FCL cargo) due for Jebel Ali was cancelled by the carrier. One day after the export booking was cancelled, on 15 July 2021, Mr Kingsley updated the Defendant that “there will be parking & chassis charges incur\[red\] until export booking is obtain\[ed\]”. The storage charges for the Defendant’s cargo were again quoted at $45 per CBM per day. This time, quotations were also provided for parking and chassis charges for the FCL cargo.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

24     On 16 July 2021, the Plaintiff sent the Defendant the delivery order for 150 of the 1,150 cartons of cigarettes (_ie_, the LCL cargo).[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) Chasers were then sent by the Plaintiff for the remaining 1,000 cartons, which were to be shipped to Jebel Ali by FCL.[^27]

25     However, about one week later, on 22 July 2021, the cartons remained in storage, and Mr Kingsley updated Mr Upul that “\[a\]s the storage will accumulate to a huge sum, warehouse is requesting payment in advance on a weekly basis”.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) Mr Upul replied on the same day: “Noted, will check with Export team.”[^29] Later that same day, one Candy from the Plaintiff sent an email to Mr Upul, seeking payment of $15,928.66 as charges for “transloading for import invoice, LCL clearance invoice, Storage invoice, container parking and chassis invoice”.[^30] Again, Mr Upul replied “Noted” to this email.[^31]

26     Further reminders were sent for the export booking of the FCL cargo, and on 23 July 2021, Mr Kingsley informed Mr Upul that charges had risen to about $18,625, and that “the warehouse will not release the cargo if we do not arrange the storage, parking & chassis charges”.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) On 26 July 2021, Mr Upul sent an attachment of another warehouse which quoted storage fees of $0.30 per carton of cigarette per week (_ie_, $300 for 1,000 cartons of cigarettes per week). Relying on this, Mr Upul questioned why the Plaintiff’s storage charges were “so high”.[^33] In response, Mr Kingsley informed him that the “\[h\]igh storage charges is because of massive movement of unstuffing & stuffing of container and warehouse required the space to maximise the movement and to avoid any restriction during the operation”.[^34]

27     As storage charges continued to increase, the Plaintiff sought payment of $24,705 for charges incurred up to 31 July 2021.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) The Defendant refused to make such payment, arguing that the storage charges amounted to “day light robbery”,[^36] and was an “injustice” that went against the standard practice in Singapore.[^37] Mr Kingsley attempted to appease the Defendant by once again explaining why the high storage charges had to be incurred, [^38] and by revising the outstanding sum payable as of 31 July 2021 to $22,904.[^39] Such efforts were to no avail, as the Defendant informed the Plaintiff that it would be initiating legal action against the Plaintiff for overcharging.[^40]

28     On 4 August 2021, the Plaintiff’s then-solicitors issued a letter of demand, demanding that the Defendant pay the storage charges in the sum of $22,904 within seven days.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) The Defendant strenuously refused, and repeated the contention that the storage charges did not form part of the contract between the parties, and also amounted to “day light robbery”. The Defendant also pointed out that no actual receipt for the storage costs had been provided by the Plaintiff.[^42] Later, on 20 August 2021, the Plaintiff offered to settle the dispute between parties if the Defendant paid $35,000 by 29 August 2021.[^43]

29     The offer was not accepted, and parties remained in dispute. By 7 September 2021, Mr Kingsley claimed that the total sum due from the Defendant had risen to $56,104.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) Again, the Defendant did not relent, and on 10 September 2021, the Defendant requested for the Plaintiff to export the cigarettes held in storage. However, the Plaintiff insisted that $30,000 had to be deposited into their bank accounts in order to release the goods as the “warehouse \[would\] not release the goods without full payment and \[the Plaintiff\] \[was\] unable to pay on behalf \[of the Defendant\] with such a huge amount incurred.”[^45]

30     Parties could not come to an agreement on the charges, which had allegedly risen to $62,744 by 13 September 2021.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) As a result, on 14 September 2021, an agreement was reached for the Plaintiff to dispose of the goods.[^47] Later, the Defendant raised an invoice for $51,000, being the alleged costs of “detention and demurrage” due from the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a result of the Plaintiff’s deliberate refusal to release the Defendant’s cargo even though parties had “no agreement” for the storage charges.[^48]

31     Based on the above, it appears that the issue of the Additional Charges did not operate heavily, if at all, on the parties’ minds _before_ the 1,150 cartons of cigarettes were delivered to the Plaintiff for transloading. Despite this, the Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Sim Jin Simm Alina, submitted that the Defendant’s repeated use of the word “noted” in response to quotations rendered by the Plaintiff signifies a clear intention to assent to such quotations, including the Additional Charges. If the Defendant did not agree to such charges, it ought to have expressed its disagreement outright.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

32     However, it bears reiteration that until 14 July 2021, when the Defendant’s export booking for the FCL cargo was cancelled, the Defendant did not have any intention to store its cigarettes with the Plaintiff for a prolonged period (see \[22\] above). While the Plaintiff issued quotations thereafter for the Additional Charges, and although Mr Upul replied “Noted” to several of these quotations, he did not unequivocally agree to the Additional Charges, nor is it clear that he had explicitly noted the Additional Charges raised in the quotations, which also covered other charges (see \[25\] above).

33     Indeed, after Mr Upul allegedly “noted” the Plaintiff’s quotations for storage fees, Ms Priya then took over the correspondence with Mr Kingsley. In her correspondence, Ms Priya repeatedly rejected the storage charges as being exorbitant and asked the Plaintiff to provide further justification for the charges.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) To this, Mr Kingsley reiterated that Mr Upul had _acknowledged_ his quotations.[^51] However, mere acknowledgment may not amount to consent, especially since it is unclear what Mr Upul had acknowledged. Furthermore, the Defendant did not, by conduct or in words, appear to agree to the Plaintiff’s demand for the repayment of the Additional Charges as a condition for the release of its cargo. Consequently, none of the Additional Charges invoiced were ever paid for by the Defendant, and the Defendant instead asked the Plaintiff to dispose of the cigarettes in September 2021, about two months after they were held in storage.

### Triable issues

34     Viewed as a whole, a host of triable issues plainly arise from the evidence presented. First, the precise terms of the parties’ agreement, and in particular whether the Additional Charges formed part of the said agreement, is an issue that merits further consideration at trial, when the body of evidence adduced can be tested under cross-examination. This may reveal why Mr Kingsley was adamant that the Defendant had agreed with the Plaintiff on the Additional Charges or bolster the Defendant’s argument that the Additional Charges never formed part of their agreement.

35     Furthermore, in justifying the ever-increasing charges due from the Defendant, the Plaintiff consistently referred to the invoices that it had produced. However, as Ms Priya suggested, the Plaintiff’s own invoices do not provide conclusive proof that the Plaintiff had incurred the storage charges which it sought to charge to the Defendant. In fact, the Plaintiff’s willingness to settle the dispute between the parties for $35,000 (on 20 August 2021), and subsequently to release the Defendant’s cargo if $30,000 was paid (on 10 September 2021) _suggests_ that the actual costs incurred by the Plaintiff was lower than it had quoted the Defendant. This is especially so as the sums allegedly due for storage, chassis, parking and transloading had supposedly risen to $62,744 by 13 September 2021; if so, questions arise as to why the Plaintiff was willing to release the cargo for just $30,000 on 10 September 2021.

36     Testing the evidence at trial may also reveal whether the Plaintiff was, as the Defendant contends, in breach of the parties’ agreement by refusing to release the cigarettes in the former’s possession until payment for the invoices (primarily for the Additional Charges) was made.

37     Nonetheless, as alluded to at \[20\] above, the Defendant accepts that $4,200 of the charges pertaining to container stuffing, banker’s guarantee, and permit fee were validly incurred pursuant to the parties’ agreement.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) To this, the Plaintiff claims that in fact, $31,343.12 of the $84,279.57 claimed is not disputed by the Defendant. For example, it is alleged that $5,265 of the removal fee and $6,873.85 of the disposal fee are not disputed.[^53] However, the Defendant maintains that only $4,200 is undisputed.[^54] Having reviewed the submissions and considered the evidence, it is not immediately clear how the Plaintiff has arrived at the figure of $31,343.12. Indeed, at the hearing before me, the alleged “undisputed” sum was only $10,390. Even then, the methodology by which the Plaintiff arrived at the figure of $10,390 was unclear, and so parties were invited to make further submissions on the “undisputed” sum. In closing submissions, the Plaintiff tendered a table, with little explanation, and submitted that the “agreed and/or undisputed amounts exceed\[s\] $10,390 as earlier said in submissions and … should have been at least $31,343.12”.[^55] This belated submission, backed seemingly only by the invoices issued by the Plaintiff, raises more questions than answers.

38     Apart from the issues pertaining to how the $31,343.12 figure was arrived at, it may be noted that some aspects of the allegedly “undisputed” sum also fall outside the scope of the Initial Charges (being charges for unstuffing, stuffing, permit, handling and labour charges). After trial, it may be that such charges, which have been strenuously disputed by the Defendant since late July 2021 (see \[26\]–\[30\] above), do not form part of the parties’ agreement and ought not to be added to a judgment sum in the Plaintiff’s favour.

39     Accordingly, judgment is only entered for the Plaintiff in respect of $4,200 of the claimed sum, this being the amount that the Defendant does not dispute. The remaining sum of $80,079.57[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) (“the Remaining Sum”) relates to aspects of the Plaintiff claim which may not form part of the parties’ agreement or be adequately supported and deserve to be fully considered at trial before a final determination is arrived at. Thus, the Defendant is granted unconditional leave to defend the claim for the Remaining Sum.

## The striking out application

### Applicable principles

40     The Plaintiff also seeks to strike out the Defendant’s DCC pursuant to O 18 rr 19(1)(_b_)–(_d_) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (“ROC 2014”), which provide as follows:

> 19.—(1)    The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —

>> …

>> (_b_) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;

>> (_c_) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or

>> (_d_) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,

> and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.

41     It is well-established that the power of striking out should only be invoked in “plain and obvious cases” (_Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others_ \[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 648 at \[18\] and _The “Osprey”_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 1099</span> at \[6\]). This is a high threshold that is reserved for cases where “it has become plain and obvious that there can be but one result” (_Bank of China v Asiaweek Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 230</span> at \[6\]).

42     Given my finding that various triable issues arise in relation to the Plaintiff’s claim for the Remaining Sum, and as the “plain and obvious” threshold is higher than that for an application for summary judgment, _a fortiori_, the Defendant’s defence should not be struck out: see _Xia Zheng v Lee King Anne_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 199</span> at \[67\]. Hence, the striking out application will only be considered as regards the Defendant’s counterclaim.

### Proper party for a claim in demurrage or detention

43     The Defendant counterclaims for $51,100 “being the charges for demurrage and detention” of the Defendant’s FCL container (containing 1,000 cartons of cigarettes) from 17 July 2021 to 28 September 2021.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) The Plaintiff submits that this counterclaim for demurrage or detention is “without basis and obviously unsustainable”.

44     A claim that is “obviously unsustainable” may be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(_b_) (the scandalous, frivolous or vexatious ground). As aptly summarised in the High Court’s decision of _Tan Swee Wan and another v Lian Tian Yong Johnny_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 206</span> (“_Tan Swee Wan_”) at \[39\]:

> …

> (b)    O 18 r 19(1)(_b_): “it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious”.

>> (i)    A matter is “scandalous” where it does not even have a “tendency to show the truth of any allegation material to the relief sought…

>> (ii)   “Frivolous or vexatious” means “obviously unsustainable” or “wrong. A case that is “plainly and obviously unsustainable” is one which is either legally or factually unsustainable. **_A case is legally unsustainable_** **if “it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks”.** _A case is factually unsustainable_ if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, \[for example, if it is\] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based”: _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 546</span> at \[39\].

>> \[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis added in bold\]

45     The concept of “demurrage and detention” is explained in Tan Lee Meng, _Law on Carriage of Goods by Sea_ (Academy Publishing, 3rd Ed, 2018) (“_Law on Carriage of Goods by Sea_”). There, the learned author explains that a voyage charterer is usually allotted a number of days, known as “lay days” to load or discharge cargo. The total period allotted for loading or discharging is known as “laytime” (_Law on Carriage of Goods by Sea_ at para 18.003).

46     Where a charterer breaches a contract by failing to complete loading or discharging by the expiry of laytime, the shipowner is, without more, not entitled to regard the charterparty as at end because of the charterer’s breach. The vessel can only sail away if the charterer has evinced an intention not to perform his obligations with respect to loading or discharging or if the commercial purpose of the adventure is frustrated (_Law on Carriage of Goods by Sea_ at paras 18.004 to 18.005).

47     To compensate the shipowner for the delay, the voyage charterer is usually required by the charterparty to pay demurrage when laytime has been exceeded. (_Law on Carriage of Goods by Sea_ at para 18.006). Put another way, “demurrage is the agreed damages to be paid for delay if the ship is delayed in loading or discharging beyond the agreed period” (_Compania Naviera Aeolus SA v Union of India_ <span class="citation">\[1964\] AC 868</span> at 899). Demurrage is thus a form of liquidated damages for damages caused by the charterer to the shipowner for delaying the shipowner’s vessel. As explained in _President of India v Lips Maritime Corporation_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] 3 WLR 572</span> at 578, per Lord Brandon of Oakbrook:

> Most, if not all, voyage charters contain a demurrage clause, which prescribes a daily rate at which the damages for such detention are to be quantified. The effect of such a claim \[in demurrage\] is to liquidate the damages payable: it does not alter the nature of the charterer’s liability, which is and remains a liability for damages, albeit liquidated damages.

48     Alternatively, where a charterparty does not provide for demurrage, the shipowner nonetheless remains entitled to damages for detention of the vessel after the expiry of laytime (_Law on Carriage of Goods by Sea_ at para 18.007). In fact, liability for detention charges can be independent of the requirement for laytime. For example, in _Freight Connect (S) Pte Ltd v Paragon Shipping Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 178</span> (“_Freight Connect_”), the relevant contractual clause between the charterer and shipowner provided that:

> Time lost due to swell and/or weather and/or waiting for loading and/or discharging berth on ships arrival at or off port or so near thereto vessel may be permitted to approach, will be charged as time for which detention is due\[.\]

Interpreting this “time lost clause”, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the charterer’s liability for detention charges was “independent of the requirement for laytime to have commenced” (_Freight Connect_ at \[44\]). In other words, liability for demurrage or detention can, in the appropriate case, arise even if the charterer has not breached the laytime (_Freight Connect_ at \[39\]):

> … **A distinction has to be drawn between a claim for demurrage (or detention charges)** **_after_** **the expiration of laytime and a claim for an agreed sum which is payable upon the occurrence of a specified event**. In the present case, it is the latter: the relevant clause clearly states that detention charges are payable for any time lost due to the waiting for a loading berth. The issue of whether the second fixture was a port or berth charterparty does not arise in so far as it is not disputed that time was, in fact, lost while waiting for a loading berth. It does not matter whether the \[the vessel\] was an arrived ship given that the time lost clause clearly states that time would start running upon the vessel’s “arrival at or off port or so near thereto \[the\] vessel may be permitted to approach”. To this end, **the requirement set out in the time lost clause is independent of the questions concerning the commencement of laytime and the tendering of a valid \[notice of readiness\]. The detention charges are payable in so far as it is not disputed that the express requirements in the time lost clause have been satisfied**…

> \[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis added in bold\]

49     Reviewing the authorities above, what emerges is that a claim for demurrage or detention is made by a shipowner against a charterer for breaches of a charterparty that delays the chartered vessel.

50     However, the Defendant’s counterclaim for “demurrage and detention” is one made by a putative charterer (the Defendant) against the Plaintiff, a freight forwarder. This counterclaim is premised solely on an invoice issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff for the “detention and demurrage” of the Defendant’s cargo until 28 September 2021.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) But the Defendant is not a shipowner, and the Plaintiff is not a charterer for the purposes of the parties’ dealings since the onus of arranging for the re-export of the cargo fell on the Defendant. Additionally, the Plaintiff’s refusal to release the Defendant’s cargo has not led to the delay of any vessel, and no invoice has been produced to show that the Defendant was liable to any shipowner, pursuant to a charterparty or otherwise, due to the Plaintiff’s refusal to release the cartons of cigarettes until the relevant payment was made.

51     In the circumstances, the Defendant’s counterclaim for demurrage and detention is clearly a misplaced claim that is legally unsustainable. This is because even if the Defendant can “succeed in proving all the facts that \[it\] offers to prove \[it\] will not be entitled to the remedy \[it\] seeks” (_Tan Swee Wan_ at \[39\]) as the Defendant is _not_ a shipowner, nor has the Defendant incurred any liability (in demurrage or detention charges) to any shipowner due to the Plaintiff’s actions. Perhaps recognising this, the Defendant submits in closing that it “wishes to withdraw its counterclaim”.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) Given that the Defendant’s counterclaim for demurrage and detention is obviously unsustainable, it is struck out in its entirety pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(_b_) of ROC 2014.

## Conclusion

52     In conclusion, summary judgment is entered in the Plaintiff’s favour in respect of $4,200 of the claimed sum, with interest on this sum to run at 5.33% per annum from the date of the filing of the writ to the date of this judgment. The Defendant is granted unconditional leave to defend the remainder of the Plaintiff’s claim (in the sum of $80,079.57), and the Defendant’s counterclaim for demurrage and detention charges is struck out.

53     I will hear the parties separately on the question of costs.
