Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Criminal breach of trust as a Public Servant

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9058/2021/01-02.\]

4 January 2022

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to two charges of criminal breach of trust by a public servant under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”). The two charges are reproduced below:

> DAC-939350-2017 (“the 1st Charge”)

> You, … …, are charged that you, sometime between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016, at Woodgrove Secondary School located at 3 Woodlands Ave 6, Singapore, being employed as a public servant by the Ministry of Education at the said school, and being entrusted in such capacity with property, _to wit_, cash amounting to S$21,627.40, did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-939351-2017

> You, … …, are charged that you, sometime between 1 January 2017 and 7 April 2017, at Woodgrove Secondary School located at 3 Woodlands Ave 6, Singapore, being employed as a public servant by the Ministry of Education at the said school, and being entrusted in such capacity with property, _to wit_, cash amounting to S$19,009.30, did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of trial, I amended DAC-939351-2017 to reflect a lower amount of S$18,964.30 (see \[89\] below). The amended charge reads as follows:

> DAC-939351-2017 (Amended) (the “2nd Charge”)

> You, … …, are charged that you, sometime between 1 January 2017 and 7 April 2017, at Woodgrove Secondary School located at 3 Woodlands Ave 6, Singapore, being employed as a public servant by the Ministry of Education at the said school, and being entrusted in such capacity with property, _to wit_, cash amounting to S$18,964.30, did commit criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

3       With regards to the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge (collectively, “the Charges”), I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and I convicted her on both charges.

4       After considering the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Accused’s plea-in-mitigation, I imposed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment on each charge. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively to give a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment.

5       The Accused filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence. The Prosecution filed an appeal against sentence.

6       I granted a stay of execution on sentence. I also allowed the Accused to go on bail pending appeal.

7       I shall now set out my grounds of decision.

## Accused’s Appeal Against Conviction

### Essential Elements of the Charges

8       The essential elements which must be established in relation to each of the Charges are as follows:

> (a)     The Accused was entrusted with property;

> (b)     The entrustment was made in the Accused’s capacity as a public servant;

> (c)     The Accused had misappropriated the property; and

> (d)     The misappropriation was dishonest.

9       Next, I set out the undisputed facts and the summaries of the Prosecution’s case and the Defence’s case.

### Undisputed Facts

10     The Accused was employed by the Ministry of Education (“MOE”) as a teacher and was deployed to Woodgrove Secondary School (“WGS”) in or around 2002. She was therefore a public servant.

11     In the course of the Accused’s deployment at WGS she assumed the position of Head of Department (“HOD”) of the English Department sometime in 2006 and held that position throughout until her arrest on 7 April 2017.

12     Sometime from 2012 onwards, the English Department of WGS began to produce its own resource packages (known as “ExCEL package(s)”) for the students’ use. The ExCEL packages would be printed by the school’s own bookshop (the “Bookshop”). The students would have to pay for the ExCEL package, the price of which was determined by its printing cost which was measured by the number of pages, and the cost of binding.

13     The ExCEL package for the relevant year would be listed as an item in the booklist given to students the year before. However, the price of the ExCEL package as stated on the booklist was merely an indicative one, as the number of pages of the ExCEL package have not been finalised yet.

14     The teachers in the English Department would collect the money from the students in their respective classes for the ExCEL packages based on the price stated in the booklist. Each teacher would indicate on a class list which students they had collected money from. Students who were on the government’s Financial Assistance Scheme or the school’s own aid scheme (collectively referred to as “FAS”) were not required to pay for the packages. Each teacher was supposed to hand over all sums collected from the students to the Accused. The Accused would thereafter be in charge of paying the Bookshop for the printed ExCEL packages from the monies she had received (the “monies”).

### Summary of the Case for the Prosecution

#### The Accused’s Modus Operandi

15     At this point it is apt to recall that the 1st Charge pertains to monies entrusted in 2016 whereas the 2nd Charge pertains to monies entrusted in 2017. The Prosecution’s case was substantially the same for both Charges in terms of how the Accused committed the breaches of trust. In each year, the Accused was entrusted the monies in her capacity as HOD of the English Department. These monies amounted to $34,937.20 between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016, and $36,005.50[^1] between 1 January 2017 and 7 April 2017. In each year, the Accused would pay the Bookshop according to invoices given to her by the bookshop manager, Mdm Cheng Bee Lian (“PW9 Cheng”). These invoices amounted to $13,309.80 for the year 2016 and $17,041.20 for the year 2017. Accordingly, there was a surplus of S$21,627.40 and S$18,964.30[^2] for the 2016 and 2017 respectively, which the Accused misappropriated (the “Surplus”). The Accused had acted dishonestly in misappropriating the surplus.

16     In relation to the amounts collected and entrusted to the Accused, the evidence showed that the Accused had instructed the teachers from the English Department to collect monies from the students in accordance with the prices stated in the book lists. The teachers then collected the monies from the non-FAS students and submitted them to the Accused.

17     In relation to the amount paid to the Bookshop and the resultant surplus, the Prosecution’s case was that PW9 Cheng would calculate the printing cost of the ExCEL packages at a rate of $0.03 per page with an additional $2 if they were bound in a “perfect bind”. She would then invoice the Accused for all the non-FAS students, and invoice MOE directly for the ExCEL packages printed for the FAS students. In this respect, the Prosecution adduced invoices to show the total amount charged by the Bookshop.

18     The Surplus was calculated by deducting the total amount invoiced by the Bookshop from the total amount collected from the non-FAS students. It was the Prosecution’s case that even after the Accused had had sight of these invoices, evidenced by her stamp and signature, she had at no point in time raised the issue that the amounts reflected in the invoices were lower than the amounts collected and that there was a resultant surplus.

19     In relation to the Accused’s dishonest misappropriation of the Surplus, it was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused knew that the Surplus did not belong to her. Yet, she chose not to return the Surplus to the rightful owners – the students – and instead used the Surplus for her own personal expenses. This amounted to a wrongful gain to the Accused, and correspondingly, a wrongful loss to the students.

20     It was also the Prosecution’s case that the Accused deliberately took advantage of the situation upon realising that the collection and payment routine would result in a surplus. Even after becoming aware of the surplus in April 2016, the Accused continued to instruct the teachers to collect the higher sum according to the booklist. Thereafter, between 1 January 2017 and 7 April 2017, instead of avoiding the same situation which resulted in the surplus, the Accused instructed the teachers to collect the monies according to the booklists once again.

21     The Prosecution’s case in establishing the Accused’s dishonest misappropriation was mainly built around the Accused’s investigation statements comprising one investigation statement (Exhibit P52) recorded by MOE Investigation Officer Lucy Lim Mei Ling (“PW2 Lucy Lim”) and the following seven investigation statements which were recorded by the Investigation Officer, Inspector Aruna d/o Ramasamy (“Insp Aruna”)[^3]:

22     The Defence did not challenge the admissibility of the aforementioned investigation statements except for Exhibit P69. I held an ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of Exhibit P69. I will be dealing with the ancillary hearing in more detail at a later section (see \[34\] below). It suffices for now to highlight that all the aforementioned investigation statements were admitted into evidence.

#### Events leading to the Accused’s arrest

23     The evidence adduced by the Prosecution showed that the Accused’s misappropriation only came to light on 3 January 2017 when Ms Jacqueline Chan (“PW8 Chan”), the Subject Head for English, obtained copies of the invoices from PW9 Cheng, and discovered that there was a discrepancy between the amounts being collected by the teachers and the amounts on the invoices. PW8 Chan subsequently informed Ms Audrey Lim, one of WGS’s Vice-Principals, who in turn informed Mr Chee Chit Yeng (“PW1 Chee”), the Principal of WGS at the material time.

24     Together, PW1 Chee and Ms Audrey Lim obtained the records of collection as well as the invoices in order to determine if there had indeed been an over-collection of monies. Their calculations were recorded in a document marked and admitted as Exhibit P3. PW1 Chee then contacted the MOE Employee Discipline Investigation Unit to report the matter.

25     On 10 March 2017, PW2 Lucy Lim was assigned to investigate into the matter.

26     PW2 Lucy Lim testified that she spoke to PW8 Chan and PW9 Cheng and recorded their statements. A decision was thereafter made to interview the Accused.

27     On the morning of 7 April 2017, PW2 Lucy Lim and her colleague, Goh Jing Ping (“PW6 Goh”) went to WGS to interview the Accused. They arrived at WGS around 10.30 am. With the assistance of PW1 Chee, the Accused was brought to meet PW2 Lucy Lim and PW6 Goh at the school’s conference room. From 11.00 am to 12.15 pm, the Accused was interviewed by PW2 Lucy Lim and PW6 Goh. The interview was mainly conducted by PW2 Lucy Lim.

28     At about 12.15 pm, PW2 Lucy Lim and PW6 Goh were brought by the Accused to her workstation. A search was conducted at the Accused’s workstation. Some monies were recovered during the search. After completing the search, the three of them returned to the conference room. PW2 Lucy Lim proceeded to record a statement (Exhibit P52) from the Accused.

29     Another MOE officer, one Kwa Yon Lye (“PW7 Kwa”) joined PW2 Lucy Lim and PW6 Goh at WGS around 2.30 to 3.00 pm. PW7 Kwa was provided with an update of the investigation findings by either PW2 Lucy Lim or PW6 Goh. PW7 Kwa reported the updates to his supervisor. PW7 was instructed to get the school’s principal to report the matter to the Police. PW7 then spoke to PW1 Chee.

30     PW1 Chee called the Police through its ‘999’ hotline. Insp Aruna and two police officers from Jurong Police Division Headquarters (“Jurong Police HQ”) were despatched to WGS.

31     Insp Aruna arrived at WGS at about 4 pm. After being briefed by PW2 Lucy Lim, Insp Aruna and the Accused went to the Accused’s workstation. A Crime Scene Investigator joined them to take photographs of the Accused’s workstation and some case exhibits (see Exhibits P53 to P68).

32     At about 4.50 pm, the Accused was placed under arrest. The Accused was then brought to the Jurong Police HQ.

33     On 7 April 2017 at 11.59 pm, Insp Aruna commenced recording Exhibit P69 from the Accused. The recording of Exhibit P69 was completed around 1.20 am of 8 April 2017. Insp Aruna was assisted by Station Inspector Navinder Singh (“SI Navinder”)[^4] during the recording of Exhibit P69.

### The Ancillary Hearing

34     The Defence challenged the admissibility of Exhibit P69 on the ground that the making of the statement was caused by a mixture of threat, inducement and promise. The Defence also submitted that Exhibit P69 was recorded under oppressive circumstances.

#### Prosecution’s Case at the Ancillary Hearing

35     For the ancillary hearing, the Prosecution called Insp Aruna, SI Navinder, and Station Inspector Mahmud bin Dahalan (“SI Mahmud”)[^5]. SI Mahmud was the Supervisory Officer for the Persons-in-Custody unit of Jurong Police HQ. Insp Aruna and SI Navinder testified as to the circumstances surrounding the recording of Exhibit P69 whereas SI Mahmud testified regarding the standard protocol that applied to persons in custody at the Jurong Police HQ.

36     SI Mahmud testified that the Police used a centralised system to track the movement of accused persons in the lock-up. This was known as the ‘Person in Custody Management System’ or the ‘PCMS’. SI Mahmud testified that following the Accused’s arrest, as per standard protocol, she would have been handcuffed at a Buffer Zone while her arrest report was being lodged. There was however no record of how long the Accused was made to wait in the Buffer Zone, and the first activity reflected on the PCMS was the successful registration of her arrest on 7 April 2019 at 6.15 pm. At 6.33 pm, the Accused was brought to the Charge Office for the registration of her identity and safekeeping of her personal property. Based on the PCMS records, the Accused was brought to the lock-up at 7.26 pm before being taken for a medical check-up between 9.13 pm to 9.19 pm. The PCMS reflected that the Accused had “no complaints”. The PCMS did not reflect when the Accused was taken out of the lock-up for the recording of Exhibit P69, and the next activity reflected was her return to the lock-up on 8 April 2019 at 2.14 am.

37     Insp Aruna’s and SI Navinder’s accounts of the recording of Exhibit P69 were largely consistent. An interview was conducted before the recording of Exhibit P69 to explain to the Accused the offences that she was arrested for and the allegations against her.[^6] During the course of the recording of the statement, The Accused was composed and was able to answer the questions posed to her.[^7] At no point in time was SI Navinder left alone with the Accused.[^8] No threats, inducements or promises were made by SI Navinder to the Accused.[^9] Insp Aruna further testified that the statement was read over to the Accused and she was allowed to make amendments as she wished.[^10] She however declined to do so.[^11]

#### The Defence’s case on Inducement, Threat or Promise

38     The Defence’s case was that SI Navinder’s presence during the recording of Exhibit P69 was purely to put pressure on the Accused. The Accused testified that “_the moment I sat down… IO Navinder started raising his voice at me. He asked me how long I had been in the school… And I told him that I had served the school for almost 15 years… Then he started to accuse me. He said, “15 years in the school, multiply by $20,000 each year. So you must have taken about $300,000._”[^12]

39     The Accused further testified that in making these allegations, SI Navinder had waved in his hand a document (_ie_ Exhibit P3) that he claimed was from the school’s principal, setting out amounts that she had allegedly taken on a yearly basis.[^13] The Accused told SI Navinder that she did not do such a thing. She broke down and cried badly.

40     The Accused also testified that SI Navinder then threatened her by saying “_\[a\]s a civil servant, when you are charged with CBT, are you aware … you are facing a life sentence? You can kiss your career goodbye. You will never see your family again._”[^14] The Accused was asked to confirm the figures in Exhibit P3, with SI Navinder promising, “_If you cooperate with us, we can help you… If you sign on the statements that we prepared for you and you agree to whatever amount that we ask you to pay, we will let you off, we will not charge you_”.[^15]

41     The Accused testified that she then signed the statement without reading the statement because she “_was very scared. There was a lot of shouting going on_”.[^16]

#### The Defence’s case on Oppression

42     The Defence’s case that Exhibit P69 was recorded under oppression was based on the following:

> (a)     The Accused slept at 1.30 am in the early hours of 7 April 2017, as she was working. She woke up at 6 am and thereafter left for work at WGS.[^17] She was then interrogated by the MOE Investigation Officers from 10.30 am to 4.00 pm,[^18] and arrested by the Police at about 4.45pm.[^19] The Accused was then placed in the lock-up “_for a couple of hours_” before being taken for the recording of Exhibit P69 between 11.45pm and 1.20am.[^20] Therefore, the Accused did not have any proper rest before her interrogation up to the time of the recording of the statement.[^21]

> (b)     The Accused’s liberties were curbed.[^22] During the interrogation by the MOE Investigation Officers, the Accused’s every move was carefully watched and scrutinised by PW6 Goh. This included PW6 Goh keeping a watchful eye on every call or message that came to the Accused’s personal mobile phone and following her when she went to the washroom. The Accused also testified that she was shown a red-ringed file by PW2 Lucy Lim that purportedly contained all the evidence against her.[^23] The Accused’s request to view the file was denied. In the Accused’s own words, “_I was treated as if I was guilty. I was treated as if I was a criminal_”.[^24] These were events that occurred hours before the recording of Exhibit P69. I understood that the Defence’s intention was to provide background on the events throughout the day that culminated into Accused’s state of mind at the point of recording Exhibit P69.[^25] In addition, the Defence also emphasised numerous times that the Accused was handcuffed during the recording of Exhibit P69.[^26]

> (c)     The Accused was humiliated at the point of her arrest. The Accused testified, “_They handcuffed me… and escorted me down to the car park where the police car was waiting for me. There were teachers and students at that time, Your Honour and I have never been humiliated_.”[^27]

> (d)     The Accused could not have read the statement before signing it.[^28] After the Accused was arrested and brought to the lockup at 7 pm, she had her hijab and spectacles removed.[^29] She did not have her spectacles with her in the interview room and therefore could not see or read the statement that was furnished to her.[^30] Further, the recording of Exhibit P69 was concluded at 1.20 am, and another statement, Exhibit P70, was recorded at 1.25 am. There would have been no time for the Accused to review the statement in a short span of five minutes.

> (e)     The Accused was traumatised by the whole event.[^31] Although she was served food in the evening, she declined because she was in a state of shock. The Accused only had a cup of water before she was brought up at 10 pm for interrogation by Insp Aruna and SI Navinder.[^32]

43     The Defence submitted that, in light of the above, the Accused was in tears towards the end of the recording of the statement.[^33] The Accused was completely in fear during the recording of Exhibit P69 and had therefore given her statement involuntarily.

#### Court’s Assessment and Decision

##### (1)   The Law

44     The approach to disputes over the admissibility of an accused person’s statement is set out in _Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 557</span> (_“Sulaiman bin Jumari”_) at \[54\]:

> (a)    First, was the statement given voluntarily based on the requirements set out in s 258(3) of the CPC?

>> (i)    If the statement was involuntary due to an inducement, threat or promise within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC, then it shall be excluded and that is the end of the admissibility inquiry.

>> (ii)   If the statement was voluntary, the enquiry proceeds to the second step.

> (b)    Second, even if the statement was voluntary, would the prejudicial effect of the statement outweigh its probative value? This is a discretionary exercise and the court’s foremost concern is in evaluating the reliability of the statement in the light of the specific circumstances in which it was recorded.

45     The Prosecution bears the legal burden of proof to show, beyond reasonable doubt, that the statement was given voluntarily: _Sulaiman bin Jumari_ at \[36\]. The test of voluntariness is partly objective and partly subjective: _Chia Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\], which is reproduced below:

> … The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge.

46     The Prosecution does not have to remove every lurking shadow of influence or remnant of fear: _Panya Martmontree and ors v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 806</span>. At \[29\], the Court of Appeal held:

> 29    The police work in difficult circumstances. If they were required to remove all doubt of influence or fear, they would never be able to achieve anything. What, in our view, is required of a trial judge in a _voir dire_ is to decide whether the evidence of the accused alleging, inducements, threats, promises or assaults, taken together with the Prosecution’s evidence has raised a reasonable doubt in his mind that the accused was thus influenced into making the statement, in much the same way as a jury would if they were faced with a similar question.

##### (2)   Court’s decision on admissibility

47     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Exhibit P69 was given voluntarily without any inducement, threat or promise by either Insp Aruna or SI Navinder. I also found that oppression did not feature in the recording of Exhibit P69.

48     In my assessment and evaluation of the evidence, I made the following findings:

> (a)     Insp Aruna and SI Navinder, either individually or collectively, did not make any threat, promise or inducement to the Accused. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s allegations were inconsistent and evolved as the trial progressed. The Prosecution highlighted several material inconsistencies and the key ones are set out below:

>> (i)       The Defence had challenged the Prosecution’s witnesses with some of the allegations during their cross-examination. However, when the Accused was testifying at the Ancillary Hearing, she came up with new allegations such as SI Navinder accusing her of misappropriating $300,000 over 15 years and that SI Navinder had a document from the principal which formed the basis of the $300,000 misappropriation accusation. The Prosecution submitted that these allegations, with its startling details, were not put to Insp Aruna or SI Navinder. Insp Aruna and SI Navinder therefore did not have the opportunity to address these allegations. In my assessment, the Accused’s allegations were clearly an afterthought, and it also demonstrated the Accused’s ability to embellish her false allegations.

>> (ii)       PW2 Lucy Lim did not feature during the Ancillary Hearing. Nonetheless the Accused alleged that PW2 Lucy Lim had a red file which she told the Accused contained evidence against her. The Accused also alleged that PW2 Lucy Lim had accused her of using the Surplus to buy branded goods. None of these allegations were raised to PW2 Lucy Lim when she was cross-examined during the main trial. This was yet another instance of the Accused embellishing her evidence. More importantly, the Defence had already consented to the admissibility of the statement (Exhibit P52) recorded by PW2 Lucy Lim. From this episode, amongst others, I found the Accused to be an unreliable witness. I thus rejected her allegations of threat, promise and inducement. On the contrary, I found that the testimonies of Insp Aruna and SI Navinder were consistent and corroborative of each other.

> (b)     The arrest of the Accused at the school and the consequential handcuffing was the norm. Under such circumstances, it was understandable for the Accused to feel humiliated. But no blame could be apportioned to the police officers for they were merely carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The evidence showed that that Insp Aruna had taken measures to ensure that the Accused would only be handcuffed just before she was taken into the police car. This was done at the request of PW1 Chee as he did not want her to be handcuffed on the way to the police car, given that there were students still around at that moment.[^34] In any case, I found that the humiliation, if at all felt by the Accused, did not amount, in law, to oppression.

> (c)     The Accused’s liberties were not curbed and her free will was not sapped. Firstly, the handcuffing of the Accused was part of the procedure and protocol that the police officers had to comply with. And this procedure extended from the time of the arrest at the school till she was brought to the lock-up at Jurong Police HQ. As testified by Insp Aruna, the restraint of the Accused was standard protocol for all persons-in-custody.[^35] This was corroborated by SI Navinder.[^36] Once the Accused was in the lock-up cell, the handcuffs would have been removed.[^37] Against this background, the Defence did not adduce any evidence to show or prove that the Accused had been unduly restrained. Secondly, the Accused was allowed to call her husband both before[^38] and after[^39] the recording of Exhibit P69. I therefore did not accept the Accused’s claim that her worry for her husband and family resulted in her signing the statement involuntarily.

> (d)     The Accused’s mental ability and strength were not affected despite the fact that she might have been fatigued by the long day she had had. In this regard, I have observed that she did not raise any issues to the doctor when she was brought for a medical assessment.[^40] Further, she did not, at any point in time, request to take a break during the recording of Exhibit P69.[^41]

> (e)     The Accused was also not affected by the lack of food. Although she had not eaten at the point of recording Exhibit P69, this was a conscious choice made by herself. A meal and beverage were offered to her.[^42] The Accused did not take the food. She testified, “_I was too worried. I was traumatised by the entire incident that happened from morning until the afternoon. I had no appetite. I was tired_”.[^43] If the Accused became hungry at a later point in time, she could have requested for food. Indeed, the Accused had requested for water when she later felt thirsty and was given a cup of water by a police officer.[^44]

> (f)     While the Accused may have been in tears towards the end of the recording of Exhibit P69, in my assessment, it was more a realisation and reflection of her guilt, rather than her fear of the police officers. In this regard, I considered the Accused’s admission that the statement had contained information that Insp Aruna and SI Navinder would not have known if not for the fact that she had told them.[^45]

> (g)     The Accused was given the opportunity to review the statement and make any amendments before she signed it. There are two points to this:

>> (i)       Firstly, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused was a well-educated woman with 20 years of teaching experience. She had shown herself to be cautious and thoughtful when giving her testimony at trial. I did not believe her evidence that she would have blindly signed Exhibit P69 without making sure that it was factually accurate and truly reflected what she wanted to say before signing it.[^46] I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s claim that she had signed the statement without thinking was belied by her personality and demeanour at trial where she had herself declared that she would “_read between the lines_” of questions asked of her in cross-examination.[^47]

>> (ii)       Secondly, although the Accused had testified that she was unable to read because she did not have her spectacles, I noted that this was only raised for the first time in her examination-in-chief and was not put to either Insp Aruna or SI Navinder.[^48] Furthermore, I accepted Insp Aruna’s evidence that she had read the statement to her “_word for word_”.[^49]

> (h)     The recording of Exhibit P70, which came after Exhibit P69, supported the Prosecution’s case that Exhibit P69 was given voluntarily by the Accused. I was mindful that the Defence did not challenge the admissibility of Exhibit P70, which was recorded a mere five minutes after the completion of Exhibit P69. It was not logical to me that two statements taken within a short span of each other were taken under different circumstances. I also observed that Exhibit P70 was recorded because the Accused wanted to volunteer further information that she acknowledged was helpful to her Defence.[^50] Exhibit P70 was a brief statement in which the Accused explained that she still had some sums of money at her desk which had not been taken by the MOE investigators. In my assessment, Insp Aruna had faithfully recorded what the Accused wanted to say.

49     Having evaluated all the relevant evidence, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Exhibit P69 given by the Accused voluntarily. Exhibit P69 was therefore admitted into evidence.

### The Accused’s Investigation Statements

50     I shall now reproduce the relevant portions of the Accused’s investigation statements. The statements contained both inculpatory and exculpatory parts.

#### Exhibit P52

51     At page 3:

> For the price in the booklist, Colleen will come to me sometime in Oct to check on the prices and packages for printing and to be stated in the booklist. I will ask her about the price there and then, and after that, she will compile the booklist and indicate the price we agreed upon. The booklists will be given to the students before the school closed in Oct for Sec 2 and above. The Sec 1 students will only get their booklists in Dec.

> In end Dec/early Jan, the packages will be ready for collection and distributed to the students via their subject teachers. … …

> Somewhere in end Jan, the teachers will start with the collection of the money based on the booklists, after I whatsapp them in the group chat to start collecting the money. The teachers will collect the money using the class lists and passed the money to me in envelopes or plastic folders. Usually, the teachers will pass me the money by end Mar. That’s when payment to Colleen will be made.

52     At page 5:

> The prices in the booklists and the invoices by Colleen are usually different, with the actual prices to be lower. The balance of the money were used for printing of worksheets that were not listed in the booklists. … …

> … …

> Q2    Is there anyone else liaising with Colleen on the payment of the invoices throughout the year?

> A2    Payment to Colleen is only me. But the teachers can submit the packages to Collen for printing.

53     At page 7:

> Q8    Did you pocket any money collected from the students for your personal use?

> A8    No.

> Q9    Have there been balance of money collected from students at the end of the school year?

> A9    Yes. Usually, there is a balance of $2000+

> Q10    What do you do with the balance of the money?

> A10    I used the remaining money to buy stationeries such as coloured markers, foolscrap papers, whiteboard markers, refills for whiteboard markers. … …

> Q11    Are the students aware that their money had been used to pay for the stationeries?

> A11    No.

54     At page 8:

> Q12    Are the other teachers aware that you used the balance of the money collected from the students to pay for the stationeries?

> A12    I don’t think I told them

> … …

> Q14    Do you think it is right to use the students’ money to purchase stationeries?

> A14    No.

> Q15    Reference to A14, why did you still do it?

> A15    I thought it would be troublesome to return the money to the students and in exchange, I just purchase stationeries for their use in the classrooms and for English projects. … …

55     At page 10:

> Q22    The school informed us that based on their calculations, the discrepancy between the amount collected from the students and the amount paid to Colleen in 2017 is $25,013.30. Can you account for the remaining of the money?

> A22    I have around $6,000 cash with me which I kept in my cubicle. That’s all I have. I did not take any money from the students.

> Q23    The school informed us that based on their calculations, the discrepancy between the amount collected from the students and the amount paid to Colleen in 2016 is $22,143.10. Can you account for the remaining of the money?

> A23    I am tired of this investigation because I know I am not going to win anyway. All the odds are against me. Let’s just say that I took the money. But I do not have the money with me. I want to end this statement now.

#### Exhibit P69

56     The relevant portions read:

> … …

> I have been in-charge of the procurement of books since 2008. Initially the school purchased textbooks for our students. In recent years we revamped our system and decided to produce our own textbook packages instead. These packages will be printed by the book store lady Ms Colleen. Teachers will collect money from the students and pass the amount to me together with the respective class list. I have this class lists put together into a file. Lower Sec has one file and upper sec has one file. The money is placed into the respective class list. The collection for that particular school year is always done somewhere in February/March. The estimated cost of the package is reflected in the book list given to the students in before the school year ends in Oct/Nov every year. At the start of the new school year, the prices will be confirmed with Ms Colleen. These confirmed prices are usually lower. However the teachers will still collect the estimated amount stated in the price list instead. The differences in the amount is then supposed to be returned to the students.

> … …

> I do agree taking the money over the last three years. But it is definitely not even more than S$10,000/-. I spend the money for my own expenses like food and etc. I did not give anyone the money. I did not invest the money or buy anything lavish with the money. I remember the differences being below $10,000/- yearly.

> … …

> Q10    Have you ever returned back the differences in the money to the students?

> A10    No I have not. Because I find it to be an hassle and decided to keep the money to myself.

> … …

> Q13    Why did you misappropriate the remaining balance at the end of the year instead of returning to the students?

> A13    I find it hassle to return to the children because I have 1300 students. I also have used the money to purchase stationeries which is all in my cubicle.

> Q14    Have you mentioned about the fact that you have used the remaining balance to anyone?

> A14    No, not even my husband knows. Cause I do not want him to worry and be upset with him.

> … …

> Q19    Is anyone else who is aware that you have been taking money for your own personal expenses out of the amount collected?

> A19    Nobody knows about this except myself.

> Q20    Do you have anything else to say?

> A20    I am sorry I am willing to pay whatever amount I have misappropriated.

#### Exhibit 70

57     This investigation statement consisted of only one paragraph and it is reproduced below:

> I will like to add that there is still some money in my office that the MOE officers did not take it from my office. I keep some money given to me by the teachers at various places in my office. This is because I am rushing to classes sometimes, so I will keep the money in my work desk instead. I can remember that I kept some money in my book shelves. The money is kept in the envelope given to me by the teachers. The files will all the class lists is all with MOE. They took everything. That is all.

#### Exhibit P71

58     The relevant portions read:

> On 8/4/17 at 0920 hrs I was brought to my school, Woodgrove Secondary School by IO Aruna. I showed IO Aruna the place where I kept the money collected from the teachers. This amount retrieved was collected for Li packages for Class 2E4.

> I will like to add that there are two different packages for English and Literature for Sec 2 students. The English package is $35 and the Literature package is $12. The total amount collection would be $47. But the amount reflected based on MOE’s collection is $65. The money found in the envelope amounting to $408 is the collection of cash for the Lit packages for class 2E4. IO Aruna seized the amount of $408 from me and I was given a acknowledgement slip. I also showed IO Aruna two black files containing class lists and indicating the amount collected from each student. IO Aruna also took back the two black files. There were also invoices inside the file.

> … …

#### Exhibit P72

59     This investigation statement consisted primarily of the clarifications the Accused gave to Insp Aruna with regards to the collection of the monies and its tabulation. Based on the clarifications provided by the Accused, Insp Aruna amended the Annexes and the Accused countersigned against the Annexes.

#### Exhibit P73

60     In this investigation statement, additional clarifications and amendments to the collection of monies were made. In addition, the Accused also stated:

> Q7    I now refer you to Annex A (Amended 2), do you agree with the total discrepancy value $20,857.80 for the year 2017?

> A7    Yes I do. I understand that there will be a further deduction later to determine the exact restitution amount that I have to pay back because money collected from 2E4(English), 2E3(Literature) and 4N2 (Band 2 English) was already seized by the Police. I signed and acknowledged a copy of Annex A (Amended 2).

> Q8    I now refer you to Annex B (Amended 1), do you agree with the total discrepancy value of $21,656.00 for the year 2016?

> A8    No, I do not agree with the number of students who paid from 3E4. It should be 31 has I had amended before. The reason being, there is one student Kenneth from 3E4 who did not pay although he is not an FA student. I can send you a copy of the signed class list provided which will indicate that Kenneth had not paid, because there was no signature or indication beside it. I am sure he did not pay because Kenneth was in my band of students that I was teaching.

> I also note that there was a technical error in Annex B Amended, there should be 29 students for 4N1 and 24 students for 4T1. I have counter signed on this errors as an acknowledgement.

#### Exhibit P74

61     This is the cautioned statement of the Accused in relation to the 2016 collections.

> I wish to add that the money that I took are not solely for myself. I did use the money to purchase other items such as markers and coloured pens, exercise books and stationaries. These items are still in my school at my work desk. That is all.

#### Exhibit P75

62     This is the cautioned statement of the Accused in relation to the 2017 collections:

> I wish to say the same thing that I mentioned in my first charge. I wish to add that I did not have any malicious intentions and that I am sorry for my actions. That is all.

### Close of the Prosecution’s Case

63     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of all the charges against the Accused. Accordingly, I called upon the Accused to enter her defence. The Accused elected to give evidence under oath.[^51]

### Summary of the Case for the Defence

64     In the words of the Accused’s counsel, her defence was “_not \[one involving\] misappropriation or embezzlement but a failure by the school principal to ensure teachers collected monies from students carefully and dealt with the monies they had collected properly by keeping proper records and receipts of monies they had given to \[the Accused\]_”.[^52] It was the Defence’s case that the Accused was merely negligent, and not dishonest, in the way she handled the monies entrusted to her by not properly counting them and keeping proper records.[^53] In this regard, the Defence submitted as follows:

> (a)     No written instructions were ever given to the Accused from the school’s higher-ups regarding the collection of monies from students.[^54] There was therefore no protocol to follow when it came to dealing with any surplus.

> (b)     The Defence also sought to establish that the Accused had mishandled the surplus as she was inundated with the multitude of tasks assigned to her as an HOD.[^55] The Accused’s duties included teaching, coordinating the scheme of work for the English subject across different levels, and putting up yearly budget proposals with regards to the programs involving the English Department. The Accused was also involved in relief-teaching, marketing the school to potential students, and doing coordination for national examinations. Faced with such a huge amount of work, the Accused failed to keep proper records of monies received and spent.[^56]

65     The Defence also sought to establish that there was reasonable doubt as to the exact amount that was misappropriated. In particular, the Defence submitted that there was “_no actual proof from the Prosecution as to exactly what were the sums actually given to \[the Accused\]_”.[^57] There were three parts to this argument:

> (a)     Firstly, there was no proof of actual collection of the monies from the students by the teachers. In this regard, the Defence relied on the fact that many of the class lists adduced at the trial Court were unsigned.[^58]

> (b)     Secondly, there was no proof that the monies collected by the teachers were given in full to the Accused. On the part of the teachers, they would sometimes leave the monies at various areas of the Accused’s workstation in her absence.[^59] On the Accused’s end, she did not have the habit of counting the monies received or issuing receipts of the monies collected. Given the haphazard manner of passing the monies over to the Accused, the Defence cast doubt on whether all the monies collected were in fact given to the Accused.[^60]

> (c)     Thirdly, the Defence submitted that there were missing invoices that had not been adduced at the trial that would have shown that more monies were paid to PW9 Cheng by the Accused.[^61] Accordingly, this would have reduced the amount of surplus and the sum allegedly misappropriated.

> (d)     Fourthly, the Defence highlighted that the figures prepared were amended several times throughout the course of the proceedings.[^62] The Defence’s submission in this regard was that the figures were “_compiled by poor investigations both by \[PW1 Chee\] and \[Insp Aruna\] who have \[sic\] now basing the 2 charges on assumed figures_”.[^63]

66     The Defence also submitted that the Accused never had any dishonest intention in handling the Surplus. When the Accused came to realise that there were excess monies, she decided to use it to buy stationeries and books for her students. In doing so, she thought that she was doing it for the benefit of the students.[^64] In this regard, the Defence’s submission was that, in the absence of dishonest intention, the Accused may only be exposed to civil but not criminal liability.[^65]

67     Finally, the Defence submitted that there was no motive for the Accused to misappropriate the Surplus for her own benefit, as the Accused was earning at least $8,000 a month and did not have any financial troubles.[^66]

### Issues to Be Determined

68     It was undisputed that the Accused was entrusted with monies in her capacity as a public servant. Firstly, there can be no dispute the Accused was an employee of MOE deployed as a teacher in WGS.[^67] Pursuant to section 21(h) of the Penal Code, this made her a public servant. Secondly, the monies were entrusted to her in the course of her duties as the HOD for English in WGS.

69     It was also undisputed that the total amount of monies collected from the non-FAS students exceeded the amount paid to the Bookshop.

70     On the disputed issues, the Court has to determine the following:

> (a)     What was the amount given to the Accused from the collection of the monies from the non-FAS students for the ExCEL Packages;

> (b)     How much surplus there was after the Accused paid the Bookshop for printing and binding the ExCEL Packages;

> (c)     Whether the Accused had misappropriated the surplus:

>> (i)       By using some of the surplus to purchase stationeries and assessment books;

>> (ii)       By putting some of the surplus to her own personal use;

> (d)     Whether the Accused had a dishonest intention.

71     The above-stated issues are relevant for both Charges pertaining to events happening in 2016 and 2017. I will address my findings on both Charges accordingly.

### Court’s Decision on the Charges

#### Accounting for the monies handed over to the Accused

##### (1)   Sums handed to the Accused based on class lists

72     The Prosecution’s case was based on the price for the ExCEL packages shown on the booklists from 2016 and 2017 and then matched it against the collection of monies from the non-FAS students based the class lists. The class lists were adduced by the teachers who had taught the respective classes. However, there were a number of class lists that were blank and did not have any indication of payment.[^68] The Defence therefore submitted that there were no accurate records as to how much the teachers had collected from the students,[^69] and raised the possibility that the teachers had not actually handed the Accused the exact amount they claimed to have given her. The Defence submitted accordingly that the Prosecution’s case was made on the bare assumption that all monies were collected from the different classes and the monies that were collected were all handed over to the Accused.[^70]

73     It is pertinent to highlight that it was not the Defence’s case that the Accused did not receive the monies at all. The Defence was merely challenging the collection process, the calculation involved and thus the accuracy of the final tally of the collections. I was mindful that this aspect of the Accused’s defence was only raised for the first time during the trial.[^71] Despite having numerous opportunities to raise this concern in her statements to the police and MOE, she had never once done so. I further noted that even after the Accused raised the issue at trial, she was unable to point to any specific instance where she had not received the correct sum from the teachers. In any event, the evidence has revealed that PW1 Chee, Insp Aruna and even the Prosecution had given her the benefit of the doubt by excluding students who might not have paid for the ExCEL package from their calculation.

74     I also considered the evidence given by 20 English teachers from WGS. These 20 teachers, excluding the Accused, effectively constituted the entire English Department of WGS at the material time. These were the teachers who were responsible for collecting the monies from the students and then handing them over to the Accused.

75     While none of the teachers were able to provide any form of documentation to show that the Accused had received certain sums of monies from them, I believed their testimonies that they had passed the monies they had collected to the Accused. A number of these teachers testified that they would either count the monies beforehand or have the Accused count the monies in front of them. Many of them testified that they would only pass the monies to the Accused personally as a matter of prudence. Even where the monies were not passed personally to the Accused, the teachers would ensure that they were hidden from sight. I also took into account the Accused’s agreement in cross-examination that there was no reason for any of these teachers to lie.[^72]

76     I found that the evidence given by the teachers was largely consistent. Where classes were taught jointly, I found that the relevant teachers’ accounts of their collection of monies from the students were corroborative of each other. Although some of the teachers were unable to recall specific details relating to the collection of monies and handing over to the Accused, I was mindful that the teachers were giving their evidence some three to four years after the event. Some gaps in memory are to be reasonably expected. Where no signed class lists were available, I accepted the teacher’s evidence that they would have collected the monies as per the class list.

77     Lastly, I also took into account the opportunities given to the Accused during the investigation stage to clarify some matters I relation to the collection of the monies. The clarifications were recorded in Exhibits P72 and P73. Exhibits P72 and P73 were mostly recorded in question-and-answer format where Insp Aruna would check with the Accused the sums that she disputed and the Accused would accordingly state her stance followed by her explanation. After the recording of the relevant statements, Insp Aruna would then liaise with PW1 Chee regarding the issues raised by the Accused to verify her claims. The email chain between Insp Aruna and PW1 Chee is captured in Exhibits P45-P50, which track a series of amendments to the figures before the Accused was eventually produced in court and charged in October 2017. Where the sums she disputed were in relation to classes that she had personally taught, I found her evidence to be credible as she would have had personal knowledge of the sums collected.[^73] Further, I noted that the Accused had highlighted several calculation errors to Insp Aruna. These amendments proposed by the Accused were generally accepted by PW1 Chee after internal verification.[^74] In summary, PW1 Chee and Insp Aruna had done their utmost to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the collection of the monies and the Accused has acknowledged them in her investigation statements, namely, Exhibit P72 and P73.

78     In my assessment, I had no doubt that the teachers had passed the monies they had collected, based on the class lists, to the Accused.

##### (2)    In relation to the 1st Charge: Amount collected and entrusted to the Accused between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016

79     On my request, the Prosecution prepared a document, Exhibit D, tabulating the amounts collected by the teachers and entrusted to the Accused, amounts charged by the Bookshop and the resultant discrepancy for the year 2016. Exhibit D revealed that a total of $34,937.20 was collected across 31 classes in 2016 and entrusted to the Accused. As I was satisfied that Exhibit D accurately reflected the evidence borne out in the course of the trial, I found that a total sum of $34,937.20 was collected and entrusted to the Accused in 2016.

80     I would like to point out that the Prosecution did revise Exhibit D and a revised version, Exhibit D (Amended) was tendered. Two changes were made in Exhibit D (Amended) and these changes related to the names of the teachers who had collected the monies for classes 3N1 and 3N2 respectively. The calculation of the sums involved remained unchanged from Exhibit D.

##### (3)    In relation to the 2nd Charge: Amount collected and entrusted to the Accused between 1 January 2017 and 7 April 2017

81     On my request, the Prosecution prepared a document, Exhibit E, tabulating the amounts collected by the teachers and entrusted to the Accused, amounts charged by the Bookshop and the resultant discrepancy for the year 2017. The Prosecution reviewed the evidence and submitted a revised version, Exhibit E (Amended). The changes made and reflected in Exhibit E (Amended) were:

> (i)     The number of students from whom the monies were collected for the class of 1E2 was reduced from 35 to 34. As such, the total amount collected for 1E2 was reduced from $1,575 to $1,530. This was a reduction of $45 and the reduction was based on the evidence of Wong Weilan, Mars (“PW24 Wong”).[^75] During cross-examination, PW24 Wong clarified that she had only collected $1530, as opposed to $1575 that was written on the booklist.[^76]

> Arising from the change made in (i) above, the corresponding figures for the total amount collected, the total discrepancy and the total amount entrusted to the Accused were reduced.

> (ii)     The names of the teachers for classes 1T1 SBB, 1T1 non-SBB and 2E3. No changes were made in respect of the sums of monies involved for these classes.

82     As I was satisfied that Exhibit E (Amended) accurately reflected the evidence borne out in the course of the trial, I found that a total of $37,815.50 was collected across 31 classes in 2017.

83     The evidence revealed that the sums of $585 and $1225 collected by Mr Syed Muhammad Ali Aljunied (“PW20 Aljunied”) and Ms Asvinder Kaur (“PW21 Kaur”) respectively had not been handed over to the Accused when she was arrested on 7 April 2017.[^77] The said sums were therefore correctly excluded by the Prosecution in their case against the Accused in respect of the 2nd Charge. In Exhibit E (Amended), the Prosecution reflected the exclusion of these two sums of monies. Therefore, by excluding these two sums from the total amount collected (_ie_ $37,815.50), I found that a of $36,005.50 was entrusted to the Accused in 2017.

#### Sums paid to the bookshop and the resultant surplus

84     I now move on to the issue of how much money was paid to the Bookshop. It was undisputed that there was a surplus, which meant that the Accused had collected more than was necessary to pay the Bookshop.[^78] The Accused was aware since April 2016 that there was a surplus after she had paid monies to the Bookshop. The contested issue was how much the surplus amounted to in 2016 and 2017. In making my decision, I considered the evidence of PW9 Cheng in relation to the amounts the Bookshop had charged the Accused. Invoices were adduced in Court which I accepted as reliable evidence of the amounts paid to the Bookshop.[^79]

85     The main thrust of the Defence’s case was that the Accused had paid more to the Bookshop than was reflected in the invoices adduced in Court. There were two parts to this argument.

> (a)     Firstly, the Defence submitted that the invoices adduced in Court did not accurately capture the sum of monies paid for the relevant transactions. The Defence relied on the fact that a number of these invoices were not signed to suggest that higher amounts could have been paid that what was stated on the invoice.[^80] I rejected the Defence’s submission. PW9 Cheng’s evidence was consistent and clear as to her protocol when it came to receiving monies from the Accused – the monies would be passed to her in an envelope which she would open for counting and cross-referencing against the relevant invoice that she had issued.[^81] She would then indicate ‘Paid’ or ‘Okay’ on the invoice or the envelope on which she had received the monies.[^82] Although there were several invoices that did not bear any signatures or acknowledgement of payment, I accepted that it could have been due to oversight on PW9 Cheng’s part in the documentation aspect, but not the collection aspect. PW9 Cheng also testified multiple times that there were no other invoices that were unaccounted for.[^83] I had no doubt that the Accused only paid PW9 Cheng the amounts stated on the invoices. The Defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt that the Accused had paid more than that stated on the invoices.

> (b)     Secondly, beyond the invoices adduced in Court, the Defence submitted that there were “_many invoices which were paid for and have not been taken into account_”.[^84] Again, I rejected this submission. As previously noted at \[77\], the Accused was given several opportunities in the course of the investigations to clarify the figures prepared by the Prosecution. The Accused in fact took the opportunity during the recording of Exhibit P73 to mention one such invoice that was not included in the calculation. The Accused was even able to point to the specific invoice number to substantiate her claim.[^85] Accordingly, amendments were made, and the relevant invoice was adduced as evidence.[^86] I was also mindful the school had also put in the effort to ensure that these additional invoices were procured and taken into account.[^87] For example, the invoice in Exhibit D5 was taken into account after the Accused raised its existence in her statement in Exhibit P73.[^88] However, the Defence thereafter claimed that there were _other_ invoices that had not been accounted for. This was only raised for the first time during trial. Unfortunately, the Defence did not point to any specific invoices unlike what was done previously. In my assessment, the bare allegation of the Accused was insufficient to shift the burden of proof on her part to show the existence of these _other_ invoices.

86     In my deliberation, I took into account that the Accused had voluntarily made restitution of a sum of $34,304.80. This was indicative that the Accused had accepted that the total surplus across both Charges were at least that amount (as at that stage of the investigation). At trial, the Accused explained that she had merely paid whatever sum was unaccounted for because she did not know how much money was collected.[^89] She had also alleged that she was threatened to do so, but as I had found at the end of the ancillary hearing, there was no such threat, or oppression, inducement or promise for that matter. She had clearly shown herself to be diligent and conscientious when it came to disputing the sums as she had done in Exhibits P72 and P73 (discussed at \[77\] above). In my assessment, I found that the Accused would not have agreed to paying $34,304.80 if she had not agreed with the calculations involved. As such, I did not accept the Accused’s explanation.

87     Accordingly, I found that all the invoices adduced in Court were accurate and fully reflective of the sums paid to the Bookshop.

##### (1)    In relation to the 1st Charge: Amount paid between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 and the resultant surplus

88     I found that a total of $13,309.80 was paid to the Bookshop in 2016.[^90] Given that a sum of $34,937.20 was collected by the Accused in 2016 (see above at \[79\]), I found that there was a surplus of $21,627.40 for 2016.

##### (2)    In relation to the 2nd Charge: Amount paid between 1 January 2017 and 7 April 2017 and the resultant surplus

89     I found that a total of $17,041.20 was paid to the Bookshop in 2017. Given that a sum of $36,005.50 was collected by the Accused in 2017 (see above at \[83\]), I found that there was a surplus of $18,964.30. The 2nd Charge was thus amended accordingly.

#### Whether the Accused had misappropriated the surplus

90     I now turn to the definition of ‘misappropriation’. Misappropriation means “_to set apart or assign to the wrong person or wrong use_”: _Tan Tze Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 876</span> (“_Tan Tze Chye_”).

91     In order to determine whether the monies, or the surplus specifically, were set apart or assigned to the wrong person or wrong use, it is necessary to state _who_ the monies rightfully belonged to and _what_ the monies were to be used for. It was undisputed in this case that the monies rightfully belonged to the students, and that the monies were to be used to pay for the ExCEL packages only.

92     After reviewing the evidence, I found that the Accused had misappropriated the sums of $21,627.40 and $18,964.30 by assigning them to the purchase of stationeries and assessment books and her own personal use – _ie_ assigning the said surplus to the wrong use. The Defence did not adduce evidence to account for the amount spent to purchase the stationeries and assessment books, and the amounts use by the Accused personally. As such, I made no attempt to surmise the exact proportion of the surplus that was spent on either purpose.

93     I now turn to the specific issues before me.

##### (1)   Whether the Accused assigned the surplus to the purchase of stationeries and assessment books

94     The Defence’s case was that the Accused had spent the entirety of the surplus on buying stationery and books for the students of WGS.[^91] This was consistently put forward by the Accused from her very first statement in Exhibit P52[^92] to her evidence in cross-examination during the trial.[^93] To this end, the Defence had produced a series of photographs in Exhibit D3 showing the items the Accused had claimed to have purchased in her cubicle. Exhibit D3 was taken on 5 December 2017. The photographs showed numerous boxes of stationery such as coloured markers, sharpeners, and acrylic paint. The photographs also showed tall stacks of assessment books, foolscap paper, and a few boxes of English games. These items did not appear in the photographs tendered by the Prosecution, which were taken by PW6 Goh on 7 April 2017 when the Accused was arrested.[^94] In light of Exhibit D3, I had to consider whether these items were already present in the Accused’s cubicle on 7 April 2017. If so, that would corroborate the submission that the Accused had used the surplus to buy the stationery and assessment books. I considered the following evidence from parties:

> (a)     The boxes of stationery were stacked in front of a bookcase which had previously appeared unblocked on 7 April 2017 when photographs were taken[^95]. The Accused’s evidence in this regard was that these boxes were initially on top of her cupboards and that they were brought down sometime after 7 April 2017.[^96] The Accused believed that the photographs taken by PW6 Goh would have had captured the boxes on top of the cupboards. In her words, “_Ms. Goh I saw backing up, backing up to take the whole picture of the cubicle. So, I was assuming that she took the big picture of my office_”.[^97]

> (b)     The Prosecution suggested to the Accused during cross-examination that she had purchased the stationery and put them in her cubicle sometime after 7 April 2017 after the raid, or that in the alternative, someone had purchased the items and put them there.[^98] The Accused denied this vehemently. The Accused had testified that between 7 April 2017 and 5 December 2017, she was only allowed to go back into the school three times after her arrest.[^99] This was not challenged by the Prosecution.[^100]

> (c)     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s evidence had evolved since the start of the investigations up until she was called to the stand. In her statements to MOE and to the Police, the Accused had stated that the surplus was spent on stationery and assessment books.[^101] It was only during trial that the Accused raised, for the first time, that the surplus was also spent on “_teaching materials and resources and English games_”[^102] and a portable radio for her teachers to conduct listening comprehension.[^103] All this was not mentioned in any of the Accused’s investigation statements. The Accused was also unable to produce any receipts to support her claim.

95     Having carefully considered the evidence, I found that the Accused had indeed spent some of the surplus purchasing stationeries and assessment books for the use of students and teachers. Although the Accused’s evidence came out in bits and pieces, they were ultimately consistent with her account from the very beginning of the investigation that she had spent a portion of the surplus on buying stationery and assessment books. Insofar as she had failed to mention English games and the portable radio at an earlier point in time, I found that these were still largely consistent with her defence. I did not think that the Accused’s failure to exhaustively state what she had bought was fatal to her case. Nonetheless, I did not accept her defence that she had used the entirety of the surplus to purchase the stationeries and assessment books. In her investigation statements, she had admitted to assigning some of her surplus for her personal use.

96     I agreed with the Defence that the Prosecution’s suggestions that the items were placed in her cubicle placed after 7 April 2017 were not borne out by the evidence. In my assessment, it was unlikely that the Accused could have brought the items to the cubicle herself, given that she only had the opportunity on three occasions to return to the school, which included the event of 8 April 2017 where she was accompanied to the school under the supervision of police officers. Further, I accepted the Accused’s evidence that she could not have carried all the items up to her cubicle without any help or without being seen. In any event, the Prosecution did not adduce any evidence to rebut the Defence in this aspect of the case. I thus rejected the Prosecution’s submissions.

97     Accordingly, I found that the Accused had misappropriated the surplus by assigning some of it to purchase the stationeries and assessment books. As mentioned in \[90\] above, misappropriation is made out if the surplus had been set apart or assigned to the wrong person or wrong use. In was clear to me that any surplus sum collected ought to be returned to each student. As an example, the purchase of assessment books for Secondary Four students (_eg_ Exhibit P86 and P88) would have utilised parts of the collection of monies from other levels. It has to be inferred that the students from other levels did not give their consent for the surplus from their payment to be used for such a purpose. The use of the monies for a purpose beyond the purchase of the ExCEL packages constituted wrong use and I made my finding accordingly.

##### (2)   Whether the Accused assigned the surplus to her personal use

98     The Accused’s stance at trial was that she did not use any of the surplus for her own personal expenses. However, she had admitted to doing so in her statement in Exhibit P69. This is the same statement that was challenged in the ancillary hearing (discussed at \[34\] above), and which I had determined to have been given voluntarily. In the statement, the Accused admitted that “_decided to keep the money to \[her\]self_”[^104] because she found it to be a “_hassle_” to return the surplus back to the students. She would “_use \[the surplus\] to buy other assessment books for the students in the mid of the year. And whatever that remains from the balance at the end of the year \[she would\] keep it for \[her\]self_”[^105] and spend it on expenses “_like food and etc_”.[^106] When the Accused was eventually charged on 31 October 2017, she had further stated that “_the money that I took are not solely for myself_”.[^107] In cross-examination, the Accused explained that what she meant by “_not solely for myself_” was that she had also used the stationery for her own classroom teaching.[^108] This explanation was however not captured in her cautioned statements in Exhibits P74 and P75. The Prosecution therefore submitted that this explanation was an afterthought. Having reviewed the evidence, I agreed that the explanation was an afterthought designed to salvage what would otherwise be a damning admission. For avoidance of doubt, the Defence had not challenged the admissibility of Exhibits P74 and P75 and I accorded full weight to these statements.

99     I therefore found that the Accused had also used a portion of the surplus to pay for her own personal expenses. Accordingly, this amounted to applying the surplus to the wrong use and I found that the Accused had misappropriated the surplus in this regard.

#### Whether the Accused had dishonest intention in misappropriating the surplus

100    The final issue before me was whether there was a dishonest intention on the Accused’s part in misappropriating the surplus. This is a crucial element that the Prosecution must show: _Tan Tze Chye_ at \[37\].

101    There was no doubt that there was dishonest intention on the part of the Accused when she used some of the surplus for her own personal expenses as it was clearly for personal gain.

102    I focus instead on whether there was dishonesty in using the surplus to pay for the stationeries and assessment books. The Defence argued that the Accused had misapplied the money in good faith, believing that the purchase of the stationeries and assessment books would be beneficial to the students. In this regard, the Defence was essentially arguing that the Accused did not know that using the surplus to buy the stationeries and assessment books instead of returning the surplus to the students would have caused wrongful loss to the students. The Defence relied on illustration (d) of s 405 Penal Code to argue that the Accused should only be exposed to civil and not criminal liability as the Accused had purchased the teaching material in good faith. The illustration reads:

> (d)    But if A, in the last illustration, not dishonestly, but in good faith, believing that it will be more for Z’s advantage to hold shares in the Bank X, disobeys Z’s directions, and buys shares in the Bank X for Z, instead of buying Government securities, here, though Z should suffer loss and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A on account of that loss, yet A, not having acted dishonestly, has not committed criminal breach of trust.

103    The statutory definition of ‘dishonestly’ is found at section 24 of the Penal Code which reads:

> “Dishonestly”

> 24.    Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

104    In _Ang Teck Hwa v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] SLR(R) 513</span>, the High Court held that “\[t\]o intend a wrongful gain or loss requires that one knows the gain or loss is wrongful” (at \[36\]).

##### (1)   Whether the Accused had good faith in purchasing the teaching materials

105    I first deal with the Defence’s argument of good faith. I rejected the Defence’s submission that the Accused had believed in good faith that the teaching material would be beneficial to the students. My reasons are as follows:

> (a)     The Accused had admitted that it was not right to use the student’s monies to purchase the stationeries and assessment books.[^109]

> (b)     The Accused had essentially allowed a repeat of events in 2017 _even after_ knowing that the previous method of collection resulted in a surplus. The Accused had admitted that she realised there was a surplus in April 2016.[^110] However, nothing was done to ensure that there was no repeat of events.

> (c)     I also had regard to Exhibit P69 where she stated that she did not tell her husband about the surplus because she did not want him to worry.[^111] This, to me, indicated that the Accused did not have good faith in retaining the surplus. If the Accused had truly thought in good faith that it was alright for her to retain the surplus and spend it on teaching material, there would be no reason for her to think that her husband would worry about her. I also noted that the Accused did not tell anyone else, including her colleagues or superiors, of the existence of the surplus.

106    I therefore rejected the Defence’s case that the Accused had acted in good faith in using the surplus to purchase the stationeries and assessment books.

##### (2)   Whether the Accused had dishonest intention in purchasing the teaching materials

107    I now turn to whether the Accused dishonestly used the surplus to purchase the teaching material. For the reasons stated below, I found that the Accused dishonestly intended to misappropriate the surplus:

> (a)     I did not accept the Accused’s justification that it was too troublesome to return the surplus to the students.[^112] I was mindful that the Accused had testified repeatedly that she did not know how much money was collected from the students.[^113] This was not a justifiable excuse. The collection of the monies was based on each class list and the invoices submitted by PW9 Cheng were also on a per class basis. Any surplus meant for the student could have been worked out by the relevant class teachers. The Accused had not even once attempted to go through this process to effect the returns of the surplus to the students. Neither did she tell her colleagues or superiors about the existence of this surplus. Accordingly, I found that the Accused was dishonest and had intended to cause wrongful loss to the students.

> (b)     I also found that the Accused had intended to make personal gain by using the monies to buy teaching material that she would have otherwise used her own money to buy. In this regard, I took into account the Accused’s admission that prior to 2016, teachers including herself would spend their own money on buying additional stationery for students when needed.[^114] Therefore, by using the surplus to buy the stationeries, the Accused had made a wrongful gain on her end.

> (c)     I accepted the testimonies of PW8 Chan and PW9 Cheng that the Accused had told PW9 Cheng not to pass the invoices to PW8 Chan when the latter requested to view the invoices.[^115] In my assessment, this was an attempt on the Accused’s part to conceal her wrongdoing.

> (d)     I also found that the Accused had admitted to her friend and ex-colleague, Ms Tan Siew Ee Jocelyn (“PW22 Tan”) that “_greed_” had brought her into her current situation.[^116] PW22 Tan then relayed this to another teacher, Ms Nora Binte Awang (“PW25 Nora”). I pause to note that at trial, PW22 testified that the Accused had sent her a single word “_greed_” whereas PW25 Nora testified that PW22 Tan had told her the Accused said, “_I got greedy_”.[^117] The Defence relied on this inconsistency to make the argument that no such admission took place between the Accused and PS22. I considered that PW22 Tan and PW25 Nora were candid and consistent in giving their testimonies. Insofar as there were minor inconsistencies as to what the Accused’s admission was, I found that the substance of the admission was corroborated. I therefore accepted that the conversation had happened. In the circumstances, I placed due weight in finding that the Accused had the requisite dishonest intention.

108    I therefore found that the Accused had a dishonest intention in misappropriating the surplus.

109    I pause to refer to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tham See Wai Sylvia_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 514</span> (“_Sylvia Tham_”) that the Defence had cited for the proposition that the Accused, in not having acted dishonestly, would not be liable to criminal prosecution. As I have found that the Accused had acted dishonestly, it followed that _Sylvia Tham_ was not relevant. In any case, I opined that _Sylvia Tham_ may be distinguished from the present case as the court in _Sylvia Tham_ had placed significant weight on the fact that there was no credible evidence of dubious conduct (at \[47\]) or attempt at concealment (at \[63\]). In our present case, however, I found the Accused’s failure to mention the existence of the surplus to any of her colleagues, and her attempt at preventing PW9 Cheng from passing the invoices to PW8 Chan, amounted to dubious conduct.

#### Conclusion on the Charges

110    I was satisfied that the Prosecution had established all the elements required for the offences of criminal breach of trust. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted her on both Charges.

## Appeal Against Sentence

## **_Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span>

111    Before hearing the parties’ submissions on sentence, I had directed them to consider the judgment of Chan Seng Onn J in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span> (“_Ewe Pang Kooi_”) where Chan J, after reviewing numerous case precedents on s 409 of the Penal Code, adopted a mathematical formula to calculate the indicative starting points for imprisonment terms based on the quantum misappropriated. I invited the parties to address me on _Ewe Pang Kooi_ and its impact on their sentencing submissions.

112    The Prosecution and the Defence chose not to rely on _Ewe Pang Kooi_.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

113    In the Prosecution’s assessment, the appropriate sentence should be at least 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge with both sentences to run consecutively. The Prosecution thus sought an aggregate sentence of at least 24 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the foremost sentencing consideration was general deterrence given the significant financial harm caused as well as harm to public confidence in the teaching service.[^118]

#### Aggravating and Mitigating Factors considered by Prosecution

114    In support of its argument for the imposition of a high imprisonment term, the Prosecution highlighted the following five aggravating factors:

> (a)     Firstly, there was a significant amount of trust reposed in the Accused. The Accused oversaw the collection process of the monies and dealt with the Bookshop in relation to payment matters. By keeping the existence of the Surplus a secret and misappropriating it, the Accused had exploited this trust.[^119]

> (b)     Secondly, public confidence in the teaching service would inevitably suffer as a result of the Accused’s actions.[^120] The damage to the public confidence was underscored by the Accused’s senior position and the significant degree of trust reposed in her.[^121] Offences against public institutions amounted to an assault on the common weal and undermined good administration. It is worse when such assaults came from within the organisation: _Public Prosecutor v Koh Seah Wee_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 292</span> at \[57\].[^122]

> (c)     Thirdly, the Accused’s offending was purposeful and deliberate. The misappropriation occurred over a period of one year and four months – or two school years as the Prosecution put it – and Accused did not at any time inform anyone of the existence of the surplus despite learning about it in 2016. The fact that the Accused continued to direct the teachers in 2017 to collect the monies according to the (higher) booklist prices indicated that the Accused’s offences were premeditated.[^123] Further, the Accused had actively sought to keep her actions from coming to light by attempting to prevent PW8 Chan from obtaining a copy of the invoices from PW9 Cheng.[^124] The Prosecution stopped short of labelling the commission of the offences as sophisticated, but emphasised that the Accused’s conduct in concealing her actions nonetheless reflected a higher degree of culpability and a degree of purposefulness.[^125]

> (d)     Fourthly, the Accused’s offending was motivated by greed. The Prosecution cited the case of _Lim Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span>[^126] where the High Court opined in relation to Criminal Breach of Trust offences that “_all other things being equal, it is a more deplorable breach for a person in a position of trust to apply the entrusted properties purely for personal gain than to have applied it for an alternative unauthorised purpose_” (at \[56\]). In the present case, the Accused had admitted to PW22 Tan that it was “_greed_” that had gotten her into the present situation, and that she had used at least part of the surplus for her personal use.[^127]

> (e)     Fifthly, the Accused had shown no remorse throughout the proceedings. While the Prosecution acknowledged the Accused’s right to claim trial, it highlighted that the Court is entitled to take the manner in which the Accused had conducted her defence in determining the sentence to be passed on her: _Wan Kim Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 410</span> at \[27\]. The Accused’s approach in conducting her defence was simply to blame everyone else for her conduct, such as blaming PW1 Chee for the lack of a proper system regarding the collection of monies and the teachers for not counting the monies beforehand.[^128] She also made a number of unsubstantiated allegations against the investigation officers which the Defence did not put across during cross-examination of the relevant witnesses. This was an aggravating factor: _Lewis Christine v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 131</span> at \[38\]. The Prosecution further noted that even at the mitigation stage, the Accused continued to apportion blame to PW9 Cheng for lowering the prices in the invoice.[^129]

115    With respect to the mitigating factors, the Prosecution acknowledged that full restitution had been made, and that the economic harm suffered by the students had therefore been substantially reduced.[^130] However, the Prosecution urged this Court not to regard the restitution as evidence of remorse, as the Accused had only made restitution so that she would not be prosecuted.[^131]

116    The Prosecution also submitted that no mitigating weight should be accorded to the Accused’s lack of antecedents for two reasons:

> (a)     First, the Accused had attained her significant position of trust and authority _as a result_ of her previous clean record. The Accused therefore could not claim the benefit of her unblemished record: _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span> at \[23\].[^132]

> (b)     Secondly, the offences were committed over a substantial period of time with substantial premeditation, and therefore the Accused cannot be treated as a true first offender: _Public Prosecutor v Leong Wai Nam_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 284</span> at \[31\].

#### Sentencing Precedents cited by the Prosecution

117    The Prosecution brought to my attention six case precedents of which four of them were unreported. Sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little weight, if any, because they are unreasoned. Such decisions had to be approached with caution: see _Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[13(b)\] and _Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\]. I did not place any weight on the four unreported cases.

118    In respect of the two reported cases, I have set out their case summarises below:

> (a)      _Public Prosecutor v Leong Wai Nam_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 284</span>:[^133]

>> The offender was an advocate and solicitor who had committed criminal breach of trust of legal fees paid to him by his clients. The offender had also committed cheating offences under s 420 of the Penal Code. The offender pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, an offence under s 409 of the Penal Code involving a sum of $48,000 and was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the sentence was enhanced to 36 months’ imprisonment. The offender had made partial restitution of $25,000 out of the total sum of $93,370.38 involved in the charges.

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 165</span>:[^134]

>> The offender was a National Serviceman at the Found and Unclaimed Property Office (“FUPO”) of the Singapore Police Force. The offender’s duties were to collect lost-and-found properties at various police divisions and bring them back to FUPO. The offender misappropriated $893.75 in cash and used them to pay the insurance premium for his car. The offender was convicted after an 18-day trial and was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. On appeal, the sentence was enhanced to six months’ imprisonment.

119    The Prosecution acknowledged that some of the precedents cited involved law enforcement officers as the offenders and they were generally treated more severely.[^135] To that end, the Prosecution had calibrated the sentence downwards to arrive at 12 months’ imprisonment per charge.

#### Overall Submission on Sentence by Prosecution

120    The Prosecution submitted that both sentences ought to run consecutively as the two charges did not form part of the same transaction. They were committed in respect of different victims and were not proximate in time, having been committed in two separate years.[^136]

121    The Prosecution submitted that a global sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment would not be crushing and was appropriate compared to the sentencing precedents, in particular _Leong Wai Nam_.[^137]

### Defence’s Plea-in-Mitigation and Address on Sentence

#### Mitigating Factors raised by Defence

122    The Defence argued that there were several mitigating factors justifying the imposition of a lenient sentence:

123    Firstly, the Accused was untraced.[^138]

124    Secondly, the Accused was a caring teacher who displayed exemplary character. The Defence highlighted several awards the Accused had obtained such as the Excellent Service Award 2011 as well as the Caring Teacher Award 2016.[^139] The Defence also adduced notes written by the Accused’s students demonstrating that she was a caring teacher.[^140]

125    Thirdly, there was no premeditation on the Accused’s part. I understood this argument to comprise the following:

> (a)     The Accused was overworked as she had to undertake multiple tasks outside her normal teaching curriculum. The Accused worked under heavy stress in order to manage these multiple duties.[^141]

> (b)     As WGS did not have a proper system of collection and disbursement of monies from students, the monies were given to the Accused haphazardly.[^142]

> (c)     The surplus only arose because PW9 Cheng had reduced the prices for the ExCEL Packages without informing the Accused.[^143] There was no positive scheme by the Accused to collect more monies than was charged by the Bookshop, and the Accused had failed to keep proper accounts of the monies received and paid to the Bookshop as she was overworked.[^144]

126    Fourthly, there was no real loss to the students because all the students had received the ExCEL Packages for which the monies had been collected.[^145]

127    Fifthly, the Accused was not “totally dishonest” as she had used some of the surplus to buy books and stationeries for the students and teachers’ use.[^146]

128    Sixthly, the Accused had fully cooperated with the authorities and had made restitution of $34,304.80 even before she was charged.[^147]

129    Lastly, the Defence submitted that the Accused deeply regretted what she had done because the conviction would mean the end of her career and loss of salary of a substantial amount of money each.[^148]

130    The Defence further highlighted that the Accused’s choice to claim trial should not be treated as an aggravating factor as this would give rise to the appearance that offenders who claim trial are being penalised for exercising their constitutional right to claim trial: _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span>; <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 36</span>.[^149] The Defence raised the issue that the Prosecution had increased the number of witnesses at every tranche which meant that the Accused was subjected to a long drawn-out trial that spanned two years.[^150]

#### Sentencing Precedents cited by Defence

131    Several sentencing precedents were cited by the Defence and annexed to the Mitigation Plea in the form of newspaper clippings. Again, these are unreported decisions with grounds of decision issued by the trial judge. I gave no weights to the cases cited by the Defence (see also \[117\] above).

132    There was yet another reason to not to rely on the case precedents cited by the Defence. As correctly pointed out by the Prosecution, these cases dealt with sentencing issues for offences either under s 406 or s 408 of the Penal Code. In the present case, we were dealing with two charges under s 409 of the Penal Code.

#### Overall Submission on Sentence by Defence

133    The Defence ultimately left the sentencing to the discretion of the Court, but urged the Court to have the sentences for the two charges run concurrently as a consecutive sentence would be crushing on the Accused.[^151]

### Court’s Decision on Sentence

#### Applicable sentencing principles

134    The Accused had committed the offences out of greed and to benefit herself. She had also abused the trust reposed in her as a teacher and as a HOD. I agreed with the Prosecution the Accused had done a disservice to MOE and in a wider context, the education service. In my judgment, the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence were applicable to the present case.

135    Specific deterrence was warranted as the offences show that the Accused’s criminal conduct was not a momentary aberration. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\].

136    It is not uncommon that teachers are often called upon to collect monies from students for various activities or for purchases of school yearbook, class photographs, etc. The public is entitled to expect the utmost care and accountability when teachers handle collection of monies from students. There was a breach of the trust reposed in the Accused in her capacity as a teacher and as a HOD. In my judgment, this calls for general deterrence. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the class or general public by making an example of a particular offender. Deterrence is generally not displaced as an applicable sentencing consideration even where an offender demonstrates that he was labouring under familial and financial hardships during the commission of the offence: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[24\] – \[25\], \[27\] and \[29\].

137    Bearing the above in mind, I proceeded to determine the appropriate sentence for the Accused. I followed the two-step approach evinced in _Mohammad Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>. At the first step, I considered the appropriate sentence for each charge, taking into the aggravating and mitigating factors. At the second step, in determining whether the sentences should run concurrently or consecutively, I had regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle.

#### Sentences for individual charges

138    In _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span>, the court held that:

> In an offence like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court.

139    In _Ewe Pang Kooi_, the court held:

> Hence, in criminal breach of trust offences, the key indicator of the harm perpetrated as well as the culpability of the offender is the amount misappropriated. After this is determined, a preliminary sentence may be derived, following which, discounts or uplifts to the preliminary may be allowed in the particular case depending on the aggravating and mitigating factors of each case.

140    The Prosecution and Defence were dismissive of _Ewe Pang Kooi_ even though _Ewe Pang_ Kooi dealt with the offence under s 409 of the Penal Code, the very same offence that the Accused had been convicted.

141    The Prosecution submitted that _Ewe Pang Kooi_ was of limited assistance as it involved large sums of monies and the charges involved a mixture under the 1985 and 2008 editions of the Penal Code. Nevertheless, having looked at _Ewe Pang Kooi_, the Prosecution was of the opinion that their submission was not disproportionate or manifestly excessive.[^152] I believed the Prosecution had looked at the overall amount involved and thus failed to notice the sums involved in the individual charges. Some of the charges in _Ewe Pang Kooi_ involved sums of $3,000, $5,000 and $10,000. In respect of charges framed under the 2008 Rev Ed of the Penal Code, the smaller amounts involved were $10,000 and $25,000.

142    The Defence similarly did not seek to rely on _Ewe Pang Kooi_, preferring instead to rely on sentencing principles instead of curves and graphs and mathematical formulae.[^153]

143    The decision in _Ewe Pang Kooi_ was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 757</span>; <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 13</span>). Absent any criticism or overruling of _Ewe Pang Kooi_ by the Court of Appeal, _Ewe Pang Kooi_ remains good law in setting the indicative sentencing bands based on the amount misappropriated for the offence under s 409 of the Penal Code. I therefore followed _Ewe Pang Kooi._

##### (1)   The Starting Indicative Sentence

144    In this regard, the following four individual sentences from _Ewe Pang Kooi_ were instructive:

145    In _Ewe Pang Kooi_, one of the reasons given by the court for setting a 15% discount was the fact that the offender had not disputed the facts in court and thereby saving the investigative authorities and the court a significant amount of time and resources. The same cannot be said of the Accused. She had claimed trial and put the Prosecution to strict proof such that almost the entire group of teachers in WGS’s English Department had to be called to testify in this case. The 15% discount was therefore not applicable to the present case.

146    In the present case, the amount misappropriated in the two charges were $21,627.40 and $18,964.30. Using _Ewe Pang Kooi’s_ charges as set out in \[144\] above, the starting indicative sentence should be from nine to 13 months’ imprisonment. In my assessment, the appropriate starting indicative sentence for the present was eleven months’ imprisonment.

##### (2)   Calibrating the aggravating and mitigating factors

147    The Prosecution highlighted five aggravating factors for my consideration (see \[114\] above).

148    Turning to the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, I found that the Accused was a first-time offender.

149    The Accused’s absence of previous criminal antecedent is a neutral factor. It is not necessarily positive evidence of good character and should not be taken as mitigating (see _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> at \[65\]). That said, I did give some weight to the accolades she had received as a teacher (see \[124\] above).

150    I also took into account that restitution has been made. I also accepted the Defence’s evidence that she had used some of the money misappropriated to buy books and stationery (see Exhibit D23 at pages 6 to 22) for use by the students and teachers.

151    In my assessment, the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors slightly and an uplift of one month’s imprisonment on each charge was warranted.

##### (3)   Individual sentences

152    The individual sentences reached, at this stage of my deliberation, was 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge.

#### Global Sentence

153    The Prosecution submitted that the sentences for both charges should run consecutively. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions in its entirety and I have nothing further to add to it.

154    At this stage, the preliminary global sentence added up to 24 months’ imprisonment. I took a step back and reviewed it. I went back to _Ewe Pang Kooi_ and I observed the following:

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.94%"> <col width="24.8%"> <col width="31.16%"> <col width="23.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>1985 or 2008 Rev Ed</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount Misappropriated</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Preliminary sentence (months)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36<sup>th</sup> charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2008 Rev Ed</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$60,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">19.464</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">38<sup>th</sup> charge</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2008 Rev Ed</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$40,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">16.3524</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

155    From the above, it was evident to me that a total sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment was excessive. I then revised the individual sentences and adjusted them to nine months’ imprisonment per charge. However, I maintained my order that both sentences ought to run consecutively.

156    In conclusion, I imposed a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment on each charge with both sentences to run consecutively making an aggregate sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment.

* * *

[^1]: At the beginning of the trial, the Prosecution stated that the amount collected for 2017 was $36,050.50. At the concluding stage of the trial, a re-calculation and checking of the evidence by the Prosecution revealed that the correct amount should be $36,005.50, a discrepancy of $45.

[^2]: At the beginning of the trial, the Prosecution stated that the amount misappropriated was $19,009.30. In view of the discrepancy in the amount collected for 2017 (see footnote 1), a consequential amendment of the amount misappropriated was required. The correct amount was $18,964.30.
