Criminal Law – Offences – Securities and Futures Act – Market rigging

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9849/2020/01.\]

23 December 2020

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The Accused, Ms Lau Wan Heng, pleaded guilty to one charge under section 197(1A)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289) (“the Act”) for engaging in a course of conduct which she knew would be likely to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading in shares issued by Koyo International Ltd (“marking rigging charge”). The Accused also pleaded guilty to another 12 charges under section 201(b) of the Act, in connection with the trading of shares issued by Koyo International Ltd, for indirectly engaging in a practice which was likely to operate as a deception upon the brokerages concerned (“deceptive practice charges”) . I sentenced the Accused to a global term of _20 months’ and 18 weeks’ imprisonment_.

2       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with the _sentence_ has filed an appeal. The Accused is currently on _bail pending appeal_.

3       I had issued brief oral grounds to explain my sentencing decision. These are available in the transcripts for 15 October 2020 at pages 1 to 6. I shall elaborate on the reasons for the sentence in these grounds.

## The Charges

4       The details of the market rigging charge under section 197(1A)(a) of the Act which the Accused pleaded guilty to were as follows:

>      DAC928628-2019

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime between 6 February 2015 and 15 January 2016, in Singapore, were engaged in a course of conduct, by controlling the trading of shares issued by Koyo International Ltd (“Koyo”) and traded on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange, through various trading accounts (as set out in **Annex A**), on the instructions of one Lin Eng Jue (“Lin”), which you knew would be likely to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading in Koyo shares, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 197(1A)(_a_) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”) punishable under section 204(1) of the SFA.

5       As for the 12 deceptive practice charges under section 201(b) of the Act, they were all similarly framed, save for the details relating to the period of offence, as well as the brokerage and trading account involved. As such, I shall set out in full the first of such charges which the Accused pleaded guilty to, followed by a table containing the salient details of each of the 12 charges for ease of reference:

>      DAC-929620-2019

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime between 19 October 2015 and 14 January 2016, in Singapore, were indirectly engaged in a practice which was likely to operate as a deception upon KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd (nka KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd) (the “Firm”), in connection with the trading of shares issued by Koyo International Ltd (“Koyo”) and traded on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange, by intentionally obtaining the account of one Chong Chin Eoo (“Chong”) (account no. XXX) (the “Account”) maintained with the Firm, for one Lin Eng Jue to instruct orders and trades in Koyo shares in, without the authorisation of the Firm, which was likely to deceive the Firm that the orders and trades in Koyo shares in the Account were instructed by Chong, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 201(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (“SFA”) punishable under section 204(1) of the SFA.

## Facts

6       The Accused admitted to the facts set out in the Statement of Facts and Annex A (“SOF”) without qualification:[^1]

>      **The accused**

> 1    The accused is Lau Wan Heng (“Janice”), a 62-year-old female Singaporean. At the material time, Janice was initially a broker and later a remisier with CGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“CIMB”).

> 2    The co-accused are as follows:

>> a.    Lin Eng Jue (“Andrew”), male, 43, Singaporean.

>> b.    Ang Wei Jie Simon (“Simon”), male, 30, Singaporean.

>> c.    Yeo An Lun (“Yeo”), male, 46, Singaporean.

>> d.    Chong Yew Mun Alan (“Alan”), male, 30, Singaporean. At the material time, Alan was employed by RHB Securities Singapore Pte Ltd (“RHB”), in the “e-brokering” team; Alan’s responsibilities included assisting Janice’s clients to open accounts with RHB and to execute trade in those accounts.

>> e.    Teo Boon Cheang (“Steven”), male, 51, Singaporean. At the material time, Steven was a remisier with KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd (“KGI”).

>> f.    Goh Qi Rui Rayson (“Rayson”), male, 35, Singaporean. At the material time, Rayson was a remisier with OCBC Securities Pte Ltd (“OSPL”).

>> g.    Koh Cheo Leng (“Koh”), female, 55, Singaporean.

> 3    Janice and the co-accused will hereafter be collectively referred to as the scheme members.

>      **Koyo International Ltd**

> 4    Koyo International Ltd (“Koyo”) is a Singapore-incorporated company whose shares have been listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) since 2009. Koyo is in the business of providing integrated mechanical and electrical engineering services to various industries, including construction, marine and oil and gas.

> 5    Between 12 August 2014 and 15 January 2016, approximately one-third of Koyo’s issued shares were floating (i.e. were available for trading by the public). The CEO of Koyo and/or his family held most of the remaining shares.

> 6    On 12 August 2014, Koyo’s market capitalisation was about $32 million.

>      **The scheme to manipulate the price of Koyo shares**

> 7    Between 12 August 2014 and 15 January 2016 (“the relevant period”), Andrew led a scheme to manipulate the price of Koyo shares. The purpose of the scheme was to create a false appearance as to the price of Koyo shares. On Andrew’s direction, the scheme members used various trading accounts under their control, to trade Koyo shares amongst one another, as well as other third parties trading on the market, and gradually pushed up the price at which Koyo shares were traded on the SGX.

> 8    Most of the trades conducted by the scheme members were on a “contra” basis. Contra trading involves buying shares without paying the full price of the shares upfront. Over the relevant period, the brokerage firms involved in the scheme permitted their accountholders to purchase shares without making full payment upfront; the brokerages generally required the accountholders to “settle” the trade (i.e. make payment for the shares purchased) within three days after the trade (known as the contra period). If the accountholder sold the shares before the end of the contra period, the buy and sell trades were offset. If the trades were profitable, the brokerage credited the profits to the account. However, if the trades incurred a loss, the accountholder had to pay the loss incurred to the brokerage.

>> a.    For example, assume that an accountholder purchases 100 shares of a company, X Ltd, at $1 per share, on Day 0. The accountholder will have three days to settle the trade, i.e. to pay his brokerage $100 for the purchase of the shares.

>> b.    If the accountholder sells the 100 shares of X Ltd on Day 3, which is within the contra period, the brokerage would offset the buy and sell trades. If the accountholder sells the sales at $1.10 per share, the brokerage would credit his trading account with the $10 profit earned. If the accountholder sells the shares at $0.90 per share, he would have to pay the loss of $10 to the brokerage.

> 9    The accounts used in the scheme were also subject to trading limits – i.e. a limit set by the brokerage on the total value of shares that could be purchased on a “contra” basis without the accountholder making payment for the shares purchased upfront.

> 10    The scheme members traded amongst accounts under their control – i.e. Koyo shares were sold by one trading account under the control of the scheme members, and purchased by another trading account also under the control of the scheme members (“cross trades”). The scheme members also traded with third parties – i.e. an account under the control of the scheme members bought Koyo shares from or sold Koyo shares to an account controlled by a member of the public who was not involved in the scheme. (“non-cross trades”) By buying and selling Koyo shares using the accounts under their control over the relevant period, at progressively higher prices, the scheme members pushed up the market price, and thereby created a false appearance as to the price of Koyo shares. Some of the strategies used by the scheme members included:

>> a.    For non-cross trades, the scheme members bought Koyo shares at a price that was generally higher than the rest of the market, by placing bids (i.e. the highest price at which a buyer is willing to purchase Koyo shares) that were higher than the rest of the market. For example, if the best bid price on a given day was $0.10, the scheme members would bid at a premium – $0.11 or $0.12 – which resulted in the trades matched at a price higher than was prevailing before the scheme members placed their premium bids, as sellers would want to sell at the highest price possible.

>> b.    For cross-trades, the scheme members would set ask prices that were generally higher than the rest of the market, through some of the accounts under their control. Concurrently, they would place matching bids that were likewise generally higher than the rest of the market, through other accounts under their control. This would make it likely that the bids and asks would be matched, and Koyo shares would be traded between two accounts that were both under the control of the scheme members, at a price higher than the last done price.

> 11    The manipulation scheme was conducted over three phases:

>> a.    In the initial phase, from August 2014 to February 2015, Andrew used trading accounts opened in his name, as well as the names of his wife, Koh and Yeo, to trade Koyo shares and push up their price. However, as these accounts had trading limits, Andrew needed more accounts for the scheme to continue.

>> b.    In the middle phase, between February 2015 and October 2015, Andrew obtained Janice’s assistance to procure more trading accounts. Janice convinced her existing clients at CIMB, as well as her family members who had trading accounts with CIMB and other brokerages, to let her use their trading accounts to trade Koyo shares. The individuals who provided their trading accounts were promised a commission of 10% from any profits made through their accounts, and that any losses incurred would be paid by the scheme members. These trading accounts were then used to trade Koyo shares on Andrew’s instructions, in pursuance of the scheme.

>> c.    For the scheme to continue, yet more trading accounts were needed. In the final phase, between October 2015 and January 2016, Janice obtained more trading accounts to be used in the scheme. Janice informed her clients that she was considering leaving CIMB and joining either RHB or KGI. She convinced her clients to open or reactivate trading accounts with the latter two brokerages. Janice also convinced her family members to open trading accounts with other brokerages. In this manner, Janice obtained even more trading accounts for use in the scheme. These accounts were then used to trade Koyo shares on Andrew’s instructions, in pursuance of the scheme.

> 12    Over the relevant period, the scheme members used in total 53 trading accounts, opened in the name of 15 individuals, with the following eight brokerage firms, to trade Koyo shares in order to push up the Koyo share price:

>> a.    KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd (KGI);

>> b.    CGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (CIMB);

>> c.    RHB Securities Singapore Pte Ltd (RHB);

>> d.    Philip Securities Pte Ltd (“PSPL”);

>> e.    OCBC Securities Pte Ltd (OSPL);

>> f.    Maybank Kim Eng Pte Ltd (“MBKE”);

>> g.    UOB Kay Hian Pte Ltd (“UOBKH”); and

>> h.    Lim & Tan Securities Pte Ltd (“L&T”)

>      **Market impact of the scheme**

>      _Impact on price_

> 13    During the relevant period, the Koyo share price progressively increased from a low of $0.16 on 12 August 2014 to a high of $0.40 on 7 and 14 January 2016, before closing at $0.34 on 15 January 2016.

> 14    The chart below shows the change in the Koyo share price over the relevant period:

![]([2020] SGDC 0293_Image/[2020] SGDC 0293_image1.png)

>      _Impact on volume_

> 15    Collectively, the trades performed through the 53 accounts involved in the scheme, during the relevant period, accounted for 66.71% of the buy volume and 65.80% of the sell volume. Cross trades between the 53 accounts represented 43.16% of the total market volume.

>      _Crash of the Koyo share price in January 2016_

> 16    On 15 January 2016 (Friday), SGX issued a trade with caution warning entitled “SGX urges caution when dealing in Koyo International Limited shares” (the “TWC”). SGX’s announcement stated that a “small group of individuals was responsible for 60% of the trading volume of Koyo \[between 26 Oct 2015 and 14 Jan 2016\], of which at least half of these trades were due to this group of individuals buying and selling among themselves.”

> 17    After the TWC was issued, the following Monday, 18 January 2016, Koyo’s shares price crashed by almost 84%, from $0.34 on 15 January 2016 to closing at $0.056 on 18 January 2016.

> 18    The market capitalisation of Koyo on 15 January 2016 was $72,075,022.12. On 18 January 2016, the market capitalisation had dropped to $13,934,175.45, a difference in excess of $58 million.

>      **Janice’s role in the scheme**

> 19    Sometime in January 2015, Janice was introduced to Andrew by the CEO of Koyo. Andrew informed Janice that he was a ‘market maker’ and asked her to assist in the scheme. He informed Janice of the following:

>> a.    He intended to trade in Koyo shares “to the tune of a few million dollars”.

>> b.    He was not able to open an account with CIMB, but asked Janice to procure nominee trading accounts for the reverse takeover exercise.

>> c.    Janice’s role was to execute his trading instructions for Koyo shares using her clients’ accounts (_ie_, the nominee accounts).

>> d.    The Koyo share price would increase and that her clients would profit in the process. The clients who provided their accounts were promised a commission of up to 10% from the trading profits, while any losses incurred in such accounts would be borne by Andrew.

>> e.    Andrew’s plan was for the Koyo share to reach a target price, in order for a potential reverse takeover to happen.

> 20    On or before 6 February 2015, Janice agreed to assist Andrew. Janice knew that by executing Koyo shares between the nominee accounts, it was likely to create a false appearance of active trading in Koyo shares.

> 21    During the middle phase of the scheme, Janice approached 9 of her clients at CIMB, and convinced them to allow her to use the following trading accounts to trade Koyo shares:

>> a.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Anna Chen Lu Jie (“Anna”);

>> b.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Chong Chin Foo (“Chong”);

>> c.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Chua Hong Kiang (“Chua”);

>> d.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Hee Soon Siang Perry (“Perry”);

>> e.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Heng Por Noi (“Heng”);

>> f.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Neo Yeo Seng (“Neo”);

>> g.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Tan Siew Hwa (“Tan”);

>> h.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Wang Ming Ming (“Wang”); and

>> i.    CIMB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Yoon Soon Seng (“Yoon”).

>     Between 6 February 2015 and 14 January 2016, on Andrew’s instructions, Janice performed trades in Koyo shares using the above nine CIMB trading accounts. Janice received a commission on each trade as trading representative in charge of the above accounts. From February to August 2015, Janice would also receive a further commission from Andrew from the resulting profits from the contra-trading. From September 2015 to January 2016, no commission was paid by Andrew and he also stopped paying for the contra losses.

> 22    She also convinced her brother, Low Wan Meng (“Low”), and his wife, Anna, to hand over the following three trading accounts to trade in Koyo shares:

>> a.    UOBKH trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Low;

>> b.    PSPL trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Anna; and

>> c.    OSPL trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Anna.

>     She would convey trading instructions from Andrew to Low, who would then execute the trades directly.

> 23    Sometime in August 2015, Janice was informed that CIMB intended to reduce the trading limits for Koyo trades in the nominee accounts, so as to reduce her clients’ exposure to the Koyo shares. In response to the restricted trading limits, Andrew instructed Janice to convince her existing CIMB clients to open new nominee accounts with KGI and RHB instead, which accounts were required to sustain the scheme and ‘continue with the churning activities’. In addition, Andrew advised Janice to ‘rope in more people’ into the scheme, as he believed that MAS would grow suspicious of Janice if majority of the Koyo trades were executed from accounts belonging to Janice’s clients.

> 24    Janice realised that the CIMB accounts were incurring significant contra-trading losses, and that Andrew stopped paying for such contra-losses incurred from September 2015 onwards. As CIMB were restricting her credit limits, she decided to leave CIMB, and join either KGI or RHB instead, depending on which brokerage firm was willing to offer her clients trading accounts with greater credit limit. Her main purpose of doing so was to contribute greater credit limits to the scheme. Between August 2015 and October 2015, to convince her clients to open additional accounts with other brokerage firms, she informed her clients that she was considering leaving CIMB, and joining either KGI or RHB instead. She requested her clients to open accounts with both KGI and RHB, in preparation of her joining either of those brokerage firms. With the exception of Low, the clients were informed that she was leaving CIMB because of “work issues”. They were not informed that the scheme to which they had contributed their CIMB accounts was running out of credit limits, and the real purpose of them opening RHB and KGI accounts was to contribute greater credit limits to the scheme. In fact, Janice neither left CIMB nor closed any of the surplus accounts. As a result of her representations, her CIMB clients opened or reactivated a total of nine KGI trading accounts and eight RHB trading accounts, as follows:

>> a.    KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Anna;

>> b.    KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Chong;

>> c.    KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Perry;

> 25    These 17 accounts were handed over to Andrew, allowing the latter and the scheme members to trade Koyo shares directly in the manner described below.

>> a.    In respect of the KGI accounts, Janice sought the assistance of one Gui Qi Xia Celestine (“Celestine”), an equity sales dealer with KGI, to execute the trades. Janice informed Celestine that she was moving from CIMB to KGI, but was unable to execute trades from the KGI accounts in the interim as her trading licence had yet to be transferred. As a result of Janice’s representations, Celestine agreed to assist her. Between 19 October and 14 December 2015, Celestine performed the Koyo trades in the KGI accounts on Andrew’s instructions, whose instructions were relayed to her by Janice or Simon. However, on 14 December 2015, Celestine declined to assist further as the KGI compliance team had started to monitor her Koyo trades. On or after 14 December 2015, Janice arranged for the Koyo trades placed from the KGI accounts to be executed by Alan instead.

>> b.    In respect of the RHB trading accounts, between 26 October 2015 and 15 January 2016, Alan performed the Koyo trades in the RHB accounts on Andrew’s instructions, whose instructions were relayed to him by Janice or Simon, or Andrew himself.

>> c.    A number of accountholders were not aware and did not consent to Celestine, Alan or any other third-party trading on their behalf.

> 26    In addition, to procure more trading accounts to be used for the scheme, Janice sought assistance from her brother, Low, who handed over the following two accounts opened in his name to Janice:

>> a.    L&T trading account (account no. XXX); and

>> b.    PSPL trading account (account no. XXX).

>     The trades in these two accounts were performed either by Alan or Low himself, on the instructions of Andrew (either directly or conveyed indirectly through Alan, Janice or Simon).

> 27    Janice’s involvement as detailed above is summarised at Annex A.

> 28    In addition, Janice also assisted Andrew with the distribution of profits in the various trading accounts held by Low or Anna and the CIMB trading accounts. If there were any contra-profits accrued, the accountholders whose accounts were being used in the scheme would retain their commission, and return the surplus profits to Janice via cash, cheque or bank transfers. Janice would then deduct her share of the profits from such monies, before transferring the remaining monies to Andrew.

> 29    By virtue of the foregoing, sometime between 6 February 2015 and 15 January 2016, in Singapore, Janice did engage in a course of conduct, by controlling the trading of shares issued by Koyo, and traded on the Catalist board of the SGX, through the 31 abovementioned accounts, on the instructions of Andrew, which she knew would be likely to create a false appearance of active trading in Koyo shares. Janice has thereby committed an offence under section 197(1A)(a) of the SFA, punishable under section 204(1) of the SFA \[1st charge; DAC-928628-2019\].

> 30    During the relevant period, the orders and trades in Koyo shares, conducted through the abovementioned 31 trading accounts, were placed on Andrew’s instructions. These trades were performed for Andrew’s benefit, and Andrew (as opposed to the respective accountholder) had agreed to be responsible for the losses incurred and Andrew was entitled to the profits generated. No consent from any of the brokerage firms was obtained for the trades to be placed on the instructions of anyone other than the accountholder, and for the benefit of anyone other than the accountholder. By intentionally obtaining from the accountholders, and handing over to Andrew control of, the following 12 accounts:

>> a.    12th charge, DAC-929620-2019: KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Chong;

>> b.    13th charge, DAC-929621-2019: KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Perry;

>> c.    16th charge, DAC-929624-2019: KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Neo;

>> d.    17th charge, DAC-929625-2019: KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Tan;

>> e.    18th charge, DAC-929626-2019: KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Wang;

>> f.    19th charge, DAC-929627-2019: KGI trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Yoon;

>> g.    20th charge, DAC-929628-2019: RHB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Chua;

>> h.    21st charge, DAC-929629-2019: RHB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Perry;

>> i.    22nd charge, DAC-929630-2019: RHB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Heng;

>> j.    25th charge, DAC-929633-2019: RHB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Tan;

>> k.    26th charge, DAC-929634-2019: RHB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Wang; and

>> l.    27th charge, DAC-929635-2019: RHB trading account (account no. XXX) opened by Yoon,

>     Janice indirectly engaged in a practice which operated as a deception on KGI and RHB, as the two brokerage firms were likely to be deceived that the trades were performed on the accountholder’s instructions. Janice has thereby committed 12 counts of an offence under s 201(b) of the SFA, punishable under s 204(1) of the SFA.

>     Losses sustained by the brokerage firms and accountholders

> 31    Following the crash in the Koyo share price on 18 January 2016, substantial losses were sustained by many innocent parties, including the accountholders and the brokerage firms.

> 32    The total amounts incurred as a result of contra trading losses in the 31 abovementioned accounts was $3,119,034.93, of which the account holders bore $2,399,202.20 of such losses, while the brokerage firms bore $399,953.14 of such losses (excluding the amount stated in paragraph 33 below).

> 33    As a result of legal action taken against Janice by CIMB, Janice paid the sum of $231,103.20 to CIMB on account of their losses.

> 34    As of 24 June 2020, the aggregate unpaid outstanding losses sustained by the brokerage firms, in respect of the 31 abovementioned accounts, was $69,834.96.

## Charges taken into consideration

7       The Accused admitted and consented to have another 19 charges under section 201(b) of the Act be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Antecedents

8       The Accused was untraced.

>     Any person who contravenes any of the provisions of this Division shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $ 250,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

10     The prosecution tendered written sentencing submissions (“PSS”), supplemented by detailed oral submissions in Court, and sought a global sentence of at least 36 months’ imprisonment against the Accused. This comprised the proposed sentences of 30 months’ imprisonment for the market rigging charge and 2 months’ imprisonment per charge for the 12 deceptive practice charges, with the sentence for the market rigging charge to run consecutively with three sentences of imprisonment for the deceptive practice charges[^2]. The prosecution’s arguments are summarised below.

#### Factual points underpinning prosecution’s sentencing position

11     The prosecution focused on 3 salient factual points in support of their sentencing position.

12     The prosecution’s first contention was that the market manipulation scheme in the present case was one of the most sophisticated of such schemes ever prosecuted in Singapore. This submission was premised on the following factors:

> (a)     The scheme involved synchronised trading between 53 separate brokerage accounts which were opened in the name of 15 individuals with 8 brokerages. It required 8 different offenders (including the Accused) to act in harmony to achieve their common goal of inflating the share price of Koyo International Ltd (“Koyo”) shares, with a view to do a reverse takeover.

> (b)     The scheme entailed a very elaborate profit and loss distribution arrangement. Profits made in accounts on one side of the trade were used to offset losses made in accounts on the other side of the trade. To attract and induce the account holders to contribute their accounts, some were promised 10% of profits generated through trades conducted in their accounts, coupled with full indemnity of any losses. The trading representatives or remisiers involved, including the Accused, were promised they could earn commission from the large volume of trades that would be conducted in the accounts under their control. The mastermind expected to cash out at the end of the scheme when there was to be a reverse takeover.

> (c)     The scheme was carried out for an extended period of 18 months between August 2014 and January 2016 and only unravelled when the authorities discovered that a small group of people were responsible for 60% of the traded volume of Koyo shares.

> (d)     The market for Koyo shares was severely distorted by the scheme.[^3] Citing the case of _Ng Geok Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 913</span> (“_Ng Geok Eng_”) at \[61\], the prosecution submitted that the stock market was meant to reflect genuine forces of supply and demand in respect of the traded securities. However, the scheme in the present case attacked the market of Koyo shares in the most fundamental way such that during its course and at the end, the \`SGX price for Koyo shares bore absolutely no connection to genuine forces of supply and demand. Through the manipulation of scheme members, the price of Koyo shares increased from a low of 16 cents in August 2014 to a high of 40 cents in January 2016. Further, the scheme members accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total buy and sell volumes while cross-trades accounted for 43% of all trades conducted in SGX for Koyo shares in the course of the scheme.

13     According to the prosecution, the only other case with this level of sophistication and coordination between multiple entities and individuals was the “Blumont” case.

14     The prosecution’s second contention was that the Accused was the second most culpable offender in the scheme, after Lin Eng Jue (“Andrew”) the mastermind, based on the following factors:

> (a)     The Accused was the single largest contributor of trading accounts to the scheme and provided 31 out of 53 accounts which were used in the scheme. Further, more than 5,500 separate trades were conducted using those accounts, which far outstripped those attributable by other co-accused persons. This was the Accused’s most critical role because each trading account was subject to trading limits, and in some instances, brokerages had cut the trading limits to reduce their exposure to Koyo shares. Therefore, in order to sustain a scheme of this scale, it was critical to obtain more brokerage accounts to fuel its need to trade in substantial volume of shares at higher prices. Besides overall providing nearly 60% of the accounts to drive the price of Koyo shares higher, the Accused had actually injected 19 out of 20 new accounts in phase three of the scheme from October 2015 to January 2016. Thus, the prosecution submitted that without the Accused’s involvement, the scheme could not have increased the price Koyo shares to the level which it did, nor lasted for as long as it did.

> (b)     The Accused executed trades as remisier for nine CGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“CIMB”) accounts belonging to her clients.

> (c)     For the other accounts opened with KGI Fraser Securities Pte Ltd (“KGI”) and RHB Securities Singapore Pte Ltd (“RHB”), the Accused coordinated the trades by relaying the instructions from Andrew or his assistant Ang Wei Jie Simon (“Simon”), to the relevant trading representatives to place the trades.

> (d)     The Accused assisted Andrew with the distribution of profits to account holders as set out in \[28\] of the SOF.

15     The prosecution further highlighted other aggravating factors as follows:[^4]

> (a)     The Accused was motivated by profit when she agreed to aid Andrew in perpetuating the scheme.

> (b)     The Accused had numerous opportunities to exit the scheme. The prosecution submitted that it was particularly aggravating that when the Accused was made aware of either the CIMB or KGI compliance teams’ monitoring of the accounts used by the scheme, instead of disengaging from the scheme or reporting it to the authorities, she chose to engage in further market manipulating conduct.

16     The prosecution’s third factual point was that the Accused had obtained some of the accounts by deceiving the account holders. Referring to \[24\] of the SOF, the prosecution pointed out that, with the exception of her brother Low Wan Meng (“Low”), the Accused had told her clients that she was leaving CIMB because of “work issues”. They were not informed that the scheme was running out of credit limits and the real purpose of them opening accounts with RHB and KGI was to contribute greater credit limits to the scheme. In fact, the Accused neither left CIMB nor close any of the additional accounts.

17     The prosecution disagreed with the defence’s position that there was no deception in this regard. The prosecution argued that the scheme as it was in October 2015 (when the additional accounts were contributed) was very different from that in February 2015 when the Accused initially joined the scheme. This was because Andrew had stopped paying for contra losses incurred in the CIMB accounts. As such, the premise on which the account holders agreed to contribute the accounts, which was that their losses would be indemnified and they would receive 10% of the profits, was unlikely to be kept. Also, by October 2015, CIMB had cut trading limits for the accounts and the scheme desperately and urgently needed new accounts for the price of Koyo shares to be maintained and pushed higher. Thus, when the Accused obtained the RHB and KGI accounts from her clients, she had painted a completely different picture from the truth. Further, had her clients known the real state of affairs, the clear and irresistible inference was that they would not have contributed accounts to the scheme.

#### Sentencing factors set out in PP v Ng Sae Kiat

18     The prosecution next addressed the Court on the law and sentencing precedents.

19     Firstly, the prosecution submitted that the Court should consider the factors set out in _PP v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span> (“_Ng Sae Kiat”_) in arriving at the appropriate sentence for the Accused. Although _Ng Sae Kiat_ concerned an offence under section 201(b) of the Act, but the factors highlighted therein were equally application to one under section 197 of the Act. This was because the same legislative intent underpinned both types of offences to: (i) protect investors, (ii) protect public confidence in the securities markets and (iii) ensure that market operation was not distorted.[^5] In addition, both sections shared the same punishment provision.

20     However, the prosecution acknowledged that not all the factors set out in _Ng Sae Kiat_ would be directly applicable to an offence under section 197 of the Act. As such the prosecution highlighted four factors for the Court’s consideration which would be relevant to the market rigging charge:

> (a)     The extent of the of the damage or loss caused to the victim(s). In this connection, the prosecution referred to the following facts concerning the extent of harm caused.

>> (i)       After the scheme unravelled, $58 million in market capitalisation was wiped out from the SGX.

>> (ii)       As a result of the scheme, a total of $3.11 million in contra trading losses were incurred in the 31 accounts contributed by the Accused. The prosecution acknowledged that the Accused bore about $231,000 of those losses, but pointed out that she gave this money after a lawsuit was brought against her by CIMB.

> (b)     The sophistication of the fraud.

> (c)     The extent of the market distortion.

> (d)     The breach of duty of fidelity that the Accused owed to her employer as well as her clients. The prosecution submitted that the Accused’s job as a remisier was a regulated profession, and to be a licenced broker, an individual had to pass examinations overseen by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Therefore, the fact that the Accused engaged in a scheme of this sophistication whilst being a regulated licensed broker was highly aggravating. Furthermore, she joined the scheme about four to five years after she became a broker and could not be said to be inexperienced.

#### Sentencing precedents and co-accused sentences

21     Turning to the sentencing precedents, the prosecution drew the Court’s attention to the main cases under section 197 of the Act.

> (a)     The prosecution first highlighted the case of _Soh Guan Cheow Anthony v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 147</span> (“_Anthony Soh_”). According to the prosecution, this was the case in which the Singapore courts had imposed the highest sentence for an offence under section 197 of the Act – that of 3½ years, after appeal. The offender, Soh, had engineering a false takeover of a company in which he held shares (Jade Technologies Holdings Ltd) by issuing false banking documents. Soh made unrealised illicit gains of $11.3 million and caused a paper loss of about $67.4 million to other shareholders. As Soh was prosecuted under both sections 197(1) as well as 140(2) of the Act for the manipulative conduct in that case, the global sentence meted out on appeal in relation to those offences was 8½ years’ imprisonment. Comparing the facts of that case to those in the present case, the prosecution submitted that the Accused participated in the scheme for 234 days whereas the offence in _Anthony Soh_ took place over 1½ months. Also, as opposed to the one-off act of a false general offer in _Anthony Soh_, the Accused’s conduct comprised more than 5500 trades in Koyo shares using the 31 accounts she provided to the scheme. Further, the scheme in the current case was far more sophisticated involving multiple offenders, trading accounts, account holders and brokerages. Thus, considering that the Accused pleaded guilty and was not the mastermind in the present case, as well as the fact that the financial gains she obtained were not as high as those in _Anthony Soh_, the prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of 30 months represented an appropriate downward calibration from the 8½ years meted out to the accused person in _Anthony Soh_.

> (b)     The prosecution next referred to _PP v Goh Hin Calm_ (High Court Criminal Case No. 13 of 2019, unreported) (“_Goh Hin Calm_”). This was one of the offenders who was prosecuted in relation to the “Blumont” scheme. The prosecution was of the view that the modus operandi in both cases were similar in that both involved trades done using numerous trading accounts with a view to manipulate the price of the shares involved. The main difference was that the “Blumont” scheme was on a completely different and much larger scale, involving many more accounts and account holders – with about $8 billion in market capitalisation lost and at least $350 million of losses sustained in the trading accounts. The prosecution urged the Court to consider that Goh, the offender, was not motivated by financial gain and his role was quite limited in the “Blumont” scheme – he contributed 10 accounts (with six in his name and four in his wife’s name) and acted as the runner for the mastermind in that scheme to settle contra losses. Goh pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that the Accused’s role was far more involved and culpable based on the facts highlighted earlier. Nonetheless, given the radically different scales of the schemes, it was submitted that a 6 month downward adjustment to 30 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

> (c)     The third precedent was _Ng Geok Eng_, where, on appeal, 6 months’ imprisonment was meted out to the accused person for an offence under section 197(1) of the Act. The prosecution noted that _Ng Geok Eng_ was a “marking the close” case, which, by its nature, was less sophisticated than the schemes in “Blumont” and the present case. In _Ng Geok Eng_, the offender, Ng, used at least 18 accounts to manipulate the price of a share which he was holding, by making a few trades close to the end of the trading day to artificially increase the closing price. Ng’s actions in that case did not result in any sustained price impact on the shares. The prosecution highlighted _Ng Geok Eng_ to demonstrate that the sentence of 6 months submitted by the defence was clearly inadequate as the scheme in the present case went on for much longer, far more accounts were used and there was significant price impact. Also, while no losses were proven in _Ng Geok Eng_, there was significant loss of $58 million in market capitalisation in the present case. In view of the substantial custodial term of 6 months in _Ng Geok Eng_, the prosecution’s submission of 30 months in this case was therefore entirely proportionate to the harm caused by the scheme as well as the Accused’s culpability.

22     The prosecution proceeded to set out the sentences meted out against the co-accused and drew the following comparisons:[^6]

23     The prosecution emphasised that while Rayson, Steven and Yeo were very much on the periphery of the scheme, the Accused was at the front and centre. Thus, in considering the sentence for the Accused, the prosecution would caution against looking at the sentences imposed against them and calibrating upwards. Instead, the prosecution urged the Court to consider cases in which offenders were prosecuted for their overall role in sophisticated schemes, such as those in _Anthony Soh_ and _Goh Hin Calm_ and calibrate downwards based on the harm caused in this case.

24     In relation to the deceptive practice charges under section 201(b) of the Act, the prosecution invited the Court to draw the inference that the Accused did deceive the account holders when she asked them to open fresh accounts or reactivate old accounts with RHB and KGI. Therefore, based on the decision in _Ng Geok Eng_, custodial sentences on those charges would be appropriate. Further, even if the Court was not with the prosecution on this point, a custodial sentence would still be warranted, based on the decision of the High Court in _PP v Prem Hirubalan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 156</span> at \[3\] (“_Prem Hirubalan_”). In that case the High Court took into consideration the decision in _Ng Sae Kiat_ and imposed a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment in relation to a charge under section 201(b) of the Act even though the account holder had consented to the trades. The High Court had taken into account the fact that the accused in that case was a financial professional who owed a duty of fidelity to the securities company who employed him, and that there were losses (amounting to about $73,000) in the account. The prosecution submitted that both factors were present in the instant case and 3 months’ imprisonment would be entirely appropriate as the losses caused in this case were far greater, full restitution had not been made and the unauthorised trading took place over a much longer period. However, taking into account the totality principle, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of 2 months per charge for the deceptive practices charges would be appropriate, in view of prosecution’s submission for three of such sentences to run consecutively.

### Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

25     The defence tendered a written plea-in-mitigation incorporating their submissions on sentence (“DSS”) and sought a global sentence not exceeding 27 weeks’ imprisonment against the Accused. This comprised the individual sentences of 24 weeks’ imprisonment in relation to the market rigging charge and 3 weeks’ imprisonment per charge in relation to the deceptive practice charges, with one sentence from each category to run consecutively.

26     In their oral submissions, the defence took the Court through the DSS and responded to the prosecution’s submissions on sentence. Their arguments are summarised below.

#### Circumstances leading to the commission of the offences

27     The defence began by highlighting the personal background of the Accused as well as the circumstances leading to her involvement in the offences.[^7] In particular, the defence emphasised that as a former housewife for many years before obtaining her licence was a broker after seven failed attempts, the Accused was not a person who was conversant with the financial industries or restructuring processes of companies. Therefore, when she was introduced to Andrew by the CEO of Koyo and told that there would be a reverse takeover (“RTO”) of Koyo shares, she did not actually know what it entailed and was not familiar with the rules concerning share trading in respect of an RTO. As such, the Accused was easily manipulated and taken advantage of by Andrew, as she just followed his instructions.

#### Culpability of the Accused and harm caused to the market

28     The defence submitted that the Accused did not play any part in engineering the market rigging scheme and her participation in the scheme only started in February 2015, many months after it had been in operation. She also did not have any control over the material aspects of the scheme such as the price at which Koyo shares were to be traded, volume of shares to be purchased or sold, which accounts to use, and the timing of the trades.[^8] Therefore, what the Accused did was almost exactly what Rayson, Yeo or Steve had done.

29     The defence argued that the Accused could not be considered to be the second most culpable offender in the scheme and emphasised that the Accused’s culpability was on par with that of Yeo’s. Firstly, she joined the scheme six months after it had taken off while Yeo had participated much earlier. Unlike Yeo, she was not promised a reward upon the eventual sale of Koyo. Thirdly, the market losses caused by the scheme were entirely the same in respect of Yeo and the Accused. Further, prior to the Accused involvement, the share price of Koyo had already risen by 9 cents since the start of the scheme. During the period of her involvement, it had likely risen by another 9 cents. Thus from a consequential perspective, the Accused’s involvement could not be said to have been different from Yeo’s.

30     The defence disagreed with the prosecution that there was deception or breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the Accused. The defence submitted that there could be no doubt that the account holders knew of their involvement in the scheme and were in it for the reward of 10% share of the profits which was promised to them. They also knew that they had to cede control of their accounts for the scheme, even if some of them were not aware of and did not consent to others besides the Accused trading on their behalf. As such, they could not be considered victims, but were in fact willing parties who participated in the scheme for profit. At all material times, the account holders were aware that the Accused had yet to leave CIMB and must have known that she could not have been the one trading on their behalf at KGI or RHB. They did not raise any objection to the arrangement until investigated by the authorities.

31     In addition, the defence took the position that a remisier did not owe a fiduciary duty or a duty of fidelity to the client. Even if such a duty were owed, there was no breach as the account holders “knew exactly what they were in for”. Thus, it was pure speculation on the part of the prosecution to suggest that the account holders would not have opened KGI or RHB accounts but for the Accused painting a completely different picture to them. Ultimately, any account opening decisions were made by the clients and processed by the brokerages. It should also be noted that the deceptive practice charges related to deception in respect of the brokerage houses and not the account holders and a distinction was drawn in _Ng Geok Eng_ between the two.

32     The defence further submitted that contrary to the prosecution’s submission that the Accused could have exited from the scheme, she could not do so as huge losses had been incurred towards the last phase. The defence stated that Andrew had delivered a veiled threat to the Accused that should she withdraw from the scheme, he would allow her and her clients to suffer great losses and she would be bankrupted as a result.[^9]

33     In relation to the losses suffered, the defence pointed out that the Accused had paid up a significant amount to cover the brokerage’s losses and had to mortgage her house to raise funds. This helped to reduce the eventual losses suffered by the brokerages to about $69,000, a very minimal amount compared to those in other cases such as _Anthony Soh_ and _Goh Hin Calm_. In addition, the brokerages would have received revenue through the trades and their actual losses would be very much lower.

34     As for the losses suffered by the account holders, the defence submitted that as participants who gained from the scheme, it would not be fair for their losses to be considered in sentencing.

35     The defence also highlighted that during the period of the offence, approximately one-third of Koyo’s shares were floated on the market and the rest were mostly held by the CEO and his family members. The trades performed by the accounts involved in the scheme represented about two-thirds of the traded volume. That being so, the $58 million losses in market capitalisation should not be treated as consequential financial harm to the general trading public.[^10]

#### Applicability of the parity principle

36     The defence urged the Court to apply the parity principle as the nature of the offences perpetuated by the Accused was similar to that of Yeo, Rayson and Steven, even though her acts were on a larger scale. In support, the defence referred to _Ng Sae Kiat_[^11] where the court applied the parity principle in respect of co-defendants charged under section 201(b) of the Act as they had participated in a common criminal enterprise and perpetrated the same type of fraud except, for the respondents in that case, on a larger scale.

37     In view of the above, there was no reason not to apply the sentence of 6 months imposed on Yeo for the charge under section 197 of the Act to this case. In this connection, the defence referred to the recent case of _PP v Soligny Bruno Ludovic_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 20</span> where the accused was sentenced to a global term of 20 weeks’ imprisonment for the four charges under section 197 of the Act. As for the deceptive practice charges, the defence urged the Court to impose an imprisonment term of 3 weeks in parity with the sentences of 3 and 2 weeks’ imprisonment meted out to Rayson and Yeo respectively for similar offences.

38     On the other hand, the defence urged the Court not to use _Goh Hin Calm_ or _Anthony Soh_ as benchmarks for sentencing as they were of different magnitude and severity. In _Anthony Soh_, the offender had claimed trial. He was the mastermind of the scheme like Andrew and reaped massive gains of several million dollars which he used to meet his personal financial obligations. _Goh Hin Calm_ was a case of even greater magnitude in terms of the losses accrued, the number of accounts and the brokerages involved. Not only did Goh use his own accounts for the trades, he also aided in the opening of many other accounts (including corporate accounts) for use by the scheme. Goh also assisted the masterminds to manage funds to the tune of at least $2 million and was aware of the unlawful trading of shares involving three companies.

39     Thus, the defence asked that the Court to calibrate the sentence in this case based on the sentence meted out to Yeo. The defence argued that the Court should not use the sentences in _Goh Hin Calm_ or _Anthony Soh_ as a starting point and calibrate downwards as doing so would fall foul of the parity principle.

#### The Accused’s rehabilitation

40     Next, the defence turned to highlight the Accused’s remorse and rehabilitation. In this regard, the defence cited the case of _Chan Kum Hong Randy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 1019</span> at \[23\] where the High Court ruled that where there had been an inordinate delay in prosecution, the sentence should in appropriate cases reflect the fact that the matter has been held in abeyance for some time, possibly inflicting undue agony, suspense and uncertainty on the offender. Further, at \[28\], the High Court also held that in cases involving an inordinate delay between the commission of the offence and the ultimate disposition of that offence via the criminal justice process, the element of rehabilitation underway during the interim could not be lightly dismissed or cursorily overlooked, and, in appropriate cases, might warrant a sentence that might otherwise be viewed as lenient.

41     The defence submitted that there had been an inordinate delay of between three to four years in the prosecution of the Accused, since the start of the investigations in early 2016. As she had fully cooperated with the investigations and was no longer required to attend interviews since early 2016, any delay should not be attributed to her. During this time, the Accused had undergone significant rehabilitation. Her extreme remorse led her to leave the financial industry and she had been working for various charitable organisations so as to do good for society.[^12] The defence emphasised that the Accused had dedicated herself to helping the needy through her charitable work, and her actions indicated that she was now an asset to society. Thus, the defence asked the Court to place substantive weight on this in determining the extent of her rehabilitation.

42     The defence also placed before the Court a letter written jointly by the Accused’s sons which laid out the significant mental anguish suffered by the Accused, how the ordeal had caused her to change for the better, and their impassioned plea for the Court to exercise mercy towards their mother.

### Prosecution’s reply

43     In response, the prosecution submitted that the figure of $69,000 highlighted by the defence was the amount remaining outstanding to the brokerages and not a reflection of the loss caused by the scheme. Thus, the true scale of the “financial calamity” caused by the scheme was the total contra trading losses in the 31 accounts contributed by the Accused which stood at more than $3.1 million.

44     The prosecution also disagreed with the defence’s comparison of the Accused’s culpability with that of Yeo and submitted that there were four main differences:

> (a)     The first was in the nature of their involvement. The prosecution explained that there were three broad categories of participants in the scheme. The first category were the masterminds and the prosecution submitted that this included the Andrew, his assistant Simon, as well as the Accused. Rayson and Steven would fall into the second category of trading representatives while Yeo would fall into the third category of account holders who were aware that their accounts were going to be used to manipulate the price of Koyo shares. Therefore, the role and involvement of Yeo and the Accused in the scheme were very different, and the Accused’s role was far more aggravated.

> (b)     The second difference was in the rewards structure. While Yeo was promised a share of profits from the reverse takeover and that losses in his accounts would be indemnified, neither of these promises were kept. Like other account holders, when the scheme collapsed, Yeo was out of pocket and had to cover some of the losses himself. On the other hand, the Accused, as trading representative, earned a commission when a trade was conducted in one of the accounts under her control. Further, as stated at \[21\] of the SOF, for a period of time, she was paid a share of the contra trading profits.

> (c)     Thirdly, the scale of involvement was very different on three indices namely, the number of accounts, number of account holders roped into the scheme and the number of trades conducted.

> (d)     Finally, Yeo did not owe a duty to anyone as an account holder, whereas the Accused, as a trading representative and remisier owed a duty of fidelity to her clients in law, as her role fell directly in the realm of agency which clothed her with the duties that any fiduciary would be clothed with. Further, even if no such duty were owed to her clients, as stated in _Prem Hirubalan_, a financial professional such as the Accused would owe a duty of fidelity to the security company which employed her. This would sufficiently distinguish her from Yeo.

45     The prosecution also clarified that they were not submitting that the account holders were deceived into signing up for the market manipulation scheme in the first place. However, the point the prosecution was making was that for the new accounts (in RHB and KCI) which were obtained by the Accused in phase three of the scheme, there was a material deception because the nature of the scheme had changed by that time and the Accused has admitted that they were not informed that the scheme was running out of credit limits and the real purpose of them opening the accounts was to contribute further credit limits to the scheme.

46     As for the issue of delay, the prosecution submitted that it was abundantly clear that this was a complex case which required significant investigation which took time. The 3½-year delay was therefore amply explained by the number of individuals prosecuted and the scale and complexity of the scheme. There was therefore no basis for the argument that there had been undue delay in prosecuting the Accused.

### Further submissions on breach of fiduciary duty and/or duty of fidelity

47     As the parties took divergent positions as to whether, in law, a remisier owed a fiduciary duty and/or a duty of fidelity to his or her clients, I requested that they provide authorities to assist the Court on this point.

48     The prosecution tendered further sentencing submissions (“PFSS”) on this issue and made further oral submissions in Court. The prosecution clarified that there was a distinction between a fiduciary duty and a duty of fidelity. The prosecution cited the Court of Appeal case of _Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 308</span> at \[49\] to \[55\] (“_Smile Inc Dental_”) where the Court of Appeal held that while both duties might arise from the same employer-employee relationship, the bases of the duties were entirely different. The duty of fidelity would be implied in every employer-employee relationship – that the employee would serve the employer with good faith and fidelity and use reasonable care and skill in the performance of his duties: _Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd v Wong Bark Chuan David_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 663</span> at \[193\]. On the other hand, a fiduciary duty would arise when one undertook to act for or on behalf of another in a particular manner in circumstances which gave rise to a relationship of trust and confidence and the distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty: _Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 1310</span> (“_Deutsche Bank AG_”) at \[104\]. In addition, while the archetype of a fiduciary would be a trustee, there were other classes of persons who normally stood in a fiduciary relationship to one another, including that of principle and agent: _Deutsche Bank AG_ at \[105\].

49     The prosecution took the position that the Accused owed and breached both duties of fiduciary and fidelity to her clients.

50     Firstly, in relation to the duty of fidelity, the prosecution cited the cases of _Prem Hirubalan_ and _PP v Chen Yue_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 333</span> where the courts found that the relevant duty owed by a trading representative was the duty of fidelity. Similar to the offenders in those cases, the Accused was a financial professional who traded on behalf of her clients and earned a commission on the trades. The prosecution submitted that by allowing her clients’ accounts to be used for the scheme and deceiving them into opening further accounts, the Accused did not use reasonable care and skill to perform her duties as a remisier and failed to act in good faith. In support of their position, the prosecution referred to Chapter 13.2.1 of the SGX-ST Rules which applied at the material time. The SGX-ST Rules required, _inter alia_, that a trading representative exercise skill, care and diligence, act in good faith, as well as in the best interests of customers. The prosecution submitted that the rules clearly imposed a duty of fidelity on the part of the Accused and further, as the Accused had failed to abide by these rules, based on _Ng Sae Kiat_ (at \[58(g)\] and _Prem Hirubalan_ (at \[3\]), this should be regarded as an aggravating factor.

51     Secondly, the prosecution submitted that specific SGX-ST Rules also imposed a fiduciary duty on the Accused to act in the best interests of the account holders:

>     13.2.1

>     When acting as an agent, a Trading Member and its Trading Representative must:-

>> …

>> (4)    act in the best interests of customers;

>> …

>> (7)    disclose the commission and any benefit directly or indirectly receivable on the transaction;

>> (8)    not enter into a transaction which may conflict with a duty owed to the customer, unless the customer is informed of the conflict and consents to the transaction;…

52     The prosecuted submitted that the Accused had breached her fiduciary duties by not acting in the best interests of her clients by deceiving them about the reasons for opening accounts with KGI and RHB.

53     The prosecution concluded that regardless of the characterisation of her duty as one of fidelity or fiduciary, the Accused had breached the position of trust as a remisier. This must be seen as an aggravating factor.

54     In response, the defence first highlighted the case of _Lee Chee Keet v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1316</span> (“_Lee Chee Keet”_) at \[40\] where the High Court found that the offender did not owe a duty of fidelity to the investing public in his capacity as a company’s director and shareholder. The High Court further pointed out that the duty of fidelity was most commonly (if not exclusively) discussed in the context of employment law.

55     As for the SGX-ST Rules, the defence agreed that they applied to the Accused at the material time. However, the defence submitted that such duties were owed to SGX, and was not the same as the legal duty of fidelity. The SGX-ST Rules also did not expressly state that the duties therein amounted to a fiduciary duty or duty of fidelity. The defence further submitted that the SOF did not show any evidence that the Accused failed to exercise skill, care and diligence or that she did not act in good faith in the best interests of her customers. In particular, the account holders were all participants in the scheme so none of these rules would have been breached with regard to them.

56     In relation to fiduciary duties, the defence referred to _Deutsche Bank AG_ which stated that the courts would not ordinarily consider banks as fiduciaries. In determining whether exceptional circumstances existed to give rise to a fiduciary relationship, the courts would focus on whether or not the fiduciary had undertaken, expressly or impliedly, to act as a fiduciary _vis-à-vis_ the principle.[^13] The defence submitted that the Accused did not give such undertaking, whether impliedly or expressly, in this case and the Court should be slow to find that such a relationship existed.

57     The defence pointed out that the case authorities, including _Smile Inc Dental_ showed that in order to give rise to a fiduciary relationship, an employee must typically hold a senior management position.

58     The defence emphasised that there was no contractual relationship between the Accused and each of the account holders and any contractual relationship existed only between the account holders and the brokerages with which they opened accounts. The Accused, as an employee of the brokerage, was merely servicing the account holders in trading activities. Based on the above, in the absence of a contract between the Accused and the account holders, no duty of fidelity or fiduciary relationship would apply as an implied term. In addition, there was no factual basis from the SOF to give rise to such implied terms in the first place.

59     In their reply, the prosecution pointed out that the case of _Lee Chee Keet_ dealt with the duties owed to the general investing public whereas this case concerned a remisier-client relationship. As for the categories of fiduciary relationships, the prosecution noted that the High Court in _Deutsche Bank AG_, did not restrict them only to employees of a higher position of responsibility, and more importantly, the High Court held that there was no reason to suppose that these categories were closed. The prosecution further submitted that compared to banking relationships where the bank’s commercial interest might be very different from that of the customer’s, the duty of a remisier was very narrow.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Applicable sentencing factors

60     In deliberating the appropriate sentence in this case, I first turned to consider the sentencing factors which were applicable to the offences at hand. It was largely undisputed that the following non-exhaustive list of sentencing factors set out at \[58\] in _Ng Sae Kiat_ would be relevant to the current case, and directly applicable to the deceptive practice charges:

> (a)     the extent of the loss/damage caused to victim(s);

> (b)     sophistication of the fraud;

> (c)     the frequency and duration of the offender’s unauthorised use of the relevant account;

> (d)     extent of distortion, if any, to the operation of the financial market;

> (e)     the identity of the defrauded party (_ie_, whether the defrauded party was a public investor or a securities firm);

> (f)     relationship between the offender and the defrauded party; and

> (g)     the offender’s breach of any duty of fidelity that might be owed to the defrauded party.

61     In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that factors (a), (b), (d) and (g) would be pertinent in relation to the market rigging charge.

62     With the above in mind, I turned to apply the sentencing factors to the facts and circumstances of the case in assessing the overall culpability of the Accused and the harm caused by the offences she committed.

#### Culpability of the Accused

63     The prosecution had emphasised in their submissions that the Accused was the second most culpable offender in the scheme. To my mind, while this would be relevant in assessing sentencing parity vis-à-vis other co-accused persons, it was of limited assistance to the Court in weighing the actual level of culpability of the Accused. This was because, even if an offender were considered to be the second most culpable member of a criminal enterprise, it did not necessarily mean that his or her culpability would be closer to that of the most culpable offender as compared to that of the next-ranked offender.

64     As mentioned in my brief oral grounds, I was acutely mindful that in arriving at the appropriate sentence, I should focus my attention on the full facts and circumstances of the case in assessing the specific level of criminality of the Accused before me.

##### (1)   The Accused was motivated by personal gain

65     Turning to the culpability enhancing factors in this case, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the Accused was motivated by personal gain when she joined the scheme. She also reaped rewards in the course of her participation, in the form of commissions on each trade from a CIMB account contributed by her, as well as a share of the contra trading profits over a period of six months.

##### (2)   The market rigging scheme was sophisticated and operated for a substantial period

66     It could not be disputed that the scheme which the Accused participated in was a complex and highly sophisticated one involving coordinated trading using multiple accounts from several brokerages which were contributed by a number of account holders. As noted by the prosecution in their submissions, the scheme had its own profit and loss distribution arrangements involving payments of rewards, commissions, and profits to various tiers of participants.

67     The scheme also operated, largely undetected, for an extended period from August 2014 to January 2016 and only collapsed when the authorities detected irregularities in the trading patterns.

##### (3)   The Accused played a critical role in the scheme

68     The Accused’s offending period spanned 11 months. During this time, she played the critical role of harnessing and contributing trading accounts to the scheme. In addition, she also assisted in:

> (a)     performing trades based on Andrew’s instructions;

> (b)     conveying instructions from Andrew to others, such as Low (her brother) and Chong Yew Mun Alan (“Alan”, a broker with RHB), to execute the trades; and

> (c)     distributing contra profits in the various trading accounts (including deducting a share for herself).

69     In this regard, I also concurred with the prosecution’s submissions that the accounts contributed by the Accused were key to the scheme’s continued viability in the middle and final phases of its operations. Indeed, it could not be disputed that the main building blocks of the scheme were the accounts that scheme members had access to and control of, for use in executing the trades. Based on the facts before the Court, it was clear that the Accused was by far the largest single contributor of these accounts. Indeed, she contributed about twice as many accounts as to those contributed or operated by Steven, Rayson and Yeo combined. Needless to say, the volume of trades placed from the Accused’s nominee accounts also far outstripped those conducted via the other accounts.

70     In addition, based on the facts admitted by the Accused, I was of the view that by her actions, she had assisted the scheme to circumvent safeguards put in place by the brokerage firms. For example, when the Accused learnt that CIMB intended to reduce trading limits for Koyo shares in her clients’ accounts, so as to lessen their exposure to those shares, the Accused assisted to convince her clients to open or reactivate their accounts with RHB or KGI. Thereafter, when Gui Qi Xia Celestine (“Celestine”), an equity sales dealer with KGI, declined to assist the Accused further with trades in the KGI accounts due to the KGI compliance team starting to monitor her Koyo trades, it was the Accused who arranged for the Koyo trades placed from KGI accounts to be executed by Alan.

##### (4)   The Accused’s deception of her clients

71     I next turned to consider the issue of the Accused’s deception of and breach of trust towards her clients. In this regard, it was important to bear in mind that this was not a case where the Accused had duped her clients into participating in the scheme at the outset. As pointed out by the defence, the facts showed that her clients were aware of and agreed to their accounts being used to trade in Koyo shares, in return for a share of the trading profits.

72     However, it was clear that from August 2015 onwards, the Accused was less than upfront with her clients, and omitted to inform or update them on material developments which would likely have had a bearing on their continued involvement in the scheme. Based on the facts admitted by the Accused, she did not inform a number of her clients that their accounts were in fact used by third parties to trade on their behalf. Thus, while they agreed to allow the Accused, whom they knew and apparently trusted, to use their accounts, they did not consent to third parties doing so. In addition, the Accused’s clients were not informed that their CIMB accounts were running out of credit limits or that the real purpose of them opening up RHB and KGI accounts was to contribute greater credit limits to the scheme. Most importantly, they were also not informed that despite the initial promise that any losses incurred would be paid by scheme members, Andrew had in fact stopped paying for contra losses since September 2015, thus potentially exposing them to substantial losses. Based on the above, I agreed with the prosecution that the Accused had, in that context, breached the trust that her clients had reposed in her. Further, I also agreed with the prosecution that the fact that the Accused participated in and facilitated the scheme in her capacity as a licenced broker added to her culpability.

73     In this connection, I had also carefully considered the submissions from both parties concerning whether the Accused was clothed with and had breached either the duty of fidelity or fiduciary duty towards her clients. Based on the High Court’s decision in _Prem Hirubalan_ as well as the clauses in Chapter 13.2.1 of the SGX-ST Rules which the Accused acknowledged to be applicable to her at the material time, I accepted the prosecution’s submissions that the Accused did owe a duty of fidelity to her clients and that she had breached that duty.

74     However, I took a different view with regard to the issue of fiduciary duty. In the absence of case authorities on point, and as I was not provided with the full details concerning the relationship between the Accused and each of her clients (including the contractual terms, if any, governing their relationship and dealings), I was not prepared to conclude that the relationship between the Accused and her clients was such that it would give rise to fiduciary duty on her part.

#### Harm caused by the offences

75     Having studied the sentencing factors which had a bearing on the Accused’s culpability, I moved on to look at the harm caused by the offences. Based on the facts admitted by the Accused, particularly \[13\] to \[18\] of the SOF, I agreed with the prosecution that the resulting market distortion on Koyo shares was severe – the price Koyo shares more than doubled and the trades performed through the accounts controlled by the scheme accounted for about two-thirds of the buy and sell volumes in Koyo shares during that period.

76     As for the extent of damage wrought by the scheme, I noted that after the trade with caution warning was issued by SGX, Koyo’s share price crashed by more than 84% and market capitalisation of Koyo tumbled by more than $58 million.

77     The contra trading losses that resulted from the crash in Koyo’s share price totalled about $3.1 million of which about $2.3 million was borne by the account holders and $399,953.14 was borne by the brokerage firms. The unpaid outstanding losses suffered by the brokerage firms was reduced to $69,834.96 after the Accused paid CIMB pursuant to legal action taken against her.

78     However, I agreed with the defence that the actual extent of harm caused to innocent third parties was ameliorated by the fact that at the material time, only approximately one-third of Koyo shares were floating while the CEO of Koyo and/or his family held most of the remaining shares. Furthermore, the account holders had knowingly ceded control of their accounts to be used in trading Koyo shares in return for profits. Hence, they could not be considered to be truly innocent, blameless victims.

#### Co-accused sentences, sentencing precedents and other sentencing considerations

79     Having analysed the facts and circumstances of this case, I next reviewed and considered the sentences meted out against the co-accused persons, as well as the sentencing precedents cited by the parties.

80     In their submissions on sentence, the prosecution sought to persuade the Court to refer to the sentences in the sentencing precedents and make appropriate downward adjustments, while the defence urged the Court to calibrate sentence based on the sentences meted out to Yeo and the other co-accused persons.

81     I should clarify that I did not adopt either approach. Instead, I employed both the sentences meted out against the co-accused persons as well those imposed in the sentencing precedents as guideposts in assessing sentence in this case.

82     I first analysed the sentences meted out against the co-accused persons. In doing so, I found the comparison set out by the prosecution in their submissions to be helpful and representative of the differentiating factors between them and the Accused.[^14] That said, I did not agree with the prosecution’s characterisation of the Accused’s role as that of a “mastermind” together with Andrew and Simon. As I have observed in my brief oral grounds, the Accused was neither the initiator nor one of the directing minds of the scheme. The facts also showed that she had all along operated under Andrew’s directions, and the orders and trades in Koyo shares conducted through the 31 trading accounts contributed by the Accused were all placed on Andrew’s instructions.

83     On the other hand, I was unable to agree with the defence’s contention that the Accused’s overall criminality was the same as that of Yeo’s or that she should receive similar sentences to those meted out to him. As mentioned in the earlier paragraph, I agreed with the distinguishing factors highlighted by the prosecution in their submissions on sentence. Aside from the significant differences in the number of accounts contributed and number of the trades conducted therefrom, I noted that Yeo played a relatively passive role as compared to the Accused, by contributing his own accounts to the scheme and acting as a runner to settle contra losses in accounts held by other scheme members. In contrast, the Accused essentially played the role of a recruiter for the scheme, by actively reaching out to her clients and family members to persuade them to allow her to use their accounts to trade Koyo shares. In doing so, she had breached the position of trust and her duty of fidelity towards her clients. In the later part of the scheme, she also obtained the assistance of Celestine to help in executing the trades in KGI accounts, by informing Celestine that she was unable to do so as her trading licence had yet to be transferred in the process of her moving from CIMB to KGI.

84     In terms of reward, it was also clear that the Accused had profited more from the scheme than Yeo, as she earned a commission from each trade conducted from a CIMB account contributed by her and, for six months, she also received a further commission from the resulting profits from contra trading. In view of the above, I assessed the culpability of the Accused to be distinctly higher than that of Yeo’s. Thus, the sentences meted out against the Accused must be much harsher than those meted out to Yeo, in order to reflect their different degrees of criminality.

85     Turning to the sentencing precedents, I found the case of _Goh Hin Calm_ to be the most apposite, especially in considering the sentence for the market rigging charge. Indeed, I agreed with the prosecution that amongst all the sentencing precedents, _Goh Hin Calm_ was most similar, in terms of the nature and modus operandi of the scheme, to the case at hand. Goh faced a total of six charges under section 197(1)(b) of the Act read with section 109 of the Penal Code, for intentionally aiding the masterminds in perpetrating a market manipulation scheme in relation to three companies. He pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.

86     In relation to the market rigging charge, the prosecution urged the Court to calibrate downwards from the 36 months’ imprisonment sentence meted out to Goh and impose a 30 months’ imprisonment term against the Accused. While the prosecution acknowledged that _Goh Hin Calm_ involved a scheme which was on a completely different and much larger scale, the prosecution submitted that this should be balanced against the fact that Goh was not motivated by financial gain and that his role was quite limited in the scheme.

87     Having studied the case details in _Goh Hin Calm_ carefully,[^15] I noted that aside from acting as a runner to settle contra losses and providing the scheme with a total of ten trading accounts (belonging to him and his wife) for its use, Goh had:

> (a)     facilitated the opening of another seven trading accounts by four other individuals for use by the scheme;[^16]

> (b)     assisted to manage the financing for the trading accounts controlled by the masterminds (including managing a large pool of funds which he utilised to pay for contra losses in the trading accounts);[^17]

> (c)     breached the fiduciary duties[^18] / duty of fidelity which he owed to various companies in which he served as director by not doing anything even when he suspected that the corporate trading accounts held in their names (or by their subsidiaries) were being misused by the masterminds;[^19] and

> (d)     abused his position in the company where he served as senior finance and administrative manager, by asking his subordinates to assist in various tasks concerning the scheme.

88     Indeed, in their submissions in _Goh Hin Calm_, the prosecution described Goh to be “in effect both seed funder and finance manager” of the scheme, and submitted that his assistance to the masterminds was “material and instrumental to the success of their scheme”. [^20] Thus, Goh’s overall culpability could not, in my view, be described to be relatively lower than that of the Accused in our case. In addition, Goh had faced a total six market rigging charges involving shares in three companies and had pleaded guilty to two, with the remaining charges taken into consideration for sentencing, while the Accused faced only a single charge of this nature involving shares in one company. In view of the above, and taking into consideration the level of damage and harm brought on by the scheme in _Goh Hin Calm_, I disagreed with the prosecution’s submissions that a downward adjustment of 6 months from Goh’s sentence to arrive at a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment against the Accused for the market rigging charge would be appropriate in the current case.

89     Instead, I was of the view that a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for the market rigging offence would be appropriate and proportionate to the Accused’s overall criminality.

90     As for the deceptive practice charges, I noted that sentences of 3 weeks’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment per charge were imposed against Rayson and Yeo respectively for similar offences. At the same time, I was cognisant of the distinguishing factors. Rayson faced a total of four charges under section 201(b) of the Act involving the use of four of his clients’ accounts which had already been employed in the scheme prior to his involvement. Yeo faced a total of ten charges under the same section involving the use of his own accounts. In contrast, the Accused faced a total of 31 charges relating to the use of 31 accounts which were harnessed by her for the scheme from her clients and family members. With regards to the nine charges relating to the CIMB accounts (which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing), I noted that the party deceived was the Accused’s own employers to whom she owed the duty of fidelity.

91     I had also considered the sentencing precedent in _Prem Hirubalan_ where 3 months’ imprisonment was imposed on a charge under section 201(b) of the Act, as well as the prosecution’s submission that a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment per charge (with three such sentences to run consecutively) would be appropriate in the present case. After careful deliberation, I was of the view that a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with three such sentences to run consecutively, would be a fair and just sentence for the Accused in relation to the deceptive practice charges.

92     I should add that in calibrating sentence, I did not give any sentencing discount to the Accused on account of the “inordinate delay” alleged by the defence. In view of the complexity and scale of the scheme, I was not persuaded that there was any unreasonable or undue delay on the part of the prosecution that would warrant leniency to be exercised towards the Accused.

93     However, in the Accused’s favour, I had taken into consideration the mitigating factors put forth by the defence, namely the Accused’s cooperation during the course of investigations, her genuine remorse, and her rehabilitative efforts by immersing herself in working with charitable organisations in fund-raising and outreach to those in need.

### Sentence imposed

94     Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, and bearing in mind the principles of proportionality, parity and totality, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.54%"> <col width="51.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 928628 – 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DACs 929620 to 929621, 929624 to 929630, 929633 to 929635 – 2019</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(12 counts)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

95     I further ordered the sentences of imprisonment for DAC 928628–2019, DAC 929626–2019, DAC 929628–2019 and DAC 929635-2019 to run consecutively.

96     The total net sentence was therefore _20 months’ and 18 weeks’ imprisonment._ In my view, this sentence was proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.
