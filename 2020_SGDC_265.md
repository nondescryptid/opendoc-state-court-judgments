### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## The Charge

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge.

> You, Ong Kah Heng, … …, are charged in this amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev Ed), that you, on 111 occasions between 2005 and 2012, in Singapore did embark on a course of conduct of engaging in conspiracies with Yap Kok Leong and Leong Swee Sum to cheat SMM Pte Ltd (“SMM”), and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order for doing of that thing, you dishonestly concealed from SMM that you would receive a portion of the payments SMM made to Daycon Pte Ltd (“Daycon”) and A-One Contracting Services (“A-One”), which you were not permitted to do, when awarding the respective jobs to Daycon and A-One and by such manner of deception, SMM was dishonestly induced into delivering property to Daycon and A-One, to wit, by making a total payment of $1,089,431.13 for these jobs, which acts were committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       In a nutshell, this is a cheating offence. The punishment prescribed by law is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

## Statement of Facts

3       The Accused admitted, without qualification, to a Statement of Facts (“SOF”) prepared by the Prosecution. I set out the entire SOF below, excluding the two Annexes.

> I.     Introduction

> 1.    The Accused is Ong Kah Heng (“the Accused”), a 57-year old male Chinese Singaporean bearing NRIC No.: XXX, (D.O.B. 23 March 1960). At the material time of the offences, Ong was employed by M/s SMM Pte Ltd (“SMM”) as a Principal Facilities Manager and had worked in SMM since December 2000.

> 2.    As part of its business, SMM tendered for maintenance contracts with its clients and acted as Managing Agent on the respective sites under the maintenance contracts for its clients, one of them being the Defence Science and Technology Agency (“DSTA”). One of these sites was Paya Lebar Airbase (“PLAB”). As the Managing Agent for these sites, SMM was responsible for ensuring that all the mechanical and electrical installation were satisfactorily maintained and serviced. SMM was also expected to take care of all the minor repair works to the buildings and M&E installations. These works would be contracted out to registered subcontractors. Whenever registered sub-contractors performed the jobs awarded to them by SMM, they would produce a Certificate of Completion for the job, which would be signed by, _inter alia_, a representative from DSTA, acknowledging that the job was completed. The Certificate of Completion would be used by the sub-contractors to bill SMM for the work done.

> 3.    As Principal Facilities Manager, the Accused’s job scope entailed overseeing the maintenance of sites over which SMM acted as Managing Agent for its clients. The Accused reported to Loh Boon Im, the General Manager of SMM’s Midland Division.

> 4.    The co-accused persons are:

>> a.    Yap Kok Leong (“Yap”), a 55-year old male Chinese Singaporean. At the material time of the offences, Yap was a Director of Daycon Pte Ltd (“Daycon”). Daycon was one of SMM’s approved sub-contractors performing various jobs for SMM at its sites.

>> b.    Leong Swee Sum (“Leong”), the Director of a sole proprietorship M/s A-One Contracting Services (“A-One”). A-One was also one of SMM’s approved sub-contractors performing various jobs for SMM at its sites.

> II.     Facts relating to the Charge (DAC-917475-2019)

> 5.    Sometime in 2005, the Accused was posted to PLAB. Purportedly to cope with delays at the work site involving ad-hoc minor repair works, the Accused began asking the existing workers performing works onsite to help out with the outstanding jobs and he would pay them in cash up-front. The Accused would pay a fixed amount to these workers he identified and the workers would have to get the materials for and perform the works themselves. The Accused did so with the dishonest intention of subsequently claiming reimbursement for the expenses and also obtaining a profit for himself. The Accused knew that he was not permitted to do so, and was supposed to engage approved sub-contractors to perform these works in compliance with SMM’s protocols.

> _Facts relating to Yap Kok Leong & Daycon_

> 6.    In order to get reimbursement for these expenses and obtain a profit from the same, the Accused proposed to Yap that he would submit invoices through Daycon to SMM for the works done by the workers. The Accused told Yap that the said works would be carried out by workers he engaged and that this would be done without SMM’s knowledge. Yap agreed and asked for formal invoices to be submitted to Daycon in order for him to process the payment.

> 7.    The Accused agreed to submit invoices under his father’s name, “Ong Teow Eng”. The Accused and Yap also agreed that Daycon would make payment to “Ong Teow Eng” once payment was received by Daycon from SMM. The two also agreed that Yap would retain 10% of the amount invoiced by “Ong Teow Eng” to Daycon. In reality, “Ong Teow Eng” was not involved in the above arrangement or the works carried out and his name was used as a front by the Accused. Yap knew that the payments to “Ong Teow Eng” would go to the Accused.

> 8.    Pursuant to the plan, the Accused continued to engage workers to perform works at PLAB for SMM’s client. The Accused would then award the works to Daycon, resulting in SMM issuing a work order to Daycon for each works to be performed by the workers the Accused engaged. Once the works were done, Daycon would check to ensure that the work was completed, notwithstanding that it was not done by Daycon’s workers. Daycon would then certify the work as completed and SMM would send a purchase order to Daycon in order to process payment for the works done. The Accused would then deliver an invoice under “Ong Teow Eng” for the corresponding works to Daycon (“the OTE invoices”). After marking up the amount stated in the OTE invoices by 10%, and a further 5% for Goods and Services Tax, Daycon would then issue an invoice for the corresponding works to SMM. After receiving payment from SMM, Yap then paid the amount stated in the OTE invoices to the Accused via uncrossed cheques so that the Accused could encash the cheques over the counter.

> 9.    Both the Accused and Yap knew that the scheme was intended to deceive SMM into believing that Daycon had carried out the said works. For his part, the Accused dishonestly concealed from SMM the fact that he would receive a portion of the payments that SMM made to Daycon in connection with the works when SMM awarded the jobs to Daycon. The Accused knew that he should not have performed the jobs awarded to Daycon and should not have submitted invoices using the name “Ong Teow Eng” to claim for his expenses as it would amount to a conflict of interest. Both the Accused and Yap knew that SMM would not have made payment to Daycon if it knew that Daycon did not perform the work and that a part of the payment to Daycon would go to the Accused. As a result, the works were not in fact performed by Daycon, although they were represented to have been so performed

> 10.    In the manner described above, between 2005 and 2012, the Accused submitted 110 OTE invoices to Yap. Yap then added the agreed mark-up as stated at paragraph 8 above and Daycon submitted invoices to SMM for a total value of $1,072,029.54. In total, SMM paid the sum of $1,072,029.54 for the works set out in the 110 OTE invoices. The details of these 110 OTE invoices, with the description of relevant works and the amounts paid by SMM to Daycon, are set out in S/Ns 1 to 110 of ANNEX A – Table of OTE Invoices, Description of Work, and Amount Paid.

> _Facts relating to Leong Swee Sum & A-One_

> 11.    In a similar manner, sometime in 2009, the Accused asked Leong if Leong would submit an invoice to SMM under A-One’s name for works performed by workers that the Accused engaged. The Accused proposed that once SMM paid A-One for the said works, Leong was to pay the invoiced amount to the Accused. Leong agreed to the Accused’s request.

> 12.    Similarly, both the Accused and Leong knew that the scheme was intended to deceive SMM into believing that A-One had carried out the said works. The Accused also dishonestly concealed from SMM the fact that he would receive a portion of the payments that SMM made to A-One when SMM awarded the jobs to A-One. The Accused knew that he should not have performed the jobs awarded to A-One and should not have submitted invoices using the name “Ong Teow Eng” to claim for his expenses as it would amount to a conflict of interest. Both the Accused and Leong knew that SMM would not have made payment to A-One if it knew that A-One did not perform the work and that a portion of the payment made by SMM to A-One would go to the Accused. As a result, the works were not in fact performed by A-One, although they were represented to have been so performed.

> 13.    In pursuance of this conspiracy, the Accused submitted an invoice under “Ong Teow Eng” for a sum of $16,532 for renovation works done to Leong. Leong in turn submitted an invoice under A-One to SMM for the corresponding works for a sum of $17,401.59. SMM later made payment to A-One and Leong passed the entire sum to the Accused via a cash cheque. The details of this invoice, with the description of the relevant works and the amount paid by SMM to A-One, are set out in S/N 111 of ANNEX A – Table of OTE Invoices, Description of Work, and Amount Paid. Subsequently, the Accused gave a sum of $2,000 to Leong.

> 14.    The Accused’s actions were also not in compliance with the requires of SMM’s employee handbook and were against company policy.

> 15.    By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused had on 111 occasions between 2005 and 2012, in Singapore, embarked on a course of conduct of engaging in conspiracies with Yap and Leong to cheat SMM, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, the Accused dishonestly concealed from SMM the fact that he would receive a portion of the payments that SMM made to Daycon and A-One, which he was not permitted to do, when awarding the respective jobs to Daycon and A-One, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly inducing SMM into delivering property to Daycon and A-One, to wit, by making a payment of a total of $1,089.431.13 for the jobs, which acts were committed in consequence of his abetment. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 417 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which is an amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

> 16.    SMM subsequently commenced civil action against the Accused for, inter alia, breach of duties owed to it by the Accused. The Accused settled the matter with SMM, agreeing to pay $20,112.53 to SMM, which represented his calculations of his estimated profit from the above schemes involving the works purportedly done by Daycon and A-One over the period of 2005 to 2012. The court order in respect of the settlement between the Accused and SMM dated 21 November 2017 is enclosed at ANNEX B. The Accused subsequently paid the sum of $20,112.53 to SMM

> 17.    In the course of investigations, the Accused admitted that the total margin he obtained, after deducting all the cost, was roughly 8 – 10% of the total claims that was submitted by him to Daycon, which was about $60,000. Investigations have been unable to uncover the exact cost incurred by the Accused in performing the works set out in ANNEX A, as the Accused kept no records of the same. Investigations have also been unable to verify if the sum of $20,122.53 paid by the Accused represents the actual amount of secret profit that he obtained at SMM’s expense by virtue of the scheme with Yap and Leong.

> 18.    The Accused is untraced and stands charged accordingly.

4       I found the Accused guilty and convicted him accordingly.

5       The Accused does not have any criminal antecedent.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

6       The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 8 months’ imprisonment. Briefly, its main argument was two-fold : firstly, a custodial sentence is warranted where the victim was caused to part with property of more than negligible value; and secondly, the greater the economic value involved, the heavier the sentence should be. The Prosecution cited the High Court’s decisions in _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya_”) and _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> (“_Gan Chai Bee_”) in support of its submission.

7       The Prosecution submitted that the amounts paid out by SMM was in the region of $1.08 million. In terms of the benefit retained by the Accused, it was at least $20,000 and could be as high as $60,000.

8       The Prosecution further submitted that the scheme was premeditated and sophisticated for it involved fabricating a veneer of legitimacy on both the accounting books of SMM as well as Daycon. The Accused has created false invoices to pass accounting scrutiny. In using his father’s name on these false invoices, it made it more difficult for the payment to be traced to the Accused. The entire scheme went on for seven years.

9       The Prosecution also highlighted that the scheme had resulted in Yap or Daycon obtaining payment for works that it never performed, which payment roughly was in the region of $90,000.

10     The Prosecution submitted that limited mitigating weight should be given to the fact that the works were actually performed because SMM was deprived of its legitimate right to have the repair works done by the contractor of its choice and being assured of the quality of such works.

11     The Prosecution referred the court to several case precedents to highlight the sentences given for the cheating offence under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). Reproduced below in a tabular form are the pertinent information highlighted by the Prosecution correlating the amount cheated with the sentence imposed.

12     Using these case precedents as a guide, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting sentence should be six months’ imprisonment. In its calibration, the Prosecution took into account the benefit retained by the Accused, in the sum of at least $20,000 up to $60,000, and it also factored in the financial gains obtained by Daycon. The Prosecution further submitted that an upward adjustment of two months’ imprisonment is appropriate to account for the serial nature of the Accused’s offending over a span of seven years. In their assessment, a sentence of at least 8 months’ imprisonment would be fair and just.

## Defence’s mitigation plea and address on sentence

### Mitigation Plea

13     The main plank of the Defence’s argument was that all the repair works were carried out satisfactorily and that there was no complaint from PLAB or SMM.

14     Secondly, the amount (_i.e._ $1,089,000.00) averred on the charge does not represent the victim’s loss. The victim was not cheated of the said sum of money. The said sum was simply representative of the total value of works done, cost of material supplied, and services rendered by the Accused. In return, the repair works were carried out to the satisfaction of PLAB and SMM. The Defence also submitted that all the repair works carried out by the Accused were billed in accordance with the schedule of agreed costs under the main contract. No allegation of over-charging was ever made.

15     Thirdly, the Accused and SMM have settled their civil suit in which there was a consent judgment of $20,112.53 payable by the Accused to SMM. The Defence submitted that the sum of $20,112.53 does not represent SMM’s loss. Instead, it represented the quantification agreed between the Accused and SMM of the secret margins obtained by the Accused. As the Accused has paid $20,112.53 to SMM before he was even prosecuted for the present offence, the Defence submitted that the Accused had already disgorged the secret margins he has made.

16     Finally, the Defence submitted that the Accused’s overwhelming motivation, albeit through improper means, was to get the repair and maintenance works done and this would enable SMM to avoid the constraints of lack of manpower which possibly could lead to complaints by SMM’s customer or even the claiming of liquidated damages. On the contrary, the Defence submitted that SMM has benefitted. The Defence’s argument was that SMM issued their bills of costs to its customer with a 10% mark-up on top of the disbursement they paid to the Accused. Even with this mark-up, SMM’s costings were well within its main contract with its customer.

### Defence’s submission on sentence

17     The Defence submitted that a fine would be an appropriate sentence because no actual loss in monetary terms was suffered by SMM and its customer.

18     In the alternative, the Defence submitted that a nominal one day’s imprisonment would suffice. The Defence made this concession on account of the Accused’s submission of the invoices, in the name of the Accused’s father, through Daycon, as the causation leading to the payments by SMM. The Accused’s father has no role in the Accused’s scheme other than having his name used in the invoices. Daycon’s involvement in the repairs work was solely to ensure that all works were carried out as stated by the Accused.

19     The Defence distinguished the case precedents cited by the Prosecution on the ground that all of the cases, without any exception, represented victims who have been cheated out of their money without getting any valuable benefit or consideration in return.

In contrast, on the facts of this case, SMM could claim reimbursement from its customer under the main contract.

### Prosecution’s reply to the Defence’s mitigation plea

20     The Prosecution did not agree with the Defence’s characterisation of the Accused as a good employee. The Prosecution argued that the Accused should have used a registered sub-contractor to perform the works and not just simply certify the works that he had done in execution of the scheme he had devised.

21     The Prosecution highlighted that in dishonestly concealing the facts that the works were not done by the registered sub-contractors and that he would be paid, the Accused has acted in breach of his duty to SMM. The Accused’s scheme involved him profiteering when the works were not carried actually performed by the registered sub-contractors. The Accused’s failure to disclose these facts led to him dishonestly making financial gains at the expense of SMM.

22     The Prosecution submitted that the fact that the repairs works were performed and that there were no complaints raised simply meant that there was no additional aggravating factor. The lack of an aggravating factor is merely neutral. It is not mitigating in the Accused’s favour.

## Court’s decision on sentence

### Applicable sentencing principle

23     In my judgment, general deterrence is applicable to this case. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender. Deterrence is generally not displaced as an applicable sentencing consideration even where an offender demonstrates that he was labouring under familial and financial hardships during the commission of the offence: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[24\] – \[25\], \[27\] and \[29\].

24     I also held the view that specific deterrence in sentencing was applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\].

### Crossing the custodial threshold

25     I was unable to agree with the Defence’s submissions that a fine or a nominal one day imprisonment would be an adequate punishment. I followed the decision of _Idya._ In _Idya_, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 417 PC and two charges under the Passports Act (Cap 220, 2008 Rev Ed). In dealing with the s 417 PC offence, CJ Menon held that a custodial sentence is generally appropriate where the offence causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value. The sums involved in _Idya’s_ case were $1,800 (“1st cheating offence”) and $10,509 (“2nd cheating offence”), and they were found to be significant amounts justifying the imposition of a custodial sentence. Applying _Idya_ to the present case, the sums illegally gained by the Accused through his scheme certainly were more than negligible value. A custodial sentence was warranted in this case.

26     Moreover, this was a case in which fraudulent invoices were used and there was dishonest concealment of material facts as part of the overall scheme. Accordingly, there was all the more reason for the imposition of a custodial sentence.

27     I was persuaded by the Defence’s submissions that the Accused’s scheme has allowed PLAB to operate without disruption and that SMM was able to keep to its scope of work under the main contract without suffering any financial detriment. That said, when the mitigating weight is measured against the strong need for deterrence in this case, as well as the aggravating factors present in this case, the mitigation was significantly insufficient to tilt the balance from a custodial sentence to a non-custodial sentence.

### Sentence imposed

28     Having found that a fine is not a suitable offence, I now turn to address the issue of the appropriate length of imprisonment to impose. At the outset, it is my judgment that a nominal one day’s imprisonment is certainly manifestly inadequate. The case precedents cited by the Prosecution showed that an imprisonment term of one month has been meted out where the amount cheated was as low as $1,200.

29     It is a well-established general principle “that in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence” : _Gan Chai Bee_ at \[42\] which followed _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 334 at \[47\] and _Lim Ying Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[69\]. I was also conscious that “the court’s discretion in sentencing is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question. … The appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived at after having regard not just to the amounts in question, but also to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case” : _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> at \[368\].

30     The Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting sentence should be six months’ imprisonment. They had based it on the premise that the benefit gained by the Accused could be as high as $60,000 after deducting all the cost. However, the investigations have been unable to uncover the exact cost incurred by the Accused. In my judgment, there is a reasonable doubt in respect of the exact amount the Accused has gained from his scheme, and it was unsafe to use the sum of $60,000 to set the indicative starting sentence. It is not in dispute that SMM has sued the Accused and they have come to a settlement at $20,112.53. The Defence submitted that this amount represented the quantification agreed between the Accused and SMM of the secret margins obtained by the Accused. The Prosecution did not dispute the Defence’s contention. In the circumstances, I found this to be the best evidence in determining the secret profits gained by the Accused.

31     I have reviewed the case precedents cited by the Prosecution carefully. I found that there is no consistent trend or pattern. In my assessment, these case precedents showed that the indicative starting sentence involving sums between $15,000 to $25,000 lies in the range of three to four months’ imprisonment. Thereafter, the courts would consider the presence and absence of aggravating and mitigating factors and the weight to be attached to these factors. This probably explain why the the final sentences imposed ranged between three to five months’ imprisonment (see _PP v Chen Young Ja, PP v Lee Hwai San Adrian Matthew, PP v Chen Chen Chang and PP v Hong Sang Young_ at \[11\]). In the present case, it is my assessment that the indicative starting sentence should be three months’ imprisonment.

32     The next step is to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors and then consider whether the indicative sentence ought to be adjusted upwards or downwards. I agreed with the aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution (see \[8\] above). In particular, the fact that a single amalgamated charge was preferred in respect of the serial nature of the Accused’s offending over a significant period of time, coupled with the used of false invoices, merited significant weight. I have noted that the Accused has left the workers to source and buy the materials and to do the repairs works (see paragraph \[5\] of the SOF above). There was clearly a lack of quality control and supervision. I found this to be another aggravating factor. At the other end of the scale, the Accused has pleaded guilty and this has saved valuable public resources and time. As all the repair works were found to be satisfactory and there being no complaints of shoddy work, some weight is to be given in the Accused’s favour. In my judgment, the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, and an uplift of one month’s imprisonment should be added to the indicative starting sentence. At this stage of my deliberation, the sentence I have reached is four months’ imprisonment.

33     Finally, as a check of consistency, I consider the term of four months’ imprisonment that I have arrived at in the context of the earlier case involving similar amount of money cheated. In _PP v Hang Sang Young_ (see \[11\] and \[19\] above), where the secret profit amounted to $25,000, the sentence imposed was five months’ imprisonment. The victim in _PP v Hang Sang Young_ did not receive any benefit at all. In the present case, the repair works were rendered and the customer was satisfied with the work done. I am satisfied that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment would be fair and just. I thus imposed a four-month imprisonment term on the Accused.

## Conclusion

34     It is my judgment that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment was on the whole proportionate to the Accused’s culpability, the length of the offending, the amount he had gained illegally through the scheme, and takes into account that the repair works were carried satisfactorily and that there had been no complaints by either SMM or PLAB. The said sentence provides a delicate balance that would deter the Accused from reoffending in the future and deter others from engaging in similar conduct.

35     The Accused and the Prosecution were dissatisfied with the sentence imposed. Each of them has filed an appeal against sentence. Pending the hearing of the appeal in the High Court, I have granted the Defence’s application for the Accused to be released on bail.
