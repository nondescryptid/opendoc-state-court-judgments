### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to one charge of failing to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse to a Central Narcotics Bureau officer. Sixteen other charges were stood down for the trial.

2       The Accused argued that his mental and physical state was affected by his intoxication (alcohol, sleeping pills and other substances) to the extent that he had a reasonable excuse not to provide a urine specimen.

3       All things considered, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Accused was convicted on the proceeded charge.

4       The Prosecution asked for 9 years’ Corrective Training (“CT”), an enhanced sentence of 247 days and 6 strokes of the cane. The formative arc of CT was traced in _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span>.

5       I sentenced the Accused to 8 years’ CT, an enhanced sentence of 247 days and 6 strokes of the cane. He has appealed against conviction and sentence. I set out my reasons.

## Charges and legal context

6       The Accused claimed trial to one charge under s 31(2) punishable under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) and s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (DAC 907780-2020).

> You, Muhammad Mustafa Bin Mohd Haniffa, are charged that you, on 5 February 2020 at about 10.50 pm, at Changi General Hospital (Ward 18 Bed 6), Singapore, failed to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse to an officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau – Sgt Abdul Azmin bin Abdul Rahman, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed),

> and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 15 February 2016, convicted of an offence for the consumption of cannabis, a specified drug, _vide_ DAC 942606/2015 in State Court No. 18, in Singapore under s 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA, and sentenced under s 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction has not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under s 33A(2) of the MDA,

> and further, that you, from 18 May 2019 to 27 January 2021, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), which is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act, and upon your conviction of the said offence, would be deemed to have committed an offence in breach of the basic condition of the remission order, and you are thereby liable under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act to an enhanced sentence not exceeding 358 days representing the remaining duration of the remission order in effect when the said offence was committed.

7       The burden of proof in showing that an accused person had a reasonable excuse lies on the defence: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Farhan bin Ahmad Saifuddin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 108</span> at \[31\].

8       As to what amounts to a “reasonable excuse”, some guidance is provided from an analogous scenario in _Madiaalakan s/o Muthusamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 580</span>. This was a case where an offender failed to provide a breath specimen, which is an offence under s 70(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed). In _Madiaalakan_ at \[9\], the High Court gave examples of a reasonable excuse, such as when the person from whom the specimen was required was “physically or mentally unable to provide it or the provision of the specimen would entail a substantial risk to his health” or when the person was unable to provide a specimen despite having “tried as hard as he could”.[^1]

## Prosecution’s case

9       The Accused failed to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse. He was fit for urine collection.

## Defence’s case

10     The Accused’s mental and physical state was affected by his intoxication (alcohol, sleeping pills and other substances) to the extent that he had a reasonable excuse not to provide a urine specimen. At the material time, his “bladder (was) in pain”,[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) he “really could not give (his) urine as (he has a) problem with (his) bladder” [^3] and he had constipation[^4].

## Ancillary hearing

11      Challenging the Statement’s Voluntariness. The Accused challenged the voluntariness of his long statement. An ancillary hearing was held.

### The Law for Ancillary Hearing

12     Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily and not on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the statements were not made voluntarily: _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> (“_Kadar_”) at \[177\], and _Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 733</span> at \[19\]-\[27\] (Ho Hock Lai, _On the Obtaining and Admissibility of Incriminating Statements_, SJLS \[2016\] 249 at 253-255 and 260-261).

13     It is only necessary for the Prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: _Panya Martmontree v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 806</span> at \[32\] (Chin Tet Yung, _Criminal Procedure Code 2010: Confessions and Statements by Accused Persons Revisited_, <span class="citation">(2012) 24 SAcLJ 60</span> at \[16\]-\[33\] and \[52\]-\[53\]).

14     The voluntariness test is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective: _Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 557</span> at \[39\]. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise. The subjective limb is satisfied when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the offender’s mind through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\] (Dorcas Quek, _The Concept of Voluntariness in the Law of Confessions_, <span class="citation">(2005) 17 SAcLJ 819</span> at \[35\]).

15     The Court of Appeal in _Garnam Singh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 1044</span> at \[31\] stated that “in order for the effects of withdrawal from drugs to affect the drug user’s medical and psychological condition to render any statement he makes to be involuntary, he must be in a state of near delirium, that is to say, that his mind did not go with the statements he was making”.

16     The litmus test for oppression is whether the investigation was, by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances, such as to affect the accused person’s mind and will such that he speaks when he otherwise would have remained silent: _Tey Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1189</span> at \[113\]. The same standard applies even where the allegation is not that the accused person would have remained silent, but that he would have given a different version of the statement, had he not been oppressed: _Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 105</span> at \[52\].

17     The Court of Appeal in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ summarised the test for oppression as follows (at \[56\]-\[57\]): “(o)ppression is a circumstance which may render a confession involuntary and thus inadmissible, and whether the accused has been subjected to oppression is a question of fact … In other words, a statement would not be extracted by oppression unless the accused was in such a state that his will was ‘sapped’ and he could not resist making a statement which he would otherwise not have made”.

18     In this regard, Explanation 1 to s 258 of the CPC states that:

> If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that _his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement_, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible. \[emphasis added\]

19     Explanation 2(b) to s 258 of the CPC states that “If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances: … (b) when the accused was intoxicated”.

20     Even if an accused person’s statement is voluntary, the court can exclude it if its prejudicial value outweighs its probative value, for example, where there is lack of language interpretation or procedural flaws in the recording which cast serious doubts on the accuracy of the statement recorded: _Kadar_ at \[53\]-\[56\] and _Sulaiman bin Jumari_ at \[54\].

#### (a)   Allegation against the recorder

21     The Defence alleged that Sgt Abdul Azmin bin Abdul Rahman[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) had recorded a long statement even though the Accused was not in a proper mental and physical state to provide a statement.[^6] This was because he had been intoxicated by Ethanol, Nitrazepam, Nordiazepam, Tramadol,[^7] Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, and Benzhexol.[^8] This was essentially a claim of oppression, which arose individually or cumulatively from the following factors:[^9]

> (a)     He had drunk alcohol prior to his arrest and was under its influence at the material time;

> (b)     He had purchased and consumed illegal sleeping pills that could have contained benzodiazepines or any other unknown substances;

> (c)     It was possible that he held on to the prescribed medication issued by Changi Prison upon his release in June 2019 and had consumed it some 8 to 9 months later prior to his arrest; and

> (d)     He was suffering from withdrawal symptoms as he was dependent on all of the above substances.

#### (b)   Long statement was voluntarily given

22     After the ancillary hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the long statement recorded on 5 February 2020 at 10.55p.m. had been voluntarily given.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) I accepted the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses.

##### (1)   HSA analyst’s evidence

23     Ms Fu Baohui,[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) an analyst from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”), stated that all the substances found in the HSA toxicology report[^12] were within the therapeutic range:[^13]

> 
| 

7-Aminonitrazepam

 | 

Detected

 |
| 

Ethanol

 | 

< 20 mg/100ml

 |
| 

Nitrazepam

 | 

0.05 μg/ml

 |
| 

Nordiazepam

 | 

< 0.02 μg/ml

 |
| 

Tramadol

 | 

0.10 μg/ml

 |
| 

… …

 |

  
  

24     She testified that ethanol at “< 20 mg/100ml”[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) has essentially no apparent effect on the Accused.[^15]

25     Mirtazapine and Benzhexol were not found in the Accused’s blood sample.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

##### (2)   Nurse’s evidence

26     Senior Enrolled Nurse Siti Noraishah binte Mohd Senin[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) testified that the Accused was orientated to time, place and person, and he was conscious and alert on 5 February 2020.[^18] He also obtained the maximum score of 15 on the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS),[^19] which took place shortly before the recording of his long statement.[^20]

##### (3)   Doctor’s evidence

27     Dr Jacob[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) testified that it was unlikely that the Accused had an adjustment disorder on 17 Feb 2020.[^22] People with an adjustment disorder[^23] can make decisions in daily life.[^24] An adjustment disorder generally does not impair mental capacity.[^25]

28     Dr Jacob stated that Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, and Benzhexol[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) were given to the Accused on 11 May 2019; these medications would only last for 5 days until 15 May 2019.[^27] This was about 8 months before 5 February 2020.[^28] The Accused had informed Dr Jacob that he did not go to the Institute of Mental Health to get these medications.[^29] The Accused was also not prescribed these medications in prison.[^30] And these medications cannot be bought over the counter in Singapore.[^31] The clinical notes stated that the Accused “denies any ingestion of illegal substances”.[^32]

29     The Changi General Hospital clinical notes show the following results for CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment):[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

> (a)     5 February 2020 prior to Dr Ong Li Anne’s consultation (a score of 1);[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

> (b)     6 February 2020 at 5.08 a.m. (a score of 1 for both alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal);[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) and

> (c)     6 February 2020 at 7.09 a.m. (a score of 2 for alcohol withdrawal and a score of 3 for benzodiazepine withdrawal).[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

> The lowest CIWA score is 0 (i.e. no withdrawal symptoms).[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) The highest CIWA score is 60 (i.e. very severe withdrawal symptoms).[^38]

30     Dr Jacob’s unchallenged evidence was that the Accused’s chance of alcohol withdrawal on 5 February 2020 was almost nil.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) Assuming that the Accused started with an alcohol level of 200 mg per 100 ml on 4 February 2020 (arrest date), the alcohol level would drop 15-20 mg every hour so in about 10 to 12 hours, his alcohol level would be zero.[^40]

31     The Accused obtained the maximum score of 15 on the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) for his eye, verbal and motor responses.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) This means that he was fully conscious and fully alert.[^42]

32     Dr Jacob noted that the Accused was able to understand the questions and give relevant answers to Dr Ong Li Anne on 5 February 2020.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) He told her that he had been a delivery driver for one day and his parents had passed away.[^44] Replying to the Accused’s claim that some of what he had told Dr Ong was not true, Dr Jacob testified that lying is a conscious decision;[^45] Dr Jacob stated that a person who is experiencing severe withdrawal would be unable to selectively provide both true and false answers.[^46]

33     Additionally, Dr Jacob noted that the Accused was able to pick up on an unrelated conversation between Sergeant Abdul Azmin bin Abdul Rahman (Sgt Abdul Azmin)[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47) and Senior Staff Sergeant Palan Hemmamalani (“SSSgt Palan”)[^48] that did not involve the Accused.[^49] The Accused was also able to discern SSSgt Palan’s rank and could even pose questions to her about it, showing that he was aware of what was happening around him.[^50]

34     When the Accused claimed that the CNB officers had provoked him into behaving aggressively, Dr Jacob noted that this showed that he was angry and thus, he shouted vulgarities at the officers.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) In other words, the Accused’s logical response to stimuli supports Dr Jacob’s conclusion that he was aware of what was happening around him when the long statement was recorded.[^52]

##### (4)   CNB officers’ evidence

35     Both Sgt Abdul Azmin[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) and SSSgt Palan[^54] testified that during the recording of the long statement, the Accused did not go to the washroom.[^55] If the Accused had done so, Sgt Abdul Azmin would have noted this in the long statement and paused its recording but nothing of that nature took place.[^56]

36     The audio-recording of their interactions with the Accused showed that his responses were based directly on the CNB officers’ questions to him.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) The instances of the Accused shouting while his long statement was recorded was not done indiscriminately, but often as an immediate response when Sgt Abdul Azmin spoke to him in relation to providing a urine sample.[^58]

##### (5)   Contents of long statement show that the Accused was sufficiently alert

37     The court is entitled to examine the contents of an impugned statement to determine whether it should be excluded or not. This is particularly so in situations such as the present where the allegations centred on the level of alertness and consciousness of the person making the statement.

38     The paramount concern of the court here is the reliability of the statement and it would be artificial and against common sense not to look at the contents of the statement when deciding whether there was prejudicial effect that outweighed its probative value. This is because the answers in the statement may reveal facts which were known only to the person making the statement or details which could not have been uttered by a person who was so mentally exhausted or confused or who was drifting in and out of consciousness: _Sulaiman bin Jumari_ at \[85\] and _Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGCA 103</span> at \[62\]-\[64\] (see generally, _Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 268</span> at \[19\]-\[20\]).

39     In the present case, the contents of the long statement show that the Accused was sufficiently alert. For example, he was able to answer the recorder’s questions as follows:

> 1\. Mustafa, How are you feeling?

> Answer: Not good.

> 2\. Why not good?

> Answer: You ask doctor.

> 3\. The doctor has certified you fit to provide urine, is there any reason you are not giving your urine samples for testing?

> Answer: My bladder is in pain.

> 4\. Are you willing to give your urine?

> **Answer: Thank you for coming you all can fuck off.**

> …

> 8\. Based on your records, do you know that drugs will only stay in your urine for a certain period of time and failing to provide your urine samples now, would strip your chance to prove your innocence in the future?

> Answer: No answer. **Until you two bastards fuck off, I will no (sic) stop making noise.**

> \[Emphasis added\]

40     Taken as a whole, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the long statement had been voluntarily given.

41     In other words, the evidence did not point to the Accused being in a physical or mental state such that the long statement should not be admitted. Indeed, the surrounding evidence of the recording of the long statement, the audio-recording,[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) the witnesses’ testimony, and the long statement itself, indicated that the Accused was lucid: _Public Prosecutor v Lokman bin Abdul Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 48</span> at \[53\].

### Summary for ancillary hearing

42     In sum, I found that the long statement[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) was voluntarily given. I was mindful that a trial judge has a discretion, and indeed a duty, throughout the trial to reconsider his decision to admit statements given by an accused person if further evidence emerges that raises doubt about their admissibility: ss 279(7) and 279(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) (see _Tan Lye Heng_ at \[2\] and \[24\]-\[36\]).

43     My finding that the long statement was voluntarily given was fortified by four points.

44     First, Dr Ong Li Anne[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) testified that the Accused was orientated to place and person.[^62] He was aware that there were nurses present and he asked them for food.[^63] He was aware that officers had brought him to the hospital.[^64] The Accused hurled vulgarities at the officers but not at Dr Ong;[^65] the Accused was a lot more hostile and aggressive in terms of his language and tone used in responding to the officers compared with Dr Ong.[^66] The Accused engaged with Dr Ong during the review.[^67] He provided his relative’s telephone number from memory.[^68]

45     Dr Ong Li Anne stated that just because somebody was acutely intoxicated on a particular substance does not mean that they are definitely unaware of their surroundings or unable to make decisions.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69)

46     Dr Ong Li Anne confirmed that on 5 February 2020, the Accused was not prescribed Mirtazapine or Benzhexol[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70).[^71]

47     Second, Dr Raymond Fong Kok Choon[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) testified that the Accused was alert on 5 February 2020.[^73] He was orientated as to time, place and person.[^74] The Accused’s neurological power (4 out of 5) was quite good, and he was able to follow commands and instructions.[^75]

48     Third, the medical case notes for 5 February 2020 stated that “(the Accused) left ward conscious and alert accompanied by police and porter”.

49     Fourth, ASP Ng Zhi Hao testified that during the recoding of the cautioned statement on 10 February 2020, the Accused made no mention of his mental state in relation to 5 February 2020.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76)

50     In the circumstances, I gave full weight to the Accused’s long statement (see _Tan Lye Heng_ at \[76\]).

## Issue to be determined

### Whether the Accused’s mental and physical state was affected by his intoxication (alcohol, sleeping pills and other substances) to the extent that he had a reasonable excuse not to provide a urine specimen?

#### (a)   Toxicology report of the Health Sciences Authority

51     The Accused claimed that his mental and physical state was affected by his intoxication to the extent that he had a reasonable excuse not to provide a urine specimen.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) To support his claim, the Accused pointed to the Health Sciences Authority’s (“HSA”) toxicology report[^78], which stated as follows:

> 
| 

7-Aminonitrazepam

 | 

Detected

 |
| 

Ethanol

 | 

< 20 mg/100ml

 |
| 

Nitrazepam

 | 

0.05 μg/ml

 |
| 

Nordiazepam

 | 

< 0.02 μg/ml

 |
| 

Tramadol

 | 

0.10 μg/ml

 |
| 

… …

 |

  
  

52     When the HSA toxicology report was shown to Dr Joshua Loke[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) in court, Dr Loke _initially_ said that he did not think that the Accused could give consent for the urine specimen because:

> (a)     The Accused was aggressive.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80)

> (b)     Tramadol can usually cause someone to be a bit more drowsy and sleepy.[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81) Under the influence of 7-aminonitrazepam, ethanol, nitrazepam, nordiazepam, and tramadol,[^82] the Accused would be sedated and may not be able to grasp what was happening around him.[^83] Dr Loke did not think that the Accused was very aware of what was happening around him.[^84]

53     I was mindful that the responsibility to adjudicate on the issues that are before the court is the court’s alone, and the judge must discharge his responsibility as the adjudicator to rule on the ultimate issue: _Anita Damu v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 825</span> at \[1\] and \[34\]-\[36\].

54     I will analyse Dr Loke’s points in turn.

> (a)      Aggressive. It was unclear why an aggressive person was unable to give consent for a urine specimen. Dr Loke did not appear to provide any explanation. I found it difficult to accept this point.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

> (b)      Sedated. The date and time stated in the charge[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) were 5 February 2020 at about 10.50 p.m. (“the material time”). At the material time, the evidence clearly showed that the Accused was _not_ sedated.[^87]

55     In fact, at the material time, the Accused was moving vigorously and was alert.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88) His alertness found expression in the fact that he afforded different treatment to the CNB officers vis-à-vis the Aetos officer. He was rude and abusive to the CNB officers but respectful and polite to the Aetos officer. Additionally, the Accused understood the CNB officers, as seen by the contents of his long statement.[^89] The Accused’s alertness was also evident from the audio-recording[^90] produced by SSSgt Palan.[^91]

56     After Dr Loke heard the audio-recording,[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92) he resiled from his previous position — he testified that he was unable to tell whether the Accused was able or unwilling to give consent for the urine specimen, and that he did not think that he was in a position to comment on the Accused’s mental state.[^93] Dr Loke is not a psychiatrist.[^94]

57     Importantly, the audio-recording and the Accused’s long statement[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95) were recorded at the material time, _viz._ 5 February 2020 at about 10.50 p.m.. In contrast, his arrest had taken place one day before (4 February 2020) and the arresting officer’s observations of the Accused had to be viewed in that context. The arresting officer, Sergeant Choong Yao Feng[^96] said that the Accused had walked in an unsteady gait and slurred his speech.[^97] Sgt Choong suspected that he could be high on drugs[^98] – when the Accused entered the car, he was in a daze and shouting.[^99] The daze would be for about 15-20 seconds, following by shouting incoherently for about 5-10 seconds and behaving aggressively.[^100] This lasted throughout the 5-10 minute car journey from Bukit Purmei to the Police Cantonment Complex.[^101] The Accused did not smell of alcohol.[^102]

58     The Accused testified that his mental status improved progressively during his admission,[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103) which was also borne out by Dr Raymond Fong’s medical report.[^104] For the tramadol usage, Dr Bartiana Lynna Grace[^105] testified that only about 1%-5% of patients had giddiness or confusion and only with repeated doses and mostly in elderly patients.[^106]

59     Dr Ong Li Anne[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107) testified that the Accused was orientated to place and person.[^108] He was aware that there were nurses present and he asked them for food.[^109] He was aware that officers had brought him to the hospital.[^110] The Accused hurled vulgarities at the officers but not at Dr Ong;[^111] the Accused was a lot more hostile and aggressive in terms of his language and tone used in responding to the officers compared with Dr Ong.[^112] The Accused engaged with Dr Ong during the review.[^113] He provided his relative’s telephone number from memory.[^114]

60     I pause here to note that the Accused also alleged that his mental and physical state was affected by Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, and Benzhexol.[\[note: 115\]](#Ftn_115) I was unable to accept his claim due to three interlacing reasons:

> (a)     Dr Jacob stated that Mirtazapine, Quetiapine, and Benzhexol[\[note: 116\]](#Ftn_116) were given to the Accused on 11 May 2019; these medications would only last for 5 days until 15 May 2019. This was about 8 months before 5 February 2020. The Accused had informed Dr Jacob that he did not go to IMH to get these medications. The Accused was also not prescribed these medications in prison. And these medications cannot be bought over the counter in Singapore. Dr Jacob’s unchallenged evidence was that the Accused’s chance of alcohol withdrawal was almost nil.

> (b)     Dr Ong Li Anne confirmed that on 5 February 2020, the Accused was not prescribed Mirtazapine or Benzhexol[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117).[^118]

> (c)     Mirtazapine and Benzhexol were not found in the Accused’s blood sample.

#### (b)   Accused was alert at the material time

61     The Accused was alert at the material time.[\[note: 119\]](#Ftn_119) SSSgt Palan testified that the Accused was perfectly fine throughout the entire time when she was with him.[^120] He was neither in a daze, nor in a state of mind where he did not understand the CNB officers.[^121] The Accused was aware of what was happening at that point of time and he knew what he was doing.[^122] The Accused’s alertness was evident from the audio-recording[^123] and the answers given in his long statement.[^124]

62     Dr Raymond Fong Kok Choon[\[note: 125\]](#Ftn_125) testified that the Accused was alert on 5 February 2020.[^126] He was orientated as to time, place and person.[^127] The Accused’s neurological power (4 out of 5) was quite good, and he was able to follow commands and instructions.[^128] The Accused obtained the maximum score of 15 on the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) for his eye, verbal and motor responses.[^129] The GCS test took place shortly before the recording of the long statement.[^130] The medical case notes for 5 February 2020 stated that “(the Accused) left ward conscious and alert accompanied by police and porter”.

63     The Accused also moved very vigorously.[\[note: 131\]](#Ftn_131) Sgt Abdul Azmin testified that the Accused was lying on the bed and would turn very hard in the opposite direction.[^132] On another occasion, the Accused “fl(ew) out of his bed in a sitting upward position”.[^133]

64     In addition, the Accused was aggressive, as stated in Dr Bartiana’s medical report.[\[note: 134\]](#Ftn_134) Dr Loke stated that the Accused was aggressive, violent, verbally abusive and shouting expletives.[^135] Despite being restrained to the bed, he was trying to kick the CNB officers.[^136]

65     Sgt Abdul Azmin said that the Accused was very annoyed and agitated.[\[note: 137\]](#Ftn_137) He spoke to the CNB officers in a “I don’t want to entertain you” tone. SSSgt Palan noted in the station diary:[^138]

> (Accused) was given a chance to provide his urine sample and he refused. He hurled vulgarities at me. He said he has nothing to say. He told us thanks for coming and pls fuck off.[^139]

66     For completeness, the Accused testified that he remembered certain events on 5 February 2020, including:

> (a)     A doctor attended to him;

> (b)     The Accused scolded the doctor in relation to inserting a catheter;

> (c)     He was restrained to a hospital bed in the ward; and

> (d)     He scolded a female police officer.[\[note: 140\]](#Ftn_140)

#### (c)   Accused understood the CNB officers and was able to communicate with them

67     The Accused understood the CNB officers and was able to communicate with them, as evidenced by the audio-recording[\[note: 141\]](#Ftn_141) overlaid with his long statement:[^142]

> 1\. Mustafa, How are you feeling?

> Answer: Not good.

> 2\. Why not good?

> Answer: You ask doctor.

> 3\. The doctor has certified you fit to provide urine, is there any reason you are not giving your urine samples for testing?

> Answer: My bladder is in pain.

> 4\. Are you willing to give your urine?

> Answer: Thank you for coming you all can fuck off.[^143]

> …

> 8\. Based on your records, do you know that drugs will only stay in your urine for a certain period of time and failing to provide your urine samples now, would strip your chance to prove your innocence in the future?

> Answer: No answer. Until you two bastards fuck off, I will no (sic) stop making noise.

68     SSSgt Palan testified that the Accused was able to understand everything that she said.[\[note: 144\]](#Ftn_144) The Accused was even able to rebut her.[^145] When SSSgt Palan told the Accused that he was suspected to be taking drugs, he retorted that what she had said was only based on “suspicion”.[^146]

69     In similar vein, Sgt Abdul Azmin testified that the Accused was able to communicate with them.[\[note: 147\]](#Ftn_147) In fact, when Sgt Abdul Azmin asked SSSgt Palan about her rank,[^148] the Accused listened attentively and said to SSSgt Palan “you Staff Sergeant only”, despite the question not being meant for him.[^149] Sgt Abdul Azmin stated that the Accused was awake throughout even though he pretended to sleep by closing his eyes and yawning very loudly.[^150]

70     The Accused stated that he would continue to make noise until both CNB officers left the ward.[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151) He did not ask the CNB officers for more time to provide his urine specimen.[^152]

71     The fact that the Accused understood the CNB officers militated against his claim that his mental and physical state was affected to the extent that he was unable to provide a urine specimen.

#### (d)   Different treatment of CNB and Aetos officers by the Accused

72     The Accused’s alertness found expression in the fact that he afforded different treatment to the CNB officers vis-à-vis the Aetos officer. He was rude and abusive to the CNB officers but respectful and polite to the Aetos officer.[\[note: 153\]](#Ftn_153)

73     The Accused shouted and used vulgarities on SSgt Palan and Sgt Abdul Azmin.[\[note: 154\]](#Ftn_154) The Accused was angry and hostile towards them.[^155] In contrast, when talking to the Aetos officer, he was very nice and respectful and his voice became soft and subtle, like communicating to a friend.[^156] The Accused thanked the Aetos officer for adjusting his blanket when he was cold.[^157] When the Aetos officer asked him to lie down, the Accused was compliant and did so.[^158]

#### (e)   Accused was fit for urine collection

74     Dr Loke’s medical memo[\[note: 159\]](#Ftn_159) stated that the Accused was “fit for urine collection”.[^160] Dr Raymond Fong Kok Choon[^161] also shared this view.[^162] The Accused did not complain about not being able to pass urine or give a urine specimen.[^163]

75     Having considered the Accused’s age and past medical history, including the fact that the Accused had neither kidney failure nor very bad spinal injury, Dr Loke testified that nothing prevented him for passing urine.[\[note: 164\]](#Ftn_164)

76     To be sure, the nursing case notes on 5 February 2020 mentioned that “patient trying to BO however unable to pass urine and BO”.[\[note: 165\]](#Ftn_165) However, this had been self-reported by the Accused to Senior Enrolled Nurse Siti Noraishah binte Mohd Senin[^166].[^167] And the nursing records for 5 February 2020 at about 8.10 p.m. stated that “urine still wanted, patient still refused to submit _…_ patient refused to pass urine and do bladder scan”.[^168]

77     The Accused’s medical report[\[note: 169\]](#Ftn_169) prepared by Dr Bartiana stated as follows:

> Admission date: 5 February 2020

> Discharged date: 6 February 2020

> In response to your queries:

> 1\. Patient was given IM tramadol 1 ml by SCDF staff on 5 February 2020 0001 hrs.

> 2\. About his claim that he requested catheter insertion for urine collection

> **Since admission patient was noted aggressive and was not co-operative** [^170]

> **He refused to submit urine and even doing urinary bladder scan** [^171]

> As per documentation in the nursing notes dated 05/02/2020 2010 hrs: staff nurse stated **patient refused to pass urine and bladder scan**[^172]

> On 06 Feb 2020 – during morning rounds – **patient again refused bladder scan**[^173]

> In the afternoon of that day 1520 hrs – Dr Tan Russell documented in the clinical notes that bladder scan recorded 600ml of urine. Patient then urinated but did not collect urine sample.[^174]

> There was no palpable bladder thereafter hence no indication to insert urinary catheter.[^175] (emphasis added)

78     To my mind, the evidence showed that despite being fit for urine collection, the Accused failed to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse. This was evidenced by the clinical notes,[\[note: 176\]](#Ftn_176) nursing notes,[^177] the Accused’s long statement,[^178] audio-recording,[^179] and the observations of various officers such as SSSgt Palan and Sgt Abdul Azmin.

79     Sgt Abdul Azmin testified that the Accused had been uncooperative, including with the medical team.[\[note: 180\]](#Ftn_180) And the Accused also did not want to drink water – he did not adhere to rules like drinking water and warnings had been given to him many times, i.e. every 6 hours.[^181] It is clear that the Accused did not try as hard as he could to provide a urine specimen.[^182]

80     All things considered, the Accused’s claim that his “bladder (had been) in pain”,[\[note: 183\]](#Ftn_183) he “really could not give (his) urine as (he has a) problem with (his) bladder”[^184] and he had constipation[^185] were bare assertions, which were unsupported by the evidence of the CNB officers and medical professionals.

## Verdict

81     Based on the totality of the evidence, the Accused failed to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse. The Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Accused was convicted on the charge.

## Guilty plea for other charges

82     After the Accused’s conviction, he pleaded guilty to 3 other charges:

> (a)     \[1st Charge\] 1 count of s 356 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) punishable under s 50T of the Prisons Act,[\[note: 186\]](#Ftn_186)

> (b)     \[4th Charge\] 1 count of Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3) punishable under s 50T of the Prisons Act,[\[note: 187\]](#Ftn_187) and

> (c)     \[11th Charge\] 1 count of s 6(1)(a) punishable under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) and s 50T of the Prisons Act.[\[note: 188\]](#Ftn_188)

83     The Accused consented to have 13 charges taken into consideration for sentencing.[\[note: 189\]](#Ftn_189)

84     The Statement of Facts can be found at **Annex A** below.[\[note: 190\]](#Ftn_190)

## Sentencing

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

85     The Prosecution asked for 9 years’ Corrective Training and 6 strokes of the cane for the offence under s 31(2) punishable under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.[\[note: 191\]](#Ftn_191)

86     The Prosecution also asked for a sentence of 247 days (i.e. about 2/3 of the maximum term of 371 days) for s 50T of the Prisons Act. The Prosecution did not ask for the maximum term of 371 days, in order to reflect the Accused’s plea of guilt. The Accused’s case fell within band 3 of _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>, as several offences were grave. Both general and specific deterrence were engaged as he had committed multiple offences, including drug-related offences, mischief, offences against public servants, and property-related offences. In all, he faced 17 charges.[^192]

87     The Prosecution had no objections for CT to be backdated.

### Mitigation plea

88     The Accused asked for a lenient sentence.[\[note: 193\]](#Ftn_193) He stated that he would be “grateful” for a sentence of 247 days for s 50T of the Prisons Act.[^194]

### Framework in Sim Yeow Kee

89     The two-stage framework in _Sim Yeow Kee_ is as follows:

> (I) Stage 1: Whether the offender qualifies for the CT regime under s 304(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).

> (II) Stage 2: Whether it is expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime. For Stage 2, there is a 3-step process:

>> (a) Step 1: What is the likely imprisonment sentence?

>> (b) Step 2: Would the offender be placed on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS)?

>> (c) Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

90     Briefly, my answer is ‘Yes’ to both stages.

91     At its heart, the above framework balances various sentencing principles – crime prevention, proportionality, totality and the reformation and rehabilitation of offenders (for a historical overview of CT, see Chan Wing Cheong, _Preventive Detention and Corrective Training for Habitual Offenders in Singapore_, 8 Sing. Ac. L.J. 157 at 165-167).

### Stage 1:   Does the offender qualify for Corrective Training?

92     Yes, the Accused qualified for Corrective Training under s 304(1) of the CPC.[\[note: 195\]](#Ftn_195) This is a threshold question.

### Stage 2:   Is it expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime?

#### (a)   Step 1: What is the likely imprisonment sentence?

##### (1)   Prescribed punishment

93     The prescribed punishment for the charge that the Accused claimed trial to (_viz._ s 31(2) of the MDA punishable under s 33A(2) of the MDA) is:

> (a)     Imprisonment of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years; and

> (b)     Not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

94     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment set by Parliament: _Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 684</span> at \[44\] (Benny Tan, _Assessing the Effectiveness of Sentencing Guideline Judgments in Singapore Issued Post-March 2013 and A Guide to Constructing Frameworks_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1004</span> at \[46\]).

95     The court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence, _viz._ Completeness principle: _Poh Boon Kiat_ at \[60\] and _Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 265</span> at \[152\]-\[154\].

96      Claiming Trial. Although claiming trial[\[note: 196\]](#Ftn_196) is not an aggravating factor, no discount would be given to offenders who elect to claim trial: _Mohd Shahrin bin Shwi v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 174</span> at \[21\] to \[22\] (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[20.147\]).

97      Plea of Guilt. I gave the Accused’s plea of guilt[\[note: 197\]](#Ftn_197) due weight.

98      Antecedents. The Accused’s antecedents included:[\[note: 198\]](#Ftn_198)

> (a)     Drug consumption (LT1) under s 8(b)(ii) Cap 185: 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes in 2016,

> (b)     Failing to report for urine test under Reg 15(3)(f) MDR: 6 months’ imprisonment in 2016,

> (c)     Mischief under s 427 Cap 224: 2 months’ imprisonment in 2016,

> (d)     Voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty under s 332 Cap 224: 2 months’ imprisonment in 2016,

> (e)     Failing to return to camp after cancellation of leave under Reg 12(5) MDR: 2 months’ imprisonment in 2014,

> (f)     Drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) Cap 185: 12 months’ imprisonment in 2014,

> (g)     Absent without leave under s 48(1) Cap 42: 3 months’ imprisonment in 2012,

> (h)     Drug Rehabilitation Centre: 6 months in 2013,

> (i)     Drug Supervision: 24 months in 2015, and

> (j)     Drug Supervision: 24 months in 2019.

99      Likely Sentence. All things considered, the Accused’s likely imprisonment sentence was as follows:[\[note: 199\]](#Ftn_199)

#### (b)   Step 2: Would the accused be placed on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS)?

100    The Accused would qualify for the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS). The Accused had been convicted of an offence under the First Schedule to the Prisons Act, _viz._ s 31(2) of the MDA, and he would receive an aggregate imprisonment term exceeding 1 year: s 50U(1)(b) of the Prisons Act (see also _Public Prosecutor v Ong Say Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 946</span> at \[15\]-\[16\]).

101    The MAS is generally for a period of up to two years, allowing three phases – a halfway house stay, home supervision and community reintegration, although not all individuals will have to go through the three phases: Mr Masagos Zulkifli, then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, at the second reading of the Bill introducing the MAS \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (20 January 2014) vol. 91\].

102    The MAS has brought to the fore the fact that rehabilitative programmes are commendably and intrinsically embedded in the imprisonment regime in general: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[100\].

103    In the present case, despite previously having had the opportunity to avail himself of the structured aftercare programmes offered under the MAS, this has had little assistance in the Accused’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. This raised serious doubts on whether it can be said that further availability of the MAS would be of benefit to the Accused.

#### (c)   Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

104    For the balancing exercise in _Sim Yeow Kee_, two considerations (rehabilitative benefits of the MAS and whether CT would be unduly disproportionate) bear weight to a greater degree when a shorter term of CT is contemplated: _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[17(d)\] and \[105\]-\[106\]. The 3-Judge Panel in _Sim Yeow Kee_ recognised that its sentencing framework is likely to reduce the scope for imposing CT sentences (at \[105\]).

105    The Accused’s likely sentence would be about 9 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane, excluding the sentence for s 50T of the Prisons Act.

106    The Accused would qualify for the MAS. On the basis that he is released after serving 6 years (i.e. two-thirds of a 9-year imprisonment term), the Accused would thereafter be eligible for several years of mandatory aftercare under the MAS. He could then be placed in a “step-down” programme as contemplated under the MAS, such that he might have the opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society (_Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[113\]).

107    In my judgment, having applied the first two steps under Stage 2, I found that a sentence of regular imprisonment twinned with the MAS would not adequately fulfil the dual aims of specifically deterring and rehabilitating the Accused (_Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[114\]).

108    The Accused’s Pre-Sentencing Report for Corrective Training stated that his “general risk of reoffending is **High**, and his general violence risk of re-offending is assessed to be **High**” (emphasis in original report).[\[note: 201\]](#Ftn_201) The report also stated that: [^202]

> (The Accused) is a 31-year-old Malay male who presents with a history of general and violent offending behaviours with an onset at 21 years old. Predisposing his difficulties, would be an early exposure to antisocial influences which contributed to the formation of beliefs and attitudes towards an antisocial lifestyle of violence and substance use. Perpetuating (the Accused’s) offending behaviours would be several factors such as his continued associations with antisocial peers (who) endorse violent attitudes and consume substances. Coupled with his permissive attitudes towards a lifestyle of crime and substance use difficulties, these factors increase his propensity towards his use of violence and general criminal offending behaviours. During the time of the interview, he did not present with any protective factors and presented with a lack of insight into his offending behavioural patterns. Taken together, Mustafa will require intensive rehabilitation and reintegration efforts to mitigate his risk of general and violent re-offending.

109    I considered that imposing CT for 8 years would not be unduly disproportionate.[\[note: 203\]](#Ftn_203)

110     Totality Principle. The sentence is in line with the totality principle: _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam_.

111     Proportionality Principle. I kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[30\]. Under the proportionality principle, the sentence to be imposed must not only bear a reasonable proportion to the maximum prescribed penalty, but also to the gravity of the offence committed (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[06.091\]-\[06.093\]) (see also Ho Hsi Ming Shawn, _The Centrality of Proportionality: A Golden Thread in Sentencing_, Singapore Law Gazette (July 2020)).

112     Section 50T of the Prisons Act. I agreed with the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions of 247 days (i.e. about 2/3 of the maximum term of 371 days) for s 50T of the Prisons Act. The Accused’s case fell within band 3 of _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman_, as several offences were grave. Both general and specific deterrence were engaged as he had committed multiple offences, including drug-related offences, mischief, offences against public servants, and property-related offences.

## Conclusion

113    Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. He was convicted and sentenced to Corrective Training for 8 years backdated to 6 February 2020. He was also sentenced to 6 strokes of the cane and given an enhanced sentence of 247 days.

114    The Accused has appealed against conviction and sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.

115    In closing, I am grateful for the hard work and submissions of both sides.

### Annex A

**Statement of Facts**

(Incorporating 3 charges)

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1.The accused is Muhammad Mustafa Bin Mohd Haniffa, a 30-year-old male Singaporean.

2.     On 18 May 2019, the accused was released from prison and was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Rd). The end date of the remission order was 27 January 2021.

## II.   FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4th CHARGE (DAC 911481-2020)

3.     From 18 May 2019 to 17 May 2021, the accused was subject to a supervision order issued under Regulation 15(2) of Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 3) (“the Regulations”).

4.     Pursuant to the terms of the supervision order, the accused was required to present himself every Monday and Thursday of each month at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters at anytime from 9.30 am to 10.00 pm (excluding public holidays).

5.     The accused failed to do so on 23 January 2020 without reasonable excuse and has thereby committed an offence punishable under Reg 15(3)(f) read with Reg 15(6)(a) of the Regulations.

## III.   FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1st CHARGE (DAC 902526-2020)

6.     The victim is Gao Min, a then 26-year-old woman.

7.     On 3 February 2020 at about 7.20 pm, the victim alighted from a bus and was walking along the walkway between blocks 140 and 141 Jalan Bukit Merah, Singapore while holding her mobile phone (a Huawei Mate 20 Pro valued at S$500) in her hands.

8.     During this time, the accused was walking behind the victim and noticed her mobile phone. The accused then approached the victim from behind and intentionally snatched the mobile phone out of her hand without her consent before running away.

9.     Based on closed-circuit television footage of the immediate vicinity, the accused was identified and subsequently placed under arrest. The victim’s mobile phone was not recovered while restitution has not been made to date.

10.    By using criminal force on the victim to commit theft in dishonestly taking her mobile phone out of her possession without consent, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 356 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## IV.   FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 11th CHARGE (MAC 906839-2020)

11.    The victim is Ahmad Faheem, who was employed as an officer with the Singapore Police Force at the material time.

12.    On 5 February 2020, the accused was warded at Changi General Hospital (located at No. 2 Simei Street, Singapore) at Ward 18, Bed 6. The victim was engaged to escort the accused and was tasked with obtaining a urine sample from him during the time period from 8.55 am to 1.30 pm.

13.    Over the course of the day, the victim asked the accused to provide a urine sample on several occasions. For two respective occasions, the accused responded to the victim as follows:

> a.     “You open your mouth, I urine inside” (in English); and

> b.     “Fuck off, cheebye” (in a mix of English and Hokkien), which means “fuck off, cunt”

14.    The above abusive words were said in relation to the victim’s execution of his duty as a public servant. The accused has thereby contravened s 6(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) and has committed an offence punishable under s 6(3) of the said Act.

## V.   CONCLUSION

15.    Prior to the commission of the above offences, the accused was subject to a remission order (as referred in \[2\] above). Upon his conviction, and in the event that he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment or corrective training, he shall be deemed to be in breach of the basic condition of the remission order under s 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and is liable to enhanced sentences under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act. This comprises imprisonment terms not exceeding the respective durations of the following charges:

16.    By virtue of s 50T(2)(_b_) of the Prisons Act, the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences imposed shall not exceed the duration of 371 days (representing the date of the earliest offence committed).

17.    The accused stands charged accordingly.
