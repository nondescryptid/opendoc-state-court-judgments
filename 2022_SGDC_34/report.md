Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Workplace Safety and Health Regulations

22 February 2022

### Senior District Judge Bala Reddy (delivering the judgment of the court _ex-tempore):_

## Introduction

1       The accused, Yiu Siok Lim, male, 50 years old (the “Accused”) pleaded guilty to an offence under Regulation 17(3) of the Workplace Safety and Health (Operation of Cranes) Regulations 2011 (“the Regulations”). The charge is reproduced below:

> **DSC-900706-2020**

> that you, on or before 11 August 2017, being the lifting supervisor appointed by Kienta Engineering Construction Pte. Ltd., at a construction site located at MK 03 on LOT4344K, 04898X, 04901W at Lower Kent Ridge Road (the “Worksite”), Singapore, which was a workplace within the meaning of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A) (the “Act”), did in contravention of regulation 17(3) of the Workplace Safety And Health (Operation Of Cranes) Regulations 2011 (“the Regulations”), failed to:

>> i.    supervise the lifting operations by a tower crane in accordance with the lifting plan, and

>> ii.    ensure that only appointed riggers participate in any lifting operation involving the use of a tower crane, i.e. the unrigging of ‘Formwork Structure 4’

> and you have thereby committed an offence under the regulation 17(3) and punishable under regulation 28 of the Regulations.

## Statement of Facts

2       The learned Prosecutor tendered a very detailed Statement of Facts (“SOF”) that included both a diagrammatic representation of the activities at the worksite as well as photographs of the scene to explain some of the technical details in the facts. The Accused accepted the SOF and pleaded guilty without any qualifications. For completeness, the SOF is reproduced in full below:

STATEMENT OF FACTS

> **The Accused**

> 1.    The accused is one Yiu Siok Lim (NRIC No.: XXX). At the material time, the accused was employed by Kienta Engineering Construction Pte. Ltd. (UEN: 197500557D) (“**Kienta**”). He was a site supervisor and the appointed lifting supervisor at a construction worksite located at MK 03 on LOT 04344K, 04898X, 04901W at Lower Kent Ridge Road (the “**worksite**”).

> **Parties**

> 2.    The Developer, National University Hospital (Singapore) Pte Ltd (UEN: 198500843R) (“**NUH**”) awarded a contract to the Occupier, Kienta, for the addition and alteration works involving the new outpatient medical clinic facilities building at the worksite. The project commenced on 29 August 2016 and was scheduled for completion by 28 February 2018.

> 3.    Kienta subcontracted the earthworks, reinforced concrete works, furniture and fittings, metal works, civil engineering works, masonry and plastering, tiling, doors, ceilings and partitions including provision of plants, machineries and equipment to their subsidiary, Hongda Engineering Construction Pte Ltd (UEN: 200716224W) (“**Hongda**”).

> 4.    Hongda in turn engaged Cheng Yi Pte Ltd (UEN: 200415703G) (“**CY**”) to carry out structural works involving the supply and erection of metal/timber formworks and concreting works.

> 5.    CY obtained manpower supply from Cheng Yi Construction Pte. Ltd. (UEN: 201002594G) (“**CYC**”) to perform reinforced concrete works and other miscellaneous works.

> 6.    PERI Asia Pte. Ltd. (UEN: 199102217W) (“**PERI**”) had a rental agreement with CY to supply the formwork system for use in the worksite.

> **The Accident**

> 7.    On 11 August 2017, at around 3.30am, an accident occurred at a lift shaft under construction (“**lift building 1**”) of the worksite.

> 8.    Prior to the accident, two workers, Zong Fu (FIN: XXX) (the “**Deceased**”) and Wang Mingshan (FIN: XXX) (“**Wang**”), employed by CYC, were performing works relating to the climbing of formwork structures from the 6th to the 7th storey of lift building 1. They completed the climbing of formwork structures 1, 2, 3 (“**FS1-3**”), and began works for the climbing of formwork structure 4 (“**FS4**”). They had installed formwork structures marked 1,2 and 3 around the perimeter of lift building 1.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image1.png)

> _Fig. A: Layout of worksite_

> 9.    After FS4 was hoisted by a tower crane (Model: Yongmao STL230; LE registration number LM352450C) from the 6th to the 7th storey, the Deceased climbed up FS4 to unrig the lifting chain slings (the “**slings**”). At around 3.30am, as the Deceased was descending to the work platform of FS4, FS4 tilted. He fell, over around 20 metres, landing on the 3rd storey.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image2.png)

> 10.    The Deceased was pronounced dead at the scene by the attending paramedics at 4.39am. The cause of death was certified as “head injury”.

> _Working Arrangement_

> 11.    In relation to the climbing of formworks, Kienta worked concurrently with CY and CYC. The scope of works and responsibility of Kienta and CY/CYC are separate and distinct.

> 12.    Kienta was in charge of the lifting of the formworks. Kienta’s lifting team included:

>> a.    The accused who was the lifting supervisor;

>> b.    Paramasivam Pushbaraj (FIN: XXX) (“**Pushbaraj**”) who was the rigger/signalman; and

>> c.    Zhang Jindou (FIN: XXX) (“**Zhang**”) who was the tower crane operator contracted by Kienta.

> 13.    CY and CYC were in charge of the dismantling of formworks for hoisting and the subsequent installation of formworks after hoisting. CY’s and CYC’s formwork team included Wang and the Deceased.

> _Briefings_

> 14.    On 10 August 2017, at about 7pm, Muthusamy Velmurugan (FIN: XXX) (“**Velmurugan**”), a safety supervisor from Kienta, conducted a mass toolbox briefing for the contractors and workers involved in the night works to be carried out in the worksite. At this mass toolbox briefing, Velmurugan only reminded the workers to wear their personal protective equipment, and to ensure that all entry and exit paths were cleared of obstruction for safe evacuation. He also reminded the workers to conduct proper housekeeping and to ensure that their work areas were sufficiently lit.

> 15.    At 7.30pm, Rayhan MD (FIN: XXX) (“**Rayhan**”), a safety supervisor from CY, conducted another safety briefing internally for workers from CY and CYC. At this briefing, Rayhan briefed the workers on general safety at the worksite and reminded the workers not to stand underneath any loads being lifted at the worksite.

> 16.    Kienta had prepared a lifting plan for the lifting operations by a tower crane.

> _Preparation for Lifting_

> 17.    At about 10pm, the Deceased and Wang proceeded to the connecting platform between two lift buildings located on the 6th storey to conduct preparation works to facilitate the subsequent hoisting of the formwork structures.

> 18.    They started removing the safety nettings, wooden platform and metal guardrails between the formwork structures (as each formwork structure would have to be hoisted separately). They also removed wooden planks that were used to cover the gap between the formwork structures and the wall façade. They then proceeded to further retract the wall form (part of the formwork structure) to a distance of around 0.6m away from the casted concrete wall, to expose the securing bolts for dismantling.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image3.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image4.png)

> 19.    The Deceased and Wang completed these preparation works for 5 sets of formwork structure sometime before midnight (i.e. 11 August 2017 at around midnight). They then rested at the connecting platform at the 6th storey, while waiting for the tower crane to be available (as it was being used to perform concreting works at the 2nd storey of the worksite).

> _Commencement of Lifting_

> 20.    On 11 August 2017, at around 1.30am, the accused instructed Pushbaraj to assist as a rigger and signalman for the lifting of formwork structures at lift building 1. At around 2am, Wang, Pushbaraj, Zhang and the Deceased commenced lifting operations. The process in relation to the lifting of each formwork structure was as follows:

>> a.    Pushbaraj liaised with Zhang via walkie-talkie to lower the slings of the tower crane. The slings were then guided through the openings of the platform and to rig the hooks of the slings to the lifting points of the formwork structures.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image5.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image6.png)

>> b.    Thereafter, the Deceased informed Pushbaraj to instruct Zhang to lift the slings to slightly tension them. Wang and the Deceased then removed the cotter pin and disengaged the securing bolt on the two sides of the formwork structure. This was so as to lift the structure off the two mounting rings[^1] that its two climbing brackets were resting upon.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image7.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image8.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image9.png)

>> c.    Wang and the Deceased then anchored the hooks of their body harnesses onto a re-bar installed through the wall form of the formwork structure (and tightened by two brackets).

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image10.png)

>> d.    Pushbaraj instructed Zhang to lift the formwork structure off the mounting rings and lower it by about 30 to 40 cm. This was so that Wang and the Deceased could remove the mounting rings that the climbing brackets were previously sitting on using spanners. Wang and the Deceased remained on the working platform of the formwork structure (which was suspended by the slings) as it was being lowered.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image11.png)

>> e.    Thereafter, Pushbaraj instructed Zhang to lift the formwork structure by about 3 to 4 metres. This was so that Wang and the Deceased could install the mounting rings into climbing cones casted for the next level. Wang and the Deceased remained on the working platform of the formwork structure as it was being raised.

>> f.    Once the mounting rings were installed, Pushbaraj instructed Zhang to lift the formwork structure and lower it such that its climbing brackets rested on the mounting rings. Wang and the Deceased then engaged the securing bolts and inserted the cotter pin.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image12.png)

>> g.    The slings were then unrigged from the lifting points. The unrigging for FS4 was done by the Deceased. The Deceased was not trained to perform rigging and unrigging works.

> 21.    To perform the unrigging, the Deceased removed the hook of his body harness from the re-bar attached to the formwork, and climbed up the wall form to unrig the slings. As the Deceased was descending to the work platform of FS4, there was a loud sound, and FS4 tilted. The Deceased fell around 20 metres, and was found lying on a stack of wooden planks at the 3rd storey.

![]([2022] SGDC 0034_Image/[2022] SGDC 0034_image13.png)

> **The Accused’s Failures**

> 22.    As the lifting supervisor appointed by Kienta, the accused had a duty under regulation 17(3) of the Workplace Safety and Health (Operation of Cranes) Regulations 2011 to :

>> a.    co-ordinate all the lifting activities;

>> b.    supervise all the lifting operation by a mobile crane or tower crane in accordance with the lifting plan;

>> c.    ensure that only registered crane operators, appointed riggers and appointed signalmen participate in any lifting operation involving the use of a mobile crane or a tower crane;

>> d.    ensure that the ground conditions are safe for any lifting operation to be performed by any mobile crane;

>> e.    brief all crane operators, riggers and signalmen on the lifting plan referred to in regulation 4; and

>> f.    if any unsatisfactory or unsafe conditions are reported to him by any crane operator or

> rigger, take such measures to rectify the unsatisfactory or unsafe condition or otherwise ensure that any lifting operation is carried out safely.

> _A. Failure to supervise the lifting operations in accordance with the lifting plan_

> 23.    Although the accused was the lifting supervisor for the lifting of the formwork structures at the material time, he was not present during the lifting operations to supervise it. The accused was not present at the worksite – in the vicinity of the location of the formwork lifting operation for part of the lifting operations (i.e. the lifting of FS4).

> 24.    Investigations revealed that after overseeing the lifting of the first formwork structure (i.e. FS1) from Level 1, the accused proceeded back to the site office. He did not return to the location where lifting operations were being carried out until after the accident had occurred. As such he had failed to supervise the lifting operations by a tower crane, in accordance with the lifting plan.

> 25.    The lifting plan required all lifting operations to be controlled by the lifting supervisor. As the accused was not present at the lifting location, he was unable to control the lifting operations.

> _B. Failure to ensure rigging by appointed rigger_

> 26.    As the lifting supervisor, the accused had a duty to ensure that lifting works such as rigging and unrigging works and guiding of chain slings, were performed only by the appointed lifting team of Kienta.

> 27.    However, investigations revealed that the Deceased was involved in the unrigging works for the formwork structures in FS4. The Deceased was from CYC’s formwork team and was deployed to dismantle and install formworks only. He was not trained as a rigger to carry out rigging and unrigging works. The accused failed to ensure that only the appointed rigger, rather than the Deceased, carried out the unrigging works for the lifting operations of FS4.

> 28.    By virtue of the afore-mentioned failures, the accused had therefore failed to comply with his duty as a lifting supervisor under regulation 17(3) WSH (Operation of Crane) Regulations 2011, and punishable under regulation 28 of the said Regulations.

## Submissions on Sentence

3       Both the Learned Counsel for the Accused and the Prosecutor submitted that there had been no previous conviction for an offence under Regulation 17(3) punishable under Regulation 20 of the Regulations. Consequently, they made their submissions based on the facts of the case and invited the court to assess the sentence based on a harm-culpability matrix.

### Prosecution’s submissions

4       The Prosecution submitted that to determine an appropriate sentence, considerations of (i) potential harm and (ii) culpability of the Accused are relevant. On that basis, it was submitted that the level for culpability in this case should be pegged at a moderate level. The Prosecution submitted that the potential harm (i.e., the harm which may result from the Accused’s failings), should be pegged at a moderate level as well.

5       Based on the above categorisation of the offence as that of moderate culpability and moderate harm and taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors present, the Prosecution sought a fine of $18,000.

### Defence’s submissions

6       The Defence, on the other hand, submitted that the harm and culpability factors in this case placed the case in the low to moderate range of the harm-culpability matrix and that consequently a fine of $10,000 would be appropriate.

7       The Defence also presented testimonials from the Accused’s employers to demonstrate that he has been an honest and diligent employee with the Company for the past 26 years, had always discharged his duties well, and had not been faulted in his work.

## Assessment of Sentence

8       In the absence of any sentencing framework or precedents for this offence, I assessed all the relevant factors to establish the degree of harm followed by the Accused’s culpability and determined the appropriate sentence using a harm-culpability matrix.

9       In this context I had regard to the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 99</span> (_“Mao”_), which endorsed the sentencing approach of See J in _PP v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 682</span> (_“G S Engineering”_). Although the present case was not in respect of a charge under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2020 Rev Ed) (_“_WSHA_”_), I find that nevertheless the purpose and underlying principles of these Regulations, being a subset of the WSHA, are substantially similar. The Court of Appeal in _Mao_ expounded at \[47\]:

> 47 … The legislative intent of the WSHA, as recognised in both _Nurun Novi_ at \[73(a)\] and _GS Engineering_ (\[23\] _supra_) at \[51\], **was to improve workplace safety by effecting a “cultural change” for employers and other stakeholders to take proactive measures to prevent accidents**. This is to be achieved in part through ensuring that the penalties for non-compliance are sufficiently high to deter risk-taking behaviour. The implication is that Parliament’s intention was for the courts to impose higher penalties where appropriate to achieve the necessary deterrent effect. The penalty regime under the WSHA applies beyond situations where actual harm resulted. It provides for meaningful penalties where there are severe lapses, even if no accidents happened: _Nurun Novi_ at \[73(b)\]. **It was expressly recognised in Parliament that the penalty to be applied in any given case will take into account the culpability of the offender, the potential harm that could have been caused and the harm actually done**: _Nurun Novi_ at \[73(c)\]:

(emphasis added)

10     I found that a sentencing framework broadly akin to the one considered in the High Court decision in _GS Engineering_ at \[70\] and endorsed in _Mao_ at \[63\] would be more appropriate and workable for offences under the Regulations_. GS Engineering_ concerned a company charged under s 12(1), read with s 20 of the WSHA, for breaching its duty as an employer to take necessary measures to ensure the safety and health of its employees at work.

11     The Court of Appeal in _Mao_ gave the following guidance to the court at \[64\]:

> 64 … In our opinion, for a first-time offender who claims trial to a charge under s 15(3A) of the WSHA, the following sentencing framework should guide the court:

>> (a)    The first step would be to establish the level of harm and the level of culpability in order to derive the indicative starting point according to the matrix set out below.

>>> (i)    Harm includes a consideration of the degree of both potential harm and actual harm caused, ie, the actual harm with a causal or contributory link to the risk created by the accused person’s negligent act. We accept the non-exhaustive factors affecting the degree of potential harm as enumerated in Nurun Novi (\[4\] supra) at \[86\]: the seriousness of the harm risked, the likelihood of that harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm. Where the harm was likely to be death or serious injury (such as paralysis or loss of a limb), the harm could be considered to be high even though it did not materialise. If death or serious injury did occur, the harm would be graded near the top end of the high range.

>>> (ii)   We also accept, as held in Nurun Novi at \[87\], that culpability includes a consideration of the nature of the unsafe act, the number of unsafe acts committed by the offender and the level of deviation from established procedure involved in the unsafe act. Other relevant factors would include whether the unsafe acts were motivated by the offender’s desire to save on costs.

12     Even though the prescribed maximum punishments are different under WSHA and the Regulations, given the legislative intent as stated above, the following approach on a harm-culpability matrix would also apply for an offence under the Regulations: an imprisonment term will be appropriate where there is: (A) high harm with low culpability; (B) moderate or high harm with moderate culpability; or (C) high culpability (_Mao_ at \[64\]). For the rest of the permutations, the sentence would be that of a fine.

### Determination of the level of Harm and Culpability

13     The absence of the Accused from the worksite, particularly at the location of the formwork lifting operation for part of the lifting operations (i.e., during the lifting of Formwork Structure 4) and his neglect of his duty to ensure that lifting works such as rigging and unrigging works and guiding of chain slings, were performed only by the appointed lifting team of Kienta were clearly factors to consider when determining his level of culpability.

14     The Prosecution highlighted the many factors that can affect a lifting operation:

> (a)     Machine: Selection of appropriate lifting equipment for the job as well as the integrity of the equipment to perform the job;

> (b)     Material: Load that is intended to be lifted;

> (c)     Medium: Environment in which the lifting operation is to be carried out and includes the setting up and stability of the equipment;

> (d)     Man: Competency, roles and responsibilities of personnel involved in the lifting operation; and

> (e)     Method: Planning and procedures to be adopted for the lifting operation.

15     I found that based on the above factors some of the failures and the nature of the unsafe acts were indeed serious. This is particularly so where the lifting operation involves a structure to be secured at a height (as compared to lifting of materials from one point to another). It is even more serious where untrained personnel were involved in the lifting operation – specifically by way of the deceased unrigging Formwork structure 4.

16     The Accused committed two breaches under Regulation 17(3) of the Regulations. As the lifting supervisor at the worksite, he had a duty to supervise as per the lifting plan and control the lifting activity. However, he failed to do so. The Accused also failed to ensure that only trained riggers were involved in the unrigging of the formwork structure and appeared to have been indifferent as to who did the unrigging. While the Accused was present at the start of the lifting operations, he neglected his duty and left the lifting area for a period of about two hours. The fatal accident occurred when he was not present.

17     The Prosecution had helpfully made reference to the relevant material that detail the duties of a lifting supervisor. Pursuant to the Workplace Safety and Health (Approved Codes of Practice) Notification 2020, the Workplace Safety and Health Council (the “WSH Council”) has, in accordance with s 40B(3) of the WSHA, approved the “Code of Practice on Safe Lifting Operations in the Workplaces” (the “ACOP”) which was published by the WSH Council in 2014.

18     The ACOP provides details of the lifting supervisor’s duties as follows:

> 5.3.2 Lifting Supervisor

> 5.3.2.1 The lifting supervisor shall be appointed in writing by the contractor. This position is defined as the person who is in-charged with actively supervising the lifting operation on site. The person could be a foreman, shift supervisor or other similar capacity. The appointed lifting supervisor shall be attired in such a way that he/ she will be distinctively identified as the lifting supervisor.

> 5.3.2.2 In general, all lifting operation must be supervised by the appointed lifting supervisor as he is the main person leading and coordinating the operation. A lifting supervisor may be allowed to supervise more than one lifting operation at any point in time provided that he is able to discharge his duties appropriately e.g., when the two operations are side by side within close proximity. If so requested by the contractor, the lifting supervisor shall assist to develop the Lifting Plan and seek approval from the contractor’s management.

> 5.3.2.3 Thereafter, the appointed lifting supervisor shall:

>> • coordinate all lifting activities in accordance with the Lifting Plan;

>> • brief all lifting team members on the Lifting Plan, safe lifting procedure and RA;

>> • ensure that only registered crane operators, appointed riggers and appointed signalmen participate in any lifting operation involving the use of mobile and tower cranes;

>> • ensure that the ground conditions are safe for any lifting operation to be performed;

>> • be present during all lifting operations to ensure that the lift is carried out in accordance with the lifting plan;

>> • keep within his/her sight and view of all the lifting operations; and

>> • take suitable measures to rectify unsafe conditions so that the lifting operation can be conducted safely.

19     I found that in failing to supervise the lifting of the formworks and allowing the untrained formwork worker to unrig FS4, the Accused had not only breached Regulation 17(3) of the Regulations but also the safe practices recommended by the ACOP.

20     In addition, his failure to adequately supervise undoubtedly extended to an omission to safeguard that the workers were not lifted together with the formwork from Level 6 to Level 7. This is indeed another serious breach. Clause 1.3 of the SS 617: Code of Practice for the lifting of persons in work platforms suspended from cranes (“SS617”) stipulates that:

> Lifting of persons in platforms suspended from the load lines of cranes and the use of such platforms as workplaces are not permitted under normal circumstances. Such practices are not recommended but are only deployed if there are no other practical alternatives or if other means are more hazardous. The purpose of this standard is to set out the basic requirements for the design, construction, installation, inspection and safe use of work platforms suspended from cranes.

21     I accepted the submission of the Prosecution that it is clear from the above that persons are prohibited from “riding” on the load while it was being lifted, except under circumstances where there are no other practical alternatives or if other means are more hazardous. Even under such circumstances, the lifting of persons in such work platforms must comply with the requirements stipulated under SS617. Accordingly, the “riding” of the workers on the formwork while it was being lifted to the next level was clearly prohibited and an unsafe act. The said lifting was also not done because there were no other practical alternatives or that other means were more hazardous. Further the facts established that the said formwork’s platform also did not comply with SS617 (e.g. not all opensides were barricaded).

22     The facts also revealed that the actual harm which resulted in this case (i.e., the fatality), was not directly caused by the failure of the Accused to supervise the lifting of the formwork structure. The direct cause of death was related to the formwork and work-at-height activities.

23     However, given the fact that the nature of the lifting activity is an inherently a high-risk activity where a breach may cause a fatality – the potential harm is clearly at least moderate. The SOF also showed that the formwork workers remained on the formwork as it was being raised from level 6 to level 7. I had no hesitation in finding that the level of potential harm for the failure in this case to be moderate.

## Sentence

24     Based on the above factors, I considered the case to fall within the moderate harm and moderate culpability category, as per the guidance by the Court of Appeal in _Mao_. I was of the view that the indicative starting sentence would be $20,000 which is the maximum prescribed sentence for such offences. However, considering the Accused’s plea of guilt and unqualified admission of the facts, together with his mitigation, I assessed that the appropriate sentence in this case would be a fine of $18,000 (or in default 1 months’ imprisonment).
