Misrepresentation – Whether a maid agent can be deemed to have implicitly represented to a domestic worker that the worker will be employed in a safe working environment with a responsible employer

False imprisonment – Whether the locking of gate to a HDB apartment can amount to false imprisonment

False imprisonment – Whether the mere fact that a plaintiff is vulnerable and fearful of leaving a place, in the absence of any specific conduct from the defendant, can amount to false imprisonment

14 February 2022 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       DC/DC 735/2019 (“**DC 735**”) involves a case where a domestic worker sued her former maid agent for misrepresentation and false imprisonment. One unusual feature of this case was that the domestic worker allegedly had to jump from the third level of a HDB unit in order to escape from her false imprisonment. As a result of the jump, the domestic worker suffered very serious injuries.

2       This case caught the attention of non-governmental organisations (which, among others, funded DC 735) and a community blogging platform (which wrote about the case). The agent, who was on financial assistance, denied the claims. Her defence was funded by Legal Aid.

3       Exploitation and false imprisonment of domestic workers are taken seriously by our Courts. Where domestic workers make serious allegations against their employers and/or agents, these will be carefully scrutinised by the Courts to ensure that factual findings are based on credible and reliable evidence and that justice is done.

4       At the end of the trial, I dismissed DC 735. Before explaining my decision, here are the brief facts of this case.

## Brief facts

5       On 5 March 2016, the Plaintiff (an Indonesian) came to Singapore to work as a domestic worker for one Sharifah. This employment was arranged through the Defendant and an employment agent in Indonesia.

6       A few days into the employment, Sharifah complained to the Defendant about the Plaintiff’s work attitude. In turn, the Plaintiff complained to the Defendant that she lacked proper food and rest, constantly felt fatigued, and was scolded by Sharifah. The Plaintiff wanted to change her employer.

7       On 21 March 2016, after attempts to persuade the Plaintiff to change her mind had failed, the Defendant brought the Plaintiff to her employment agency at Joo Chiat Complex (“**the Office**”). Later that evening, the Defendant brought the Plaintiff to her home – a one-room rental HDB unit located on the third level (“**the Flat**”). At the material time, the Defendant’s daughter and Fitriya (another domestic worker waiting for a transfer of employer) were also residing in the Flat.

8       For the next three days, the Defendant would bring the Plaintiff to the Office during the day, and back to the Flat to stay at night.

9       On 24 March 2016 at about 11 am, the Plaintiff jumped from the kitchen window of the Flat. She was conveyed to Changi General Hospital (“**CGH**”) and found to have suffered multiple fractures, abrasions and liver laceration from the fall. After her discharge from CGH, the Plaintiff stayed with the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (“**HOME**”) to recuperate from her injuries.

## The misrepresentation claim

### Parties’ pleaded case

10     Dissatisfied with her employment under Sharifah, the Plaintiff sued the Defendant for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation. The case for both parties regarding the Plaintiff’s misrepresentation claim are summarised below:

### Applicable legal principles

11     To succeed on her misrepresentation claim, the Plaintiff must prove the following:

> (a)     First, the Defendant had made the alleged representations and that they were false (“**False Representation Element**”).

> (b)     Second, the Defendant had intended the Plaintiff to act upon these representations (“**Inducement Element**”).

> (c)     Third, the Plaintiff did act upon the representations (“**Reliance Element**”).

> (d)     Next, the Plaintiff had suffered damage as a result (“**Damage Element**”).

> (e)     Finally, the Plaintiff must also prove the “**Mental Element**”:

>> (i)       In the case of _fraudulent_ misrepresentation, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant had made the representations knowing that they were false, or without belief in their truth, or recklessly, not caring whether they were true or false.

>> (ii)       As for _negligent_ misrepresentation, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant owed her a duty of care which was breached.

> _Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 435</span> at \[14\]; _Chu Said Thong v Vision Law LLC_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 375</span> at \[114\] – \[125\].

12     I found that the Plaintiff had failed to prove the above elements which were necessary to make out a case of misrepresentation. I will now elaborate my reasons for coming to such a finding.

### The Plaintiff had failed to provide satisfactory evidence to prove that the alleged representations had been made

13     In my judgement, the Plaintiff had failed to provide satisfactory evidence to prove that the Defendant had made the alleged representations.

14     Despite the fact that the alleged representations were central to her entire misrepresentation claim, the Plaintiff astonishingly did not adduce any evidence about them as part of her case – whether in her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“**AEIC**”) or her examination-in-chief (“**EIC**”).[^11]

15     The Plaintiff referred to these representations only (1) when the Defendant’s counsel, Mr Singh, put to her that they had not been made and (2) in her re-examination.[^12] Even then, the Plaintiff’s evidence regarding the representations was not compelling.

> (a)     The Plaintiff’s responses regarding the alleged representations were conflicting and confusing. This was despite repeated attempts, including by her own counsel, Ms Low, to simplify the questions posed to the Plaintiff.

> (b)     The Plaintiff’s evidence as to the representations consisted of bare assertions and were devoid of details. She did not testify _where, when, how and how_ the Defendant had allegedly made them. In fact, when she was probed on the Fourth Representation, the Plaintiff testified that she could not remember anything about it.[^13]

> (c)     The only evidence _volunteered_ by the Plaintiff that remotely came close to the alleged representations was when she testified that the Defendant had told her at the Office that, “I will deploy you in (_sic_) this employer, I hope that you will be able to adjust yourself there”.[^14]

> (d)     No explanation was provided, either by the Plaintiff or in closing submissions, as to why she had such great difficulty in clearly asserting that the Defendant did in fact make the representations.

### It was implausible that the Defendant could have made the alleged representations based on the Plaintiff’s case theory

16     In fact, based on the Plaintiff’s own evidence, (1) she had very limited interactions with the Defendant before starting to work for Sharifah and (2) the Defendant did not make the alleged representations to her. According to the Plaintiff –

> (a)     She did not communicate with the Defendant _before_ arriving in Singapore.

> (b)      _After_ arriving in Singapore, the Plaintiff was picked up by the Defendant’s brother from the airport and brought to his apartment. There, she was given some basic training on work as a domestic worker. The Plaintiff did not communicate with the Defendant during this period.

> (c)     The first time that the Plaintiff communicated with the Defendant was when she was placed in Sharifah’s care. This took place at the Office, shortly before Sharifah arrived to fetch the Plaintiff to her (Sharifah’s) home. According to the Plaintiff, apart from informing her that –

>> (i)       she would be working for Sharifah,

>> (ii)       her employment contract was for two years,

>> (iii)       deductions would be made from her salary pursuant to the Agency Contract, and

>> (iv)       she should call her (the Defendant) if she were to encounter any problem,

> the Defendant did not say anything else to her before she was brought to Sharifah’s home.[^15]

17     The Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant had made the alleged representations simply did not gel with her own narrative of what had transpired before she commenced working for Sharifah.

### The Plaintiff had sought to fill in the evidential gaps in her case with tenuous and unsubstantiated inferences

18     To overcome the serious evidential gap in the Plaintiff’s case, Ms Low submitted that the court should _infer_ that the alleged representations had been made based on certain _conduct or words_ by the Defendant.

19     I was not persuaded by these submissions. Ms Low’s submissions, and my reasons for rejecting them, are set out below:

### The Defendant did not concede to having made the First Representation

20     At this stage, I would like to digress briefly to address Ms Low’s submission that the Defendant had “conceded” making the First Representation. According to Ms Low, such a “concession” was made (a) during a pre-trial hearing on 17 March 2021, (b) an exchange of correspondence on 14 April 2021 and (c) during the first day of trial. Ms Low took issue with the fact that on the second day of the trial, Mr Singh stated that the “concession” related only to the fact that the Defendant had been convicted of operating a maid agency without a valid license at the material time – and not that she had represented to the Plaintiff that she had a valid license to operate a maid agency. According to Ms Low, the Defendant had been “flip-flopping” on her position regarding the First Representation, and that the only reason for this was because she did not have a credible defence.[^22]

21     I disagreed with Ms Low’s submission. It was very clear that from the outset, the Defendant had denied making the First Representation, and that all that she was prepared to admit to was that she had been convicted of operating without a valid maid agency license at the material time. This is evident from her Defence filed on 4 July 2019 which stated the following:

> 5     _The 1st Defendant denies that she had fraudulently and/or negligently misrepresented to the Plaintiff that she had a legally valid agency license as alleged in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim._ ...

> 6    The 1st Defendant _admits_ that she was charged with the offence of operating as an unlicensed employment agent under Section 6(1) of the Employment Agencies Act. She pleaded guilty to the Charge and was fined $50,000.00, in default 10 weeks imprisonment. _The 1st Defendant does not plead to the rest of paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim_.

> \[emphasis added\]

22     In my view, the alleged “flip-flopping” of the Defendant’s position on First Representation is attributable to the imprecise manner in which Mr Singh had framed the “concession”. See for instance the following example where Mr Singh stated the “concession” in the following terms:

> Singh:    Your Honour, the Defendant stand is that she admits to the 1st representation, _that she did not hold a valid license to operate an employment agency_, but she is disputing the other 2 representations.[^23] \[emphasis added\]

23     In my judgement, Mr Singh ought to have made it very clear that while the Defendant had accepted that she did not have a valid maid agency license, she nonetheless denied having made the First Representation.

24     That said, Mr Singh’s imprecision in stating the scope of the Defendant’s “concession” on the First Representation did not result in any prejudice to the Plaintiff, and certainly could not be used to shore up a weak case put forth by the Plaintiff. In this regard, it bears noting that following from the Defence at \[5\] and \[6\] (as set out at \[21\] above), the Plaintiff would have known that she must prove the First Representation. Despite this, the Plaintiff failed to provide clear evidence of the First Representation in her AEIC. This AEIC was filed on 10 November 2020 – several months _before_ the “concession” was made by Mr Singh on 17 March 2021.

### The Plaintiff had failed to prove the False Representation Element

25     For completeness, I wish to state that even if the Defendant did in fact make the four representations, the Plaintiff’s claim for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation is bound to fail. This is because she had failed to prove the other key elements of misrepresentation.

26     Save for the First Representation, the Plaintiff had failed to prove that the remaining three representations were false.

> (a)      **_Second Representation_**. It is an uncontroverted fact that the Defendant did make the necessary arrangements for the Plaintiff to obtain employment as a domestic helper. The Plaintiff had a validly issued work permit, a valid employment contract and an employer duly approved by MOM.[^24]

> (b)      **_Third Representation_**. To re-cap, the Plaintiff pleaded that the Third Representation was false because the Defendant “had failed to perform the necessary checks to ensure that the Plaintiff obtained employment in a _safe working environment_”.[^25] \[emphasis added\]

>> (i)       The Plaintiff however _did not provide any evidence_ on what the “necessary checks” entailed, whether such checks envisaged by the Plaintiff were reasonable, and how the Defendant had failed to do these checks.

>> (ii)       The Plaintiff had also _failed to put her case_ regarding the “necessary checks” to the Defendant during cross-examination. The Defendant was thus deprived of an opportunity to meet the Plaintiff’s submission that the “necessary checks” were not done. This is a clear breach of the _Browne v Dunn_ rule.

>> (iii)       To aggravate the prejudice caused to the Defendant, the Plaintiff provided a _different basis_ as to why the Third Representation was false in her closing submissions. In these submissions, the focus of the Plaintiff’s case was no longer on checks that she claimed the Defendant ought to have carried out. Instead, it was the Defendant’s failure to provide the Plaintiff with a safe environment _while the latter was waiting for a new employer_. More precisely, the Plaintiff submitted that the Third Representation was false because the Defendant (1) had failed to show any meaningful concern as to whether the Plaintiff was being abused by Sharifah, (2) had verbally abused the Plaintiff, (3) had confined the Plaintiff in the Flat, (4) had provided the Plaintiff with only one meal a day, (5) had, in contravention of the work permit conditions, made the Plaintiff work in the Office, and (6) had made the Plaintiff stand facing a wall when she was not otherwise engaged with chores and as punishment for her request to transfer to another employer.[^26] I rejected these submissions as they had egregiously strayed beyond the scope of the Plaintiff’s pleadings. It is well established that a party is bound by its pleadings and that it will not be allowed to rely on a line of argument that had not been specifically pleaded: _Tan Kia Poh v Hong Leong Finance Ltd._ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 429</span>; _Ong Seow Pheng v. Lotus Development Corp_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 113</span>.

> (c)      **_Fourth Representation_**. The Plaintiff pleaded that the Fourth Representation was false because the Defendant “had failed to perform the necessary checks to ensure that the Plaintiff obtained employment ... with a _responsible employer_ who could comply with the requisite law and regulations and/or safety arrangements/agreement”.[^27] \[emphasis added\] More specifically, it was the Plaintiff’s case that the Fourth Representation was false because Sharifah had verbally her.[^28] In my judgement, such a case is not legally sustainable:

>> (i)       To make out her misrepresentation claim, the Plaintiff must prove that the Fourth Representation was objectively false _at the time when the Defendant made it._ In other words, the Plaintiff must prove that _before_ she commenced employment, the Defendant had communicated to her that Sharifah was a responsible employer and that this information was false _at the time of the communication_.

>> (ii)       The Plaintiff had failed to adduce any evidence in this regard. The fact that Sharifah might have verbally abused the Plaintiff _after_ the Defendant had allegedly made the Fourth Representation did not go to prove that Sharifah was verbally abusive at the time the Fourth Representation was allegedly made.

### The Plaintiff had failed to prove the Inducement Element

27     According to the Plaintiff, the four alleged representations induced her to do two things:[^29]

> (a)     First, the Plaintiff claimed that she was induced to _enter into the Agency Contract_ which provided that $450 was to be deducted monthly for seven months from her salary to cover a loan given to her by the agent in Indonesia to enter Singapore.

> (b)     Second, the Plaintiff claimed that the four representations induced her _to agree to work for Sharifah_.

28     The Plaintiff’s allegations flew in the face of uncontroverted evidence that _before_ the Defendant first spoke to the Plaintiff on 7 March 2016 in the Office (i.e., shortly before placing the Plaintiff in the care of Sharifah) –

> (a)     The Plaintiff _had already_ entered into the Agency Contract while she was in Indonesia.[^30] When the Defendant explained on 7 March 2016 to the Plaintiff the deductions that would be made from her salary under the Agency Contract, the Defendant was merely re-iterating what the Plaintiff had previously agreed to in this contract.

> (b)     MOM _had already_ approved on 5 March 2016 an application for the Plaintiff to work for Sharifah. During cross-examination, the Plaintiff confirmed that the Defendant did not say anything that induced her to work for Sharifah.[^31]

29     Accordingly, the Defendant could not have induced the Plaintiff to enter into the Agency Contract and to work for Sharifah as the Plaintiff had alleged.

### The Plaintiff had failed to prove the Damage Element

30     Although the Plaintiff’s misrepresentation claim referred to four different representations, it is clear from her pleadings that she was effectively relying _only on the Third Representation_ to prove that she had suffered consequential damage. This damage being that she was deprived of the opportunity to complete (and thus earn salary from) at least a two-year contract with a “suitably prequalified” employer.[^32]

31     However, in her closing submissions, the Plaintiff (again) went beyond the scope of her pleadings. Instead of the damage being the loss of a two-year contract, it was submitted that the damage related to (a) her alleged abuse by the Defendant and Sharifah and (b) the injuries that she had suffered from the jump:

> 39    But for the 1st Defendant's various misrepresentations which induced the Plaintiff to enter the employment contract with the 2nd Defendant_, the 1st Defendant would not have suffered abuse at the hands of the 2nd Defendant, and subsequently, the 1st Defendant. She would not have suffered mental anguish caused by the 1st Defendant's abuse which led her to escape from the 1st Defendant's home. This caused her to not only sustain physical injuries but also become unable to be employed by any subsequent employer which the 1st Defendant was in the midst of transferring her to._

> 40    The 1st Defendant does not dispute that but for the 1st Defendant's misrepresentations, the Plaintiff would also have gone on to complete an employment contract of at least 2 years in a safe environment.

> \[emphasis added\]

32     In my judgement, even if the alleged representations had been made, and even if one were to ignore for the moment that \[39\] and \[40\] in the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions were not part of the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, the alleged representations clearly did not have any nexus with the alleged abuse, “mental anguish” and physical injuries of the Plaintiff.

## The false imprisonment claim

### Parties’ pleaded case

33     I will now turn to the Plaintiff’s claim for false imprisonment. The parties’ case in relation to this claim were as follows:

34     Before analysing the Plaintiff’s case, I wish to make the following preliminary observations:

> (a)     The Plaintiff did not maintain a consistent case regarding the _place_ of her alleged confinement. According to the Plaintiff’s pleadings, she was confined in the Defendant’s _Flat_. In her closing submissions however, the Plaintiff alleged that she was also confined in _the Office_.[^39]

> (b)     The Plaintiff alleged that her confinement was of _physical_ (locked door) and _psychological_ (by the control that the Defendant and Sharifah allegedly had over her) in nature. It was not the Plaintiff’s case that she was confined in either the Flat or the Office because of _threats_ from the Defendant.

### Applicable legal principles

35      **Elements of false imprisonment.** To make out a case of false imprisonment, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant had “_directly and intentionally”_ caused her to be confined _within a particular area_ delimited by the Defendant without a lawful basis: _Goel Adesh Kumar v Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd (SATS Security Services Pte Ltd, third party)_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 289</span> at \[16\]. A defendant can be said to directly and intentionally cause a plaintiff to be confined if (i) he does an act with the intention of causing the plaintiff to be confined, and (ii) that act is the direct (proximate) cause of the defendant’s confinement. A plaintiff can be said to be confined within a particular area if he is _kept_ within that area and/or _prevented_ from leaving it. If the plaintiff has a reasonable and proper means of leaving that area, then he cannot be said to have been confined.

36      **How can false imprisonment be committed?** It is well established that various methods might be used to keep a person confined. They could involve (a) physical barriers (such as locks and bars), (b) people (such as guards who would physically prevent the person leaving if he tried to do so), and/or (c) threats, whether of force or of legal process: _R (Jollah) v Home Secretary_ (SC(E)) \[2021\] AC 262 at \[24\].

37      **Can there be false imprisonment merely by a defendant’s “will”?** Apart from the above, Ms Low submitted that there could also be false imprisonment merely by a “_defendant’s will_” that a plaintiff should stay within a defined location. She submitted that as long as the plaintiff (a) was in a vulnerable position vis-à-vis the defendant, and (b) the plaintiff was fearful of leaving a place, this _in and of itself_ was sufficient to constitute false imprisonment.[^40]

38     I disagreed. First, Ms Low cited no authority for her novel proposition. Second (and more importantly), Ms Low’s submission unjustifiably extended the law on false imprisonment. The case law is very clear that there must minimally be some form of conduct from defendant (e.g., a threat) to prevent the plaintiff from leaving a defined space before there can be false imprisonment. In my view, self-induced fear by a plaintiff of what might happen is he were to leave a defined place is insufficient to constitute _direct and intentional_ false imprisonment _by_ a defendant.

39      **Key findings.** I now turn to the facts. A key piece of undisputed evidence supporting the Plaintiff’s false imprisonment claim was that the metal gate to the Flat was locked at the material times. After considering the evidence, I found that the Defendant had given a reasonable explanation for locking the gate and that she had no intention of wrongfully confining the Plaintiff. Further, I disbelieved the Plaintiff’s allegation that she was falsely imprisoned in the Flat and that she did not have a choice but to jump out from the Flat to escape. This view is based on the following findings:

> (a)     The Defendant did not control the Plaintiff’s movements. The Plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence to show that the Defendant had unjustifiably denied her request to leave the Flat.

> (b)     The Plaintiff had numerous opportunities to escape or to raise an alarm if she had been falsely imprisoned but had inexplicably failed to do so.

> (c)     The Plaintiff’s allegation that she had been wrongfully confined was materially contradicted by her accounts of the circumstances of the jump given to two doctors on the same day after the incident.

40     I will now explain the basis for these findings.

### The Defendant did not lock the metal gate with the intention of confining the Plaintiff in the Flat

41     As I have stated, the Defendant did not dispute that the metal gate was locked when the Plaintiff was in the Flat at night. According to the Defendant, the metal gate was locked for the personal safety of the Flat’s occupants (to prevent intruders from entering the Flat) – and not to confine the Plaintiff.

42     I found that the Defendant had provided a reasonable explanation for locking the metal gate. Many HDB dwellers – including those with domestic workers – keep the metal gate to their flat locked, especially at night, for security reasons. If the mere locking of the metal gate can constitute false imprisonment of the flats’ occupants, then these flat owners would all be liable. This surely cannot be correct. Indeed, Ms Low did not take such an extreme position.

43     In my judgement, as owners of the premises in which they are residing, employers ought to have some reasonable control over the movements of individuals (including their domestic workers) into and out of their place of residence. This was not disputed by Ms Low. She accepted that agents and employers may have some measure of oversight or supervision over domestic workers.[^41]

### The Defendant’s conduct showed that she did not control the Plaintiff’s movements and had no reason to confine her in the Flat

44     Ms Low submitted that the Defendant had confined the Plaintiff because it was against HDB regulations for the Defendant to be housing the Plaintiff in the Flat. Allowing the Plaintiff to leave the Flat, according to Ms Low, could expose this breach and lead others to discover the Defendant’s illegal agency activities.[^42] This could in turn cause the Defendant to lose the financial assistance which she was receiving at the material time.[^43] The Defendant could also suffer financial losses if the Plaintiff were to leave without further placement.[^44]

45     I was unable to accept Ms Low’s submissions.

46     First, I accepted the Defendant’s evidence that she was not unduly concerned that her neighbours would come to know that the Plaintiff was staying in the Flat, and that this was because they already knew that she would sometimes bring domestic workers to the Flat.[^45] The Defendant’s testimony was supported by the following uncontroverted evidence:

> (a)     Each day, the Defendant would leave the Flat with the Plaintiff from about 7.30 am for the Office, and they would return to the Flat at about 7.00 pm. The fact that the Defendant was prepared for the Plaintiff to be openly seen entering and leaving the Flat at such hours, where human traffic could be expected at HDB flats (e.g., neighbours leaving or returning to their homes), showed that she did not keep the fact that the Plaintiff was staying at the Flat a secret.

> (b)     It bears noting that Fitriya, another domestic worker,[^46] was also staying at the Flat at the material time. The Defendant did not have any issue with Fitriya leaving the Flat to throw the rubbish every night[^47] – even though this might expose the fact that the Defendant was housing transfer domestic workers in her Flat in breach of HDB regulations.

47     Second, Ms Low’s submissions that the Defendant had intentionally confined the Plaintiff in the Flat to hide the fact that she was operating an unlicensed maid agency ignored the undisputed fact that the Defendant had operated her unlicensed maid agency _very openly_.

> (a)     The Defendant conducted her business at Joo Chiat Complex, a commercial building. The Office was co-located with about eight to nine other businesses.[^48]

> (b)     During the material period, the Defendant would bring the Plaintiff and Fitriya to the Office for long durations, from about 7.30 am to 7.00 pm. She would task them to do basic cleaning work at the Office, in full view of the other businesses.[^49]

> (c)     The Plaintiff was free to visit a public toilet – which was about 20 m away from the Office – by herself, unsupervised. She was not given a time limit to visit the toilet.[^50]

48     Finally, there was no reason for the Defendant to confine the Plaintiff in the Flat. The latter did not give the Defendant any cause to believe that she (the Plaintiff) would want to run away.

### The Plaintiff had failed to prove that the Defendant had unjustifiably denied her request to leave the Flat

49     Ms Low submitted that if the Defendant had no intention to confine the Plaintiff, then she would have given the Plaintiff access to the house keys or given her free time instead of keeping her for long hours in the Office. Ms Low further submitted that the Defendant did not provide any evidence that she would have given the Plaintiff her house keys had the latter asked.[^51]

50     I was not persuaded by these submissions.

> (a)     These submissions unjustifiably reversed the Plaintiff’s burden of proof. In the context of the present case, where the Defendant had given a reason for locking the metal gate, it is for the Plaintiff to discredit that reason – for instance, by showing that the Plaintiff had made a reasonable request to leave the Flat and that the Defendant had unreasonably denied it.

> (b)     In this case, it was common ground that the Plaintiff did not in fact request to leave the Flat at all material times.[^52] Without the Plaintiff making such a request, how would the Defendant know that the Plaintiff had felt confined in the Flat?

> (c)     In my judgement, if the Plaintiff did in fact want to leave the Flat, she would have told the Defendant of this. The evidence revealed that the Plaintiff had no difficulty speaking her mind to the Defendant. For instance, the Plaintiff was not afraid to let the Defendant know that she was unhappy working for Sharifah and wanted a new employer. Despite the Defendant’s persuasion to reconsider her decision, the Plaintiff insisted on a change of employer.[^53]

### The Plaintiff had numerous opportunities to escape or raise an alarm if she had been confined

51     The Plaintiff clearly had _numerous_ opportunities to escape, and to raise an alarm that she had been falsely imprisonment, during the relevant period. These opportunities included the following:

> (a)     When the Plaintiff was brought out of the Flat each day to go to the Office,

> (b)     When the Plaintiff was at the Office, which was co-located with about eight to nine other businesses, every day for long durations,

> (c)     When the Plaintiff left the Office to visit the public toilet,

> (d)     When the Plaintiff was in the Flat –

>> (i)       She could have followed Fitriya when the latter left the Flat each night to throw the rubbish,

>> (ii)       She could have asked Fitriya where the key to the metal gate was since the latter had such information[^54] and both of them were friends and spoke a lot to each other,[^55]

>> (iii)       She could also have searched for the key herself.

52     Despite claiming that she was desperate to escape from the Flat, the Plaintiff did not make use of any of the above opportunities to do so.[^56] This fact materially discredited the Plaintiff’s claim that she had been falsely imprisoned in the Flat.

### The Plaintiff had failed to satisfactorily explain why she did not make use of the numerous opportunities to escape

53     When asked why she did not escape despite having numerous opportunities to do so, the Plaintiff repeatedly claimed that she was afraid of the Defendant.[^57]

54     I was not convinced by the Plaintiff’s claim.

> (a)     First, in her pleadings and AEIC, the Plaintiff did not allege (i) that she was fearful of the Defendant, (ii) that this fear had deterred her from using the numerous opportunities (as described earlier) to escape, and (iii) that the same fear had caused her to resort to jumping out of the Flat to escape. This omission is especially glaring given that the Plaintiff had no difficulty pleading that she had suffered “severe emotional distress” and “trauma” from Sharifah’s verbal abuse.[^58]

> (b)     Second, during the trial, the Plaintiff did not explain why she was so fearful of escaping.[^59]

> (c)     Finally, if the Plaintiff was fearful that the Defendant would cause her harm, it is puzzling why the Plaintiff did not escape at the earliest opportunity. After all, the uncontroverted evidence revealed that the Plaintiff was someone who was not afraid to leave a threatening environment – such as when she insisted to the Defendant that she wanted to leave Sharifah’s employment when the latter became verbally abusive.

### The Plaintiff’s allegation that she jumped out from the Flat to escape from false imprisonment had been materially contradicted by her prior contemporaneous accounts to her doctors

55     On 24 March 2016, soon after she had jumped out of the Flat, the Plaintiff was conveyed to CGH. On the same day, she was seen by Dr Vincent Wong Khung Hoon (“**Dr Wong**”) from CGH’s Department of General Surgery and Dr Hong Lin Feng (“**Dr Hong**”) from CGH’s Department of Psychological Medicine. These doctors separately spoke to the Plaintiff regarding why she had jumped out of the Flat. The information provided by the Plaintiff were documented in detailed medical notes recorded by Dr Wong and Dr Hong. These notes were tendered as part of the Plaintiff’s case.[^60]

56     If the Plaintiff had jumped out from the Flat to escape from false imprisonment, one would have expected this important information to be documented in the medical notes. This was however not the case. It is plain from the contemporaneous medical notes that there was no record of the Plaintiff having told Dr Wong and Dr Hong that she had jumped out of the Flat to escape from false imprisonment.

57     Instead, the Plaintiff was recorded as having disclosed to these doctors that she had jumped out of the Flat _to end her life_. According to the medical notes, the Plaintiff explained that she wanted to end her life because she was homesick, was unhappy working for Sharifah, and was frustrated that she did not have the funds to pay off the huge loan under the Agency Contract so as to get out of her unhappy situation.

58     The Plaintiff did not dispute the accuracy of the medical notes. She admitted that she did not complain to Dr Wong and Dr Hong that she had been falsely imprisoned by the Defendant.[^61]

59     In my judgement, the Plaintiff’s disclosures – documented in the medical notes on the same day of the jump – were fatal to her case that she had jumped out of the Flat to escape false imprisonment.

60     For completeness, I would like to address two matters.

### Sisi and Dominica’s evidence failed to salvage the Plaintiff’s false imprisonment claim

61     The first relates to the evidence of Ms Sisi Sukiato (“**Sisi**”) and Ms Dominica L Gaol (“**Dominica**”) who were called as defence witnesses. Sisi and Dominica were HOME officials who took care of the Plaintiff from end March 2016 after she was discharged from the hospital.

62     According to Sisi, the Plaintiff told her that the Defendant –

> (a)     had kept her locked in the Flat,

> (b)     had called her names, and

> (c)     had told her that she would be made to do sex work if the Defendant could not find a new employer for her.[^62]

In Sisi’s opinion, “\[f\]aced with the ongoing verbal abuse and endless chores and the threat of being made a sex worker in a foreign land, it is not surprising that the Plaintiff did what she could to escape from her predicament”.[^63]

63     According to Dominica, the Plaintiff told her the following:

> (a)     that she had jumped from the Flat because the Defendant was “very bad to her and had threatened her”,[^64]

> (b)     that “_If I had stayed longer, I will suffer and die_”, “_so better I jump, I have some chance to go out, rather than staying there I will die also_”,[^65]

> (c)     that she did not dare ask the Defendant if she could leave “for fear of further threat and scolding”, and

> (d)     that _“\[s\]he did not know what else to do except to take a risk and jump to escape from her situation_”.[^66]

64     In my judgement, Sisi and Dominica’s evidence were insufficient to provide the strong evidential support that the Plaintiff desperately needed to make out her false imprisonment case.

65     This is because while Sisi and Dominica’s evidence are _arguably relevant_ pursuant to s 159 of the Evidence (as being former verbal statements made in ordinary conversation by the Plaintiff), they carried _little weight_ – given that their evidence originated from the Plaintiff and thus lacked the quality of independence.

66     Furthermore, and in any event, I had grave doubts about the reliability of Sisi and Dominica’s evidence. I say this for the following reasons:

> (a)     I observed that Sisi was prone to conflating information that she had gathered from the Plaintiff with her own subjective opinion. Further, Sisi had great difficulty providing an objective account of what exactly the Plaintiff had told her. One example of this was when during cross-examination, Sisi testified that the Plaintiff had felt trapped in the Office. On further questioning, she reluctantly admitted that the Plaintiff did not say this to her.[^67] Nonetheless, Sisi provided her unsolicited opinion on what the Plaintiff would have been going through mentally when she was at the Flat and Office, and that the Plaintiff would have felt that she was being watched and being trapped. Despite being reminded that she was not medically qualified to testify to the Plaintiff’s mental state at the material time, Sisi persisted in maintaining her opinion.[^68]

> (b)     In the case of Dominica, I found that her recollection of what the Plaintiff had told her in 2016 (i.e., some five years before the trial) might have been corrupted with the passage of time. One example of this was when Dominica testified that the Plaintiff told her that she was made to work for _long hours_ cleaning the Office from morning _to 10 pm_.[^69] Dominica’s evidence did not gel with the Plaintiff’s on two counts. First, the Plaintiff testified that she would return to the Flat (from the Office) _by around 7 pm_ (not 10 pm). Second, the Plaintiff had also testified that she was made to clean the office _for only about one to two hours daily_.[^70]

### The mere fact that the Plaintiff had acute stress reaction at the material time did not prove that she had been wrongfully confined

67      **Acute stress reaction.** The second matter that I want to address is the Plaintiff’s evidence (which was not disputed by the Defendant)[^71] that she was suffering from acute stress reaction at or around the time of the jump. Acute stress reaction is a transient disorder which develops in an individual without any apparent mental disorder in response to exceptional physical and/or mental stress and which usually subsides within hours or days.[^72] The Plaintiff called two doctors to prove that her acute stress reaction was caused or contributed by her false imprisonment and that this had caused her to jump from the Flat.[^73]

68      **Dr Severine’s opinion.** The first doctor was Dr Severine GrandGeorge (“**Dr Severine**”). She had tended to the Plaintiff while the latter was recuperating at HOME from end-March 2016. Dr Severine was of the opinion that “the Plaintiff _would have suffered acute stress_ under the physical condition of _being confined_ living in a small flat _with no means of leaving the house_ without the 1st Defendant’s consent or seeking help from the authorities or other persons”. \[emphasis added\][^74]

69     I did not find Dr Severine’s opinion to be helpful. My reasons are as follows:

> (a)     Dr Severine did not interview the Plaintiff. Her opinion (that the Plaintiff had been confined and that this had caused her to jump out of the Flat) was not based on any information which she had personally and directly obtained from the Plaintiff.[^75] Instead, Dr Severine’s opinion was _based on hearsay evidence_ – namely, (i) the Plaintiff’s AEIC dated 15 December 2020 and (ii) an article by The Online Citizen on the Plaintiff’s case dated 5 October 2017 (“**The Online Citizen article**”).[^76] In the case of the article, it is in fact hearsay upon hearsay. It bears noting that the AEIC and article were made long after the jump on 24 March 2016 and were _not contemporaneous_.

> (b)     During the trial, Dr Severine was clearly sympathetic towards the Plaintiff’s case and had unquestioningly accepted the Plaintiff’s claim that she had jumped out of the Flat to escape from her alleged confinement.[^77] When confronted with evidence that contradicted the Plaintiff’s claim, Dr Severine was not prepared to re-evaluate her assumptions and opinion. The following extract from Dr Severine’s cross-examination is an example of how she had tried very hard to rationalise why the Plaintiff did not escape from her alleged confinement by availing herself to the numerous opportunities to do so:

>> Q    ... \[The Plaintiff\] was staying in a flat but she was not unlawfully confined because if she was, she would have avail herself of the opportunities---4 opportunities to run away.

>> A     _I really think_ she was scared by the agent, she was stress, you couldn’t English so she---she wouldn’t know where to go, you know, _I think_ she---she didn’t---she didn’t want to---she couldn’t escape, _she was confined in the sense that she was under the authority of the agent and she couldn’t do anything on her own_, she had no phone, _nowhere to go, no one to speak, to seek advice so and_\---and _I think---and she felt_ when she was in the---the flat, she was lock down, she has no days off too, that’s a way of being confined, _I think_ and---

>> Q    Okay, to---

>> A    she was---

>> Q    do---

>> A    afraid to go out---

>> Q    no---

>> A    agree with the agents, to follow the agents and that so---so, _it’s the confinement_ it’s---_she was not free at all_.[^78]

>> \[emphasis added\]

> It is evident from the above cross-examination that Dr Severine was personally convinced that the Plaintiff had been confined. This was despite the fact that she had not interviewed the Plaintiff and there was in fact evidence to discredit the Plaintiff’s claim of wrongful confinement.

> (c)     Finally, Dr Severine could not rule out the fact that even without the alleged confinement, the Plaintiff might have jumped out of the Flat due to the other stressors that she was experiencing at the material time:

>> Q    \[...\] Now, leaving aside the wrongful confinement, just leaving that aside would there be enough factors there to cause the Plaintiff to jump out of the window? If you just put aside the physical wrongful confinement.

>> A    Uh, that’s a difficult question to answer. Because you ask me basically what would have happened if all the other factor would have been without the wrongful---wrongful confinement. at---_I can’t---I can’t tell you, it may---it may have been enough to let Nina jump to the window and maybe that---that’s, you know, it’s something that I---I---I can’t tell you_ because the acute stress reaction occurs in different situation for different people. So, it’s not something, you know, _I can’t really answer that question_.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> Dr Severine’s evidence that other factors “\[might\] have been enough to \[cause the Plaintiff to\] jump” cast grave doubts on the nexus between the alleged confinement and the Plaintiff jumping out from the Flat.

70     It is well established that an expert opinion is of little utility if the primary facts it relies upon are either hearsay evidence (e.g., _Gema Metal Ceilings (Far East) v Iwatani Techno Construction (M)_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 37</span>) or had been accepted without critical analysis by the expert (_Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 887</span> at \[30\] and \[31\]). In the present case, Dr Severine’s opinion clearly cannot survive forensic scrutiny.

71      **Dr Rajesh’s opinion.** In 2020, in preparation for DC 735, Justice Without Borders (a non-governmental organisation) requested Dr Jacob Rajesh (a senior consultant psychiatrist with Promises (Winslow) Clinic) to assess the Plaintiff’s mental state leading to her jump from the Flat. Specifically, Dr Rajesh was asked to give an opinion on whether the acute stress reaction noted in Dr Wong and Dr Hong’s medical notes –

> **...** could have resulted from the \[Defendant’s\] mistreatment and confinement of the Plaintiff in the circumstances as set out in her Pleadings, and further whether such ‘acute stress reaction’ would have led her to jump to escape from confinement in the \[Flat\].[^79]

> (“**the Issue**”)

72     Dr Rajesh interviewed the Plaintiff three times in 2020 and 2021. In Dr Rajesh’s opinion –

> ... \[the Plaintiff's\] Acute Stress Reaction was precipitated by her confinement in her agent's house for 3 days and the preceding verbal abuse by her employer Sharifah and her agent Nora. Both these factors played a cumulative and synergistic role in the precipitation of her acute stress disorder”.[^80]

73     I found Dr Rajesh’s opinion to be unreliable. This was because in coming to his opinion, Dr Rajesh had failed to keep an open mind on the Issue. For instance, when asked whether the Plaintiff’s omission to inform Dr Wong and Dr Hong that she had jumped out of the Flat to escape from confinement would undermine his opinion on the Issue,[^81] Dr Rajesh refused to concede on the point (despite the point being a reasonable one to make).

74     Instead, Dr Rajesh speculated that the omission was due to the fact that Dr Wong and Dr Hong were “junior” doctors and that they were more concerned with coming up with a diagnosis and a management plan for the Plaintiff then probing her on why she had jumped.[^82] Dr Rajesh’s speculation is clearly untenable.

> (a)     First, it is evident from the medical notes that Dr Wong and Dr Hong _did in fact probe_ the Plaintiff on why she had jumped:

>> _Medical notes by Dr Wong dated 24 March 2016_

>> ... Spoken to patient. Patient shown to be very frustrated. She claimed she has been bullied, tortured by the employer. She had been denied food or forced to eat at the toilet. She asked to be deported but was denied by the agent and the employer. Out of desperation she tried to kill herself. ... Kindly review the patient in view of her history. ... [^83]

>> _Medical notes by Dr Hong dated 24 March 2016_

>> ... Feeling sad for the last 1 week. First time coming to Singapore. Paid a lot of money to come here to work. Unhappy working for current employer. Wanted to change employer so called up agent. Agent scolded her and stated that she has to pay $14 million rupiah. But doesn’t have such money. Missing family members. Hasn’t spoken to them since coming to Singapore. Was feeling sad this morning. Suddenly had this thought of not wanting to live anymore. Decided to jump from third level she lived on. ...

> (b)     Second, Dr Rajesh’s attempt to undermine the evidential value of the medical notes – by claiming that they were made by “junior” (and hence inexperienced) doctors – ignored the fact that these notes had been reviewed by Dr Cheryl Loh (“**Dr Loh**”), who was in charge of CGH’s psychiatric department at the material time. According to Dr Loh, Dr Hong was under her supervision and had discussed the Plaintiff’s case with her.[^84] Dr Rajesh did not dispute this evidence.[^85]

> (c)     Finally, when questioned on whether the Plaintiff could have jumped out of the Flat due to the stressors other than the alleged confinement, Dr Rajesh struggled to give a straight answer:

>> Q    Arising from your answer, Doctor, yes, if we put aside the confinement---the unlawful confinement from the permutation, from all the factors, if you just take that out and just---and all the other factors, would you agree with me? Would you---would she still have jumped, Doctor? If you take---and just forget about the un---il---illegal confinement, leave that aside. From all the other factors that---that have been---that we---we know of now.

>> A    Mmm hmm.

>> Q    All of them, put them all together. She would have committed still---she should have still committed suicide or attempted suicide?

>> A    No. With unlawfully confinement towards the triggering factor for the jump. So, if you say that she was not confined unlawfully, correct? That’s what you are saying, right? Assuming that she was---the house open. She was free to go out---out. Yah. Uh, is that the question?

>> Q    No. That’s why I say. You leave that aside. And just for one, leave that aside. Just look at all the other factors. Even if she was free to go, alright.

>> ...

>> Witness:    It’s difficult to what as---uh, to give me---to give a---a yes or no answer. But again, looking at the case itself, she was in the employer’s house for 2 weeks and she did not---even though she was feeling sad and was missing her family, she did not really attempt suicide. In fact she wanted a change of employer which showed that she actually---she wanted to continue to work in Singapore. Which showed that she had some form of hope. So, it’s not a depressive state of mind. Assuming she was free to leave the house, assuming that there was no verbal abuse by the agent. Assuming that she was given all the food, assuming she was not eaten in front---uh, asked to eat in front of the toilet. Because all those factual also play---play the role to the triggering of the ASR. So, it is---it is a more like a specu---because more speculative, right. It’s difficult for me to give you a---a straight answer.[^86]

75     Before moving on, I wish to make some observations. Dr Severine and Dr Rajesh testified that the Plaintiff’s alleged confinement in the Flat had precipitated or caused her to suffer acute stress reaction and to escape from her confinement by jumping out of the Flat. In coming to such an opinion, they unfortunately had unquestioningly assumed that the Plaintiff had been confined – and were not prepared to review their assumptions and opinion in light of new/contradicting evidence. Through their own conduct, Dr Severine and Dr Rajesh had cast doubts on the objectivity of their opinion. It is useful for expert witnesses to note that they may not be in the best position to forensically assess the veracity of a claim provided by their patient or client. This is because unlike a court, they do not have the advantage of knowing _all_ the evidence on the issue. Neither do they have the benefit of having all the relevant evidence stress-tested through cross-examination.

### Why did the Plaintiff jump out from the Flat?

76     In the present case, I noted that Dr Severine and Dr Rajesh had (with some reluctance) acknowledged that they were not able to determine conclusively that it was wrongful confinement – and not other reasons/stressors – which caused the Plaintiff to jump out of the Flat. This considerably weakened the evidential link between the Plaintiff’s acute stress reaction and the jump with the alleged wrongful confinement.

77     In my judgement, the mere fact that the Plaintiff had jumped from the Flat did not prove that she had been confined. In fact, it is evident from Dr Wong and Dr Hong’s contemporaneous medical notes that the Plaintiff had jumped out of the Flat, sadly, _to end her life_.

78     There was no reason for me to question the reliability of the medical notes. These notes, which showed that the Plaintiff had jumped out of the Flat – not to escape – but to end her own life, were corroborated by the following admissions made by the Plaintiff during the trial:

> (a)     The Plaintiff was under emotional stress due to homesickness (she had not left Indonesia before coming to Singapore to work for the Employer) and isolation from her family (having not communicated with them since coming to Singapore).

> (b)     She was under immense financial burden because she incurred a huge debt in coming to Singapore to work. If she could not find employment in Singapore, she would not have the means to repay the debt. This weighed heavily on the Plaintiff’s mind at the material time.

> (c)     She was feeling confused at the material time. On the one hand, she felt homesick and wanted to return to her family. On the other hand, she could not do so because of her financial commitments.

## Conclusion

79     For the above reasons, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claims for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation and false imprisonment.
