### District Judge Josephine Kang:

1       The Accused, a 30-year-old Singaporean Male, was charged with five drug-related offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”). He pleaded guilty to three of these charges, and agreed to have the remaining two taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:

2       The Accused was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. He appealed against the sentence.

## The facts

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification.

4       On 26 February 2018, CNB officers arrested the Accused for suspected drug-related offences. On the same day, he was brought to his residence and a search was conducted in his bedroom. Some items found were seized and marked as exhibits. The Accused and the seized exhibits were subsequently brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) for further investigations.

#### Facts relating to DAC-906836-2018

5       On 26 February 2018, one Teng Yi Gang (also known as "Peter") was arrested by CNB officers at his residence. A packet of vegetable matter (later marked as exhibit “T-A”) was found in his residence. Peter admitted that exhibit “T-A” belonged to him. Upon analysis, exhibit “T-A” was found to contain no less than 2.35g of fragmented vegetable, which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol i.e. cannabis mixture (as defined in s2 MDA).

6       The Accused admitted to have given Peter exhibit “T-A” on 24 February 2018, at around or before 1pm, at Peter's residence. By doing so, he had abetted the possession of a Controlled Drug, which was an offence under s8(a) MDA read with s12 MDA and punishable under s33(1) MDA.

#### Facts relating to DAC-914778-2018

7       At the CNB HQ, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples for analysis. HSA certified that the Accused’s urine sample was found to contain 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid. This was a cannabinol derivative, which is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA. The Accused admitted to consuming ‘weed’ (street name of cannabis) without authorisation prior to his arrest on 25 February 2018. He had thereby committed an offence under s8(b)(ii) MDA punishable under s33(1) MDA.

#### Facts relating to DAC-920115-2018

8       On 27 February 2018, exhibit "K-A1" (an IKEA ziplock bag containing vegetable matter which was seized from the Accused) was sent to the HSA for analysis. HSA certified that on analysis, exhibit “K-A1” contained not less than 9.28g of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis. The Accused admitted that exhibit “K-A1” belonged to him and that it contained cannabis. He had bought it for his own consumption. He had thereby committed an offence under s8(a) MDA and punishable under s33(1) MDA.

## Antecedents

9       The Accused was untraced.

## Mitigation

10     The Accused lived with his parents, step-mother and younger sister. After graduating from secondary school, he enrolled with the polytechnic but left without completing his diploma course. Six months prior to his arrest, he started a company, Relaque LLP, which was a nail salon business with retail operations. At the time of sentencing, he had been accepted by Kaplan Institute to continue with his diploma course.

11     The Accused had been consuming cannabis casually for 7 to 12 months prior to his arrest. He consumed cannabis as a form of self-medication to help him cope with his long-term sleep deprivation and ongoing stress.

12     In February 2018, Teng contacted the Accused and asked for some cannabis as he was depressed and wanted to commit suicide. Initially reluctant, the Accused nevertheless decide to pass some drugs to him in order to ‘get him off his back’.

13     On 26 February 2018, the Accused was arrested by the CNB. He was fully cooperative during the process. He voluntarily informed the officers where he had kept his cannabis, which were for his own consumption.

14     Two medical reports were attached to the mitigation plea, one prepared by the Institute of Mental Health (“the IMH report”) and the other prepared by Promises Healthcare Pte Ltd (“Dr. Winslow’s Report”).

#### The IMH report

15     According to the IMH report, the Accused first presented at the IMH in May 2010 for difficulties adjusting to his posting in National Service. In March 2018, after he was arrested for the drug charges, he presented at the IMH again, where he was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. During his follow-up appointment, he was also investigated for symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity since childhood and was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (“ADHD”). He was offered medication, which he declined.

16     IMH referred the Accused to the National Addictions Management Service (“NAMS”) and he was seen in April 2018. He was referred for counselling therapy. During his 5th counselling session, he said that he was seeing his private psychiatrist and counsellor and was also attending regular group meetings at Narcotics Anonymous. On his request, he was discharged from NAMS service.

#### Dr. Winslow’s Report

17     The salient parts of Dr. Winslow’s opinion were contained in paragraphs 16, 18 and 19 of his report, which I summarised below:

(i)     The Accused had ADHD, which was consistent with his long-standing issues with concentration and focus as well as his impulsiveness.

(ii)     The Accused was suffering from Insomnia Disorder and ADHD at the material time and which had been present for an extended period prior to his arrest. He used cannabis primarily to self-medicate his untreated symptoms. It was likely that “these factors combined with an increase in the severity of his symptomology due to work stress, significantly contributed to his poor judgment in continuing his use of cannabis."

(iii)     The Accused was “an individual with high levels of impulsivity and presents with significant problems with impulse control (as seen in his psychological testing, and his ADHD diagnosis). His psychiatric conditions together with the stressors leading up to the alleged offences, including his financial problems, \[were\] likely to have impacted his judgment and impulse control leading to the commission of the alleged offences.

18     Dr. Winslow further opined that the Accused’s commission of the alleged offences should be “seen in the context of someone who was using substances to cope with his underlying psychiatric issues...”. He recommended the Accused to continue with his regular monthly follow-up with a psychiatrist to monitor and treat his insomnia and ADHD with medications, as necessary.

## Probation Report

19     During the first hearing, the Defence Counsel invited the Court to call for a probation report to assess the Accused’s suitability for probation. The Prosecution objected. After hearing both parties, I decided to call for the probation report.

20     The probation officer assessed the Accused as a suitable candidate for probation. His risk factors included his willingness to engage in risky behaviours despite knowing it was illegal; his poor coping and problem-solving skills, indiscriminate peer associations, exposure to negative habits, lack of self-control and consequential thinking. Inadequate parental supervision had also given him the freedom to engage in negative activities.

21     Nevertheless, the probation officer felt that he had the capacity to be rehabilitated given his positive responsiveness to the trial probation conditions. The other protective factors included his parents’ willingness to work on their parenting style to support his rehabilitation and the Accused’s willingness to receive professional help to abstain from drugs, treat his insomnia disorder and improve his coping mechanisms.

## Submissions on sentence

22     The Prosecution submitted for the following sentences:

(i)     DAC-906836-2018 - At least 8 months' imprisonment

(ii)     DAC-914778-2018 - At least 8 months' imprisonment

(iii)     DAC-920115-2018 - At least 15 months' imprisonment

23     In their oral submissions, the Prosecution referred to _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ . They pointed out that the quantity of drugs involved was not insubstantial. Besides possessing 9.28g of cannabis (which was the subject of the proceeded charge), he was also found in possession of 13.8g of cannabis mixture (which formed the subject of the TIC charge). They further submitted that the 15-month imprisonment term should run consecutively with one of the 8-month imprisonment term, thereby bringing the aggregate sentence to 23 months’ imprisonment.

24     In their written submissions, the Prosecution further argued that this was not an appropriate case for an order of probation for the following reasons:

(i)     General deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration for drug offences, especially if cannabis was involved. This was because cannabis abuse has recently been on the rise in Singapore and was the third most commonly abused drug in 2017.

(ii)     Specific deterrence applied with added force in this case as the Accused was convicted of multiple drug offences and was not a first-time drug abuser. He had a substantial history of drug abuse stretching back to his twenties and had abused drugs despite knowing that it was illegal in Singapore.

(iii)     The Accused’s psychiatric disorders were not causally linked to his commission of the offences and hence, this was not a “purely exceptional case” which would warrant a departure from the usual norm of custodial sentences imposed for drug offences. The Prosecution also criticised Dr. Winslow’s report as vague, unhelpful and which did not clearly state a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric disorders and his commission of the offences.

(iv)     Even if the Accused’s psychiatric conditions were causally linked to the commission of the offences, a probation order would nevertheless be inappropriate. It would set a dangerous precedent which would undermine Singapore’s zero-tolerance policy on drugs, and condone illegal consumption of drugs for the purposes of self-medication.

25     The Defence Counsel had initially urged the Court to consider imposing either a probation order or a Mandatory Treatment Order (‘MTO’). During the hearing, Counsel withdrew his submissions for MTO and focussed his submissions on obtaining a probation order.

26     The Defence Counsel submitted that an order of probation should be imposed for these reasons, amongst others:

(i)     The Accused’s mental state had contributed to his offences. In particular, the Counsel urged the Court to give weight to Dr. Winslow’s findings that the Accused’s state of mind had “significantly contributed to his poor judgment in continuing his use of cannabis” and that “the best way to ensure that this behavior did not repeat itself was through an active mental health and recovery programme”.

(ii)     The Accused had the benefit of strong family support and this was a key feature that ought to be given full weight.

(iii)     This was the Accused’s first brush with the law. He was contrite and vowed never to repeat.

(iv)     He was amenable to reform. According to \[42\] of the Defence’s submissions, “_after several interviews with \[the Accused\] and his family, including a home-visit and risk assessment, \[the probation officer\] had presented a detailed plan that suits \[the Accused\]. This clearly point towards \[the Accused’s\] capacity for reform and high potential for change_”.

(v)     Counsel also pointed out that the Accused had been regularly attending his counselling sessions at NAMS, 25 Narcotics Anonymous meetings, 4 counselling sessions at IMH and 3 medical review sessions.

## Probation for Adult Drug Offenders

27     In determining whether a probation order was appropriate, s5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (POA) required the sentencing court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender.

28     In the context of whether probation was suitable for an adult drug offender, the High Court made the following observations in _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ (“_Alvin Lim_”). Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon held that for drug offences, deterrence is clearly the dominant consideration and, save for the “purely exceptional case”, a custodial term is usually warranted. The CJ also pointed out that precedents where probation had been ordered for older drug offenders involved those who were suffering from psychiatric or other condition that was in some way causally related to the drug offence.

29     General guidance could be drawn from _GCO v PP_ , where Justice See Kee Oon had summarised the relevant principles concerning when probation should be ordered for older offenders, which were the same principles he had laid out in the earlier case of _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jordan_ (“_Jordan Lim_”):

(i)     Probation responds to the principle of rehabilitation and can only be justified where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration;

(ii)     Rehabilitation as a sentencing principle will presumptively take precedence where young offenders are involved, seeing as they are in their formative years and have better prospects of being reformed;

(iii)     That said, adult offenders above 21 years of age can still be sentenced to probation, although this would be the exception rather than the norm. What was required, however, is that the offender demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform, or that there be exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation.

(iv)     Moreover, even if rehabilitation is found to apply, it can be displaced by the need for deterrence. Deterrence would become relatively more prominent, and rehabilitation correspondingly less so, if the offence is serious or the harm caused is severe, amongst other considerations. Rehabilitation would come to the fore, and deterrence recede in significance, if the offender suffers from a mental condition causally linked to the commission of the offence.

## The analytical framework

30     In assessing whether to impose an order of probation or custodial sentence, I considered the following questions:

(i)     Could this be classified as a ‘purely exceptional case’ in light of the Accused’s psychiatric conditions?

(ii)     Did the Accused demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform, such that rehabilitation should displace deterrence as the dominant sentencing principle?

## Was this a ‘purely exceptional case’?

31     In _Alvin Lim_, CJ Menon stated that probation _might_ be considered in cases of adult drug offenders who suffer from psychiatric conditions which are causally linked to the offences. For instance, in _PP v Lee Han Fong Lyon_ , the Court had imposed probation on a 25-year old drug offender who had suffered from ADHD and which was a factor in his criminality. The medical evidence was that even though that offender was aware of the wrongfulness of his acts, he did not realise the seriousness of his actions as he could not think much about the consequences of the wrongful acts.

32     In _Lim Ghim Peow v PP_ _(“Lim Ghim Peow”) at_ \[52\], the Court held that the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender did not automatically reduce the importance of the principle of general deterrence in sentencing. Much depended on the circumstances of each individual case. The court must examine the nature and gravity of the offender's mental condition and its impact on the commission of the offence before arriving at a sentence that takes into account and balances the relevant sentencing objectives. If the offender had acted with knowledge of what he was doing and of the gravity of his actions, and the offence is particularly serious or heinous, the principles of deterrence, retribution and protection may assume primacy in the sentencing process. If the nature of the mental disorder is such that it does not affect the offender’s capacity to appreciate the gravity and significance of his criminal conduct, the application of the sentencing principle of general deterrence may not be greatly affected.

33      _Lim Ghim Peow_ was cited with approval in _Jordan Lim_, where J. See stated that it is not simply the existence of a mental condition that displaces the need for deterrence and brings rehabilitation to the fore. Rather, the search is for the existence of a mental condition that is causally linked to the commission of the offence.

#### Was there a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric condition and the commission of the offences?

34     It was not disputed that the Accused did suffer from ADHD and Insomnia Disorder at the material time. However, the Prosecution did not agree that the Accused’s mental condition had a causal link with the commission of the offences.

35     In this regard, I noted that the IMH report was silent on the issue of a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and the commission of the offences. Dr. Winslow did not use the words ‘causal link’ in his report. However, he alluded to the presence of a causal link by stating as follows in paragraphs 18 and 19 of his report:

(i)     Paragraph 18: “it is likely that these factors combined with an increase in the severity of his symptomology due to work stress, significantly contributed to his poor judgment in continuing his use of cannabis”.

(ii)     Paragraph 19: “his psychiatric conditions together with the stressors leading up to the alleged offences, including his financial problems, are likely to have impacted his judgment and impulse control leading to the commission of the alleged offences.”

36     Unfortunately, I had to agree with the Prosecution that Dr. Winslow’s report had failed to clearly state or explain the presence of a causal link between the Accused’s mental conditions and the commission of the offences. The statement in paragraph 18 was vague. When Dr. Winslow referred to 'these factors' as having contributed to the Accused’s poor judgment, it was not clear what these factors were. When referring to the Accused’s ‘poor judgment’, he did not elaborate on whether this meant that the Accused’s ability to understand the nature or consequences of the offences had been impaired. In fact, one could construe this sentence the other way i.e. that the Accused retained the ability to make his own judgments, albeit poor ones and hence, it was not a situation where his mental conditions had irresistibly driven him to commit those offences. Either way, this opinion lacked specificity and was therefore inconclusive.

37     In paragraph 19 of his report, Dr. Winslow was clearer in stating that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions, coupled with his stressors (including his financial problems) had impacted his judgment and impulse control, which led to the commission of the offences. However, on closer scrutiny, I did not find this statement helpful to the Accused’s case.

38     In essence, Dr. Winslow’s assessment was that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions had impacted (i) his judgment and (ii) his impulse control. Again, as regards the Accused’s impacted judgment, Dr. Winslow did not specify whether this meant that the Accused’s capacity to understand the nature and gravity of his offences was impacted by his psychiatric conditions. If so, how and to what extent? Lacking in specificity or explanation, this was of no assistance to the present analysis.

39     As regards the Accused’s impacted impulse control, even if I were prepared to accept that the Accused’s impulse control may have been impacted by his psychiatric conditions and stressors, I was of the view that impulse control played a limited role in the context of these offences. The offences he had committed were neither opportunistic nor one-off in nature. He had starting consuming drugs in his twenties, well before the emergence of his stressors. There was no evidence that his impaired impulse control was responsible for his decision to pass the drugs to Teng. If anything, his initial rejection of Teng’s requests for drugs showed that he had the capacity to say ‘no’. Hence, in my view, paragraph 19 of Dr. Winslow’s report did not assist the Accused.

40     In any event, I noted that Dr. Winslow had simply put forth his opinions without any explanations. His report did not contain any underlying evidence, analytical process and reasons to support his opinions. This was not ideal. In _PP v Chia Kee Chen and Anor Appeal_ , CJ Menon stated that it was critical for an expert to provide the reasoning behind his conclusions. If he failed to do so and the report could not be probed or evaluated, it was useless and prone to be rejected. CJ Menon also commented that a psychiatrist should “state his opinion as definitively as possible to the best of his ability, avoiding ambiguity and minimising room for subjectivity in interpretation. Otherwise, his opinion may be unhelpful and unreliable”. Ultimately, if the psychiatric report appeared “contrived and flimsy”, the court would be justified in rejecting the evidence of the offender’s purported mental condition.

41     I considered seeking clarifications from Dr. Winslow on various aspects of the reports which were unsatisfactory. Eventually, I decided that it was unnecessary as there were other factors which would have militated against the finding of a ‘purely exceptional case’ in any event.

#### The factors militating against the finding of a ‘purely exceptional case’

42     The Prosecution pointed out and I accepted that there was no medical evidence that the Accused had failed to understand either the wrongfulness or seriousness of his acts. On the contrary, the facts stated in the probation report showed that the Accused did understand the nature and severity of his offences[^1].

43     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s admission to have abused drugs as a lifestyle activity for fun and relaxation[^2], the fact that he had shared his supply of cannabis with other drug abusers, and his overseas escapades to smoke cannabis for fun and enjoyment[^3], undermined the position that there was a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric disorders and his commission of the offences. These indicated that the Accused’s decision to commit the drug offences was not, as opined by Dr. Winslow, motivated by his desire to cope with his underlying psychiatric conditions. He had clearly gone far beyond that and committed the offences for social reasons, despite knowing the nature and consequences of his illegal acts.

44     To be fair, these facts may not have been disclosed to Dr. Winslow, given that his report made no mention of them. The absence of these facts may have impacted his ability to give a fair and accurate assessment.

45     All things considered, I was of the view that the medical evidence did not show a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and his commission of the offences. Besides that, there were other facts which militated against the finding of a ‘purely exceptional case’. In my judgment, notwithstanding the Accused’s psychiatric disorders, this was not a ‘purely exceptional case’ which could justify a departure from the usual custodial sentence.

## The Accused’s propensity for reform

46     Even if this was not a ‘purely exceptional case’, the Court could still be persuaded to offer probation if the Accused could show an extremely strong propensity for reform.

47     Defence Counsel had argued that the probation report pointed clearly towards the Accused’s capacity for reform and high potential for change. He also invited the Court to consider the Accused’s strong family support, his clean record and his voluntary attendance for the sessions with NAMS, Narcotics Anonymous and the psychiatrists.

48     I accepted that the Accused’s strong family support and his clean record were factors which operated in his favour. I did not, however, place much weight on his attendance at the counselling sessions. In my view, these were neutral factors at best, given that he had commenced on these sessions after his arrest. In fact, I noted that he had voluntarily discharged from NAMS counselling services on the 5th session and also declined the medication offered to him by IMH to manage his ADHD.

49     The Accused’s track record was not encouraging. The probation report contained the Accused’s educational and employment history, which I summarised below in chronological order:

50     I observed that the Accused had done well for his National Service and worked in his father’s company for three years. However, beyond that, his track record was patchy. He had embarked on diploma courses thrice and completed none. Tellingly, in two of those instances, he had dropped out of the courses due to disinterest. Most of his other jobs were part-time or did not last very long. One of his jobs as a bartender had exposed him to drugs.

51     In my view, the Accused may have the capacity for reform but he had to demonstrate something more than that i.e. that he had an extremely strong propensity for reform. Unfortunately, the evidence before me did not support that finding.

#### The tension between deterrence and rehabilitation – which should take prominence?

52     Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach to drug offences. The dominant sentencing consideration for drug offences is generally that of deterrence. The Prosecution had tendered a report entitled “Overview of Singapore’s Drug Situation in Singapore 2017”, which showed that the demand (and supply) for cannabis had been increasing in recent years, and that cannabis was the third most commonly abused drug amongst drug abusers arrested in 2017. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that general deterrence was a prominent sentencing consideration.

53     Specific deterrence was also a dominant sentencing consideration. The Accused first consumed cannabis in his twenties. He continued consuming it occasionally between 2009 and 2016. By 2017, he had become a casual user who smoked a joint every night. He also possessed a significant quantity of cannabis and had also shared his drugs with another drug abuser. He did all these knowing that it was illegal to consume and possess drugs in Singapore.

54     In the light of the seriousness of his offences, the Accused would have had to present an extremely compelling case of his propensity to reform before I would consider probation. In my view, he could not do so. Hence, I was not inclined to find that deterrence had been displaced by rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.

## The Sentence

55     All things considered, I did not see a reason to deviate from the usual custodial sentences for drug offences. I accordingly imposed the following sentences on the Accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr"><colgroup><col width="24.62%"> <col width="49.46%"> <col width="25.92%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-906836-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Abetment of Possession of a Controlled Drug (2.35g Cannabis Mixture) s8(a) MDA r/w s12 MDA p/u s33(1) MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment 8 months (consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-914778-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption of a Specified Drug, namely 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid s8(b)(ii) MDA p/u s33(1) MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment 10 months (consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-920115-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of a Controlled drug (9.28g Cannabis) s8(a) MDA p/u s33(1) MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment 15 months (concurrent)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

56     In respect of DAC-906836-2018, I agreed with the 8 months’ imprisonment proposed by the Prosecution.

57     The Prosecution had submitted for an imprisonment term of 8 months for the consumption offence. In my view, this was too lenient, considering that the Accused was a casual user of drugs as opposed to a one-off user. I accordingly imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment to reflect the greater need for specific deterrence in this instance.

58     In respect of the Accused’s possession charge, the 15 months’ imprisonment proposed by the Prosecution was not unreasonable, having regard to the significant quantity of drugs involved (9.28g of cannabis) in the proceeded charge, and also taking into account the TIC charge (which involved 13.8g of cannabis mixture).

59     The Prosecution had asked for the 15 months’ imprisonment sentence to run consecutively with the 8 months' imprisonment. That would have brought the aggregate sentence to 23 months. In my view, this was rather harsh, considering that this was the Accused's first conviction and his plea of guilt.

60     I therefore ordered the sentence for DAC-906836-2018 (8 months’ imprisonment) to run consecutively with the sentence for DAC-914778-2018 (10 months’ imprisonment). The Accused’s aggregate sentence would therefore be 18 months’ imprisonment.

61     The Accused has appealed against the sentence. He is currently on bail pending appeal.
