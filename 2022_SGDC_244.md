\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9181/2022/01.\]

14 October 2022

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mr Seah Swee Siang (“**Seah**”) is 25 years of age. In May 2018, he met a young woman (the “**Victim**”) on a dating application. They began a romantic relationship and had sexual intercourse on several occasions. He took videos and a photograph of their sexual activity. But their relationship began to deteriorate in August 2018. On 25 March 2019, they had an argument over her intention to break up with him; he threatened to hack into her Instagram account and post the videos and photograph. On 8 April 2019, they met at a void deck to talk about the state of their relationship. He asked her to have sex with him. She rebuffed the request. In anger he took out a flip-knife, with which he intimidated her. He poked her left thigh with its tip, and then placed the blade to the side of her neck. He told her how hurt he had been the entire time. She was crying continuously, and eventually agreed to have sexual intercourse with him later that month.

2       She made a police report. Following investigations, a total of seven charges were brought against Seah for various offences, mostly against her. On 2 August 2022, he pleaded guilty to three charges: two charges of criminal intimidation, under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“**Penal Code**”); and one charge of being armed with the flip-knife without lawful authority or a lawful purpose, an offence under s 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184 (“**MOA**”). Four other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

3       On 7 September 2022, he was sentenced to a total of 5 months’ imprisonment. He was allowed to defer the sentence to 23 September 2022. He filed the present appeal through his counsel on 16 September 2022. The sentence has been stayed and he is on bail pending the appeal.

4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

5       The three charges to which Seah pleaded guilty were as follows (in the order in which the offences were committed):

> MAC-906802-2020

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 25th of March 2019, at about 6.27 pm, in Singapore, did commit criminal intimidation, _to wit_, by threatening the \[Victim\] with injury to her reputation by threatening, via WhatsApp messages, to hack into her Instagram account and posting videos and a photograph of you and the victim having sexual intercourse onto the victim’s Instagram feed, with intent to cause alarm to her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> MAC-906801-2020

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 8th of April 2019, sometime between 12.00am to 1.00am, at the void deck at \[the Victim’s home\], Singapore, did commit criminal intimidation, _to wit_, by putting a flip-knife against the thigh and neck of the \[Victim\], and in so doing threatening the victim with injury to her person, with intent to cause alarm to the victim and to cause that person to do an act – sexual intercourse – that she was not legally bound to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (1st limb) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> DAC-917212-2020

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 8th of April 2019, sometime between 12.00am to 1.00am, at the void deck at \[the Victim’s home\], Singapore, were armed with an offensive instrument – a flip-knife – without lawful authority or a lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184.

6       The relevant statutory provisions were as follows:

> Section 506 Penal Code

> Whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both \[…\].

> Section 22(1)(a) MOA

> 22.—(1)    Any person who is found — (a) armed with any dangerous or offensive instrument without lawful authority or a lawful purpose; \[…\] shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years; and any instrument or article found in the possession of that person shall be forfeited.

### Facts

7       These were the salient facts.

8       Seah and the Victim started dating after meeting on Tinder (a mobile dating application) sometime in May 2018. They had a romantic relationship which included sexual intercourse. Seah used his mobile phone to take a total of five videos and one photograph of their sexual activities over three separate occasions (the “**videos and photograph**”). But their relationship started to break down in August 2018.

#### 25 March 2019: criminal intimidation

9       In late 2018, she told him to delete the videos and photograph. She personally went to his home in December 2018 or January 2019 and, with his agreement, deleted the videos and photograph from his computer and mobile phone. Unknown to her, he still had a copy of the videos and photograph stored on other devices.

10     On 25 March 2019, at around 6.27 pm, they had an argument. He was angry that she was not reciprocating his affections and wanted to break up with him. Over WhatsApp, he threatened to hack into her Instagram account and post the videos and photograph onto her Instagram feed. He thus threatened her with injury to her reputation, with intent to cause alarm to her. She was alarmed. (MAC-906802-2020)

#### 8 April 2019: criminal intimidation, armed with offensive instrument

11     Two weeks later, between midnight on 7 April 2019 and 1.00 am on 8 April 2019, they were sitting on a bench at the void deck of the Victim’s home, talking about the state of their relationship. He was upset as they had not had sexual intercourse in a long time, and asked her to have sexual intercourse with him. She rebuffed his request.

12     He became angry. He took out a flip-knife and held it by the left side of his body (with the blade of the knife still folded). He asked her, “Really cannot?”, intending to cause alarm to her and to cause her to accede to his request. She continued to rebuff his request.

13     Then he flipped the knife open, with the blade out. He poked the tip of the blade against her left thigh. He asked her, “Does it hurt or not?”, and explained to her that the sensation of being poked by the knife represented how much he had been hurting all the time due to the deterioration in their relationship. She started crying, continuously.

14     He then placed the blade of the flip-knife to the right side of her neck and held the tip to the skin of her neck. He continued to ask her if it hurt, and said that this was how he had been feeling the entire time. She continued crying, and agreed to have sexual intercourse with him. She told him that they could do so during a staycation in late April 2019. After that he put the knife back in his pocket, waited for her to calm down, and then took a cab home.

15     Seah was thus armed with an offensive instrument (the flip-knife) without lawful authority or a lawful purpose. (DAC-917212-2020) He threatened the Victim with injury to her person, with intent to cause alarm to her and to cause her to do an act (sexual intercourse) that she was not legally bound to do. (MAC-906801-2020)

16     The Victim made a police report on 20 April 2019 about Seah poking her with a flip-knife.

#### Defendant’s psychiatric condition

17     Seah carried the flip-knife around with him on his person due to his urge to self-harm by cutting himself. He underwent psychiatric and psychological assessment, and three reports relating to his psychiatric condition were tendered in evidence:

> (a)     A Specialist Medical Report from the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) dated 28 January 2021 (the “**KTPH Report**”);

> (b)     A report from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) dated 2 September 2021 (the “**IMH Report**”); and

> (c)     A clarificatory report from the IMH dated 15 February 2022.

18     In the KTPH Report, Seah was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and anxiety symptoms of panic attacks.

19     The IMH Report concurred with the diagnosis in the KTPH Report. Seah was diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder, Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder. The IMH psychiatrist was of the opinion that:

> Mr. Seah’s recurrent urges to self-harm by cutting himself to reduce his anxiety and emotional difficulties would have _contributed to_ his alleged offence of carrying an offensive weapon (foldable knife) without lawful authority as he had difficulties in controlling his anxiety and emotional difficulties by other means at the time of the alleged offence. His fear of abandonment, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, feelings of emptiness and impaired judgment due anxiety and depressed mood would have _likely contributed to_ his alleged offence of criminal intimidation by positioning a foldable knife against victims left thigh and neck. There is _no contributory link_ between his mental illness and his alleged offences of possession of obscene material (intimate videos) and criminal intimidation by threatening to distribute the intimate videos.

(Para 15(b) of the IMH Report, emphasis in original)

## Sentencing

### Charges taken into consideration

20     Apart from the three proceeded charges, Seah admitted to four other offences, which were taken into consideration (TIC) for the purposes of sentencing. The main details of these TIC charges were as follows:

> (a)     Being armed with a black flick knife with a 10-cm handle and 10-cm blade, without lawful authority or a lawful purpose, an offence under s 22(1)(a) MOA. (DAC-917213-2020)

> (b)     Having in possession a mobile phone containing five films which were obscene, another mobile phone containing one film which was obscene, and a computer containing five films which were obscene, an offence punishable under s 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107). (MAC-906803-2020)

> (c)     Sometime on 31 December 2018, making a threatening communication to the Victim by telling her that he still had sexual videos of her, thereby causing alarm to her, an offence under s 3(1)(b) punishable under s 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A) (“**PHA**”). (MAC-906804-2020)

> (d)     On 22 April 2019, making a threatening communication by sending a message to the Victim via WhatsApp informing her that he would hurt his own dog if she did not open her door to let him into her house, causing alarm to her, an offence under s 3(1)(b) punishable under s 3(2) of the PHA. (MAC-906805-2020)

### Prosecution’s submissions

21     The prosecution sought a total sentence of 5 to 8 months’ imprisonment.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

22     It was submitted that the sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation were relevant. While the IMH had diagnosed Seah with Borderline Personality Disorder, Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder, these disorders had a contributory link only to his offences involving the carrying around of offensive instruments, and the offence of positioning the knife against the Victim’s thigh and neck; the disorders had no contributory link to his possession of the intimate videos and his threat to distribute the videos (above, at \[19\]). While Seah’s mental disorders would go some way in mitigation in relation to the offence of carrying an offensive instrument, deterrence would still have to feature in the sentence meted out. It was highlighted that Seah threatened the Victim with his knife in order to cause her alarm and to get her to accede to his request for sex. His threatening behaviour escalated as she rebuffed his requests, and the threats only abated once she agreed to have sex with him. Moreover, he had displayed a litany of abusive conduct towards her, some of which were not contributed to by his mental disorders. His behaviour should be deterred, even as rehabilitation would be an important consideration for him. It was acknowledged, however, that Seah’s plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities were mitigating.

23     The submissions of the prosecution on the sentences for the individual sentences are considered below (at \[31\]-\[36\]).

### Mitigation plea

24     In a written mitigation plea,[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) counsel for Seah urged the court to consider calling for a probation suitability report. In the alternative, if the court was not inclined to call for such a report, a global sentence of up to 5 months’ imprisonment was suggested.[^3] (Counsel’s submissions on the sentences for the individual offences are considered at \[31\]-\[36\], below).

25     It was highlighted that Seah was still relatively young and was a first offender. He was remorseful for his behaviour towards the Victim, and he truly regretted not having treated her much better than he did. He had once sought emotional support from the Victim, and he was afraid of the prospect that she would stop being in a relationship with him. It was a turbulent relationship, and he was desperate to keep her company. It seemed to him that a key source of emotional and social support was abandoning him. He had been cooperative (with the authorities), and his decision to plead guilty demonstrated his contrition.

26     He was a troubled individual and suffered from a litany of issues. Part of his misconduct arose from his poor mental health. He was diagnosed as suffering from various mental conditions (above, at \[18\]-\[19\]), and he was continuing to receive treatment at KTPH. He was also coping with heart-related issues, for which he had previously been admitted to the hospital.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Dominant sentencing considerations

27     In my judgement, the dominant sentencing considerations were deterrence and retribution, given the nature of the offences and the harm caused to the Victim. Also, to the extent that Seah’s psychiatric condition might have contributed to some of his offences, his rehabilitation was also a relevant consideration. Rehabilitation, however, was displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration by the need for deterrence and retribution.

#### Probation not appropriate

28     Counsel for Seah had urged the calling of a probation suitability report. The prosecution objected to the calling of such a report. I was also not persuaded that probation was an appropriate sentencing option, given that rehabilitation was not the dominant sentencing consideration.

29     Although Seah was relatively young at the time of the offences, he was not a youthful offender. At the time the earliest offence was committed in 2018, he was already above 21 years of age. (According to the prosecution, Seah was 21 years and 9 months old at the time of the earliest offence.) In other words, he was above 21 years of age both at the time of offending and the time of sentencing. Hence, neither the retrospective nor prospective rationales mentioned in _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[37\] would apply. For such an offender above the age of 21 at both the time of the offence and the time of sentencing, the law takes the view that rehabilitation would typically not be the operative concern for such an offender unless the offender demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform or there exist other exceptional circumstances: _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[44\].

30     It was not shown by the defence that Seah demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, or that there existed exceptional circumstances to support the position that rehabilitation ought to be the dominant sentencing consideration such that probation ought to be considered.

#### Custodial sentences to be imposed

31     Given the serious nature of the offences committed by Seah, it was appropriate, in my judgement, that for each offence an appropriate custodial sentence be imposed. The prosecution and the defence were not far apart in their submissions on the length of the custodial sentences. Their sentencing positions are summarised in the following table:

32     Having considered the sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution and the defence, I found the suggested sentencing ranges to be reasonable. I also agreed that the sentences for MAC-906802-2020 and MAC-906801-2020 ought to run consecutively, given that they were separate and distinct offences committed on different occasions; and the sentence for DAC-917212-2020 ought to run concurrently with the sentence for MAC-906801-2020 as the offences were committed concurrently and within the same transaction.

33     For MAC-906802-2020 (criminal intimidation by threatening to post the intimate videos and photograph on Instagram), I accepted the submission of the prosecution that there was an abuse of trust. The Victim had trusted Seah and allowed him to take the intimate videos and photograph; he betrayed that trust by not deleting all copies of the material upon her request, but threatened to post them on Instagram. There were also two TIC offences in which he made threatening communications to the Victim (above, at \[20(c)\]–\[20(d)\]). There was no contributory link between his mental condition and the offence, as stated in the IMH Report (above, at \[19\]). All in, I accepted that a sentence of two months’ imprisonment was appropriate for this charge.

34     The facts of this offence bore some similarities with _PP v Roman_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 8</span>, where a sentence of two months’ imprisonment was also imposed. The offender Roman had a romantic relationship with the victim in that case. When the victim ended the relationship and refused to reconcile with him, he started to harass her with WhatsApp text messages. He threatened to distribute nude photographs of her online through Instagram if she did not have sex with him. He pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code (with two other charges, under s 509 and s 323 of the Penal Code, taken into consideration). He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment.

35     For MAC-906801-2020 (criminal intimidation of the Victim using a flip-knife), I accepted the submission of the prosecution that harm was caused to her.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) She was alarmed by Seah’s actions, and started crying continuously after he poked the knife at her left thigh. He then escalated his threatening behaviour by putting the knife against her neck. The threat compelled her to agree to his request for sex, despite her rebuffing his earlier requests. That said, his culpability was mitigated to some extent by the fact that there was a contributory link between his mental disorders and the offence. I also accepted the submission of counsel that the use of the knife was not premeditated.[^10] Seah carried a knife on his person due to his urges to commit self-harm by cutting himself. The quarrel between Seah and the Victim arose spontaneously, and he simply retrieved the knife that he was carrying. What was aggravating, however, was the manner in which he used the knife in the course of threatening her. In my judgment, weighing these aggravating and mitigating factors, the sentence for this offence ought to be higher than for MAC-906802-2020, considering the direct imminence of the threat, which caused greater alarm and harm to the Victim. All in, I considered a sentence of three months’ imprisonment to be appropriate for this offence.

36     Finally, for DAC-917212-2020 (being armed with an offensive instrument), it was submitted by the prosecution that the usual sentencing tariff for such offences was three months’ imprisonment. Some discount could be given on account of Seah’s mental condition but counterbalanced with the fact that there was a TIC charge for another offence under s 22(1)(a) MOA. I accepted the submission of the prosecution. In my judgment, considering that Seah’s mental condition had contributed to the offence, a (lower) sentence of two months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

### Sentence imposed

37     In summary, the sentences imposed were as follows:
