> 11.    The accused admits to the said offence and he stands charged accordingly.

## C.   Antecedents

4       The accused has no prior antecedents.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address On Sentence

5       In its written address on sentence, the Prosecution had highlighted the accused is a 35-year-old secondary school teacher, who was convicted of committing an indecent act with the victim who was then 14-years old under s 7(a) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38) (“CYPA”). It was the Prosecution’s submission that a sentence of at least **8 months’ imprisonment** should be imposed.

### Sentencing Principles and Considerations

6       It was submitted by the Prosecution that general deterrence and retribution are the applicable sentencing principles in the present case for the following reasons.

> (a)     The principle of deterrence is “intended to create an awareness in the public and more particularly among potential offenders that punishment will be certain and unrelenting for certain offences and offenders”: see _ADF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> at \[57\].

> (b)     The CYPA was enacted to protect vulnerable minors under the age of 16 from sexual exploitation: see _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> (“_AQW_”) at \[13\]. Sentences for offences under the CYPA should provide for adequate deterrence against sexual exploitation of children and young persons: see _AQW_ at \[13\].

> (c)     On principles of deterrence and retribution, offences against more vulnerable minors ought to be visited with heavier punishments: see _AQW_ at \[15\].

7       It was further submitted that the key sentencing considerations are: (a) the vulnerability of the minor; and (b) the degree to which the accused has exploited the minor: see _AQW_ at \[13\].

#### Vulnerability of the minor

8       In relation to the vulnerability of the minor, the following was submitted:

> (a)     “The more vulnerable the minor is, the more protection he or she will require, and the more reprehensible will be the conduct of an offender in exploiting him or her for the offender’s own gratification”: see _AQW_ at \[15\].

> (b)     The vulnerability of the minor may also arise from situational circumstances such as a relationship of teacher and student which places the student in a position of “special vulnerability” with respect to the teacher: see _AQW_ at \[18\].

#### Degree of exploitation

9       In relation to the degree of exploitation, it was submitted that increased exploitation occurs when the offender abuses the trust placed in him by the minor: _AQW_ at \[21\].

### Sentencing Precedents

10     It was the Prosecution’s case that the High Court in _AQW_ held at \[50\] that a sentence of between 6 and 8 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate where:

> (a)     the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor involved touching of naked genitalia, regardless of whose genitalia it was,

> (b)     the minor is 14 years old or above, and does not appear to be particularly vulnerable,

> (c)     the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act, and

> (d)     there was no element of abuse of trust.

11     In its submissions, the Prosecution had emphasised that, on the present facts, the victim was particularly vulnerable and the degree of abuse of trust was exceptionally high. Applying _AQW_, it was submitted that the relevant assessment is:

> (a)     The particular vulnerability of the victim (factor (b)) – the accused was the victim’s school teacher and teacher-in-charge of the victim’s xxx CCA.

> (b)     The abuse of trust (factor (d)) – the accused abused his position of trust and position of authority over the victim. The accused also cultivated a relationship with the victim through the exchange of text messages with her and going out alone on two occasions (18 July 2018 and 24 July 2018) prior to the commission of the offences. The accused had initiated both outings. This course of conduct and cultivation reflects premeditation, which is aggravating.

> (c)     Although factor (a) is absent, it was submitted that the combined presence of the above two characteristics more than outweighs this.

12     It was further submitted that the accused committed the offence with a degree of premeditation. The accused invited the victim to dinner alone after they had attended a school-organised play. This gave the accused the opportunity to isolate the victim from the other students who had attended the play. After the dinner, the accused placed his right arm over the victim’s shoulder and kissed her on her lips. Even though the victim told the accused that it was late and wanted to return home, the accused persisted by bringing the victim to a nearby park and kissing her again on the lips.

13     In the circumstances, it was the case for the Prosecution that it would be appropriate to impose a sentence at the higher end of the sentencing range (i.e. at least 8 months’ imprisonment) set out in _AQW_ at \[50\].

14     It was submitted that this would be consistent with _PP v GCL_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 198</span> where sentences of 8 months’ imprisonment were imposed on each of the offender’s s 7(a) CYPA charges for hugging the 15-year-old victim from behind and kissing and licking her neck and ear area (in relation to the 1st charge) and for hugging the victim’s waist area and kissing her neck and licking her ear area (in relation to the 2nd charge). The global sentence imposed in _GCL_ was 16 months’ imprisonment. It was highlighted that the victim in _GCL_ was one year older than the present victim and, to that extent, less vulnerable.

15     It was orally submitted that in respect of factor (b) of _AQW_, the particular vulnerability, it was highlighted that the accused was the victim’s school teacher and in addition, he was the teacher in-charge of the victim’s CCA. It was further submitted that on top of that, he was a chaperone in-charge of the victim and other students in the evening of the commission of the offence. It was the case for the Prosecution that applying _AQW_, the appropriate sentence is at least 8 months’ imprisonment because of the vulnerability of the victim and the abuse of trust more than outweigh the absence of factor (a) which is the touching of the genitalia.

## E.   Mitigation

#### Background

16     In his written plea in mitigation, his Counsel stated that the accused is a 35-year old who has been living in Singapore since 1987. He comes from a humble family in which his father is retired and his mother is a housewife. The accused is the eldest child and has three younger siblings. His Counsel also provided details of his educational background, his various achivements in his co-curricular activities while he was in school as well as his contribution towards the community.

17     It was submitted that on or about December 2008, the accused was offered a position as a teacher at the victim’s school with a monthly salary of $2,800. His Counsel highlighted that his responsibilities included but were not limited to teaching various subjects, setting examination papers and preparing his students for the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ Level examinations. He conducted supplementary and remedial lessons several times a week, during the holidays and even on Saturdays.

18     It was further submitted that he was the teacher-in-charge of the victim’s CCA. In 2012, he received the Inspiring Staff Award 2012 for his outstanding performance as a teacher in the school. As a teacher-in-charge, it was stated that “\[he\] motivates the members through organising a xxx camp and giving them opportunities both in school and outside, even when it means giving up personal time.”

19     It was the case for the Defence that on or about May 2018, the accused noticed that one of his students, the victim was not her usual self during her CCA practices. It was submitted that out of concern, he approached and spoke to her. According to the accused, the victim shared with him that she felt both of her parents were using her as a weapon against each other. The episodes between her parents made her feel worthless. The accused consoled the tearful victim and shared his life story of having through similar issues with his father. He encouraged her not to lose hope.

20     It was submitted that since then the victim would ask to see the accused for counselling in relation to her family issues. They would go to a common public space within the school to sit and chat. It was further submitted that on one occasion, the victim informed the accused that the situation at home had deteriorated as her father was trying to claim his legal fees incurred from her mother who was struggling to make ends meet.

21     It was submitted that upon hearing this, the accused began to suspect that the victim was suffering from depression and suggested that she consult one of the school counsellors. According to the accused, the victim vehemently refused and begged the accused not to reveal her situation to anyone else, especially her form teacher. It was further submitted that the accused agreed hesitantly.

#### Circumstances leading to the charge

22     It was the case for the Defence that while there were two incidents in which the accused had kissed the victim on her lips, it was stated that the two incidents had occurred on the same day, within the approximate span of 30 to 60 minutes.

## First Incident

23     It was submitted that on 28 July 2018, the school had organised a field trip to watch a play as part of the school’s curriculum. The accused was asked by one of his colleagues on short notice if he could chaperone the students to the play and he agreed. The victim was one of the students who went on the field trip. After the play, the accused and the victim went for dinner at a Japanese restaurant as the accused had wanted to check on the victim.

24     It was submitted that during their dinner, they talked about the victim’s family issues and whether she was still demoralised and unable to cope with the stress. According to the accused he was concerned that the stress might affect the victim’s studies. The victim had admitted that she was not doing well in her other subjects except English.

25     It was the case for the Defence that to brighten their conversation, the accused had asked the victim about her aspirations in life. According to the accused, the conversation went well and the victim moved to sit next to the accused after dinner. It was submitted that in a moment of weakness, the accused leaned over and kissed the victim on her lips. It happened very quickly and lasted for about 3 seconds. It was highlighted that the victim did not pull back or push the accused away when he leaned in. The victim had burst out laughing after the kiss ended.

## Second Incident

26     It was submitted that after that at about 7 pm, both the accused and the victim left the Japanese restaurant and walked to a nearby location. According to the accused, they walked around the area for a short while because they were making casual small talk and passing the time after their meal. They then left the area and walked up a flight of steps to see if it would lead anywhere as they wanted to explore the area while talking.

27     It was further submitted that when both of them realised that the staircase did not really lead anywhere, they decided to go back down. The victim was climbing down the stairs slightly ahead of the accused and was at the bottom of the stairs when she heard him call out to her. When she turned her back to look at him, he kissed her on the lips. It was very brief and lasted for about 3 seconds. It was highlighted that once again the victim did not pull away or push the accused away.

28     It was submitted that the accused then brought the victim to the bus-stop opposite an MRT station where they both took the bus to the victim’s father’s house. They alighted at the bus stop near the victim’s father’s house. The victim left and walked to her father’s house. It was further submitted that on hindsight, the accused realised that his actions were not appropriate and was unfitting. He felt very remorseful and wanted to make amends for what he did.

29     It was further submitted that on 21 August 2018, the accused was called into the Principal’s office. He was informed by the Principal that the victim had told her form teacher about what had happened on 28 July 2018. The accused was put on leave while the Ministry of Education carried out their investigations. On 31 August 2018, the police contacted him and he gave the police his full co-operation.

#### Mitigating Factors

30     It was submitted that the accused was extremely ashamed by his behaviour and had been reproaching himself since the two incidents. He understands that he had conducted himself in a manner that is totally unacceptable as the victim’s teacher and recognised the inappropriateness of his behaviour. It was further submitted that the accused had since reflected deeply on his action. If possible, he would like to offer a sincere and unreserved apology to the victim for the acts he had committed on impulse.

31     It was the case for the Defence that the accused’s family had to overcome a lot of adversities to come to Singapore in order to have a better standard and quality of life. Knowing how difficult it was for his family to come to Singapore, the accused hoped to be given a second chance and was committed not to fall afoul of the law again and dim his bright future.

#### Not Premeditated and No Grooming

32     It was submitted that the accused had absolutely not pre-meditated his actions during the two incidents and that he had been acting on impulse. It was empahsized that there was no element of grooming involved between the accused and the victim. According to the accused, he had been interacting more with the victim prior to the two incidents because he was concerned about her state of mind due to her family issues and the stress which she had been facing.

#### Early plea of guilt

33     It was submitted as further evidence of the accused’s contrition and remorse he had decided to plead guilty to his charge at an early stage of his criminal proceedings. It was further submitted that it is trite law that a timeous plea of guilt indicative of genuine remorse is a mitigating factor.

34     It was submitted that the accused ought to be given credit for pleading guilty to this specific offence under s 7(a) CYPA as he had spared the victim additional suffering of having to testify in court as she is a young victim. By opting to plead guilty before the matter was set down for trial, the accused had saved the State resources which would have otherwise been expended for a trial. It was the case for the Defence that the accused’s early plea of guilt should be given appropriate weight in mitigating his offence.

#### Full co-operation with Authorities

35     It was submitted that the accused’s full co-operation throughout the investigation process should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. He had dutifully reported for his interview with the police to have his statement recorded and had fully facilitated and complied with the investigation process.

#### Good Character and No Antecedents

36     It was highlighted that the accused has always been an upright and rule-abiding citizen. He had no prior antecedents whatsoever. His Counsel had enclosed character testimonials from his ex-students as evidence that many of his ex-students had attested to his good character and described him as a passionate and caring teacher. In addition, his colleagues and friends know him to be a supportive friend and/or colleague and they had attested to this in their testimonials.

#### Career Affected

37     It was submitted that on 12 September 2018, the accused was informed that he was suspended on half-pay until the investigations is concluded. It was highlighted that the accused was concerned that his employment pass would be revoked and that he would not be allowed to work and/or stay in Singapore. It was further highlighted that the accused had always been a law abiding citizen since he moved to Singapore in 1987. It was further submitted that this was his first brush with the law. He regards Singapore to be his home as he has spent most of his life here.

38     It was the case for the Defence that the accused was and still is an inspiring teacher to many students. It was highlighted the CCA concerned was his passion in life, as shown by his participation in the CCA at every school and college he had attended. It was submitted that the accused would not have pre-meditated any action that would have jeopardised his career in Singapore.

#### Strain on Finances

39     It was submitted as the accused has been suspended with half-pay from his work due to the present case, he is being subjected to financial hardship and subsequently the accompanying emotional stress due to losing the job which he is so passionate about.

40     It was highlighted that the accused’s father had retired since early 2000s and his mother is unemployed. As such, the accused had been providing for his parents financially and has to care for his aged parents. It was submitted that the accused is a responsible and filial son who feels the need to support his aged parents. The Court was urged to exercise leniency due to the hardship that his family is facing due to his significant decrease in income.

#### Considerations on Sentence

41     It was submitted that in _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span>, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had set out the applicable guidelines for offences under the CYPA as well as the key sentencing considerations when dealing with sexual offences in general which are committed against minors at \[13\]. It was further submitted that the starting sentencing benchmark of between six to eight months’ imprisonment set out in _AQW_ has been accepted as the applicable guideline sentence for offences under CYPA in cases such as _PP v Mahsook Rahman Ajahar Nisha_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 4</span> and in _PP v GCL_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 198</span>.

#### Application of the sentencing framework and the relevant sentencing precedents

42     As part of the Defence’s address on sentence, Counsel did a comparison of the relevant sentencing precedents and the present case. In respect of _AQW_, it was submitted that there was a much lesser degree of sexual exploitation. The accused had not touched the victim’s genitalia, naked or otherwise. It was further submitted that at the time of the offence, the victim was aged 14 and she did not appear to be particularly vulnerable. The accused did not coerce or pressure the victim into participating in the two incidents as described above.

43     It was the case for the Defence that while the accused is an educator and admittedly he had made a mistake, the kiss on the lips with the victim involved a very brief period of about 3 seconds for each kiss. It was proposed that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment be imposed.

44     It was submitted that the court in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> stated at \[41\] that to promulgate a benchmark sentence on the basis of an uncontested case might be suitable for a “typical case”. An example given by the court was one of road rage as compared to a case of rape whereby the road rage will be considered a “typical case”. It was further submitted that a charge under the CYPA is particularly fact specific and the sentencing benchmark in _AQW_ should not restrain the court from giving a lower sentence as necessitated in the present case.

45     It was the case for the Defence that this was further supported by the case of _PP v Vilashini d/o Nallan Rajanderan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 142</span>. While the judge recognised that the starting point of that case was a custodial sentence of about two weeks, he had calibrated the sentence downwards to one week’s imprisonment. He took into account the factors considered in the accused’s mitigation plea in order to calibrate the sentence. As such, in the same manner the Court was urged to give due weight to the mitigating factors of the present case.

#### Sentencing precedents for offences under s 7(a) CYPA

46     Counsel then provided summaries of sentencing precedents under s 7(a) CYPA and sought to distinguish them from the present case based on its factual matrix as well as the mitigating factors in the present case.

## Early Plea of Guilt

47     It was submitted that compared to the cases of _Mahsook Rahman_ and _Tan Zhan Yang_, the accused should be eligible for a sentencing discount because he had pleaded guilty early. In _Mahsook Rahman_, the court had referred to the case of _Siti Norlelawati_ to state that since the accused in the latter case had pleaded guilty instead of claiming trial to her charges, this was a strong mitigating factor that warranted a sentencing discount. It was further submitted that this line of reasoning was also reflected in _Tan Zhan Yang_ where the court stated at \[7\] that if the accused had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, this would have been a clear reflection of his remorse as it would have spared the victim from having to testify in court. Instead the victim had been subjected to the full rigours of a trial in that case.

48     It was submitted that with the above cases in mind, since the accused had pleaded guilty early and spared the victim from having to testify in court, this was a clear reflection of his remorse and it is a strong mitigating factor that warrants a sentencing discount to be granted to him.

## Lesser Degree of Exploitation

49     It was submitted that unlike cases like Tan Zhan Yong and Tan Koek Seng where there was touching of genitalia involved, the kisses between the accused and the victim involved less exploitative contact between an offender and a minor.

50     It was further submitted in _BAB_, there was no contact with the victim’s genitalia that led to the s 7(a) CYPA charge. However, the accused in _BAB_ faced a multitude of charges, including 6 proceeded charges under s 376A(1)(b) and punishable under 376A(3) Penal Code and 14 charges of the same offences were taken into consideration. These charges all involved vaginal penetration. As a whole, the nature of the offences in _BAB_ were far more sexually exploitative in nature, compared to the acts committed by the accused in the present case. Likewise, the s 7(a) CYPA charge in BAB while not involving contact with the victim’s genitals, was also more sexually exploitative in nature compared to the present case as there was contact with the victim’s bare nipples which is a sensitive and private part of the body. It was emphasized that the accused did not have contact with any of the victim’s private parts.

51     It was submitted that even when compared to a case like _Siti Norlelawati_ where the accused was also an educator, the accused in that case had given the victim love bites in addition to kissing him on the lips and putting her tongue into the victim’s mouth. The accused had only kissed the victim in the present case twice on the lips for a very brief period of time – about 3 seconds for both kisses. This brevity of the kisses should also be noted since there was no prolonged and extensive contact between the accused and the victim unlike the case of _GCL_ where with regard to one of the charges under s 7(a) CYPA, the accused had kissed and licked the victim’s neck and ear area for about 5 minutes. It was further submitted that the level of exploitation in the present case was not very high as the nature of the sexual contact between the accused and the victim was that of two brief kisses on the lips.

## No Sexual Grooming or Premeditation

52     It was submitted that unlike cases like _Mahsook Rahman_, _GCL_ and _Tan Zhan Yang_ where there was evidence that the accused person had taken calculated steps to introduce the victims to sexual acts in a gradual manner or exploited the victim’s feelings and sexually groomed them before committing the offences, the present case involves a one-off offence and the accused had not sexually groomed the victim in any way.

53     It was further submitted that prior to the incident the accused and the victim had forged a genuine friendship. The victim would share her personal problems with the accused and when the accused realised that the victim might have depression he suggested that the victim should consult one of the school counsellors. The victim did agree and was against telling anyone her problems. According to the accused. She begged the accused not to reveal her situation to anyone else. The accused hesitantly agreed. It was the case for the Defence that the accused has always been a supportive teacher/friend to his students. This is evident from the various character testimonials from his students. While the accused was fully aware that his actions depicted in the SOF were completely unacceptable, it was submitted that the accused had a momentary lapse of judgment and his actions were not premeditated. It was further submitted that the accused did not ‘target’ the victim from the outset.

54     It was submitted that the present case can be distinguished from the case of _GCL_. The accused there had sent an explicit text message to the victim. He took calculated steps to introduce the victim to sexual acts in a gradual manner by sending her messages with sexual innuendos. When they met, the accused had touched the victim all over her body, kiss and caress her. It was further submitted that as a whole, the facts of GCL was much more aggravating than the present case. In the present case, there was no evidence that he had sent sexually explicit text messages to the victim and he did not take calculated steps to introduce the victim to any sexual acts. It was the case for the Defence that the accused and the victim had simply befriended each other and the incident that occurred was a one-off incident. It was submitted that this lack of sexual grooming and premeditation should be taken into account when the Court decides upon the sentence to be meted out to the accused.

## Lesser Degree of Harm and Culpability

55     It was submitted that there was a lesser degree of exploitation in the present case compared to the cases of _Tan Zhan Yang_ and _Tan Koek Seng_. While it was clear that what the accused did was plainly wrong, there was no premeditation on his part. It was further submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that extraordinary harm was caused to the victim as a result of the incident. There was no evidence of any physical or psychological harm caused to the victim.

## Submissions on Sentence

56     In the light of the above, it was submitted that the accused’s offence should fall lower than the sentencing benchmark laid out in _AQW_. It was further submitted that even if the accused’s offence is deemed to warrant between six to eight months’ term of imprisonment as a starting point following _AQW_, his sentence ought to be calibrated downwards in view of all the mitigating factors detailed above.

57     It was submitted that a term of imprisonment of not more than three months would be an appropriate punishment for the accused’s offence especially considering the fact that the nature of the offence which he committed did not involve a serious act as the acts committed by the accused persons in the sentencing precedents.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

58     In response to the written plea in mitigation, it was orally submitted that paragraph 13 of the written plea in mitigation had left out portions which clearly shows that the victim was uncomfortable with the accused's actions. It was further submitted that the victim cannot and should not be blamed for the accused's offending. It was the case for the Prosecution that the accused should never have placed the victim in the situation that he placed her in.

59     In relation to the case of _Sit Norlelawati_, it was submitted that the case had relied on a High Court precedent of _PP v Low Chuan Wee Anthony (“Anthony Low”)_ as stated at \[23\] of the case. With reference to \[42\] and \[43\] of _AQW_, it was highlighted that s 7(a) CYPA was amended in 2011. As such, the High Court had stated that the case _Anthony Low_ was of limited assistance as it was under the previous regime. In addition, at \[49\] of _AQW_, it was further submitted that the Chief Justice had cited the case of _Siti Norlelawati_ and at \[50\] by stating that he had discarded these as relevant benchmarks, he had also meant _Siti Norlelawati_’s case.

60     It was the case for the Prosecution that Counsel’s reference to _Ng Kean Meng Terence_ when he urged the Court to adopt a two-step process was not appropriate. It was submitted that one cannot transplant the sentencing procedure for a different regime to _AQW_. In _AQW_, the Chief Justice did not propound a two-step sentencing framework and his comments should be read as it is. It was further submitted that did not mean that the Court could not consider aggravating and mitigating factors which the Courts do in sentencing on a daily basis.

61     It was submitted that on the facts of _AQW_ when Counsel tried to draw a comparison between _AQW_ and the present case, it was highlighted that _AQW_ was different. He was not in a position of trust and he was not a school teacher nor a CCA teacher. What had happened in that case was that they had met online on Facebook.

62     It was further submitted that with reference to the accused's service to the school and testimonials, no credit can be given in relation to the very position he had abused in the present case. It was emphasized that it was clear from paragraphs 8 to 10 of the mitigation plea that the victim was in a position of special vulnerability. The victim had confided in highly personal matters with the accused. It was the case for the Prosecution that that exacerbates the position of trust the accused had and being in that position, he had abused the position of trust.

## G.   The Sentence

#### Prescribed punishment for sexual exploitation of a child / young person

63     The prescribed punishment for an offence of committing an indecent act on any child or a young person under s 7(a) CYPA is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or to both for a first offender. Prior to 20 July 2011, the maximum punishment for such an offence was two years’ imprisonment or a fine of $5,000 or to both for a first offender.

64     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment. In contrast, Counsel had urged the Court to consider the imposition of a sentence of no more than three months’ imprisonment. It was submitted by Counsel that even with the starting point of between six to eight months’ term of imprisonment following the case of _AQW_, the accused’s sentence ought to be calibrated downwards in view of all the mitigating factors. It was clear from their respective submissions that both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement that the present case warranted the imposition of a custodial sentence but disagreed on the appropriate length.

#### Abuse of position of trust and authority

65     In the present case, it was undisputed that the accused had been a teacher in the victim’s school for almost a decade since December 2008. On the day of the offence in July 2018, he was not only a teacher in the victim’s school as well as the teacher in-charge of the victim’s CCA but he was also a chaperone in-charge of the victim and other students who had attended a play organised by the school. At the material time, the accused’s duties as a teacher in-charge to the victim and the other students would have ended once the play was over. Unfortunately, on the evening of 28 July 2018, the accused overstepped his boundaries as a teacher by abusing his position of trust and authority by committing the indecent act in public with a young person.

#### Role of educators

66     As the present case involves an educator, it must be strongly emphasized from the outset that teachers play a very important role in society in shaping their students’ minds and their future. The integrity of the teaching profession and the trust placed on teachers in all their interactions with students is a serious matter and should never be taken lightly. As educators, it is clear that teachers hold the dual positions of authority and trust over their students. In view of substantial length of time that students spend in school, teachers are effectively mentors and role models to their students. Hence, teachers must always be mindful of their conduct and how they manage their relationships with their students. They must ensure they act with propriety at all times and their actions, particularly involving their charge are all above board. It is of utmost importance that the teachers themselves ensure that such boundaries between teachers and students should never be overstepped.

67     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I was mindful that one of the objectives of the CYPA is the protection of a class of vulnerable people, namely minors under the age of 16, from sexual exploitation. I was guided by the applicable guidelines for offences under the CYPA as well as the key sentencing considerations when dealing with sexual offences in general which are committed against minors as set out by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _AQW v PP_. In particular, as highlighted by both the Prosecution and the Defence, the key sentencing considerations for such offences are: (a) the vulnerability of the minor; and (b) the degree to which the accused has exploited the minor: see _AQW_ at \[13\].

68     The present case involves a single charge of the accused, a 35-year old male secondary school teacher kissing the victim who was then 14 years on her lips twice. The first instance was when the victim was seated next to the accused after a meal. The accused had placed his right arm over the victim's shoulder and then leaned towards the victim and kissed the victim on her lips. The second occasion was when the victim who had walked ahead of the accused was called out by the accused. The victim had stopped walking, turned around and was suddenly kissed on her lips by the accused.

#### Premeditation

69     Based on the facts before me, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had committed the offence with a degree of premeditation. It was undisputed that the accused had cultivated a relationship with the victim through the exchange of text messages with her and going out alone with her on two occasions i.e. on 18 July 2018 and 24 July 2018, prior to the commission of the offence. The accused had paid for the victim’s haircut on 18 July 2018 when they each had a hair cut at a shopping mall as well as had coffee together thereafter. On 24 July 2018, the accused told the victim to meet him at a shopping mall after school as he wanted to bring her for tea at a restaurant. It was unchallenged that the accused was the one who had initiated both outings and these were acts which were more consistent with persons in a boy-girl relationship and not the usual above board teacher-student interaction. I agreed with the Prosecution that this course of conduct and cultivation reflects premeditation, which is an aggravating factor. Hence, I did not accept Counsel’s submission that the accused did not ‘target’ the victim from the outset.

#### Exploitation of the minor

70     After having cultivated this relationship with the victim, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the accused took the opportunity to invite the victim to dinner alone after they had attended a school-organised play. This gave the accused the opportunity to isolate the victim from the other students who had attended the play. After the dinner, the accused had asked the victim to sit next to him and the victim complied. When the victim was seated next to the accused, he placed his right arm over the victim’s shoulder and kissed her on her lips. It was clear from the Statement of Facts that the victim was uncomfortable with the accused's actions.

71     Yet as highlighted by the Prosecution at paragraph 13 of the written plea in mitigation, portions of the Statement of Facts which clearly shows that the victim was uncomfortable with the accused's actions were left out in the narration of the events by the Defence. It was also highlighted by the Defence that on both occasions after the accused had kissed the victim, she had not pulled away or push the accused away. To my mind, these were attempts by the Defence to downplay the accused’s level of culpability in respect of the charge. At paragraph 8 of the Statement of Facts, it was unchallenged that the victim went through a mixed set of emotions. She was shocked, nervous and felt embarrassed as well as scared after the first instance when the accused had kissed her. Hence, the victim’s actions at the material time should not be held against her or regarded as a mitigating factor in the accused’s favour.

72     As highlighted by the Prosecution, even though the victim told the accused that it was late and wanted to return home, the accused persisted by bringing the victim to a nearby park and kissing her again on the lips. It was unchallenged that the accused’s action in kissing her again left her speechless. In my mind, the accused’s actions were clearly inconsistent with Counsel’s assertion that at the material time the accused was concerned about the victim’s state of mind due to her family issues and the stress which she had been facing. Based on the present facts, I agreed with the Prosecution that the victim was particularly vulnerable and the degree of abuse of trust was exceptionally high.

73     Based on these facts, I was unable to accept Counsel’s submissions that the accused had been acting on impulse, he had a momentary lapse of judgment and that his actions towards the victim were not premeditated. It was clear from the conduct of the accused that he had exploited the victim for his own gratification. I also rejected Counsel submissions that the accused had forged a genuine friendship with the victim and the incident that occurred was a one-off incident. In my view, the accused’s acts of exchanging text messages and initiating outings with the victim prior to the commission of the offence were deliberate acts calculated to gain the victim’s trust and confidence. It was clear that the accused had overstepped the bounds of his teacher-student relationship with the victim by his actions and sought to justify his actions under the guise of a genuine friendship.

#### Vulnerability of the minor

74     Counsel had sought to characterise the victim as one who did not appear to be particularly vulnerable. It was submitted by the Defence that the accused did not coerce or pressure the victim into participating in the two incidents as described above. Although there was no evidence of coercion or pressure on his part, it was clear as set out above, the accused had actively cultivated a relationship with the victim knowing full well that she was only a young troubled 14-year old student and he was the fully grown 35-year old adult who was 21 years older than her.

75     In the present case, I did not accept the assertion by the Defence that the victim did not appear to be particularly vulnerable. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was clear from paragraphs 8 to 10 of the accused’s own mitigation plea that the victim was in a position of special vulnerability. This arose from the situational circumstances of their relationship of teacher and student. The victim had confided in highly personal matters with the accused. The accused was fully aware that she had familial issues with her parents. I agreed with the Prosecution that this exacerbates the position of trust the accused had and being in that position, he had abused the position of trust. In my view, such exploitation by authority figure such as the accused is extremely harmful and must be taken seriously regardless of the gender of the parties involved.

76     Counsel had submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that extraordinary harm was caused to the victim as a result of the incident. It was also submitted that there was no evidence of any physical or psychological harm caused to the victim. The fact remains that the victim was troubled and uncomfortable by the fact that she was kissed by a male teacher without her consent that it was only about two weeks later that she was able to inform a female teacher what had happened to her. Being abused by a person in a position of trust can cause a variety of emotional and psychological problems regardless of gender.

#### General deterrence and retribution

77     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that general deterrence and retribution are the applicable sentencing principles for an offence under s 7(a) CYPA. The CYPA was enacted to protect vulnerable minors under the age of 16 from sexual exploitation: see _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> (“_AQW_”) at \[13\]. Sentences for offences under the CYPA should provide for adequate deterrence against sexual exploitation of children and young persons: see _AQW_ at \[13\].

78     In my calibration of the appropriate custodial sentence to be imposed, I was mindful that in the present case, the accused had committed the offence with a degree of premeditation, the victim was particularly vulnerable and the degree of abuse of trust was exceptionally high. The accused had cultivated a relationship with the victim through their teacher-student interactions, exchange of text messages as well as outings over a period of time. In addition, the present case was not a case of a single or one-off instance of an exploitation of a minor by way of a quick peck or kiss on the lips but that the accused who was in a position of trust and authority had asked her to come over and sit next to him. He then placed his right arm around the victim's shoulder, leaned towards the victim and kissed her. The victim was shocked, nervous, felt embarrassed and was afraid after the first instance when the accused had kissed her. Yet, the accused had persisted in his exploitation of the victim by kissing her on the lips a second time while they were walking and after the victim had indicated that she wanted to go home. The accused had clearly abused the position of trust and the position of authority reposed in him as a school teacher as well as teacher in-charge of the victim's CCA and the sentence imposed must be of sufficient deterrence to him and other like-minded offenders.

79     Nevertheless, unlike some of the cases in the sentencing precedents, the present case does not involve multiple charges, the touching of naked genitalia or explicit sexual acts over a long period of time. The accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 7(a) CYPA. The factual matrix in the Prosecution's sentencing precedents involved facts which were more aggravated than the present case. Hence, in my view the sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution was on a high side. Even so, I disagreed with the Defence that the nature of the offence did not involve a serious act and that the sentence should be of no more than three months’ imprisonment. In my view, the sentence sought by the Defence did not commensurate with the factual matrix of the case as well as the degree of culpability of the accused and the harm caused.

80     Based on the degree of culpability and the level of harm in the present case, the mitigating factors as well as the aggravating factors, I had imposed a sentence of **6 months’ imprisonment** for **DAC 905502-2019.** I was of the view that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for **DAC 905502-2019** was just and appropriate in the present case.

81     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentence on 5 September 2019. He is presently serving his sentence in prison and his earliest date of release is 3 January 2020.
