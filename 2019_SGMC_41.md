Contract – Terms – Incorporation

8 August 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### Magistrate Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       The defendant (“Komori”) stored goods at a warehouse operated by the plaintiff (“DNKH”). On 9 August 2015, a fire broke out at the warehouse and damaged some of those goods. In the weeks thereafter, the parties corresponded by email, and also met face-to-face at the office of Komori on 31 August 2015 (the “Meeting”). They discussed among other things the air-freighting by DNKH, on behalf of Komori, of replacement goods from China to Singapore. These goods were urgently required by a customer of Komori. On 2 September 2015, the parties signed a document (DNKH/AF120 (rev 2)) that set out the details of the air-freighting (the “Quotation”). Thereafter, DNKH performed the air-freighting, and invoiced Komori.[^1]

2       In this Suit, DNKH claims against Komori for the invoice sum of $36,992.20 and interest thereon at 2% per month from 8 October 2015. Pursuant to District Court Order of Court No 7245 of 2018 and the subsequent agreement of the parties before me,[^2] District Court Suit No 3471 of 2016, in which Komori claims against DNKH for the losses that it suffered due to the fire, will be heard immediately after this Suit.

## Pleadings

3       DNKH pleads that the air-freighting arrangement was a separate and distinct contract from the warehousing arrangement between the parties, and that Komori had agreed to pay for the air-freighting without set-off or deduction on account of the fire damage.[^3] As evidence of this agreement, it refers to the Quotation, which had been signed by the parties and which expressly incorporates the Singapore Logistics Association Standard Trading Conditions (“SLASTC”).[^4] It highlights cl 19(a) of the SLASTC, which when incorporated into a contract requires all sums due thereunder to be paid immediately when due without deduction or set-off.[^5]

> The Customer \[_ie_, Komori\] shall pay to the Company \[_ie_, DNKH\] in cash or in such manner as the Company may agree all sums immediately when due without deduction or deferment on account of any claim, counterclaims or set-off and the Customer agrees to waive the right of set-off, if any, as against the Company.

4       Komori denies that it had agreed to pay for the air-freighting without set-off or deduction,[^6] and pleads that DNKH had at the Meeting agreed to perform the air-freighting for “no charge” (“No-Charge Agreement”).[^7] It adds that it had signed the Quotation simply as “documentation” to facilitate an insurance claim by DNKH for the costs of the air-freighting.[^8] It contends that cl 19(a) of the SLASTC does not form part of the air-freighting arrangement because a copy of the SLASTC had not been extended to it.[^9]

## Quotation

5       I find that the parties had agreed to the air-freighting in the terms of the Quotation and not of any No-Charge Agreement.

6       First, the Quotation was negotiated then signed by Komori and DNKH. During the negotiations, Komori had cancelled two clauses on a draft of the Quotation (DNKH/AF120).[^10] The draft was amended to become what is now the Quotation. Komori signed the Quotation thereafter.[^11] The Quotation is the only document relating to the air-freighting that both Komori and DNKH signed (apart from the draft Quotation, which neither party suggests is binding). Allen Tan, the managing director of Komori at all material times, conceded in cross-examination that the Quotation is a “contract”.[^12]

7       Second, Komori expressly _admits_ in its Defence to a key pleaded allegation by DNKH: that Komori had asked DNKH to “proceed with the air-freighting” and had agreed to “pay \[DNKH\] the sum of US$25,910.00 for the air-freighting without any deduction or set-off upon being invoiced for the same.”[^13] When asked about this pleading during cross-examination, Allen Tan confirmed that he had “told \[DNKH\] to go ahead and pick up and the cargo and … \[Komori\] will claim against \[DNKH\] for all the consequential loss.”[^14]

8       Third, the notion that Komori had agreed to pay for the air-freighting and then apply to recover the same against DNKH is borne out in an email sent by Allen Tan between the time of the Meeting and the signing of the Quotation. This email states that Komori would, “accept the S$35,361.97 air freight charges”, albeit “unwillingly”, and will “claim this bill form the insurance consequences loss”.[^15] This unwillingness does not diminish the effectiveness of Komori’s acceptance. Rather, it shows that Komori knew of the payment obligations that it was assuming under the Quotation.

9       At the same time, the evidence does not bear out a No-Charge Agreement between the parties.

10     First, the allegation by Komori of a No-Charge Agreement is not borne out in any objective documentary evidence. Komori points to emails that it had sent to DNKH before the Meeting stating that “the costs of freighting and all related costs will be the responsibility of DNKH”[^16] and that “DNKH has agreed to settle this and resolved the claim \[_sic_\] yourself with your insurer.”[^17] But these emails reveal only a unilateral or subjective understanding on the part of Komori of a No-Charge Agreement, and not an agreement on the part of DNKH to the same. In any event, extrinsic evidence of any such subjective intent by Komori is inadmissible. The Quotation is a written agreement and extrinsic evidence is inadmissible for contradicting or varying its terms (s 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”)). Also, the Quotation on its face plainly applies to the air-freighting arrangement and extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to prove that it does not so apply (s 96 of the EA). Further, the absence of latent ambiguity in the text of the Quotation as to the payment obligations of Komori thereunder (see \[24\] below) leaves no room to admit extrinsic evidence of the subjective intentions of Komori in signing the Quotation (_Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 219</span> at \[44\]).

11     Second, Komori had no reason to sign the Quotation if the parties had in fact a No-Charge Agreement. Rather, Komori would have had every reason not to sign the Quotation because it controverts a No-Charge Agreement. Komori pleads, nevertheless, that it had done so because DNKH “required documentation to be produced and signed to show what the cost of the freight would have been, so that \[DNKH\] could show the document to their own insurers.”[^18] Yet Komori not only signed the Quotation but also _negotiated_ the terms therein as to payment duration and late payment interest. It is difficult to see why Komori would have gone to the trouble of negotiating these terms if it had believed that the Quotation was to be mere “documentation” and of no substantive legal effect as between itself and DNKH.

12     Third, Komori gives inconsistent accounts of the contents of any No-Charge Agreement. At Paragraph 13 of the Defence, it pleads that DNKH had agreed to undertake the air-freighting “without charge”.[^19] At Paragraph 15 of the Defence, it states that “payment for the freight charges would not be made until it was determined whether \[DNKH\] were liable to \[it\] for damage to the goods caused by the fire” and that “payment would only be made in the event \[DNKH\] were not liable for the fire”.[^20] During cross-examination, Allen Tan was asked to clarify these pleadings. He replied: “What actually we want is if DNKH insist the payment, after letting us know that they can or they can’t claim from the insurance, then we will make a decision from there.”[^21]

13     Accordingly, I find that the parties had agreed to the air-freighting in the terms of the Quotation and not of any No-Charge Agreement.

14     I note the submission of DNKH that it made limited profit (S$615.95) from the air-freighting, and could not therefore have agreed to perform them unless it was “fully paid for its services and \[would\] not be out-of-pocket.”[^22] But this does not take DNKH far. No evidence was led as to the typical level of profit on an air-freighting arrangement, and it is unclear how the S$615.95 that would DNKH would earn under the Quotation compares to that. More importantly, even if the profit made by DNKH under the Quotation was low, it is a stretch to conclude thereby that DNKH would not have agreed to the air-freighting unless it was paid immediately. As DNKH admits, it provided the air-freighting services at least partly in the belief that Komori would “give future work to \[it\]” and “to maintain the business relationship between the parties.”[^23]

## SLASTC properly and validly incorporated

15     I find also cl 19(a) of the SLASTC to have been properly and validly incorporated into the Quotation.

### Incorporation of SLASTC

16     The Quotation expressly subjects “all business transacted” with DNKH to the SLASTC.[^24]

> All business transacted with DNKH Logistics Pte Ltd are subject to the Singapore Logistics Association’s Standard Trading Conditions, a copy of which is available upon request.

17     There is no dispute that the Quotation was signed by both parties, and, as Allen Tan conceded, the Quotation constitutes a “contract” between them. It is irrelevant that Komori may not have known about or read the SLASTC. The principle of drawing the attention of a contractual counterparty to onerous and unusual conditions has no application where there is a signed contract with an explicit incorporation clause. This is subject only to the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“UCTA”), which governs the reasonableness of contractual clauses (_Press Automation Technology Pte Ltd v Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 712</span> (“_Press Automation_”) at \[39\]–\[40\]).

18     Strikingly similar is the incorporation clause here to that in _Press Automation_: “All business is only transacted in accordance with the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association (SFFA) Standard Trading Conditions. Copy is available upon application.” In holding that these words sufficed to incorporate the SFFA Conditions into the contract between the parties, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed that the words were “clear” (_Press Automation_ at \[40\]).

19     Here, the case for incorporation is even stronger. In _Press Automation_, the parties had no prior course of dealing (at \[10\]). By contrast, Komori had before signing the Quotation entered into a warehousing contract with DNKH that expressly referred to the SLASTC in language identical to that in the Quotation.[^25] Also, most if not all of the written communications by DNKH to Komori in the wake of the fire stipulated that DNKH traded on the basis of the SLASTC.[^26] Further, while Allen Tan cancelled two clauses relating to the mechanics of payment from the draft Quotation during the negotiations with DNKH, he did not amend the clause incorporating the SLASTC, which was just above those two clauses.[^27] Allen Tan accepted that “nobody \[at DNKH\] bothered to query about what does SLA\[STC\] mean” and “just didn’t bother”, explaining that “We engaged a service, lah, so we don’t go into all the fine detail”.[^28]

20     Ultimately, a contracting party must have a care for its own legal position. It must ascertain the terms that are to be part of a contract before signing the contract. If it does not do so, it will be bound by those terms (_Press Automation_ at \[40\]). Komori having signed the Quotation is thus bound by the clause therein that incorporates cl 19(a) of the SLASTC, insofar as the cl 19(a) of the SLASTC satisfies the requirement of reasonableness in the UCTA.

21     Komori submits that because DNKH “specifically knew that \[Komori\] wished to make claims for all losses arising from the fire against \[DNKH\]”, DNKH “had the legal and equitable obligation to say that there was a clause in SLASTC” that would preclude Komori from doing so.[^29] But Komori doess not plead that DNKH had any such obligation. Nor does it offer any authority in support of these submissions. Also, _Press Automation_ at \[39\]–\[40\] is clear that no notice would be required to incorporate a term by reference to a collateral document if the contract in question has been signed by the party against whom the term is sought to be enforced.

22     Accordingly, I find that cl 19(a) of the SLASTC was properly incorporated into the Quotation.

### Validity of SLASTC

23     Freedom of contract means that contracting parties can agree to exclude rights and defences of set-off. It is simply a matter of interpretation whether the words of a contract are clear enough to do so. This is a general common law principle that is based on commercial logic and common sense. It may be important for cash flow reasons that a party should receive payment in full under a contract so that, if the other party has a cross-claim which otherwise would give rise to an equitable set-off or a common law defence of abatement, that other party should not be entitled to tender a reduced amount, but should have to seek its remedy in separate proceedings (_Koh Lin Yee v Terrestrial Pte Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 497</span> at \[15\]–\[16\]).

24     In my judgment, the text of cl 19(a) of the SLASTC is clear, and precludes Komori from setting-off or otherwise deducting the costs of the air-freighting against any damages that it may recover from DNKH for the fire damage. Komori may not therefore use the fire damage to justify tendering a reduced amount for the air-freighting, but must seek its remedy for any fire damage in separate proceedings.

25     Komori does not expressly raise the UCTA in its pleadings or missions. Nevertheless, I do not think cl 19(a) of the SLASTC is unreasonable under the UCTA. First, cl 19(a) of the SLASTC was entered into, as part of the Quotation, between two commercial entities in a commercial context, and there is no evidence that Komori was of weaker bargaining power than DNKH. Second, Komori ought reasonably to have known of the incorporation and substance of the SLASTC before signing the Quotation given the repeated references to SLASTC in the draft Quotation, the correspondence between the parties, and the warehousing contract between the parties. Third, Komori remains able to pursue and is in fact pursuing its claims against the DNKH for the fire damage in District Court Suit No 3471 of 2016.

## Payment mechanics

26     Having found that Komori agreed to pay for the air-freighting without set-off or deduction, I turn to how such payment was to be made.

27     The Quotation expressly prescribes a payment duration of 30 days and interest at 2% per month on late payments.[^30]

> Payment terms: 30 days from date of invoice

> Late payment of 2% interest charges shall be imposed on the outstanding amount owed per month for the full period in the event of late/partial payment, until a time when all outstanding payments are settled

28     A party is bound by a contract that it has signed even if it is unaware of the existence or effect of a term therein (_Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Lin Lester_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 593</span> at \[38\]).

29     For the clause requiring payment to be made 30 days from the date of the invoice issued by DNKH, Komori makes no express submission. For the clause prescribing late payment interest at 2% per month, Komori makes two points. First, “Allen Tan deleted the \[corresponding\] clause” in the draft Quotation. Second, “interest at 2% per month is usury and a penalty” because DNKH “produced no evidence to show that that was their costs of funds”.[^31]

30     I am unable to accept these two points, neither of which was expressly pleaded. Wherever a party has a special ground of defence, it must specifically plead the matter on which it relies for such purpose (O 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). Although this is not an immutable rule, an assertion that has not been pleaded will not be entertained unless it would not surprise or irreparably prejudice the other party (_BOM v BOK and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 349</span> at \[40\]).

31     For the point that Allen Tan had omitted to cancel out the clause relating to late payment interest before singing the Quotation, as he had done with the draft Quotation, Komori does not plead any defence of mistake. The furthest that the Defence goes is that the clause is “inconsistent with the agreement … that payment for the freight charges would not be made until it was determined whether \[DNKH\] were liable\]” for the fire damage.[^32] But this suggests only that Komori did not have to pay for the air-freighting at all (until the liability of DNKH for the fire damage had been determined), and not that Komori was mistaken as to the late payment interest obligation. Also, Komori did not put its case of a mistake as to the term prescribing late payment interest to the witnesses of DNKH.

32     For the point that interest of 2% per month is penal, Komori does not even suggest as such in its Defence and its opening statement. Only belatedly, in its closing submissions, did Komori so argue.

33     I thus conclude that Komori was to have paid for the air-freighting within 30 days from the date when DNKH issued its invoice for the same, failing which interest is payable at a rate of 2% per month until the invoice is fully paid.

## Stay of judgment

34     Komori submits that any judgment in this Suit should be stayed pending the hearing of District Court Suit No 3471 of 2016. But Komori has through the Quotation agreed to waive its right of set-off in respect of whatever claim to damages it may have had for the fire damage. In these circumstances, staying the judgment in this Suit would avail Komori of what is in essence the benefit of a set-off when Komori has, by contract, waived its right to a set-off (see _Kum Leng General Contractor v Hytech Builders Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 310</span> at \[46\]–\[47\]). Such a course is not therefore appropriate.

## Conclusion

35     I thus enter judgment for DNKH for $36,992.20. Interest is payable on this sum at a rate of 2% per month from 8 October 2015.

36     I will fix the costs of this Suit if the parties cannot agree on the same.
