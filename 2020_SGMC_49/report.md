Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Gag orders

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9837/2020/01.\]

19 October 2020

### District Judge Seah Chi Ling:

## Introduction

1       The sole issue arising for consideration in this appeal is whether the identity of the accused (the “**Accused**”), who has been found suitable to undergo a Mandatory Treatment Order (“**MTO**”) after pleading guilty to an outrage of modesty charge, should be protected under a gag order.

## Background facts

2       The Accused is currently a medical student at a local university. The Accused faced a single charge under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), namely, that he had on 30 August 2019 at or about 10.15 pm, at a local MRT Station, insulted the modesty of a 25-year-old female (the “**Victim**”) by recording an upskirt video of the Victim whilst riding up an escalator, by placing his handphone under the Victim’s skirt, with the intention of intruding her privacy and insulting her modesty (the “**Charge**”).

3       The Accused is currently 21 years of age. He was a few months shy of 20 years old at the time of the commission of the offence.

4       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to the Charge on 1 September 2020 (the “**PG Mention**”). In his mitigation plea, Defence Counsel urged the court to call for a MTO Suitability Report to assess the Accused’s suitability to be placed on a MTO. Defence Counsel highlighted that the Accused was under considerable stress at or around the time the offence was committed. This was attributed to the worsening health of his grandparents – his maternal grandmother was suffering from severe medical ailments at the material time and had to be hospitalized from time to time; separately, his paternal grandmother passed away in September 2019 due to illness; and his paternal grandfather’s health condition had also worsened considerably during this period and he eventually passed away in November 2019. The Accused’s stress was further compounded by his breakup with his girlfriend of 3 years shortly before the commission of the offence.

5       A private psychiatric report tendered by the Defence opined that the Accused “was suffering from an Adjustment Disorder with Behavioural Manifestation” as the Accused was “experiencing tremendous stresses at that time”. These conditions contributed to his commission of the index offence. The private psychiatrist report also noted that the Accused was genuinely remorseful, acutely aware of his situation, has shown a willingness to change, and that his risk of re-offending was very low. The Accused further took proactive steps to seek help for his condition, including attending multiple therapy sessions, and has not offended for a year since starting his treatment. His strong family support also bodes well for his treatment and rehabilitation.

6       In view of the medical evidence tendered, I called for a MTO Suitability Report pursuant to Section 339(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**CPC**”) to assess the Accused’s suitability for a MTO. Prosecution did not object to the calling of the report.

## Application for a gag order

7       In addition to urging the court to call for a MTO Suitability Report, at the PG Mention, Defence Counsel further requested that the court impose a gag order to prohibit the disclosure of the Accused’s identity. Save for articulating various broad principles, no authorities were cited by Defence Counsel to support his application.

8       It was common ground that an existing gag order was already in effect since the Accused’s earlier court mentions which prohibited the identification of the Victim. Defence Counsel intimated that he understood the mentions judge had ordered the gag order to extend to the Accused as well, a position which the Prosecution disputed. A perusal of the mentions judge’s minute sheets dated 8 June 2020 and 11 August 2020 respectively revealed that no gag order was made in relation to the Accused.

9       Be that as it may, Defence Counsel submitted before me that, even if there were no pre-existing gag orders in respect of the Accused, a gag order should presently be made to prohibit the identification of the Accused. The Prosecution objected to the application. The Prosecution argued that gag orders are traditionally imposed to protect the identities of victims of sexual offences or child abuses from being disclosed. Gag orders are never intended to extend to accused persons, except in cases where the disclosure of the identity of the accused would lead to the identification of the victim, citing Section 425A of the CPC.

10     As there was no advance notice that the issue of the scope of the gag order would be contested at the PG Mention, I decided to adjourn my decision on the gag order until a later date for parties to undertake research and present full arguments on this point. In the meantime, I made an interim gag order prohibiting the publication of the Accused’s identity pending further submissions on this issue.

11     On 25 September 2020, parties returned for the sentencing of the Accused (the “**Sentencing Hearing**”). A MTO Suitability Report dated 23 September 2020 had by then been prepared by an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist (the “**Appointed Psychiatrist**”). The Appointed Psychiatrist opined that the Accused fulfilled all the requirements under Section 339(3) of the CPC for a MTO, and recommended that the accused be placed on a MTO for a period of 18 months. According to the MTO Suitability Report, the Accused was suffering from an adjustment disorder at the time of the offence precipitated by the various stressors he was facing; there was a contributory link between his mental disorder and his offending behaviour; and his adjustment disorder had shown signs of improvement after treatment.

12     Both Prosecution and Defence Counsel did not object to the sentence of a MTO in light of the recommendations and findings of the Appointed Psychiatrist. Applying the principles in _GCX v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span>, I agreed with the Appointed Psychiatrist’s recommendations and sentenced the Accused to a MTO for 18 months with effect from 25 September 2020.

## Whether a gag order covering the Accused should be ordered?

### Defence’s submissions

13     Post my sentence of the Accused to a MTO, Defence Counsel revisited the issue of whether the interim gag order that I had previously granted pending detailed submissions on this issue should be made permanent. The is the sole issue in the present appeal.

14     The key arguments advanced by Defence Counsel for advocating a permanent gag order in respect of the Accused are as follows:

> (a)     Counsel submitted that this Court has wide powers under Section 7(3) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“**SCA**”), which is in _pari materia_ with Section 8 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“**SCJA**”), to prohibit the publication of any information that will lead to the identification of any “witness” in the court proceedings. Counsel contended that the reference to “witness” in Section 7(3) SCA must necessarily extend to an “accused person”.

> (b)     The Court’s power to make a gag order is broad and unfettered, and not limited to situations where publication would lead to the identification of the victim[^1]. As set out in Section 7(2) of the SCA, the court may exercise the powers set out therein where “it is expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or \[where there are\] other sufficient reason” to do so. Section 7(6) of the SCA further sets out various matters that the court may consider when deciding whether it ought to hear proceedings _in camera._ Defence Counsel argued that while the Section 7(6) SCA factors are expressly stated to be applicable to Section 7(2) of the SCA (which deals applications for hearings _in-camera_), the principles nevertheless provided useful guidance for determining whether a gag order should be ordered in respect of a “witness” under Section 7(3) of the SCA[^2].

> (c)     Citing _GCP (a minor) (suing by her father and litigation representative, GCQ) and others v GCS_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 122</span> (“_GCP’s case_”), Counsel further submitted that the law has long recognised strong public policy reasons for safeguarding the welfare of children involved in court proceedings by protecting their identities from disclosure. This has since been incorporated within the provisions of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“**CYPA**”). This policy stance is justified on the basis that public shaming of a child can heighten tensions within his family and fracture the very unit of society that is pivotal to his rehabilitation; cause the offender to be ostracised by his peers and teachers thus crippling community-based rehabilitation measures; and create a public record of the offence (particularly in this digital age) which will compromise the education and employment prospects of the offender[^3]. Counsel emphasized that the Accused was a 19-year-old teenager at the time of the offence and thus rehabilitation would assume prominence when sentencing the Accused. On this basis, counsel submitted that there are clear parallels to be drawn between the policies underpinning the protection of identification of children under the CYPA and the Accused, a youthful offender, in the present case. The rationale for extending gag orders to “young persons” under the CYPA should therefore apply to Accused[^4].

> (d)     Extending the gag order to the Accused will further facilitate his rehabilitation by: (i) avoiding his risk of expulsion from school; (ii) improving his employment prospects and allow him to “embark on a career in a noble profession with countless opportunities to serve the public good”; (iii) avoiding intense public and shaming of the Accused which would only serve to impede his progress in dealing with his Adjustment Disorder; and (iv) avoiding fracturing his family and social support network which are “pivotal to his growth in maturity and effective rehabilitation”[^5].

> (e)     To refuse to extend the gag order to the Accused is in effect to “promote the sentencing objectives of punishment and general deterrence” which goes against the “presumptive view” that rehabilitation is the predominant consideration when sentencing young offenders[^6].

### Prosecution’s submissions

15     At the Sentencing Hearing, the Prosecution continued to oppose the extension of the gag order to the Accused. The key arguments raised by the Prosecution are as follows:

> (a)     “Open justice” is an essential component to the rule of law in Singapore. The Accused was prosecuted in an open court. Accused persons of all backgrounds have been prosecuted in open court and none have requested, or have ever had, gag orders extended to them (except in cases when failure to do so would lead to the identification of certain categories of victims).

> (b)     The imposition of a gag order to cover an accused person represents the exception rather than the norm. Where such exceptions are contemplated, Parliament has seen it fit to expressly legislate for such exceptions: see for example Section 84B of the CYPA.

> (c)     Defence Counsel’s reliance on Section 7(3) of the SCA as the legal basis for extending the gag order to the Accused is legally flawed. Section 7(3) of the SCA expressly provides for the extension of the gag order to “witnesses” in suitable cases. As a matter of statutory interpretation, an “accused person” could not be regarded as a “witness” in court proceedings.

> (d)     Reliance by Defence Counsel on the Section 7(6) SCA factors to support the proposition that the court has a wide discretion to expand the scope of a gag order under Section 7(3) of the SCA to an accused person is also misconceived. It is undisputed that the Defence Counsel is relying on Section 7(3) SCA as the legal basis for submitting that a gag order should be ordered in respect of his client[^7]. Prosecution, however, pointed out that Section 7(6) of the SCA is expressly stated to apply to Section 7(2) (_in-camera applications_) _only_, and not Section 7(3) (_gag order applications_).

> (e)     The Defence has further misstated the Prosecution’s position that the latter’s purpose in objecting to the extension of the gag order to the Accused is intended to inflict punishment and deterrence on the Accused. The Prosecution accepts the need for the rehabilitation of the Accused having regard to the recommendations contained in the MTO Suitability Report. Accordingly, Prosecution did not oppose the making of a MTO as requested by the Defence. However, Prosecution takes issue with the Defence’s attempts at conflating the issue of the rehabilitation as the presumptive sentencing consideration for the Accused as a youthful offender, versus the need for the imposition of a gag order to cover the Accused. Prosecution submits that it is entirely speculative for Counsel to assert that the ends of rehabilitation cannot be achieved if the gag order were not extended to the Accused. Indeed, by asking for a gag order in addition to the MTO, the Accused is in effect seeking special treatment vis-à-vis other youthful offenders who fell outside the protective provisions of the CYPA due to their age but who were nevertheless sentenced to rehabilitation-based sentencing options and have never had their identities protected by a gag order. The Prosecution’s opposition to extending the gag order to the Accused is motivated by considerations of “open justice”, and not by attempts to undermine the Accused’s rehabilitation.

## My decision

16     Having carefully considered the arguments by both parties, I am not persuaded by the Defence’s arguments that a gag order should be extended to the Accused. I accordingly dismissed the Defence’s application for a permanent gag order to prohibit the disclosure of the Accused’s identity. The Accused is dissatisfied with my decision on the gag order issue, and has filed the present appeal. I set out the reasons for my decision below.

### Principles of open justice

17     The principle of open justice is a fundamental tenet of our jurisprudence and is enshrined in Section 7 of the SCA, as well as Section 8 of the SCJA which is _pari materia_ to Section 7 of the SCA. Section 7 of the SCA states:

> “7.- (1)    The place in which any State Court is held shall be deemed an open and public court to which the public generally may have access.”

18     That court proceedings should generally be held in open court has been justified on the basis that justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done. This justification was further expounded by Lord Diplock in _Attorney-General v Leveller Magazine Ltd _<span class="citation">\[1979\] AC 440</span> at 449–450 in the following terms:

> “_If the way that the courts behave cannot be hidden from the public ear and eye this provides a safeguard against judicial arbitrariness or idiosyncrasy and maintains the public conﬁdence in the administration of justice_. The application of this principle of open justice has two aspects: as respects proceedings in the court itself it requires that they should be held in open court to which the press and public are admitted and that, in criminal cases at any rate, all evidence communicated to the court is communicated publicly. _As respects the publication to a wider public of fair and accurate reports of proceedings that have taken place in court the principle requires that nothing should be done to discourage this”.[^8] \[Emphasis added\]_

19     There are, of course, cases in which the circumstances and nature of a particular case may require that the case be conducted in private. In such cases, the court may hear the proceedings _in camera_ – i.e. by way of a proceeding closed to the public. This is expressly contemplated under Section 7(2) of the SCA. These may arise in cases where national security is involved, or the interests of children are at stake, though it should be pointed out that the categories of such cases are not closed: see Sections 7(2) and 7(5) of the SCA.

20     It should, however, be emphasised at the outset that the present case _does not_ involve an application for an _in-camera_ hearing. The Defence has never applied for the hearings to be heard _in-camera_ right from the mentions stage to the sentencing stage. Indeed, the relief sought by the Defence is far more limited in scope – _viz_., for the court to impose a gag order to prohibit the disclosure of any information that may lead to the identification of the Accused.

### Examination of legal basis for extending the gag order to the Accused

21     It follows from the principles of “open justice” discussed above that the court should be slow to hold that the identity of the Accused should be protected by secrecy unless there are express statutory provisions or established legal principles that provide for the making of such an order.

22     I start my analysis by referring to Section 425A of the CPC which provides as follows:

> **“Prohibition against publication, etc., that identifies complainant or alleged victim of sexual offence or child abuse offence**

> 425A—(1)    Subject to subsection (2), where any person knows that an _individual is a complainant, or an alleged victim, of a sexual offence or child abuse offence_, that person must not do any of the following things:

>> (a)     _publish the name_, address or photograph of the _individual_;

>> (b)     _publish any evidence, or any other thing, that is likely to lead to the identification of the individual as a complainant, or an alleged victim, of a sexual offence or child abuse offence;_

>> (c)    do any other act that is likely to lead to the identification of the individual as a complainant, or an alleged victim, of a sexual offence or child abuse offence.” _\[emphasis added\]_

23     It is clear from Section 425A of the CPC that gag orders are most commonly sought to protect the identities of victims of sexual or child abuse offences. It is generally imposed to prohibit the identification of the victim of an offence, and not the perpetrator of the offence. The only time prohibition of the disclosure of the identity of the offender is expressly contemplated in Section 425A of the CPC is where disclosure of any information relating to the offender is “likely to lead to the identification of the \[victim\]”: see Section 425A(1)(b) CPC.

24     Defence Counsel, however, relied on Section 7(3) of the SCA to support his argument that the court is empowered to extend a gag order to persons outside those expressly contemplated under Section 425A of the CPC. Section 7 of the SCA provides as follows:

> “**Sittings in camera, etc.**

> **7.**—(1)    The place in which any State Court is held shall be deemed an open and public court to which the public generally may have access.

> (2)    A State Court shall have power to hear any matter or proceeding or any part thereof _in camera_ if the court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or for other sufficient reason to do so.

> ……

> (_3_)     _A State Court may at any time order that no person shall —_

>> (_a_)     _publish the name, address or photograph of any_ _witness_ _in any matter or proceeding or any part thereof tried or held or to be tried or held before it, or any evidence or any other thing likely to lead to the identification of any such_ _witness_ _; or_

>> (_b_)     _do any other act which is likely to lead to the identification of such a_ _witness_ _._

> ……

> (6)     _For the purposes of subsection (2)_, the matters that a State Court may consider, when deciding whether it is expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or for other sufficient reason, to hear the whole or any part of any matter or proceeding _in camera_, include the following matters:

>> (_a_)    whether the defence of any accused person in that matter or proceeding will be prejudiced by the presence of any member of the public in the courtroom;

>> (_b_)    whether any accused person or witness in that matter or proceeding has any legitimate interest in privacy that needs to be protected;

>> (_c_)    whether the object of that matter or proceeding will be defeated by publicity if that matter or proceeding is heard in open court;

>> (_d_)    whether any accused person or witness in that matter or proceeding has any legitimate interest in protecting the confidentiality of any information that may be disclosed during the hearing of that matter or proceeding;

>> (_e_)    whether any information that may be disclosed during the hearing of that matter or proceeding will be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore……..” _\[emphasis added\]_

25     It is clear from a plain reading of Section 7(3) of the SCA that the provision is intended to protect the identity of “witnesses”, which literally construed, would not cover “accused persons”. Indeed, where the Legislature intended the gag order to extend to a specific class of accused persons, this has been clearly provided for in the relevant legislation. Section 425A of the CPC discussed above is one such example. Separately, Section 84B of the CYPA expressly prohibits the publication of any information relating to any court proceedings that may lead to the identification of any “child” or “young person” concerned in the proceedings _“either as being the person against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken or as being a witness therein”._ Section 84B of the CYPA states:

> **“Restriction on publication of information relating to proceedings involving children and young persons**

> 84B.—(1)    Subject to subsection (2), a person must not —

>> (a)    publish or broadcast any information relating to any proceedings in any court or on appeal from any court that reveals the name, address or school or that includes any particulars that are calculated to lead to the identification _of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings, either as being the person_ _against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken or_ _as being_ _a witness_ _therein_;

>> (b)    publish or broadcast any picture as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in any such proceedings; or

>> (c)    publish or broadcast any information or picture mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) even after the child or young person attains 18 years of age (called in this section the protected person).” _\[emphasis added\]_

26     Section 84B of the CYPA is thus clear in providing that the prohibition against disclosure extends _even to the identity of accused persons_ who fall within the definition of a “child” or “young person” within the meaning of the CYPA. The legislative approach adopted in both Section 84B of the CYPA and Section 425A of the CPC suggest that where there are no express statutory provisions prohibiting the disclosure of the identities of accused persons, the default position is that the principles of “open justice” would prevail. As K Shanmugam, Minister for Law, noted in _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (14 May 2012) vol 89 at pp 188–189:

> “_Our legal system operates on the principle of public justice. Accused persons are publicly tried. The verdict of the court is publicly announced. Reporting of ongoing proceedings is allowed so long as it does not prejudice the proper administration of justice. The exceptions to the principle are limited_ – they mainly apply to protect sensitive information relating to national security, as well as the _identities of young persons_ …

> Lawyers from the Bar would know that the publicity from a criminal trial is often very damaging to the accused, even if he is ultimately acquitted. … The solution to adverse publicity during ongoing proceedings must be to increase public awareness that a charge is not the same as a conviction, and that an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty by a court of law. But I accept and recognise that this is a significantly uphill task.”[^9]

27     light of the foregoing, I do not accept Defence Counsel’s submission that Section 7(3) of the SCA confers a wide discretion on a judge to impose a gag order covering an accused person, as opposed to a “witness”. While there are distinct legislative provisions elsewhere which protect the disclosure of an accused person, these, as illustrated above, do not apply to the Accused.

28     For completeness, Defence Counsel’s submission that a wide discretion to order a gag order is introduced by analogy via Section 7(6) of the SCA is also misconceived in my view. The factors enumerated in Section 7(6) CPC are clearly expressed to apply to Section 7(2) of the SCA only, i.e. for the purposes of determining whether _in-camera_ hearings should be ordered. This is not the factual matrix encountered in the present case, which concerns the imposition of a gag order. For the same reason, I did not consider the case of _BBW v BBX_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 755</span> cited by the Defence Counsel to be relevant, as the case similarly dealt with the an _in-camera_ application in the context of arbitration proceedings.

### Potential Adverse Effects on the Accused’s Rehabilitation?

29     Defence next argued that the Accused’s rehabilitation under the MTO would be jeopardised if a gag order covering the identity of the Accused were refused. In this regard, Defence Counsel sought to draw parallels between policies underpinning the protection of the identities of children under the CYPA and the need to give effect to the dominant consideration of the Accused’s rehabilitation in the present case on the basis that the Accused is a youthful offender.

30     The Legislature has long endorsed a public policy of protecting a “child” and “young persons” involved in court proceedings even if such individuals have committed serious offences[^10]. As noted above, this policy is enshrined in Section 84B of the CYPA which has been set out in \[25\] above. Section 84B of the CYPA, which came into effect on 1 July 2020, replaces section 35(1) of the then existing CYPA. The two provisions are identical in material aspects save that Section 2(1) of the CYPA now defines (subject to certain exceptions) a “young person” to mean “a person who is 14 years of age or older but below _18 years of age_”, whereas previously, a “young person” was defined to mean “a person who is 14 years of age or above and below the age of _16 years_”.

31     The Accused was a few months short of 20 years of age when he committed the offence on 30 August 2019. As at the offence date, the cut off age for a “young person” for the purposes of Section 35(1) of the then CYPA was 16 years old. Even with the coming into effect of Section 84B of the CYPA on 1 July 2020, and the consequential raising of the threshold age of a “young person” under the CYPA to 18 years old, the Accused still far exceeded the age limit for coming within the protective provision of a gag order, whether under the old Section 35(1) or the new Section 84B of the CYPA. In light of his age, I am unable to go behind the express legislative intent and extend the gag order to the Accused under, or by analogy with, the relevant CYPA provisions.

32     I acknowledge that the accused, who was around 20 years of age both at the time of the offence and at sentencing, would be regarded as a youthful offender for the purposes of the application of the principles in _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Karthik_”). It is for this reason that I found that rehabilitation was still a predominant sentencing consideration for the sentencing of the accused, and accordingly sentenced the Accused to a MTO. However, the acceptance that rehabilitation remains a predominant sentencing consideration for an accused person in light of his age should not be conflated with the issue of whether the accused should be sentenced under a shroud of secrecy under the protective shield of a gag order. It does not follow that the ends of rehabilitation would invariably be thwarted the minute the identity of the accused is disclosed publicly. If this submission were true, then all Community Based Sentences (“**CBS**”) or probation orders should in the majority of cases be accompanied by a gag order to protect the identity of the offender. This, however, is clearly not the practice of the courts. Indeed, Defence Counsel was not able to cite me a single authority in which a gag order was extended to an accused person sentenced to a rehabilitative sentencing order solely on the basis that such a gag order was necessary for his rehabilitation. Having regard to the clear legislative behind the CYPA amendments to only extend a gag order to accused persons under 18 years of age, it would not be right for me to go behind the legislative intent and grant a gag order in favour of the Accused simply because he has demonstrated rehabilitative needs, is a tertiary student undertaking a specialist discipline, and has good future employment prospects: see paragraph \[14(d)\] above.

### Parity of treatment

33     The State Courts deal with a not insignificant number of cases involving youthful offenders above 16 years but under 21 years of age in which the predominant sentencing consideration is one of rehabilitation: see _Karthik_. CBS (including MTOs), probation orders, and reformative training orders are often considered, and in a vast majority of cases, granted, for these youthful offenders. Yet, it is rare, and indeed unheard of (to my knowledge), for these accused persons to argue that their identities should be protected from disclosure, except in cases whether the gag order is extended to the accused person principally to prevent the unintended identification of the victim of a sexual or child abuse offence: see Section 254A CPC. The Prosecution makes the valid point, which I accept, that in seeking for a gag order to cover the Accused in the present case, that may very well be perceived as seeking special treatment for the Accused compared to other offenders who have similarly been sentence to rehabilitation-based orders.

34     Defence highlighted a number of difficulties that the Accused would face if his identity were not protected by a gag order – see paragraph \[14(d)\] above. These are, however, inevitable consequence of the commission of a criminal offence which all convicted offenders will have to come to terms, and learn to cope, with. The Accused has been sentenced to a MTO. Much as I appreciate that the Accused would face some distress if his name were made public, that is a consequence of the misstep that he had taken, and something he must take some responsibility for, and learn to cope with as part of his rehabilitation. It is certainly an area the Accused should seek to address with this Appointed Psychiatrist as part of his overall treatment.

## Conclusion

35     In conclusion, I am unable to acceded to the Accused’s request to impose a gag order to protect his identity from disclosure. Not only is this request inconsistent with the principles of “open justice” on which our legal system operates, it is also not backed by any legislative authority or case law principles. It may further be perceived wrongly as granting special treatment to the Accused vis-à-vis other youthful offenders with equally pressing rehabilitative needs and sentenced to rehabilitation-based sentencing options, but who are not protected by any gag orders.

36     I therefore dismissed the Accused’s application in relation to the gag order. The Accused is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed the present appeal. For the avoidance of doubt, the MTO order made in favour of the Accused has not been appealed against by either party and therefore remains in effect.
