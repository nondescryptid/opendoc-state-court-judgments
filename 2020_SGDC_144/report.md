Criminal Law – Offences – Consumption of Specified Drug – Possession of Utensils Intended for Consumption of Specified Drug

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9342/2020/01.\]

22 June 2020

### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Kanesan s/o Ramasamy, claimed trial to two charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The first charge (DAC-935409-2016) was a charge under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA. It related to the consumption without authorisation of a specified drug, Morphine, listed in The Fourth Schedule to the MDA (“the Consumption Charge”):

> You… are charged that you, on or before 13th September 2016, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, Morphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed)…”

2       The second charge (DAC-943069-2016) was a charge under s 9 of the MDA for possession without authorisation of utensils, namely one rolled up paper and one burnt aluminium foil, intended for the consumption of a specified drug, Morphine, listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA (“the Drug Utensils Charge”):

> “You… are charged that you, on 13th September 2016, in Singapore, did have in your possession utensils intended for the consumption of Morphine, a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Edition), to wit, one (1) rolled-up paper and one (1) burnt aluminium foil, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 9, which is punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act.”

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of both offences. I sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment (mandatory minimum) for the Consumption Charge and four months’ imprisonment for the Drug Utensils Charge. Both imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently.

4       Being dissatisfied with the decision, the Accused has appealed against both conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending appeal.

5       The full grounds of my decision for the conviction and sentence are set out below.

## Undisputed Background Facts

6       The Accused was arrested on 13 September 2016 at Tiong Bahru Plaza for suspected consumption of controlled drugs. He was found to be in possession of various items including one “Pall Mall” cigarette box (“the Cigarette Box”)[^1] containing one burnt aluminium foil[^2] wrapped around a TOTO betting slip[^3] with residue. The Accused was later brought back to the Police Cantonment Complex (“the PCC”) for further investigations, and a statement was recorded from the Accused. The statement contained admissions in relation to the Consumption Charge and the Drug Utensils Charge. Two bottles of the Accused’s urine samples were collected and sent to Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Upon analysis by two HSA analysts, the Accused’s urine samples were found to contain morphine.

## Case for the Prosecution

7       The Prosecution called a total of 21 witnesses to give evidence at the trial. These included 9 witnesses who had also testified at an ancillary hearing that was held pursuant to a challenge by the Accused regarding the recording of one of his statements. The key evidence of the Prosecution witnesses are summarised below.

### Arrest, Search and Seizure of the Accused

8       Three arresting officers gave evidence on the arrest of the Accused:

> (a)     PW1 – Station Inspector Ram Rohitashwa Tiwary (“SI Ram”)

> (b)     PW2 – Sergeant Lee Yen Ting (“W/SGT Lee”)

> (c)     PW3 – Staff Sergeant (Reservist) Douglas Mok (“SSGT Mok”)

9       SI Ram testified that on the 13 September 2016, he was patrolling Tiong Bahru Plaza when he stopped the Accused to ask for his particulars. He did a scan and found out that the Accused was wanted by the Traffic Police as well as by the Warrant Enforcement Unit. After the screening, SI Ram handcuffed the Accused and placed him under arrest. SI Ram checked the Accused’s pockets to ensure that he did not have any weapons on him. During the check, SI Ram discovered the “Pall Mall” cigarette box in the Accused’s pants pocket which contained a rolled up TOTO slip as well as an aluminium foil with some stains on it. As he did not wish to alarm the Accused, SI Ram placed them back into his pocket.[^4] The Accused was then brought back to the PCC, where the items were seized and SI Ram lodged a police report.[^5] During the arrest, SI Ram testified that the Accused was calm and behaving very normally.[^6]

10     W/SGT Lee and SSGT Mok were performing patrol duties with SI Ram on the 13 September 2016. W/SGT had assisted SI Ram in conducting screening of the Accused. At the PCC, she had assisted in sealing the exhibits into a seizure polymer bag. W/SGT Lee testified that the Accused remained calm even after he was handcuffed, and appeared to look like he knew he was going to be arrested.[^7] SSGMT Mok testified that during the arrest of the Accused, the Accused was compliant and did not put up any form of resistance.[^8]

### HSA Certificates and Analysis of Urine Samples

11     Ms Goh Mei Ling Evelyn (“Ms Goh”) was the analyst of the HSA certificate dated 16 September 2016.[^9] Ms Goh testified that the amount of morphine found in the Accused’s urine sample was 2.5 micrograms per millilitre of urine, which was higher than the cut-off of 0.5 micrograms per millilitre of urine for a positive certificate to be issued.[^10]

12     Ms Chan Si Jia (“Ms Chan”) was the analyst of the HSA certificate dated 19 September 2016.[^11] Ms Chan testified that the amount of morphine found in the Accused’s urine sample was 2.3 micrograms per millilitre of urine, which was higher than the cut-off of 0.5 micrograms per millilitre of urine for a positive certificate to be issued.[^12]

13     Both Ms Goh and Ms Chan testified that the morphine found in the urine sample of the Accused was consistent with the consumption of diamorphine (“heroin”).

### The Accused’s Statement

14     At the PCC, Senior Staff Sergeant Ravichandran (“SSGT Ravichandran”) took a statement from the Accused[^13] recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) dated 13 September 2016 at 7.20PM (“the Long Statement”). In his Long Statement, the Accused admitted to committing the offences disclosed in the Consumption Charge and the Drug Utensils Charge. The key details of the Long Statement are set out below:

> (a)     At paragraph 5 of the Long Statement, the Accused stated that he did smoke “Heroin” and “Ice”. He had been smoking “Heroin” and “Ice” since 2013 on an “on-and-off” basis. He smoked “Heroin” and “Ice” by using the chasing dragon method. He would pour some “Heroin” and “Ice” on top of the aluminium foil, after which he would use a lighter to light underneath the foil. When smoke is observed to be coming out from the foil, the Accused would use a rolled up TOTO betting slip to inhale the smoke. The Accused stated that the last time he smoke one straw of “Heroin” at one go was on 13 September 2016 in the toilet of his house. He would normally smoke “Heroin” and “Ice” alone.

> (b)     At paragraph 7 of the Long Statement, the Accused referred to the “Pall Mall” cigarette box containing one burnt aluminium foil wrapped around a TOTO betting slip with residue which was found in his left front pants pocket by the police officer during arrest. The Accused explained that the “Pall Mall” cigarette box belonged to him. He would use the burnt aluminium foil to pour the “Heroin” and “Ice” and use the TOTO betting slip with residue to inhale the smoke coming out from the “Heroin” and “Ice”.

15     The Defence challenged the admissibility of the Long Statement at trial. As a result, an ancillary hearing (“the Ancillary Hearing”) was held to determine the admissibility of the statement. At the conclusion of the Ancillary Hearing, I found that the Long Statement was given by the Accused voluntarily and admitted it into evidence.

16     Following the ruling that the Long Statement was admitted as evidence, SSGT Ravichandran was recalled by the Prosecution to give evidence in respect of the weight to be placed on the statement:

> (a)     SSGT Ravichandran explained that the statement was recorded in narrative form where he would ask the Accused a sequence of questions of the event and put the answers in paragraphs.[^14] When the series of questions were posed to the Accused, the Accused had no issues understanding the questions.[^15]

> (b)     After the statement was recorded, SSGT Ravichandran printed out the statement and read the statement back to the Accused who appended his signature at the end of the statement. Amendments made within the statement would also be acknowledged by the Accused by way of his signature.[^16]

> (c)     SSGT Ravichandran explained that an amendment was made to the time of the recording of the statement because the Accused had originally recorded the statement in Word format, and had thereafter put it into the system for the statement to be generated. Thus, when the statement was printed out, the timing showed “8.47PM” even though the recording of the statement had started earlier at 1920 hours.[^17]

## The Ancillary Hearing

17     The Defence argued that the Long Statement was not voluntarily procured on the basis that the Accused was threatened, offered inducements and promises by the recorder before and during the recording of the statement. The Accused also raised allegations that he was put in an oppressive environment prior to the recording of the Long Statement.

### Accused’s Evidence during the Ancillary Hearing

18     At the Ancillary Hearing, the Accused, represented by the Defence Counsel, raised a host of allegations in relation to various threats, promises and inducements allegedly made by SSGT Ravichandran, the arresting officers and/or the escorting officers before and during the recording of the Long Statement.

19     The following allegations were levelled against SSGT Ravichandran while SSGT Ravichandran was being cross-examined at the Ancillary Hearing:

> (a)     SSGT Ravichandran had, during a conversation prior to the commencement of the recording of the Long Statement, told the Accused that he was facing a “very minor charge” with a maximum of one year imprisonment term. All that the Accused had to do was to “admit” and he would be given bail thereafter.[^18]

> (b)     The Accused was in a “traumatised state” and was not prepared to give his statement. When he had signed on the Long Statement, he was “not ready to sign” and was not in a “proper state of mind”.[^19]

20     Moreover, the Accused levelled the following allegations against SSGT Ravichandran when the Accused himself was giving his evidence-in-chief at the Ancillary Hearing:

> (a)     The Accused was “mouth-shut” and in “shock” and he was not able to reply to the questions of SSGT Ravichandran properly. The Accused said that SSGT Ravichandran had told him “If you cooperate with us, you’ll be out on bail”.[^20] As a result, the Accused was eagerly looking forward to the bail, and he was confident that he was going to be out soon. Throughout the entire statement, he was not in a clear state of mind.[^21]

> (b)     The Accused was seeking the assistance of one of his “fellow officers” from CNB for whom he worked as a “source”. The Accused told the Court that SSGT Ravichandran had told him that he would not be able to see him until the statement was completed.[^22]

21     Lastly, the Accused raised the following issues when the Accused was being questioned under cross-examination:

> (a)     The Accused was told by the arresting officers at Tiong Bahru Plaza that he was facing a traffic offence and that he would be granted bail.[^23] The Accused could not recall which of the three arresting officer had told him this.[^24]

> (b)     The Accused recounted that he was feeling very distressed and in trauma at the time when his urine sample was being taken. He recounted that his tobacco packet was “taken out” which had made him panic because it did not belong to him.[^25]

> (c)     The Accused informed the escorting officers that he was in distress and trauma and there were some doctor that visited him in the lock-up.[^26] The Accused was very disturbed and screamed crazily when he was at the lock-up asking for help.[^27]

> (d)     The Accused also stated that he was crying when he was having the conversation with the recording officer SSGT Ravichandran. However, the Accused admitted that he had not told his lawyer about the fact that he was crying during the recording of the statement.[^28]

22     The Accused subsequently confirmed to have remembered that the statement was recorded in an office in a cubicle. After the statement was recorded, SSGT Ravichandran had printed the document in hardcopy and read the statement back to him in English. The Accused stated that his mind did not absorb what was being read as he was eager to make an urgent call and getting out. He was not paying attention.[^29]

### Prosecution’s Evidence during the Ancillary Hearing

23     At the Ancillary Hearing, the Prosecution called a total of 9 witnesses. The key evidence adduced by the Prosecution during the Ancillary Hearing is summarised below.

24     SSGT Ravichandran had denied all the allegations that were put to him by the Defence Counsel during cross-examination.[^30] He also denied spending a substantial amount of time with the Accused before commencing the recording of the Long Statement.[^31] He testified that he only spent about five minutes interviewing the Accused in order to establish that he was recording the statement from the correct person.[^32]

25     Station Inspector Suhaimi bin Senin (“SI Suhaimi”), together with Mohd Fareed bin Assan Mohd (“SC Fareed”), had escorted the Accused to procure his urine samples on 13 September 2016. SI Suhaimi testified that on that day, he asked the Accused to choose one master bottle from one box of containers and two small bottles from another box of containers. He then escorted the Accused to the toilet and asked him to urinate inside the master bottle. Subsequently, the Accused was asked to transfer the urine in the master bottle to the two smaller bottles. The Accused was then escorted to the holding bay.[^33] SI Suhaimi confirmed that the Accused did not raise any complaints during the urine procurement process.[^34]

26     SSGT James Quak Tiong Beng (“SSGT James”) was the duty urine escorting officer at the PCC lock-up. On 13 September 2016, SSGT James escorted the Accused to Supervision “A”, CNB side, to do the urine test.[^35] The procedure was for him to pick up the Accused from the holding bay and put the grip restraint on the Accused. Thereafter, the Accused would be escorted to Supervision “A” for the urine test. After the test is carried out, SSGT James would bring the urine test result slip back to the regional lock-up.[^36]

27     Dr Wong Kia Boon (“Dr Wong”) examined the Accused at the lock-up as stated in the medical report dated 1 March 2018.[^37] The medical examination took place on the 13 September 2016 in the afternoon at 3.50PM at the Central Police lock-up. Based on the report, the Accused had a significant past medical history of chronic lower back pain secondary to slipped disc. The Accused complained of lower back pain or flexion on his back. He denied any problems with passing urine and bowel movement. Dr Wong explained this was relevant to ensure that the pre-existing problem of a slipped disc does not belong to the worst category where his bowel and bladder functions would be affected.[^38] The Accused was also assessed by Dr Wong to be well, which was explained to mean that the Accused was not in severe distress.[^39]

28     Dr Wong also conducted a leg raise test on the Accused to assess the severity of the Accused’s condition. The result was that the Accused’s right leg could be raised to 50 degrees, while the Accused’s left leg could be raised to 45 degrees.[^40] Dr Wong testified under cross-examination that this restriction was not so severe as compared to only 10 to 20 degrees. He did not recall that the Accused had screamed in pain, although he acknowledged that pain was a common presentation of such cases.[^41]

### Court’s Finding at the end of the Ancillary Hearing

29     The applicable law regarding the admissibility of an accused’s statement is stated in s 258 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”). The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular Accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\]. Both the objective and the subjective components must be present before a statement could be excluded on the ground that it was not voluntarily made: _Lim Thian Lai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 319</span> at \[14\].

30     The burden of proof is on the Prosecution to satisfy beyond reasonable doubt that the statement given by the Accused was made without threat, inducement, promise or any form of oppression: _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\]. Having regard to the evidence adduced during the Ancillary Hearing, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Long Statement was voluntarily given by the Accused.

31     First, in relation to the allegations made against SSGT Ravichandran, I did not find any of these to be credible or truthful. The Accused displayed a clear tendency to embellish his evidence and to make new allegations on the fly. Having observed and heard the Accused in Court, I did not find the Accused to be a truthful witness. In contrast, I found SSGT Ravichandran’s evidence to be simple and straightforward. He had steadfastly denied the allegations made against him by the Accused. On the facts, there was no evidence which disclosed any reason for him to lie or frame the Accused. I also noted that SSGT Ravichandran was merely the recording officer of the Long Statement, and was not the investigating officer of the case.

32     Second, with regard to allegations made against the arresting officers, the Accused claimed that he was told he was facing a traffic charge and would be granted bail. This allegation by the Accused was simply incredulous and hard to believe, given the circumstances under which he was arrested and the items found on him. Furthermore, Counsel had not put this allegation to any of the arresting officers when they were giving their evidence. I also find that it was convenient and self-serving for the Accused to have forgotten which of the three arresting officers had allegedly provided the inducement.[^42] The relevant witnesses were therefore not given the opportunity to respond these allegations, and the Prosecution was consequently denied the opportunity to call the appropriate rebuttal witnesses. Accordingly, I rejected these allegations.

33     Third, the Accused had claimed that he was traumatised, disturbed, screaming and in pain. These were alarming claims which, if taken to be true, would have meant that the Accused was in no condition at all to have given any statement. However, the Accused had answered in cross-examination prior to the recording of the Long Statement that he was not in distress and did not experience any trauma. Up until the point before the recording of the Long Statement, when the Accused was conversing with SSGT Ravichandran, there was nothing amiss, nor were there any signs showing that the Accused was traumatised or disturbed. The Accused himself admitted that when SSGT Ravichandran asked him if he was okay or alright to give the statement on 13 September 2016, he had answered that he was alright to give the statement.[^43]

34     Fourth, on the allegation that the Accused screamed “crazily” while he was in the lock-up, prior to the recording of the Long Statement, I similarly did not find this to be true. According to the medical report prepared by Dr Wong, it was stated that the Accused was well. Dr Wong explained this in Court to mean that the Accused was not in severe distress.[^44] Based on Dr Wong’s testimony in Court, he could not recall if the Accused had screamed in pain although pain was not uncommon as part of the medical examination.[^45] If the Accused’s claim were to be true, this would certainly have been picked up by a observant and trained doctor or even any of the escorting officers.

35     Finally, I did not find merit in the Defence submission that the evidence was suppressed in relation to how the Accused was in physical pain and needed medical attention whilst in custody.[^46] There was no particular inference to be drawn, based on the fact that the witnesses could not particularly recall whether the Accused had been in a wheelchair. There was also no objective evidence to suggest that the pain, if any, experienced by the Accused was such as to have warranted exceptional attention. The only evidence on the facts was the Accused’s own words.

36     Considering the evidence as a whole, I found that the failure of the Accused to keep a straight and coherent account regarding his allegations, had severely undermined the credibility of his testimony. He had no qualms in raising eleventh-hour allegations, completely unsupported by any credible evidence. I could not also accept the Accused’s constantly shifting and evolving testimony in view of the consistent and corroborated evidence of the other Prosecution witnesses who had testified at the Ancillary Hearing.

37     Therefore, at the end of the Ancillary Hearing, I was satisfied that the Long Statement recorded by SSGT Ravichandran was given voluntarily by the Accused. I did not find that there were any objective threats, inducements or promises given to the Accused. Neither was the Accused put in an oppressive environment, prior to the recording of the Long Statement. The Long Statement was accordingly admitted into evidence.[^47]

## Case for the Defence

38     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the Accused on both charges. Accordingly, the Accused was called to enter his defence. The Accused elected to take the stand and to give evidence from the witness box.

39     The Accused testified that he lived with his elder sister and her four children. However, during the period in September 2016 when he was arrested, he was putting up at a friend’s place as he was aware that he was issued a warrant of arrest for traffic offences, and had wanted to stay away from his residence. As such, he lived in a one-room apartment in Bukit Ho Swee with three others.[^48]

40     The Accused did not know much of the background of his three roommates, and did not associate himself much with them. He would stay in his room, and was only back in the apartment late at night after 11PM and in the morning before 9AM.[^49] The three other roommates would stay awake all night, smoking and chatting.[^50] The Accused had a suspicion that they were smoking heroin based on the smell of the room and the roommates’ suspicious behaviour.[^51]

### Possession of drug utensils

41     In relation to the Drug Utensils charge, the Accused’s defence was a simple and straightforward one. The Accused’s position was that the cigarette box did not belong to the Accused but to his three roommates. According to the Accused, the packet of cigarette was shared amongst the roommates.[^52] The Accused did not know that the TOTO slip and aluminium foil were inside the cigarette box, and that he was not the one who had put them inside the cigarette box.[^53]

42     The Defence highlighted that the Accused had displayed a calm demeanour when he was being arrested, and argued that the Accused would not have remained calm when arrested and questioned if the Accused had indeed known that he possessed the drug utensils for the purpose of consumption.[^54] According to the Defence, the Accused had no idea that he had taken the packet of cigarettes which contain the drug utensils.[^55]

### Presence of morphine in urine samples

43     As for the Consumption Charge, the Defence’s case comprised two main defences:

> (a)     First, the Defence argued that the presence of morphine in the Accused’s urine was possibly caused by the consumption of cough mixture consumed by the Accused which contains codeine (“the Medication Defence”).[^56]

> (b)     Second, the Defence argued that the Accused had inhaled secondary heroin smoke when he resided with three other roommates at the one-room flat in Bukit Ho Swee (“the Passive Inhalation Defence”).[^57]

44     The Defence submitted that there was a scientific possibility that the morphine in the Accused’s urine samples may have resulted from consumption of the cough syrup.[^58] The Defence relied on a report prepared by Dr Joseph Samuel Bertino (“Dr Bertino”),[^59] which concluded that the presence of morphine (and small amounts of codeine) in the urine sample of the Accused is most likely due to the ingestion of codeine-containing cough syrup prior to the arrest of the Accused.[^60]

45     The Defence further submitted that there was the scientific possibility that traces of morphine could be found in his urine because of passive inhalation.[^61] The Defence highlighted the point in Dr Bertino’s report which stated that the presence of morphine in the urine sample of the Accused could be due to exposure to second-hand smoke or exposure third-hand due to touching contaminated surfaces and skin absorption or oral ingestion of opiates.[^62]

## Analysis and Court’s Findings

46     At the outset, I placed considerable weight on the Accused’s Long Statement. I found SSGT Ravichandran to be a truthful and reliable witness. He was only tasked with the role of recording the Long Statement from the Accused. I could find no credible reason why an officer with 20 years’ of experience would falsely implicate an Accused, when he was not even the investigating officer of the case.

47     In addition, I noted that some of the allegations levelled by the Accused against SSGT Ravichandran were only raised when the Accused was being cross-examined. For strange reasons best known to only to the Accused, he had not raise those allegations during his own examination-in-chief. Neither did the Accused raise these allegations in the two statements recorded under s 23 of the CPC (“the Cautioned Statements”).[^63] In my view, these allegations were more likely desperate afterthoughts raised at trial in a bid to discredit what he himself had stated.

48     Looking at the contents of the Long Statement, I noted that some of the information, such as where he bought the heroin from and when was the last time he bought it, could only have come from the Accused himself. The Accused had also provided specific details as to how he had consumed the heroin with the items found on him. Thus, I found that the statement which was confirmed and signed by the Accused himself had accurately recorded the circumstances surrounding the offence and contained that ring of truth.

### The Drug Utensils Charge

49     For the Drug Utensils Charge, the Accused’s main defence was merely one of bare denial. In his Long Statement, the Accused admitted that the drug utensils belonged to him. He even provided details as to how the utensils were used for the consumption of heroin and ICE – the burnt aluminium foil was used to pour the heroin and ICE, and the TOTO betting slip with residue was used to inhale the smoke from the heroin and ICE.[^64]

50     No satisfactory explanation was given as to why his subsequent claim that the drug utensils belonged to his roommates should be believed. The Accused did not call any of his roommates to testify in his defence. I did not find his calm demeanour during the arrest to be indicative in any way that he was innocent. If anything, I found the Accused’s calm demeanour unusual for a person who was found with incriminating items that did not truly belong to him. In the absence of any objective or corroborative evidence, I found that the drug utensils did belong to the Accused and intended to be used for the consumption of morphine. I was therefore satisfied that the Drug Utensils Charge against the Accused had been made out by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.

### The Consumption Charge

51     For the Consumption Charge, the starting point was that the two HSA certificates[^65] in respect of the Accused’s urine samples which tested positive for morphine, triggered the presumption under s 22 of the MDA. The burden of proof fell on the Accused to rebut, on a balance of probabilities, the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of the Consumption Charge. A vague and uncorroborated allegation that the accused consumed medication would be insufficient to rebut the presumption: _Yusran bin Yusoff v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 74</span> at \[5\]. A commonly-used defence should be approached with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence: _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> at \[15\].

#### Medication Defence

52     I turn next to the other defences. The Accused’s Medication Defence that he had consumed cough mixture prior to his arrest, was nothing more than belated vague assertions unsupported by any credible evidence. The Accused did not produce any prescription slip showing that he was prescribed any cough mixture. Neither did he produce the cough mixture containing codeine which he had purportedly consumed. With regard to the Accused’s claim that the cough mixture belonged to his roommates, the Accused did not call any of his roommate as witnesses to testify. I did not find it particularly convincing that the Accused had simply consumed a cough mixture that was lying around in the apartment, without knowing who it belonged to. Neither could the Accused state with any specificity how much cough mixture he had consumed.[^66]

53     The Accused had also specifically stated in his Long Statement that he was not on any traditional medication or prescribed medication. He stated that he only smoked heroin and ICE.[^67] In the Accused’s Cautioned Statements,[^68] his only defence was that his urine test was positive because of his three roommates who used the drug utensils. No mention was made that he had consumed codeine cough mixtures. Both the two Cautioned Statements were recorded by an entirely different CNB Officer, namely ASP Koh Yi Wen (“ASP Koh”), whom the Accused had not made any allegations against regarding the accuracy of recording. There was no reasonable explanation for the Accused to have failed to raise his Medication Defence in both of his Cautioned Statements. The irresistible inference therefore was that the Accused had fabricated the Medication Defence as a belated afterthought during the trial process. As the Accused had failed to mention the Medication Defence which he is now relying upon at trial and which he reasonably ought to have mentioned to ASP Koh, I drew the appropriate adverse inferences in accordance with s 261(1) of the CPC.

54     As for the Expert report which the Defence relied on, I did not attach much weight to the presumptive conclusion that the presence of morphine in the Accused’s urine samples was “most likely” due to the ingestion of cough syrup containing codeine. Dr Bertino conceded under cross-examination that he had not analysed the alleged cough syrup consumed by the Accused. He also did not know how much of the cough syrup was purportedly consumed by the Accused.[^69] His conclusion was therefore based on the Accused’s own assertion to him of having consumed cough syrup prior to the arrest, for which no credible evidence has been tendered in court.

#### Passive Inhalation Defence

55     The Accused’s Passive Inhalation Defence was also a bare assertion that was largely speculative. To begin with, none of the roommates were called by the Accused to testify. In his examination-in-chief, the Accused testified that his roommates “might have been consuming something unlawful” which was “most likely” heroin.[^70] Under cross-examination, the Accused conceded that he had only smelled his roommates smoking cigarettes and there was little basis to suspect that they were smoking anything other than cigarettes.[^71] From these answers, it was abundantly clear that it was the Accused’s own conjecture that his room-mates were smoking “something unlawful”. In the absence of credible evidence, I rejected the Accused’s tepid and unconvincing assertions that they were smoking heroin.

56     Moving on to the Defence’s expert evidence, Dr Bertino’s report had concluded that the presence of morphine in the urine sample of the Accused “could be” due to exposure to second-hand smoke. I noted that this was by no means an affirmative or conclusive finding. Dr Bertino’s conclusion was stated in the report to have been premised on the assumption that the Accused was living with persons who “may have been” smoking heroin.

57     Under cross-examination by the DPP, it was revealed that the report had lacked the necessary foundational basis for a proper assessment of whether the presence of morphine in the Accused’s urine samples could have been due to the exposure to second hand smoke. Dr Bertino admitted that he did not know the number of people allegedly staying with the Accused, neither was he aware of the size of the flat as he had never seen what the flat looked like.[^72] He also further conceded that he did not know what was the ventilation conditions of the flat at that time, such as whether there was a fan that was turned on or off, or whether the windows were open or closed.[^73] No details were provided as to how long the Accused was in the presence of his roommates, or who may have been smoking heroin at the material time.[^74]

58     Moreover, I did not find the study relied on in Dr Bertino’s report (“the Goldberger study”)[^75] to be of particular assistance for the Accused’s Passive Inhalation Defence. The Goldberger Report was based mainly on a field study conducted in Afghanistan which produced 90% of the world’s opium at that particular time. There were also severable variables that affected the credibility of the study. In this regard, I agreed with the comments of the Prosecution’s expert witness, Ms Moy Hooi Yan (“Ms Moy”), in the HSA report dated 28 March 2019.[^76] To summarise, the Goldberger study was not a controlled study. No comparative data nor detailed analytical data on urine samples was provided. There was also no conclusive data on the conditions under which second-hand and third-hand exposure to smoke and contamination gave rise to positive urine test results for opiates.

59     Based on the reasons given above, I found that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA that he had consumed morphine. Neither the Medication Defence or the Passive Inhalation Defence could prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Accused had not consumed morphine. Therefore, I found the Accused guilty of the Consumption Charge.

60     For completeness, I did not give any merit to the Accused’s claim that he would be adversely affected for being found guilty as a registered confidential informer of the CNB. There was no evidence of any sort that was placed before the Court to prove his identity as a CNB informer.

> \*_Antecedents highlighted in grey form the basis of the LT1 punishment in the Consumption Charge_

62     The prescribed punishment for the LT1 Consumption Charge is a mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. The maximum punishment is seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The Accused could not be sentenced to caning as he had already passed the age of 50 years at the time of his conviction.

63     The prescribed punishment for the Drug Utensils Charge is a maximum imprisonment term of three years’ or a fine of $10,000 or both.

64     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of six years’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge. The Prosecution argued that the uplift of one year’s imprisonment was warranted as the Accused had not shown remorse by claiming trial, resulting in a long-drawn trial that spanned over two years. As a result of the delay, the Accused could no longer be caned since he had turned 51 as of 7 January 2020.[^77] For the Drug Utensils Charge, the Prosecution submitted that the usual tariff for the offence is four to six months’ imprisonment. For the same reasons of a lack of remorse, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment which was on the higher end of the tariff was warranted.[^78] The Prosecution had no objections to run both sentences concurrently.[^79]

65     The Defence submitted that the Accused had led a clean slate for 21 years. Therefore, the Defence urged the Court to impose the mandatory minimum of five years’ imprisonment for the Drug Consumption charge and 4 months imprisonment for the Drug Utensils charge, with both sentences to run concurrently.[^80]

66     In deciding on the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I noted that the Accused’s drug-related antecedents were rather dated. While the trial did take some time to complete, there was a significant period of time spent in obtaining the services of the expert witness, which was the prerogative of the Accused. I therefore did not hold the fact the Accused had claimed trial to be an aggravating factor that warranted an uplift of sentence.

67     Having considered all the circumstances of the offence, including the submissions by the Prosecution and the Defence, I took the view that the appropriate sentence would be to impose the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge. A sentence of four months’ imprisonment was imposed for the Drug Utensils Charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, giving a global sentence of five years’ imprisonment.

68     The Accused has applied for a stay of execution of the sentence of imprisonment. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
