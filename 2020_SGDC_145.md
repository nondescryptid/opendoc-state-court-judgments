Damages – Mitigation – Tort – Plaintiff failing to follow medical advice to undergo surgery for personal injuries – Plaintiff claiming future medical expenses in respect of worsened condition

26 June 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       The plaintiff is a Senior Lead Technician at Sembcorp Industries Ltd. On 21 April 2015, he was involved in a motor accident with the defendant in which he suffered property damage and personal injury. By consent, the parties recorded interlocutory judgment for the defendant to pay the plaintiff 90% of the damages to be assessed. They also agreed pursuant to s 23 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) that the District Court would have jurisdiction to hear and try these proceedings notwithstanding that the amount claimed herein exceeds the District Court Limit of $250,000.[^1]

2       During the assessment of damages, the parties reached agreement on all heads of claim for property damage and some heads of claim for personal injury. At 100% liability, the quantum of these agreed heads of claim totals $97,536.98. The heads of claim for which damages remain to be assessed are: (a) pain and suffering for fractures to both wrists; (b) future medical expenses for fractures to both wrists; and (c) future medical expenses for a hip injury. For these heads of claim, the plaintiff seeks $154,148.50 for the wrist fractures and $8,000.00 for the hip injury. The defendant submits that only $43,000.00 should be awarded for the wrist fractures and makes no submission on the hip injury. The detailed positions of the parties are tabulated in an Annex to this judgment.

## Factual background

3       The impact of the accident threw the plaintiff off the motorcycle that he had been riding. An ambulance was called, and the plaintiff was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”). There, he was diagnosed with a fracture in his right hip (_ie_, femur) and an intra-articular fracture in each of his wrists. This is set out in a medical report prepared by Dr Jeffery Tan Gek Meng, who was the last treating doctor of the plaintiff at KTPH[^2] and who gave expert evidence for the plaintiff in these proceedings.[^3]

> Segmental right femur shaft fracture with right intertrochanteric fracture.

> Bilateral displaced distal radius fracture (closed). Left side – intra-articular with long segment of comminution over metaphysis and proximal radial shaft. Right side – intra-articular.

4       An intra-articular fracture is a fracture of a bone where the fracture breaks the otherwise smooth surface of a joint, which is the head of the bone and where the bone meets other bones. A joint is like a hinge of a door, with the bones the arms of the hinge.[^4] Cartilage lies between the bones and operates as a lubricant as the bones move against each other as the joint is used. By breaking the surface of the joint, an intra-articular fracture damages the cartilage between the bones. Over time, if the fracture remains uncorrected, the cartilage will wear out and the bones will become damaged as they move against each other.

5       The intra-articular fractures in the wrists of the plaintiff extended to his distal radius ulna (“DRU”) joints, where the radius bone and the ulna bone in each forearm meet at the wrist. Surgery was performed to re-align the fractured bones in each wrist (_ie_, open reduction internal fixation) and implant a metal plate to hold the bones together (_ie_, plating).[^5] This surgery was done from the palm (_ie_, volar) side of the wrist.[^6] For the left wrist, which remained unstable, wires were inserted to hold the DRUJ together, with further protection provided through a wrist splint.[^7] The post-operative recovery was uneventful and the plaintiff was discharged form KTPH on 30 April 2015.[^8]

> A second stage Open reduction internal fixation of the bilateral distal radius fractures was done on 28/04/15 using volar plating. The left DRUJ was unstable on stress test and 2 K wires were used to pin the DRUJ. The left wrist was protected in a backslab and changed to a resting wrist splint.

### Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion

6       On 5 November 2015, the plaintiff consulted a private specialist, Dr Lim Beng Hai, who also gave expert evidence for the plaintiff in these proceedings. Dr Lim observed that the wrist fractures had re-united, but that there were osteoarthritic degenerative changes in both DRUJs as revealed in a radiological scan (the “2015 X-Ray”). This osteoarthritis produced pain whenever the wrists were moved. Dr Lim advised the plaintiff to undergo surgery to remove the wrist implants, address the osteoarthritis, and reconstruct the wrists (“Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion”).[^9] Dr Lim estimated that such surgery and the necessary follow-up therapy would cost $78,570.10.[^10]

> Padzul fractures had united but he has the following problems

> Both the distal radius ulnar joint DRUJ showed radiological evidences of osteoarthritis. This results in pain on motion of the wrist.

> He will need the following

>> Right Wrist

>>> Removal of implant

>>> Ulnar head replacement

>> Left wrist

>>> Removal of implant

>>> Corrective osteotomy of the left distal radius

>>> DRUJ soft tissue arthroplasty with a slip of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon

>>> Repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC)

7       The plaintiff did not undergo the surgery as advised in Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion, and the implants remained “_in situ_”.[^11]

### Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion

8       On 21 November 2016, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Peter Lee Yew Cheng, who gave expert evidence for the defendant in these proceedings. Dr Lee opined that the wrist fractures had re-united with “good alignment” but that the osteoarthritis would worsen over time. He added that the wrist fractures had caused some “loss of function in the forearm and wrists \[that\] will remain permanently”. He concluded that the wrist implants required removal and that the surgery to do so would cost $6,000. He added that surgery to reconstruct the wrists to alleviate the pain and restore wrist movement would cost $20,000.00–$30,000.00 for each wrist. Dr Lim also opined that the hip implant required removal and that the cost of doing so was $8,000.00 (“Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion”).[^12]

> Padzul will require removal of the implants in the right femur in the future. The cost of removal of the implants is estimated to cost $8000/- at B1 rate at a Singapore government hospital.

> …

> The implants in both distal radius will require removal in the future. This can be done simultaneously or staged sequentially. The cost of removal of the implants at B1 rates in a Singapore government hospital is estimated at $6000/- per surgery. With progression of osteoarthritis in the wrists, Padzul may require further surgery to both wrists to alleviate pain and restore wrist movements. The cost of surgeries to the wrists is estimated at $20,000/~ to $30,000/~ for each wrist at B1 rates in a Singapore government hospital.

9       The plaintiff did not undergo the surgery as advised in Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion.

### Dr Tan’s 2017 Opinion

10     On 12 April 2017, the plaintiff had his final follow-up consultation at KTPH. Dr Tan noted that the plaintiff had stiffness and early osteoarthritic degeneration in both DRUJs. Dr Tan estimated that surgery to remove the implants would cost $6,000.00–$8,000.00, while surgery to address the osteoarthritis and reconstruct both wrists would cost a total of $16,000.00–$20,000.00. Dr Tan also noted that the plaintiff “is not keen for removal of implants” (“Dr Tan’s 2017 Opinion”).[^13]

> Serial radiographs showed all the fractures had united. The patient had stiffness in both wrist joints and the right hip, with decreased grip strength in his left wrist. Radiographs showed early degenerative changes in both distal radio-ulna joints. The patient is not keen for removal of implants.

> …

> If the patient were to opt for removal of implants in bilateral wrist in the near future, the estimated cost for removal of implants from both wrists is about $6000-$8000 at B1 rates …

> He may require future reconstructive surgeries in his wrist to address the distal radio-ulnar joint arthritis. These surgeries could be combined with removal of distal radius plates in future to reduce the need for multiple operations. The estimated cost for reconstructive surgeries to address both wrist distal radio-ulnar joint arthritis at B1 rates is about $16000~$20000.

### Dr Lim’s 2018 Opinion

11     On 12 April 2018, Dr Lim reviewed the plaintiff again and observed that the osteoarthritis in the DRUJs had worsened and that there had been malunion in the left distal radius bone. He advised the plaintiff to undergo surgery to correct the osteoarthritis, particularly in the left wrist, failing which radial carpal osteoarthritis would develop. He estimated that such surgeries would cost $86,659.30 for the left wrist and $49,808.50 for the right wrist (“Dr Lim’s 2018 Opinion”).[^14]

> X-rays done on April l2, 2018 showed arthritic changes at the distal radial ulnar which is more pronounced compared to November 2015.

> Osteoarthritis of the left distal radial ulnar joint with malunion of the distal radius. Malunion of distal radius needs correction otherwise it will develop radial carpal osteoarthritis.

> ln view of these changes, Padzul will need the following

>> Right Wrist

>>> Removal of the distal radius implant

>>> Soft tissue arthroplasty of the distal. radial ulnar joint using cadaveric tendon

>>> Immobilization of the distal radial ulnar joint for 4 weeks and removal of the K wire and start physiotherapy

>> Left Wrist (6 to 8 weeks after right wrist surgery)

>>> Removal of implant

>>> Excision of loose ulnar styloid

>>> Corrective osteotomy of the left distal radius \_

>>> Soft tissue arthroplasty of the distal radial ulnar joint using cadaveric tendon

>>> Immobilization of the distal radial ulnar joint for 4 weeks and removal of the K wire and start physiotherapy

## Parties’ positions

12     The plaintiff submits that his wrist fractures are serious and complex, and that he has suffered the malunion, osteoarthritis, and a permanently reduced range of motion.[^15] For the future medical expenses, he adopts the advice and cost estimate in Dr Lim’s 2018 Opinion for the wrist fractures, and the cost estimate in Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion for the hip injury.

13     The defendant responds that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his losses by failing to undergo the wrist surgeries as advised in Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion and Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion, which surgeries would have arrested the osteoarthritis in the wrists.[^16] The defendant adds that this failure exacerbated both the pain and suffering from the wrist injuries and complicated the extent of future medical treatment required to treat those (exacerbated) wrist injuries.[^17] The defendant thus submits that the plaintiff should receive only $15,000.00 for the pain and suffering and a further $28,000.00 for future medical expenses for the wrist fractures.[^18] The defendant makes no submission on the hip injury.

## Decision

14     The issue of mitigation of loss was not expressly pleaded by the defendant. As the plaintiff observes, citing _Yip Holdings Pte Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 131</span> at \[23\], “mitigation of damages as a defence must be properly pleaded and proved.” Such rules of pleading are a facet of natural justice that the court painstakingly upholds to ensure that the defendant knows the case that it must meet.

15     But the court will not descend blindly into technicalities when assessing the adequacy of pleadings. The ultimate purpose of pleadings is to define the scope of the issues arising for determination and to ensure that neither party is taken by surprise or deprived of the opportunity to adduce the relevant evidence (_Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd and others v Mok Wing Chong (Tan Keng Lin and others, third parties)_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 645</span> at \[61\]). Hence, “evidence given at trial can, where appropriate, overcome defects in the pleadings provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced” (_BOM v BOK and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 349</span> at \[40\]).

16     In my view, it is plain that the mitigation of damages was a live issue in these proceedings. The issue of whether the plaintiff should have undergone surgery as early as in 2015 to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists was raised by his own expert, Dr Lim (see Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion). It was also canvassed in the medical reports of his other expert, Dr Tan, and the expert for the defendant, Dr Lee. The defendant questioned Dr Lim extensively on the issue in cross-examination, and the plaintiff also asked Dr Lim about the same in re-examination. The plaintiff himself was asked about his failure to undergo surgery to remove the implants and reconstruct the wrists.[^19] The plaintiff can hardly have been taken by surprise or otherwise deprived of the opportunity to adduce relevant evidence. I will thus consider the issue of mitigation.

### Mitigation

17     The principle of mitigation of loss is uncontroversial: a claimant in an action in the tort of negligence must take all reasonable steps to mitigate his losses. If he neglects to do so, he will not be allowed to recover any loss that flows from his failure to so mitigate (see the observations of the House of Lords in _British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1912\] AC 673</span> at 689):

> The fundamental basis is thus compensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach; but this first principle is qualified by a second, which imposes on a plaintiff the duty of taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach, and debars him from claiming any part of the damage which is due to his neglect to take such steps.

18     Where an injured claimant fails to follow the advice of his doctors to undergo medical treatment, the court will in considering whether he has acted reasonably to mitigate his losses look at all the circumstances of the case, including especially the medical advice that had been provided to him. If the doctors advise the claimant to undergo a reasonable course of treatment that would give him a reasonable chance of recovery, he ought to follow the advice. If he does not do so without reasonable grounds, he will not be allowed to recover damages “in respect of a period extending after the projected time of recovery had that treatment been received” (_Ng Chee Wee v Tan Chin Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 54</span> (“_Ng Chee Wee_”) at \[24\], _per_ Vinodh Coomaraswamy JC). Further, a failure to follow medical advice to undergo medical treatment includes a failure to do so “fairly expeditiously” (_Karuppiah Nirmala v Singapore Bus Services Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 934</span> at \[28\], _per_ Judith Prakash J). An injured claimant who dawdles to the detriment of his condition in following medical advice will not be indulged by the court

19     The plaintiff submits that it was not unreasonable for him to decline to follow the advice to undergo surgery in or around November 2015 to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. He asserts that he wanted to do the procedure with Dr Lim (who specialises in hand reconstruction) and not with Dr Tan (who specialises in general orthopaedics). He adds that he lacked the funds to undergo the surgery at the relevant time.[^20]

20     Notably, the plaintiff does not dispute the soundness of the advice to undergo surgery in or around November 2015 to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. And in my view, it would be difficult for the plaintiff to do so when all his doctors, Dr Lim, Dr Lee, and Dr Tan, were in favour of the procedure. The suggestion by the plaintiff that he preferred to do the procedure with Dr Lim and not Dr Tan does not assist him, because Dr Lim had by 5 November 2015 advised the plaintiff to undergo (see Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion), and there is no objective evidence that the plaintiff sought to arrange such procedure with Dr Lim.

21     I do not accept that the plaintiff did not undergo the relevant surgery “fairly expeditiously” following Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion because he lacked the funds to do so. First, there is no contemporaneous evidence on the financial position of the plaintiff in November 2015. As recently as on 27 July 2017, when the plaintiff deposed his first affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he made no mention of any inability to afford such surgery even as he stated that he “intend to undergo the operations as soon as I receive compensation for my claim.”[^21] Second, even if the plaintiff had in November 2015 lacked the necessary funds, by November 2016, the defendant had consented to interlocutory judgment and Dr Lee had opined on the necessity of such surgery (see Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion). There is little reason why the plaintiff could not have sought assistance from the defendant for the surgery soon after. Third and most importantly, there is no evidence that the plaintiff would not have been able to undergo the surgery unless he paid for it _upfront_. The very evidence of the plaintiff is that he had been able to pay for his medical expenses _in arrears_, and that a substantial portion of his medical expenses have been covered by insurance and did not require out-of-pocket expenditure on his part.[^22]

> I have incurred medical expenses in the sum of $20,194.00 to date. Out of the $20,194.00 I have incurred, $6,953.46 was covered by the MediShield Life basic health insurance plan administered by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board.

22     This leaves me to conclude that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his duty to mitigate his loss by undergoing surgery on or around November 2015 to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. He will therefore be precluded from recovering damages “in respect of a period extending after the projected time of recovery had that treatment been received” (_Ng Chee Wee_ at \[24\]).

### Pain and suffering

23     It is undisputed that the plaintiff suffered a bilateral wrist fracture in his DRUJs and underwent “open reduction internal ﬁxation” surgery.[^23] Further, as Dr Lim’s 2018 Opinion sets out, the osteoarthritis in both wrists has worsened since the 2015 X-Ray and Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion. For the left wrist, there is a further complication of malunion in the left DRUJ that needs correction to avoid the development of radial carpal osteoarthritis.[^24]

24     Nevertheless, Dr Lim accepted that surgery in or around November 2015 to remove the implants and correct the osteoarthritis would have minimised the osteoarthritis in the wrists of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff in failing to undergo such surgery “made \[the\] damage worse”.[^25] For the right wrist, surgical replacement of the ulna head of the DRUJ would have caused the pain to settle down and reduced the loss of cartilage and the wearing out of the DRUJ. Back in 2015, some cartilage remained at the DRUJ,[^26] and a replacement of the ulna head would have substantially restored the functioning of the joint. By 2018, however, all the cartilage at the DRUJ had worn out,[^27] and merely changing the ulna head would be of little benefit.[^28] For the left wrist, surgical excision of the distal radius (_ie_, osteotomy) and reconstruction (_ie_, arthroplasty) of the DRUJ would have prevented the neighbouring set of joints (the radial carpal joint) from developing osteoarthritis. Without such a surgery, the movement of the damaged distal ulna joint against the radial carpal joint would wear out the radial carpal joint.[^29]

25     But Dr Lim also testified that the osteoarthritis in both wrists as seen in the 2015 X-Ray was caused by and did not pre-exist the accident. When it was put to Dr Lim that the osteoarthritis was caused by the physical labour performed by the plaintiff for his employer, Dr Lim disagreed and explained that the plaintiff is “clinically a young person and has no medical condition to suggest that he is prone to developing osteoarthritis.”[^30]

26     Dr Tan and Dr Lee broadly agreed with this assessment.[^31] Dr Lee gave evidence that the osteoarthritis had “progressed” between 2015 and 2018.[^32] Yet, Dr Lee candidly acknowledged that unlike Dr Lim, who specialised in hand and reconstructive surgery, his specialisation was orthopaedics with a focus on spinal and paediatric surgery.[^33] Dr Lee added that for patients with complex hand injuries, as was the case with the plaintiff, a general surgeon like him would usually refer the patient to a hand surgeon like Dr Lim.[^34]

27     Even so, the plaintiff resumed his employment after his discharge from KTPH on 30 April 2015 and has not returned to KTPH for follow-up therapy since 14 November 2017. There is also no evidence that Sembcorp had any issues with his work performance. Indeed, the plaintiff had received an increment in his basic salary from $4,155.00 to $4,615.00 after the accident, even as he states that the increment was made on a company-wide basis.[^35]

28     The _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (the “_Guidelines_”) at pp 36–37 prescribe damages of $6,000.00–$25,000.00 for pain and suffering for moderate to severe wrist fractures:

>   
| 

**(a) Severe and/or compound fractures of the distal radius and ulna in which extensive surgery is required**

There is severe restriction in the mobility of the wrist on a permanent basis resulting in a great loss of function. An award in the higher range is appropriate where complications, such as malunion and infection, arise during the recovery period and there is also a high risk of developing osteoarthritis in the future.

 | 

**$25,000–$32,000**

 |
| 

**(b) Moderately severe fractures of the distal radius or ulna**

Substantial recovery is achieved but there is significant permanent disability and considerable pain on a long-term basis that cannot be resolved despite treatment. There is considerable loss of function but the person is still able to cope with the activities of daily life although he is unlikely to return to his pre-trauma employment especially if it is a labour-intensive job requiring extensive use of his hands.

 | 

**$15,000–$25,000**

 |
| 

**(c) Moderate fractures of the distal radius and/or ulna**

Cases in this category are less severe than (b) above in that the person is able to regain substantial function of his wrist. However, his chances of being employed in his pre-trauma job (especially if it is a labour-intensive job requiring use of the hands) are reduced and it is unlikely that his condition will improve in the future.

 | 

**$6,000–$15,000**

 |

  
  

29     I assess damages for pain and suffering at $15,000 for the fracture in the left wrist and $10,000 for the fracture in the right wrist, based on the _Guidelines_ with a modest uplift for inflation since their publication in 2010 (see _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth (by his litigation representative Pang Choy Chun) v Yeo Chye Huat and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> at \[110\]). These figures are based on what would have been the likely condition of the plaintiff had he followed Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion to undergo surgery to remove the implants, address the osteoarthritic degeneration, and reconstruct his wrists. For the left wrist, the plaintiff would likely have achieved substantial recovery even if he would continue to experience some disability and pain in the long term from the osteoarthritis that was already manifest on the 2015 X-Ray. It is also likely that the plaintiff would not be suffering from the malunion and risk of radial carpal osteoarthritis set out in Dr Lim’s 2018 Opinion. For the right wrist, the plaintiff would likely have achieved a swift and very substantial recovery, with the replacement of the ulna head enabling him to use his right hand “immediately”. Further, this post-operative mobility in the right wrist would have offered an additional benefit: without it, a surgery on both wrists concurrently (instead of consecutively) would have been unviable for the plaintiff, who would have had both wrists immobilised at once. The mobility made viable such a concurrent surgery, thereby reducing post-operative recovery time.[^36]

### Future medical expenses

30     At the outset, the parties and all three experts used B1-ward rates at a government hospital as the basis for their positions on future medical expenses. I proceed on the same basis.

31     Having found that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his losses by following the advice in Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion, the plaintiff will not be able to recover damages “in respect of a period extending after the projected time of recovery had that treatment been received” (_Ng Chee Wee_ at \[24\]). In the context of future medical expenses, this must mean that where the condition of the plaintiff has deteriorated since his failure to follow the relevant medical advice, he will be entitled to recover only such expenses as he would have incurred had he followed the advice.

32     For the wrist fractures, had the plaintiff followed the advice in Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion “fairly expeditiously”, the cost of the prescribed treatment would have been $78,570.10 (see \[6\] above).[^37] At that time, both wrists could have been operated on concurrently rather than consecutively (see \[29\] above), with “considerable savings” in medical expenses.[^38]

33     The defendant relies on the Dr Tan’s 2017 Opinion to submit that such surgery at KTPH would have cost only $28,000.00: $8,000.00 to remove the implants in both wrists and a further $20,000.00 to reconstruct the wrists.[^39] I do not accept this submission. First, the defendant’s own expert, Dr Lee, has opined that the cost of the surgery is $6,000.00 to remove the implants and a further $20,000.00–$30,000.00 _per wrist_ to reconstruct the wrists (see Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion).[^40] This gives a total of up to $68,000.00, which is not far from the $78,570.10 in Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion. Second, the estimates in Dr Tan’s 2017 Opinion (and Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion) are not supported by any detailed explanation or cost breakdown, unlike that in Dr Lim’s 2015 Opinion. Third, Dr Lim as a hand surgeon is better placed than Dr Tan and Dr Lee, who are general surgeons, to opine on the cost of hand reconstruction surgery. As Dr Lee testified, general surgeons typically refer questions on hand reconstruction like those implicated in the case of the plaintiff to hand surgeons.[^41] I thus prefer the estimate of Dr Lim and assess damages for future medical expenses for the wrist fractures at $78,570.10.

34     For the hip injury, Dr Lee’s 2016 Opinion that states that the implant in the right femur requires removal and that the cost of the surgery to do so is $8,000.00.[^42] The defendant offers no submission to the contrary. I assess damages accordingly.

## Conclusion

35     For the reasons above, I assess damages as follows for the heads of claim that are in dispute (on a 100% basis):

> (a)     $25,000.00 for pain and suffering for the wrist fractures;

> (b)     $78,570.10 for future medical expenses for the wrist fractures;

> (c)     $8,000.00 for future medical expenses for the hip injury.

36     Adding these sums to the $97,536.98 that has been agreed between the parties for the other heads of claim gives a total quantum of damages of $209,107.08 (on a 100% basis).

37     On the 90% basis under the consent interlocutory judgment, the damages payable by the defendant to the plaintiff is thus **$188,196.37**.

38     I will hear the parties on the costs of these proceedings.
