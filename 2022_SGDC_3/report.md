Contracts – Contractual terms

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 45/2021/01.\]

3 January 2022

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction**[^1]**

1       This was the plaintiff’s claim for the balance payment for work done for the defendant on a construction project. It was also the defendant’s counterclaim for alleged overpayment on the contract between the parties.

2       Both the claim and the counterclaim were dismissed. At the trial, the claim was dismissed as the Court found the scope of the plaintiff’s work to be wider for the agreed price than what the plaintiff claimed it to be and the part payment made sufficed, given the poverty of evidence on the plaintiff’s part, even on a balance of probabilities. As for the counterclaim, it was also dismissed as it was the Court’s finding that the payment made was neither an advance or a goodwill payment. Further, there was also no evidence that the plaintiff breached the contract or that the defendant had to expend by deploying its own workers for the job.

3       The plaintiff being dissatisfied with the findings and decision of the Court in dismissing its claim against the defendant, the plaintiff lodged this appeal against this part of the decision. No appeal was lodged for the counterclaim.

## Facts

### The parties

4       The parties were Singapore-registered companies.

5       The plaintiff was in the business of providing manpower for cabling and cable infrastructure works, whilst the defendant was in the construction business as a specialist contractor for mechanical and electrical (“M&E”) works.

### The project and project owner

6       The project owner and developer was the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (“CAAS”). The project at Changi Airport was the ‘_Proposed Erection of One Block of 8 Storey Control Tower with Office at 1st Storey and M&E Facilities at 1st to 8th Storey. One Block of 2 Storey Ancillary Annex Building with M&E Facilities. Renovation Works to 6th to 8th Storey of Existing RSAF Building on Lot PT 03638P MK31 & Provision of Cabling & Cable Infrastructure Works within Runway 3_’ (“the Project”).

### The relationship between the parties and others

7       CAAS engaged SCB Building Construction Pte Ltd (“SCB”) as its main contractor. SCB’s subcontractor for M&E works was Primeflux Engineering Pte Ltd (“Primeflux”). Primeflux then subcontracted to Vista Construction and Engineering Pte Ltd (“Vista”) the electrical works for the 8-Storey Control Tower (“R3 Tower”).[^2] Of the works subcontracted to Vista, Vista appointed the defendant as its subcontractor for part of the works.[^3] The defendant subsequently engaged the plaintiff as its subcontractor for its tasks.

8       It was not in dispute that Vista’s scope of works was as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.98%"> <col width="53.4%"> <col width="27.62%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/N</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description of Works</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Value of Works</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Work Item 1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Electrical works at R3 Tower</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$ 160,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Work Item 2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Electrical works at Annex Building</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$ 72,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Work Item 3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Project co-ordination and supervision of the electrical works</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$ 18,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Work Item 4</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Supply of labour for MLAT cabling</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$ 15,000.00</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

9       Of the above four work items, Work Item 1 and Work Item 2 were the works that were subcontracted to the defendant. Due to the defendant’s stretched resources, the defendants engaged the plaintiffs as subcontractors to assist with the work.

10     This relationship between the parties can be graphically presented as follows:

CAAS

_Project owner_

↓

SCB

_Contractor for the Project_

↓

Primeflux

_for the mechanical and electrical works of the Project_

↓

Vista

_for the electrical works of the Project_,

_its supervision and co-ordination_,

_and to supply labour for the MLAT cabling_

↓

Defendant

_for the electrical works at R3 Tower and Annex Building_

↓

Plaintiff

_for the electrical works at R3 Tower only, or_

_for R3 Tower and Annex Building?_

### Background to the dispute

#### How the plaintiff came to be involved in the Project

11     The circumstance by which the plaintiff became involved in this project is not in dispute. In late April 2017, the defendant’s managing director, Mr Ong Hung Kwang (“Mr Johnny”) (DW2) mentioned to one Mr Mani Muthu (“Mr Muthu”) (PW5) that he was looking for subcontractors to carry out part of the defendant’s work. Mr Muthu then referred the job to the plaintiff.

12     By 12 May 2017, although there was no signed contract between the parties, but because the Project was long-delayed, the plaintiff’s workers started work on the Project. However, it was only on 1 June 2017 that there was any signed contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. On that day, Mr Muthu took instructions from the plaintiff’s director, Mr Manickam Nagarajan (“Mr Naga”) (PW2), and brought the plaintiff’s quotation for the subcontract works (“the Quotation”) for Mr Johnny to sign, and Mr Johnny did so.[^4] The signed Quotation therefore became the Subcontract that governed the parties’ relationship. The value of the Subcontract was S$160,000.

13     Both parties did not have issue with the Subcontract despite the later discovery that Mr Muthu neither represented the plaintiff nor the defendant. Mr Muthu was an employee of a company, Rytter (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Rytter”). However, as Rytter was apparently heavily saddled with projects then,[^5] Mr Muthu had conveyed Mr Johnny’s offer to Mr Naga. Mr Naga was Mr Muthu’s ex-employer. The plaintiff then had an arrangement with Rytter for Mr Muthu to still be part of the Project.

#### The termination of the contracts between the parties

14     On Saturday, 23 September 2017, the plaintiff was asked to stop reporting to work on Monday, 25 September 2017.[^6] The instructions were by Primeflux, who, on 25 September 2017, terminated its contract with Vista, who terminated its contract with the defendant and so, the defendant terminated its contract with the plaintiff.

15     Following the contractual terminations, it is uncontroverted that Primeflux approached the plaintiff directly, also on 25 September 2017, for a quote and to finish the job. As the plaintiff considered that that “would not be appropriate” since they had been working on the site,[^7] it was the plaintiff’s related company, Layan Management Pte Ltd (“Layan”), which took over the works and completed them.[^8]

16     As for the works that the plaintiff did for the defendant between June to September 2017, the plaintiff issued four progress claims to the defendant for payment. However, only the amount raised in Progress Claim No. 1 was paid. Even then, the defendant argued that it was advance payment or payment made on goodwill. This was therefore the subject of the defendant’s counterclaim in the present suit for a refund of the same from the plaintiff. As for the subsequent three progress claims, as no payments were made on them, the plaintiff’s claims before me were therefore in respect of Progress Claim Nos. 2, 3 and 4.

#### The adjudication application under the SOP Act

17     Prior to this case being lodged at the District Courts, the plaintiff had made an adjudication application under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA hearing”). At that SOPA hearing, the defendant took the position that the adjudicator had no jurisdiction since not all the contractual terms were in writing.[^9] This was despite the plaintiff arguing the circumstances that showed that there was an agreement between the parties. It appears that there was no determination on the claims in issue; according to the plaintiff’s Mr Naga (PW2)[^10] and its Operations Manager, Mr Tham Kwok Cheong (“Mr Tham”, also referred to as “Van” in some documents) (PW1),[^11] this was because the adjudicator’s ruling was that he/she only had jurisdiction over written contracts.

18     The plaintiff therefore brought this claim before the District Court.

### The four Progress Claims

19     As the plaintiff’s claims arose from the Progress Claims, it is pertinent to set these out in greater detail. The details of the four Progress Claims issued by the plaintiff were as follows:

20     For the amounts claimed under each Progress Claim, the plaintiff had included the charges for additional works.

## The parties’ cases

### On the scope of work

21     It was the plaintiff’s case that its appointment as the defendant’s subcontractor was to carry out only Work Item No. 1 (see: table at paragraph 8 above), that is, to do the electrical works at R3 Tower only. The plaintiff further understood the parties to have agreed that the value of their work was S$160,000. Should there be additional works or any variation of the works, these were to be additional costs.

22     It was the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s work at the value of S$160,000 was for electrical works at R3 Tower, _as well as_ for Annex Building, that is, Work Item No. 2 of Vista’s work items from Primeflux (see: table at paragraph 8).

23     So, while it was not in dispute which work items were awarded to the defendant by Vista, it was a subject of the dispute which work item/s of the defendant’s were subcontracted to the plaintiff.

### On the extent of the work completed

24     It was also the plaintiff’s case that 80% of the work had been completed before the plaintiff was asked to stop work on 25 September 2017. The plaintiff based this on the progress claims that Vista would have submitted to Primeflux for payment, which, according to the plaintiff’s understanding of the industry norm, Vista would have calculated and assessed, then submitted.[^16] This meant that the defendant would likewise have first submitted its progress claims to Vista before Vista submitted its claim.

25     It was not disputed that the defendant did receive payment from Vista for their works. However, the plaintiff had no evidence of its quantum since the same was not disclosed by the defendant, and the plaintiff’s application for specific discovery (DC/SUM 2038/2020) was dismissed with costs.

26     On the basis that the plaintiff did perform work for the defendant, the plaintiff raised the progress claims and argued that they should be paid.

27     According to the defendant, however – who had the help of an expert witness, a quantity surveyor – the value of the plaintiff’s work was only about S$9,021.08 (or S$9,652.56 with GST). On the works at R3, only 15% was completed.

28     Flowing from the above, as the defendant had paid the amount of S$23,364.52 upon being presented with Progress Claim No. 1, the defendant counterclaimed the amount paid in excess, that is, S$13,711.96, being S$23,364.52 minus S$9,652.56.

### On the deployment of workers, the Project delay and damages

29     The defendant also alleged that the plaintiff breached the Subcontract in that there was an inadequate number of workers deployed at the worksite when it should have been at least 10 workers.[^17] Also, that the plaintiff unilaterally stopped work without the defendant’s approval resulting in the defendant’s suffering a consequential loss of S$22,500. The defendant therefore also claimed this sum from the plaintiff for their alleged breach of contract.

30     The plaintiff argued that there was no term of the Subcontract that they had to deploy a stipulated number of workers on site. If there was, it was between Primeflux and Vista[^18] and not cascaded down to the subcontractors. In any case, the plaintiff’s position was that it had deployed sufficient workers since 8 to 16 workers were usually working at the site.

31     The plaintiff further argued that there was no stipulation of when the work was to be completed by and so, how could the works be considered delayed? (That there was no end-date for the Project was also admitted by the defendant’s managing director, Mr Johnny (DW2).[^19]) Further, that they must have done their work properly or to Primeflux’s satisfaction since Primeflux requested for the plaintiff’s workers to continue to work there when Primeflux terminated its contract with Vista. The workers then did so, deployed in the name of the plaintiff’s related company, Layan.

## Issues

### Issues addressed at the oral judgment

32     When I delivered my oral judgment, I addressed three main issues. These were –

> Issue 1:    What were the terms of the contract between the parties? Was it for the plaintiff to do electrical works just at R3 Tower, or did it also include the Annex Building;

> Issue 2:    What was the value of the work that the plaintiff actually completed; and

> Issue 3:    Whether there was a breach on the plaintiff’s part and so, for damages to be paid to the defendant for the plaintiff’s breach of contract. This issue stemmed from the counterclaim.

33     Issue 3 is not relevant for the present appeal as it focused on the defendant’s counterclaim which was dismissed. I understand that the defendant did not raise an appeal on the counterclaim. Therefore, for the purposes of completion only, I would give an abridged version of my determination on this issue.

34     The defendant had argued that it was a term of the contract – albeit not stipulated in writing – that the plaintiff was to deploy at least 10 workers to work onsite at all times. Because of the plaintiff’s failure to do so, the defendant was put to expense and loss in getting its own workers to work there. Consequently also, according to the defendant, the contract between Primeflux and Vista was terminated because of this. The contract’s termination cascaded down to the subcontracts between the various subcontractors.

35     It was the Court’s ruling that it was not a contractual term between the parties to deploy at least 10 workers onsite. The defendant had also failed to show that it deployed its workers there. This was also not the reason for the contract and subcontracts being terminated, since Primeflux subsequently engaged the plaintiff’s workers for the job, under Layan. The counterclaim was therefore dismissed.

### Issues for the plaintiff’s appeal

36     The issues for the plaintiff’s appeal therefore centred on the scope of the plaintiff’s work as subcontracted by the defendant; and the extent of the work done.

37     On this account, the first two issues remain alive on appeal:

> Issue 1:    The terms and scope of the plaintiff’s works; whether it covered the Annex Building; and

> Issue 2:    How much of the plaintiff’s work was completed.

## The Court’s determination

### Issue 1: What were the terms of contract between the parties? Did the plaintiff’s work scope include the Annex Building?

38     The more specific issue here is whether the plaintiff’s scope of work included the Annex Building. It is not disputed that the plaintiff was to do the work at the R3 Tower. The plaintiff claimed to have done so. In fact, the plaintiff’s four progress claims were for works done at the R3 Tower only. According to the defendant, however, because the plaintiff’s work scope covered the Annex Building and the plaintiff only did work at R3 Tower, the plaintiff had not completed their work scope. The defendant considered that the payment of S$23,364.52 made on the plaintiff’s Progress Claim 1 was already excess payment.

39     It is not disputed that the Quotation of 1 June 2017 was presented by the plaintiff to the defendant as a contract between them. The issue here is whether the document presented to Mr Johnny for his agreement and signature on the contractual terms was a one-page document[^20] or whether it was more than that, in that it included a modified version of “Vista’s Progress Claim” showing “the balance works to be carried \[out\]”.[^21]

40     The plaintiff argued that when the offer was first broached to the plaintiff to take on the job, Mr Johnny had given Mr Muthu the scope of works for R3. (According to the plaintiff, this would be a portion of Vista’s progress claim.) The same was shown to Mr Naga by Mr Muthu. Hence, when the Quotation was presented to Mr Johnny subsequently for Mr Johnny’s signature, the Quotation had included this document. As this document only showed works at R3 Tower, the parties must be taken to have agreed for the plaintiff to only do works at R3 Tower.

41     Mr Muthu was an important witness to recount to the Court what happened on that day when the proposal to take on the job was made to him. Sadly, Mr Muthu’s evidence was insufficient to persuade the Court on a balance of probabilities. Mr Muthu, in his affidavit,[^22] had deposed that he presented the Quotation together with Vista’s progress claim – or the subcontracted scope of work – to Mr Johnny to sign. However, during cross-examination, he agreed with defendant’s counsel that he only presented a one-page document for Mr Johnny to sign:[^23]

>   
| 

\[DC\]:

 | 

… Muthu, can you confirm, the---the document that you asked Johnny to sign is the---did not include the doc---the document exhibited from pages 308 to 312?

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Yes, yes.

 |
| 

\[DC\]:

 | 

So, just the---just the 1-page document?

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Because this was---referring to page 308 to 312, was already given to me previously, he had already given to me previously.

 |
| 

\[DC\]:

 | 

So, what you---so what you gave to Johnny is just that 1-page document at 307, right?

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

42     During re-examination, it was Mr Muthu’s evidence that he brought the whole set to Mr Johnny.[^24] When the Court clarified with Mr Muthu, his position changed again:[^25]

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

I want to clarify that. Earlier on, when you were asked, it was asked of you a few times, you said that you brought only 1 page to Mr. Johnny, but now you are saying that you brought the whole set?

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Your Honour, I cannot remember because---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Cannot remember?

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

at the start---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What, you cannot remember what you said just now? I’m telling you what you said.

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Your Honour, I may have given the entire set, Your Honour. I may have given, I cannot re---remember, I may have given the entire set, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

Because of the contradictory evidence, the Court allowed defendant’s Counsel’s request to further clarify. Mr Muthu then showed himself to be an unreliable witness:[^26]

>   
| 

\[DC\]:

 | 

… So, you---if you say---if you say you may have, that means you’re not sure, right? Is it---is it---do you accept that when you say you may have, that means you’re not sure whether you have given a whole set or an---or just a 1-page quotation.

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Yes. I’m not sure whether I gave the whole set or just 1 page.

 |
| 

\[DC\]:

 | 

So, there is also a possibility that you only gave just that 1 page.

 |
| 

\[PW5\]:

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

43     At other points, he contradicted himself.[^27] All in all, I have found it difficult to accept his testimony. The Court was not assisted, and unable to find in the plaintiff’s favour on this factual issue as to whether it was only the one-page or a set of documents that was presented to Mr Johnny for his signature.

44     This was important as what was stated on the face of the document[^28] was the project title which suggests that works were to be performed at both the R3 Tower and the Annex Building. The body of the document then provided –

> Subcontract work for Electrical (Lump Sum): $160,000.00

> \* (Additional work not included)

It therefore appeared to the Court, on a balance of probabilities, that the subcontract work for electrical at a lump sum of S$160,000 would be for both the R3 Interim Tower and the Annex Building.

45     Mr Muthu was even uncertain as to how he came by the drawings.[^29] Although there was a finding at the SOPA hearing at \[72b\] that the drawings were provided to Mr Muthu by Primeflux,[^30] this Court was not bound by that finding, as was also conceded by the defendant.

46     It also did not help the plaintiff’s position to argue that their workers never worked at Annex Building.[^31] Instead, it might even confirm the defendant’s position that the plaintiff failed to execute their obligation under the Subcontract to carry out works at the Annex Building.

47     The plaintiff further argued that by May 2017, the works at the Annex Building was completed.[^32] It therefore could not be that the plaintiff was contracted work when there were be no work there. While it was Mr Johnny’s evidence during cross-examination that the base work might have been completed, he also explained that there were variation works, touch-ups, and rectifications to be carried out.[^33]

48     It sufficed to say that there was no firm evidence before this court that Mr Muthu obtained Vista’s progress claim and that the same was submitted to Mr Johnny together with the Quotation document dated 1 June 2017. What was clear, however, is that Mr Johnny signed on and is taken to have agreed to paying for the plaintiff’s electrical works at S$160,000.

49     Apart from the poverty and contradictory nature of Mr Muthu’s testimony, the Court had to agree with the defendant’s counsel that if there was any ambiguity in the Quotation, it is trite law that the _contra proferentum_ rule would operate and the document be interpreted against the plaintiff who was the drafter of the document. If the plaintiff had taken the trouble to state the value of the contract, reference could and should also have been made to refer to any attachment. But there was nothing to suggest to the Court that it consisted of more than just that one page.

50     Although it was my holding that what was delivered to Mr Johnny for his signature was only just the one page, that is not to say that the parties did not come to any form of agreement on the scope of works. In fact, I suggested in my oral judgment that the agreement between the parties could also have included some oral agreements that electrical works were to be done. The title of the Quotation itself in fact covered the works at the Annex Building, which, if it were not, it would be incumbent upon the plaintiff – the drafter of the Quotation – to have qualified it in its Quotation. In plaintiff’s counsel’s submission, it was suggested that it was only logical for Vista’s Progress Claim to have been attached to the Quotation. If not, the plaintiff would not have agreed to take on the job.[^34] I would say that even if there was nothing attached to the Quotation, but the parties considered that they were on the same wavelength post-discussion, the plaintiff would still take on the job. If there was any misunderstanding of the scope of work, it was only realised upon subsequent presentation of the progress claims.

51     Defendant’s counsel also submitted the evidence of the plaintiff’s own supervisor, Mr Murugesan Dinesh Raja (“Mr Dinesh”), who identified at least one of the plaintiff’s worker in the vicinity of the Annex Building on a few occasions.[^35] Mr Dinesh also testified that they would have no business there, except to do the work.[^36] So, despite the plaintiff’s evidence that they had nothing to do with and at the Annex Building because their work scope did not cover the Annex Building, on Mr Dinesh’s testimony, they must have been there to do the work.

52     On this first issue therefore, it is the Court’s determination that the plaintiff’s S$160,000 lump-sum contract would be for electrical works for both the R3 Interim Tower and the Annex Building.

## Issue 2: What was the value of the work that the plaintiff completed?

53     In addressing this issue in my oral judgment, one of the focal points was on the part payment of S$23,364.52 that the defendant made to the plaintiff, as the defendant had argued that it was made on goodwill and/or was an advance payment. It was my holding that that amount paid was made on the plaintiff’s Progress Claim 1. I took into account, amongst other factors, the precision of the amount with Progress Claim 1, down to the last cent. As far as the counterclaim for the refund from this amount therefore, it was dismissed.

54     However, the issue as stated is still relevant for the present appeal on the other focal point that I also addressed: it raised the question of the value of the plaintiff’s work that was actually completed. This should therefore be awarded. The plaintiff had raised Progress Claim 2, 3 and 4. This amounted to S$120,969. The issue for the plaintiff’s case was therefore whether the defendant should be ordered to satisfy payment of this amount to the plaintiff for the work done. This other focal point was what is relevant for the present purposes.

55     As earlier mentioned, it was the Court’s finding, on a balance of probabilities, that the scope of the plaintiff’s work covered R3 Tower as well as the Annex Building. The work that the plaintiff claimed to have done must therefore be measured against the whole of the plaintiff’s subcontracted work scope.

56     A point must be highlighted, that, by Mr Johnny having paid the plaintiff on Progress Claim 1, it was the Court’s finding that Mr Johnny was taken to have accepted the works for Progress Claim 1. There was therefore no reason for any refund to the defendant. The counterclaim was therefore dismissed.

57     In presenting the other progress claims though, the plaintiff had not persuaded Mr Johnny on its works. The defendant took issue with the works alleged to have been performed by the plaintiff. Whilst Mr Johnny might have agreed with the claims made under Progress Claim 1, when an issue arose on the subsequent progress claims presented, it was for the plaintiff to be able to support its progress claims. Even to the trial judge.

58     A point must be made that better evidence could have been presented on this case on both parties’ sides. However, given that this suit is the plaintiff’s claim, the burden would be on the plaintiff to discharge the same. In _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another_ v _Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span>, Steven Chong J at \[75\] and \[78\] said:

> … both parties’ narratives are riddled with difficulties.

> …

> …\[T\]he difficulties in the defendant’s narrative, however numerous, do not assist the plaintiffs with the proof of its affirmative case. I am not faced with a binary choice between accepting either the plaintiff’s account of events or that of the defendant’s. In other words, rejection of the defendant’s case theory does not invariably entail acceptance of the plaintiff’s.

59     That was the conundrum that I had faced in trying very hard to be persuaded on the plaintiff’s case: that the plaintiff had failed to persuade on the works performed as to justify the progress claims. It might be very well for the defendant to have failed to show how they arrived at the 15% of work that the plaintiff had done. But, as it was the plaintiff’s case that 80% of the work had been done, the burden was on the plaintiff to persuade on that.

60     Without an expert’s evidence, the plaintiff had relied on ‘industry practice’ and submitted that when a progress claim is presented, it was the contractor which would verify the works then send to the upstream contractor. In the present case, when the plaintiff presented its progress claim to the defendant, the plaintiff suggested that the defendant had not found it necessary to verify the works, but had “simply sent it to Vista”.[^37] On that basis, the plaintiff had submitted to the effect that there must be acknowledgement of the plaintiff’s works.

61     The plaintiff then used extrapolation and submitted that in one month, by June 2017 (the date of Progress Claim 1), it had completed about 14% of the works (S$23,364.52/S$160,000\*100%). Then, when Vista submitted to Primeflux its progress claim[^38] on 31 July 2017 showing that S$73,458.20 out of S$160,000 of works was done (implying that the plaintiff’s workers did the work), this would be 45.92% of works completed at R3 Tower by July 2017.[^39] The plaintiff therefore urged the Court to accept that by September 2017 when its contract with the defendant was terminated, “obviously the Plaintiff would have completed 80% or more of the contract value of $160,000 from July 2017 to 23 September 2017”.[^40]

62     Whilst the above might be mathematically logical, the Court had difficulty in accepting this wholesale, given that the plaintiff’s premise, to begin with, was based on works at R3 Tower being 100% of its subcontracted works. It failed to take into account the scope of works at Annex Building, even if that portion of the works at the Annex Building might not be a big portion of the Subcontract. Speaking mathematically then, the ‘denominator’ of the works as a whole being larger than what was submitted by the plaintiff, the percentage of works completed at the R3 Tower would be reduced.

63     It was on the above basis, and for the lack of evidence to prove otherwise on a balance of probabilities, that the Court was unable to find for the plaintiff in respect of the Progress Claim 2, 3, and 4.

64     The Court had also not been able to find how the plaintiff’s work could be awarded on a _quantum meruit_ basis. I had looked at the defendant’s expert’s report. Quantity Surveyor, Mr James Wesley Chessell provided a report wherein he assessed the value of the plaintiff’s work in the context of the plaintiff having subcontracted to do works at both the R3 Interim Tower and the Annex Building. Although the report was discredited by the plaintiff’s counsel, I had not found a reason not to accept it. Mr Chessell had also provided the bases by which he arrived at the finding that the plaintiff’s work is valued at S$9,021.08 (without GST). As earlier mentioned, the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to discharge, and that was even if the defendant’s evidence was incredible.

65     Apart from the above, the Court must also admit that it was troubled by the plaintiff’s statement of claim which had stated that its work included variation and additional works. Yet, these had not been quantified. It therefore became unclear for Progress Claim 2 to 4 how much of what was claimed was part of the S$160,000 or were variation works, which were instructed by Primeflux, but approved by Mr Johnny’s son, Mr Ong Hoe Loong or “Ah Loong” (DW1).

66     The plaintiff had also not brought in their own expert quantity surveyor to assist the Court. Further, although the plaintiff’s Mr Dinesh claimed to have regularly assessed the works and would be the best person – amongst all the witnesses – to provide the value of the works, sadly, no evidence in respect of the value of the plaintiff’s work was provided from that source. This was despite the Court even giving Mr Dinesh the opportunity to do so.

67     Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable to have relied on Mr Chessell’s testimony and report.

## Conclusion

68     It flowed from the above that the claim must also fail, as did also the defendant’s counterclaim. Both parties were therefore ordered to bear their own legal costs.
