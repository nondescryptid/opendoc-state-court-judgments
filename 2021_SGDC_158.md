2 July 2021

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

1       I heard District Court Suit No. 1368 of 2019 on 7-8 January 2021 and 1-5 March 2021 and reserved my judgment. As directed, parties filed their written closing submissions on 14 May 2021. Pursuant to further directions issued on 15 June 2021 whereby parties were directed to file written submissions on the issue of the quantum of damages for the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ counterclaim for defamation, the Court was informed via a letter dated 25 June 2021 that parties have reached an agreement on the quantum of damages for defamation[^1]. This is my written judgment for District Court Suit No. 1368 of 2019.

## Introduction

2       The first, second and third Defendants were formerly employees at the Plaintiff’s sole-proprietorship company “Swee Hock Foodstuff Provision Company” (“Swee Hock”) which is in the business of wholesale supply of food products such as snacks and sweets to other retailers in Singapore. On 17 April 2017, after the 1st Defendant had left Swee Hock, both he and the 2nd Defendant incorporated the 4th Defendant, AQ World Pte Ltd that carries out the same business as Swee Hock. The Plaintiff brought this suit against all 4 Defendants for breach of employment contract and breach of employee’s duty of fidelity; breach of confidence by reason of alleged use of the Plaintiff’s List of Products, List of Suppliers and List of Customers; malicious falsehood through the making of false representations to Swee Hock’s customers; unlawful interference with trade; and for having conspired to cause harm to the Plaintiff by unlawful means. In response, the 1st and 2nd Defendants counterclaimed against the Plaintiff for defamation and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants also counterclaimed against the Plaintiff for wrongful dismissal and short payments of their salaries.

## Facts

### The Parties

3       The Plaintiff (“P”), Lim Eng Chuan, is the sole proprietor of Swee Hock. P started the Swee Hock business in 1983 and from 1988, P has employed his family members, including his eldest and second eldest brothers to work in Swee Hock.

4       The 1st and 2nd Defendants (“D1”, “D2”), are P’s nephew and niece who are the children of P’s eldest brother. D1 started working at Swee Hock after his national service. By the time he left Swee Hock on 9 December 2016, he had worked there for about 22 years (from 1 September 1994 to 9 December 2016). D2 started working at Swee Hock on 1 May 2005 and she remained an employee until 9 June 2017. The 3rd Defendant (“D3”) was formerly a sales executive at Swee Hock and he has worked at Swee Hock for close to 15 years (from 1 July 2002 to 26 May 2017) before he tendered his resignation on 15 May 2017. The 4th Defendant, AQ World Pte Ltd (“AQ”) is a company incorporated on 18 April 2017 by D1 and D2 as joint directors and shareholders. As stated above, AQ’s business is also in the wholesale supply of food products to other retailers such as minimarts in Singapore.

### Background to the dispute

5       Swee Hock first started as a provision shop in retail business. Soon after D1 joined Swee Hock, it changed its focus to wholesale and distribution business. D1 was in charge of sales, procurement and delivery while P focussed on the finance and admin matters of the business. By 2000, D1 became designated as Business Manager and was heading the operations, sales and delivery teams.

6       From 1994, Swee Hock started to have a system of entering its sales records electronically. Over time, Swee Hock’s system comprises an electronic database consisting of the following lists – list of customers, list of suppliers and list of products which P alleged are “confidential data”.

7       D2 and D3 were employees involved in sales. At Swee Hock, D3’s direct supervisor was D1. As D1 and D2 were considered as family members, they did not have any written employment contract whilst working at Swee Hock. There is, however, a written employment contract for D3.

8       On 7 July 2016, there was a family meeting involving P, P’s brothers and D1 and D2’s parents (P’s eldest brother and P’s sister-in-law) concerning the HDB flat that D1 and D2’s parents are residing in. According to P, D1 and D2’s parents had to repay 55% of the market value of the HDB flat back to his late parents’ pool of family assets. The details of this family dispute are not relevant for the purpose of this case. Suffice to say that after this family meeting, the relationship between P and his eldest brother and D1 and D2 turned sour.

9       A day after the said family meeting, P sent a WhatsApp message to the following persons: D2, 2 business partners of Swee Hock: Mr Pei of Sin Hua Hock Kee Trading and Mark Heng of Santa Boeki Pte Ltd, 2 relatives of P: Lincoln Lim and Lee Wee Tai and 3 former employees of Swee Hock who are currently employed at AQ: Koh Gek Chin, Goh Sai Kheng and Ling Boh Ching. This WhatsApp message is the subject of D1 and D2’s counterclaim for defamation against P.

10     In November 2016, D1 was stripped of his sales and managerial responsibilities and his pay was drastically reduced. On 2 December 2016, P sacked his eldest brother (D1 and D2’s father).

11     On 9 December 2016, D1 was told to do only minor administrative work and to report to the store supervisor. On the same day, P told D1 to hand over Swee Hock’s warehouse and car keys. This proved to be the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back for D1 and he left the premises of Swee Hock in a huff. Thereafter, P arranged for D1’s belongings in the premises of Swee Hock, including a laptop used by D1 for his work at Swee Hock, to be packed into boxes and these boxes were later handed over to D1 by an employee by the name of Koh Gek Chin.

## The Parties’ Cases

### The Plaintiff’s Claim

#### P’s case

12     P alleges that Swee Hock’s database which contains Swee Hock’s list of customers (“Customers List”), list of suppliers (“Suppliers List”), and list of products (“Products List”) contains confidential information and that D1’s unauthorised use thereof for the conduct of business at AQ is a breach of confidence and a breach of employee’s duty of fidelity. Additionally, P also says that by setting up AQ with D1 and D2 as directors and shareholders and by AQ using Swee Hock’s database in breach of confidence, the Defendants have conspired to cause harm to him and Swee Hock.

13     P also claims against D3 and AQ for malicious falsehood by making false representations to Swee Hock’s customers and for unlawful interference with trade. P’s claim against D3 and AQ for malicious falsehood and unlawful interference with trade is premised on P’s allegation that D3 had falsely claimed to Swee Hock’s customers that Swee Hock’s business had closed so as to solicit business and custom from Swee Hock’s customers for AQ, in particular, customers such as Sathya Minimart, Siant International Pte Ltd and Noorul Ajmir Corner.

14     Arising from these claims, P seeks various injunctions against the Defendants including an injunction to restrain them from continuing in the business of wholesale supply of food products to minimarts and other retailers in Singapore for a period of one year and to restrain the Defendants from disclosing or using confidential information belonging to P as well as damages.

#### Ds’ Case

15     In essence, D1’s defence is that his employment at Swee Hock was suddenly terminated without notice by P on 9 December 2016. After working at his brother in law’s renovation business, he decided that he should make use of the knowledge and skill he has gained from working at Swee Hock to start his own business and AQ was then incorporated in April 2017, a few months after his forced departure from Swee Hock.

16     D2’s defence is that other than lending her name as director and shareholder of AQ, she was not involved in AQ’s business until after she had resigned from Swee Hock and joined AQ.

17     All 3 Defendants (D1, D2 and D3) also averred that AQ’s first transaction only occurred in July 2017, by which time all 3 of them had already left Swee Hock.

18     As for P’s case against D3 and AQ on false representation and unlawful conspiracy, D3 denied making any false representations and averred that he had informed Sathya Minimart and Siant International Pte Ltd that he had left Swee Hock and was working for AQ when he met their representatives with the intention to take sales orders from them in or around mid-June and July 2017 respectively. As for Noorul Ajmir Corner, D3 denied having had any contact with this entity.

19     In relation to the alleged use of Swee Hock’s Customers List, Suppliers List and Products List (collectively referred to as “Swee Hock’s database”) for AQ’s business, the Defendants’ defence is that these do not constitute confidential information[^2]. The Defendants also averred that P had taken a “cavalier and lackadaisical attitude towards the protection of Swee Hock’s database[^3] and that it was P who had in fact packed D1’s laptop that contains Swee Hock’s database into a box for D1 to bring home[^4].

20     Additionally, D1 and D2’s defence is that they had used Swee Hock’s database only for the purpose of performing their duties while working at Swee Hock. The Defendants acknowledged that AQ’s invoices have a similar format to Swee Hock’s and that AQ also use Customers IDs based on the address of the individual customers[^5]. For the similar Customer IDs used by both AQ and Swee Hock, the Defendants explained that that is because this format was devised by D1 himself when he was working at Swee Hock and he had continued to use the same format as it is simple to use[^6]. Additionally, in so far as P’s case for breach of confidence against D3 is based on breach of Clause 10 of the employment contract which imposes the obligation to keep information confidential, D3’s defence is that Clause 10 is a restrictive covenant that is unenforceable[^7].

### D1, D2 and D3’s counterclaim for wrongful dismissal

21     D1 submitted that he was “constructively dismissed” by P and that that dismissal constitutes a wrongful dismissal for which he is entitled to one month’s salary in lieu of notice. D2 and D3 say that their services were wrongfully terminated prior to the end of the resignation notice period and that they are entitled to be paid salary in lieu of the remaining notice period.

22     In response, P says D1’s claim for wrongful dismissal is unmeritorious as D1 had already planned to leave Swee Hock from July 2016 at the latest. As for D2’s dismissal, P says the one-month notice does not apply and that, in any event, it was impliedly and mutually waived between P and D2. Similarly, for D3, P’s case is that the one-month notice prescribed in the employment contract has been impliedly and mutually waived by virtue of the fact that D3 preferred to work for D1 and was eager to do so.

### D1 and D2’s counterclaim for defamation

23     On 8 July 2017, P published a message (original language is in the Chinese language) via WhatsApp to the following persons: D2, 2 business partners of Swee Hock: Mr Pei of Sin Hua Hock Kee Trading and Mark Heng of Santa Boeki Pte Ltd, 2 relatives of P: Lincoln Lim and Lee Wee Tai and 3 former employees of Swee Hock who are currently employed by D4: Koh Gek Chin, Goh Sai Kheng and Ling Boh Ching. The English translation of the message is as follows:

> "For a long time before 7 July 2016, \*someone had admitted to having grievances, and had secretly hatched a series of devious schemes to benefit himself. On the night of 7 July 2016, he usurped the ancestral assets for himself.

> He also recruited conspirators to achieve his objective using clandestine means.

> The conspiracy is this: he would start a new company in July 2017 and poach a majority of my staff all at once, so as to plunge my company into a very difficult situation (akin to ripping out the pillars of a house).

> When \*he absconded the company on 9 December 2016, he instigated his conspirators who were working at my company to go through the motion at work and obtain attractive remuneration before July 2017 and leave the company together when the time was ripe. They would also steal and rob my company’s business information which they could use in future.

> To date, as of 5 July 2017, they have begun to steal my business, which proves my past suspicions and that I did not wrongly accuse them.

> Their deliberate and devious scheme caught me off guard. They did not care about my survival at all.

> The reason why I allowed them to put on a show in front of me and only took action at the last moment, was because I wanted to treat them kindly until they admit their wrongdoing.

> After much consideration and reflection, for the manner in which I have handled this matter, which has caused distress to my confidantes and inconvenience to my business partners, I can only respond (to them) with the following: the circumstances forced me to do so.

> In the end, I want to quote an old saying to warn "repent and be saved". I hope this matter will not worsen.”

24     D1 and D2 allege that the said message bears defamatory imputations which refer to or reflect upon their reputation. P pleads the defence of justification and qualified privilege. P further says there was no malice or ulterior motive when P published the WhatsApp message and that in any event, D1 has not shown that he has suffered harm to his reputation.

## My Decision

25     As the factual matrices for P’s claim against D1, D2 and D3 are slightly different, my decision on P’s claim will be based on P’s claim against each of them separately.

### P’s claim against D1

26     P’s claim against D1 centres around the alleged breach of confidence by D1 in relation to Swee Hock’s database. Thus, a finding as to whether D1 is in breach of confidence in relation to Swee Hock’s database is key to P’s claim against D1. Additionally, a finding as to the circumstances surrounding the departure of former employees to join AQ is also relevant to the question of whether the Defendants have conspired to cause harm to P by unlawful means.

#### Is D1 shown to have been in breach of confidence in relation to Swee Hock’s database?

27     On this question, I find that Swee Hock’s database does not contain confidential information. Further, I am not satisfied that Swee Hock’s database has been imparted to the Defendants, in particular, D1 in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. In any event, I find that D1’s conscience is not affected and thus, there is no breach of confidence by D1.

28     In _I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 1130</span> (“_I-Admin_”), the Court of Appeal set out at \[61\] the “new” or “modified” approach to be taken by the Singapore courts in relation to breach of confidence claims:

> (a)     The plaintiff must prove the following two prerequisites:

>> (i)       The information in question has the necessary quality of confidence about it;

>> (ii)       The information in question has been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.

> (b)     Upon the plaintiff proving the two prerequisites, a breach of confidence is presumed. However, the presumption can be displaced if the defendant is able to show that his conscience is not affected.

29     The question of whether there is a breach of confidence is ultimately a question of fact and degree that must be regarded in its wider context. As stated by Lee Seiu Kin J in _Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 163</span> ("_Clearlab_”) at \[205\]:

> “... The turning point for this development seems to be an awareness that **_an obligation of confidence is ineluctably shaped by the facts of the case. I can imagine that the relationship between the parties, the manner in which confidential information was obtained, the measures taken to safeguard confidentiality, etc, would define the boundary of the defendants' obligation of confidence and, in turn, affect the analysis of whether the obligation was indeed breached. Thus, whether there has been breach of confidence appears to be a question of fact and degree that must be regarded in its wider context_**.” \[emphasis added\]

30     The only basis that P is relying on for his allegation that D1 is in breach of confidence is the fact that AQ’s invoices appear similar to Swee Hock’s, in particular, in the description of products and the Customer IDs.

31     An inspection of Swee Hock’s database shows me that the individual lists[^8] in Swee Hock’s database contain information that are not confidential in nature. For example, the names and address of customers who are in the retail provision shop business would be information that is available in the public domain. The names and address of suppliers would also be information that is readily available in the public domain, especially to people who are carrying out business in provision shops. As for the product list, the information or description about the products comes from the suppliers and is not information created by P.

32     In _Invenpro (M) Bhd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1045</span> ("_Invenpro_”), George Wei JC explained at \[130\] that where the individual component in the information is accessible to the public, it is still possible for the information to possess the necessary quality of confidence as a whole if the end result is more than just the sum of the parts. Nevertheless, in these instances, the plea that the individual elements have been combined together in a way so as to produce something which is new in itself, is a plea that requires careful analysis and must be supported by the evidence.

33     In the instant case, P has not articulated in his pleadings how the individual elements have been combined together in a way as to produce something which is new in itself. P has also not led any evidence to show how Swee Hock’s Customers List, Products List and Suppliers List have added “a new dimension or insight” to the underlying information that is readily available in the public domain.

34     Therefore, whether based on the individual entries or the respective Lists or the database as a whole, the information in Swee Hock’s database does not possess the quality of confidentiality.

35     Further, on the facts, I find that access to Swee Hock's database was readily available and accessible to Swee Hock's employees regardless of position or seniority. According to D1, employees of Swee Hock can freely access Swee Hock’s database and even customers of Swee Hock had been entrusted with the information in Swee Hock’s database[^9]. P has also explained that for ease of retrieval of information, he in fact did away with access rights and therefore all employees of Swee Hock have access to Swee Hock’s database (“_So, subsequently, we do away---we did away with the access rights_”)[^10]. P himself did not see the need for restricted access or need for access rights for Swee Hock’s database and in fact gave free access to even his driver and assistant[^11]. In P’s own words, “_how many people could access or not, there is no way to be sure_”[^12].

36     In fact, it was upon P’s instructions that D1 had made a backup copy of Swee Hock’s database in his personal laptop so as to have a ready copy of the database in case of fire at the premises of Swee Hock[^13]. P had in fact also asked others other than D1 to do a backup of Swee Hock’s database in their laptops[^14]. P therefore knew or would have known that the laptop that he had returned to D1 contains Swee Hock’s database. The uncontradicted testimony of D1 is that it was P himself who had packed D1’s personal laptop containing Swee Hock’s database into the box that was given to D1 to bring home[^15].

37     In any event, from the time of D1’s departure till P’s letter of demand on 12 July 2018, P had not once demanded that D1 surrender the laptop P himself had permitted to be returned to D1 after his departure from Swee Hock. This shows that P was not at all concerned that D1’s personal laptop contained Swee Hock’s confidential information.

38     All of these show that on the facts, P’s attitude towards Swee Hock’s database is cavalier and lackadaisical and P himself had not treated the information contained in D1’s laptop as confidential property of Swee Hock.

39     Furthermore, according to P, prior to D1’s departure, he had intended for D1 to take over the business. It is also not disputed that prior to the breakdown in their relationship, D1 was entrusted with the management of Swee Hock’s business. Therefore, the relationship between P and D1 and their respective attitudes were such that it can be inferred that, prior to the breakdown in their relationship, if there was to be any “ownership” in the database, P had willingly shared that ownership with D1.

40     Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence, I am of the view that Swee Hock’s database had not been imparted to D1 in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.

41     For all of the above reasons, both the first and second pre-requisites required for the imposition of an obligation of confidence are not satisfied.

42     Even assuming that Swee Hock’s database has the requisite quality of confidentiality and was imparted to D1 in circumstances importing an obligation of confidentiality, P has not shown that D1 has “copied” or “used” it in breach of confidence.

43     D1 has testified that after the laptop was returned to him, he had left the laptop in the box returned to him in his storeroom and had not used it at all[^16]. He also testified that the database in his laptop can only be retrieved for the purpose of generating invoices when the laptop is connected to the server in Swee Hock’s premises and using the system “EMS Version 2”[^17].

44     Against D1’s evidence that he had not touched the laptop that was returned to him by P, the only evidence that P has to show for his allegation that D1 has “used” Swee Hock’s database in breach of confidence is the circumstantial evidence of alleged “similarity” between AQ’s invoices and Swee Hock’s invoices. P alleges that the format, layout, words, symbols, descriptions are similar. P also pointed out that the product ID numbers, and customer ID numbers are identical.

45     I find that the alleged similarities, if any, are not probative of D1 of having used Swee Hock’s database.

46     First, items such as format and layouts of invoices are generic in nature.

47     Second, similarity in product descriptions (_the evidence shows only use of product description and Swee Hock does not use product IDs for identification of products_) does not constitute evidence of D1 having used Swee Hock’s database as these product descriptions would have come from the suppliers of the products. Therefore, if D1 had used the same suppliers as Swee Hock for AQ’s business, the product descriptions used in AQ’s invoices would be identical or similar to Swee Hock’s invoices for the same products from the same suppliers. D1 had been working for Swee Hock for many years and was the most senior manager in Swee Hock. It is fully understandable for him to have approached the same suppliers he had been dealing with when working for Swee Hock for the conduct of AQ’s business. In this connection, it cannot be said that Swee Hock has monopoly over the suppliers. Thus, there is no breach by D1 using the same suppliers for AQ’s business.

48     Further, while there are similarities in product descriptions in the invoices of Swee Hock and AQ[^18], there are also some differences[^19]. A closer examination of the differences in product description reinforces the fact that the information relating to product descriptions in both Swee Hock’s and AQ’s database had originated from the suppliers.

49     The key similarity that might perhaps have been indicative of unauthorised use of Swee Hock’s database by D1 is in relation to customer IDs. Both AQ and Swee Hock use the same format to identify and retrieve information relating to their customers, resulting in identical Customer IDs being used for the same customer. On this similarity, D1 has explained that he was the one who came up with the format, using each customer’s address for the Customer ID (for example, the first 3 digit is the block number of the customer’s address; 4th and 5th numbers are the unit number of the customer’s address and the last digit is a running number)[^20] for ease of retrieval of customer information from the system.

50     While D1 has explained how he had devised the Customer ID for Swee Hock and had admitted that he had used the same format for Customer ID for AQ’s business as it was a simple format to follow[^21], P has not given any explanation as to the method he has employed for deriving customer IDs in Swee Hock’s database. P has also not contradicted the information given by D1. As such, I am satisfied that the customer IDs I see in Swee Hock’s database is the result of a format devised by D1. It is therefore fully possible that the reason why the same customer IDs for the same customers are seen in both AQ’s and Swee Hock’s invoices is because of D1 using the same format for AQ’s invoice generating system. This similarity cannot simply be taken as evidence of copying or unauthorised use of Swee Hock’s database by D1. In the absence of any evidence to contradict D1’s testimony, the fact that AQ’s invoices have the same format for customer IDs is not probative of use of Swee Hock’s database amounting to a breach of confidence by D1 and AQ.

#### Has D1 breached his duty of fidelity as an employee?

51     It is not disputed that AQ was incorporated only in April 2017, a few months after D1 had already left Swee Hock’s employment. According to D1, AQ did its first business transaction on 4 July 2017[^22]. Therefore, whether P’s claim of breach of fidelity was based on breach of confidence in D1 using Swee Hock’s database or based on the setting up of AQ to engage in business that is in competition with Swee Hock, there is no breach of employee’s duty of fidelity by D1 as these are not shown to have been performed while he was still an employee of Swee Hock.

52     In _Clearlab_, Lee Seiu Kin J held at \[67\] that former employees must be allowed to utilise their skill and knowledge acquired during their employment to compete with their former employer:

> "However, if the breach of confidence claim is made against an ex-employee, the law has taken care to distinguish between "skill and knowledge " belonging to an ex-employee and "confidential information " belonging to the ex-employer. **_The law recognises that in the post-employment situation, while an ex-employer's confidential information should be protected, the scope of protection should not unreasonably encroach upon the ex-employee's ability to utilise his skill and knowledge to compete with the ex-employer or seek alternative employment in the same field._** Thus, in Ocular Sciences Ltd v Aspect Vision Care Ltd \[1997\] RPC 289, Laddie J observed at 370 - 371 that, **_as a matter of public policy, an employee should be entitled to use his skill and knowledge_**, whether or not it is confidential to the employer at time of acquisition, and that if the ex-employer's right to restrain misuse of his confidential information collides with the public policy of allowing an ex-employee to freely use his acquired skill and knowledge, it is the latter which prevails... " \[emphasis added\]

53     Therefore, in addition to my finding that Swee Hock’s database does not possess the quality of confidence and was not imparted in circumstances that impose the obligation of confidence, and that in any event, D1 has not been shown to be in breach of confidence, I also find that there is no basis for P’s claim against D1 based on breach of fidelity. D1 is entitled to make use of his skill and knowledge gained from working at Swee Hock, such as which suppliers to contact for the supply of goods, what price margins to set for competitive pricing, which customers to solicit for business from, etc to set up a competing business.

54     In any event, any use of skill and knowledge gained by D1 to set up AQ happened after his employment at Swee Hock had been terminated. An employee does not owe his employer the duty of fidelity after his employment with the employer has ended. He only owes such a duty while he is still in the employment of the employer.

55     I will now move on to P’s claim against D2, followed by P’s claim against D3, before dealing with P’s claim against all the Defendants for alleged unlawful means conspiracy.

### P’s claim against D2

#### Has D2 breached her duty of fidelity?

56     P’s claim against D2 is that she had been in breach of her duty of fidelity because she had, together with D1, caused AQ to be incorporated as a competing business while she was still in the employment of Swee Hock. Based on the facts and the totality of evidence adduced, I find that D2 has not breached her duty of good faith and fidelity.

57     It is a fact that D2 had remained in the employment of Swee Hock after her brother’s departure. It is also not disputed that AQ was incorporated with D2 as a named director and shareholder while D2 was still an employee of Swee Hock.

58     D2 has explained that when D1 told her and her husband that he intended to set up his own business in April 2017, she and her husband decided to support him[^23]. In cross-examination, D2 explained that her husband had the money to assist D1 in setting up his own business but had wanted D2 to be “named” as the director and shareholder instead because he was working in senior management in a company and he could not be involved in D1’s business on record[^24]. Under cross-examination, D2 was forthcoming and consistent in her testimony. As such, I find no reason not to accept D2’s testimony as to how she came to be named as the director and shareholder of AQ.

59     The evidence adduced by the Defendants shows that AQ’s first transaction was on 4 July 2017, which was after D2 had left Swee Hock. D2 has also testified that she was not involved in any activity related to AQ after AQ’s incorporation in April 2017 until after her employment at Swee Hock had been terminated[^25].

60     In _Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 308</span> (“_Smile Inc_”) the Court of Appeal held at \[81\] that the mere incorporation of a competing business and the leasing and fitting out of business premises, among others, fall within the limits of permissible preparatory activity:

> "Indeed, the Respondent had only obtained a licence from the Ministry of Health on 14 May 2009, to take effect on 15 May 2009. This was almost a month after his employment with the Appellant had ceased. **_The only acts that the Appellant may validly rely upon, therefore, were merely the mere incorporation of the competing business, the leasing and fitting out of business premises, and discussions with another former employee to join the competing business. These acts fall cleanly within the limits of permissible preparatory activity._** We would point out, however, that **_the situation would have been clearly different if the Respondent had obtained a licence from the Ministry of Health and had, in his free time, treated patients under the auspices of Dental Essence, in direct competition with the Appellant... or was engaged in active solicitation of his patients when he was under the employ of the Appellant_**...No evidence of such impermissible behaviour is before us and we cannot see how the preparatory acts of the Respondent can be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and fidelity. " \[emphasis added\]

61     P has not led any evidence to show impermissible behaviour or breach of the duty of good faith and fidelity by D2 such as the active solicitation of customers for AQ. P has also not called any of Swee Hock’s customers to give evidence or adduced any evidence to show sale transactions between AQ and Swee Hock’s customers while D2 was still an employee of Swee Hock. The only act relied upon by P to say there was such a breach is the mere incorporation of AQ as a competing business. As the Court of Appeal has ruled in _Smile Inc_, the act of incorporating a company to conduct a competing business is an act that clearly falls within the limits of permissible preparatory activity and does not constitute a breach of the employee’s duty of good faith and fidelity to the employer.

### P’s claim against D3

62     P’s claim against D3 is on the basis that he has breached Clause 10 of his employment contract in divulging Swee Hock’s company policies and confidential matters to others. P also claims that D3 has given false representations to Swee Hock’s customers such as representing to Swee Hock’s customers that AQ is the “former Swee Hock” and caused damage to Swee Hock and is liable for unlawful interference with trade[^26].

#### Has D3 breached Clause 10 of his employment contract?

63     On P’s claim that D3 has breached Clause 10 of his employment contract, I find that P has not established that D3 has divulged any of Swee Hock’s company policies or confidential matters to D1 or any “outsiders” or has solicited for personal business with Swee Hock’s customers in breach of Clause 10. In any event, Clause 10, in so far as it operates as a restrictive covenant, is unenforceable.

64     Clause 10 of his employment contract provides:

> "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

> You are at all times warned not to divulge any company’s policies & confidential matters to any outsiders. You are not allowed to solicit for personal business with any of the company's clients.”

65     Clause 10 pertains to confidential information and non-solicitation of Swee Hock’s customers for D3’s own personal business while he was still in the employment of Swee Hock. The use of the word "outsiders" also lends weight to this interpretation. P has not adduced any evidence to show that D3 has breached Clause 10 while he was still an employee of Swee Hock. All of P’s allegations in this regard pertain to events that occurred after D3 had left Swee Hock.

66     Further, reading Clause 10 to apply post-termination of D3's employment would mean that Clause 10 is a restrictive covenant because it seeks to restrict D3's conduct even after his employment in Swee Hock has come to an end (see _Lek Gwee Noi v Humming Flowers & Gifts Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 27</span> at \[33\]). As a restrictive covenant, Clause 10 is prima facie void and unenforceable, unless it protects a legitimate proprietary interest, and it is reasonable in the interests of the parties and also reasonable in the public interest (See _Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D & F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 663</span> at \[70\]). In this connection, P has not identified any legitimate proprietary interest that was sought to be protected by Clause 10 that D3 had allegedly breached.

67     Additionally, the terms "company 's policies" and "confidential matters" in Clause 10 are not defined in D3's employment contract. As P had admitted in cross-examination that there was no employee handbook that sets out Swee Hock's policies[^27] and as such, D3 would not know what company policies and confidential matters he was not supposed to disclose under Clause 10, insofar as Clause 10 operates as a restrictive covenant to restrain disclosure of confidential information post-termination of D3's employment, it is too wide to be reasonable.

68     As P has not made any specific allegations against D3 as regards the use of Swee Hock’s database, it is not necessary for me to make any findings as regards thereto. In any event, the same findings I have made as regards Swee Hock’s database in relation to D1 applies to D3 as well.

#### Is D3 liable for false representations and unlawful interference with trade?

69     P’s claim for malicious falsehood against D3 is on the basis that D3 has maliciously made or published false statements to another person about P and Swee Hock and this has caused P to suffer damage thereby. P also claims against D3 under the tort of unlawful interference with trade based on the allegation that D3 has wrongfully interfered with the actions of a third party in which P has an economic interest with the intention to cause loss to P.

70     In support of his claim for malicious falsehood and unlawful interference with trade against D3, P alleged as follows:

> (a)     P heard from Swee Hock’s employees, Tan Pek Gaik and Diana Teo that Swee Hock’s customers had been approached by AQ’s employees including D3 between July to October 2017 and these employees had falsely represented to them that AQ was a subsidiary or a related company of Swee Hock[^28];

> (b)     P received a video recording between February to March 2018 from a former employee of Swee Hock, a Ms Eileen that purportedly shows that D3 had told a Mr Ho of Nam Kee, a former customer of Swee Hock various false statements about P[^29];

71     On a totality of the evidence adduced, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that P has not shown that D3 has made any false representations to P’s customers or that any of the grounds for unlawful interference of trade is established.

72     P’s allegations are based on what he purportedly heard from Swee Hock’s employees (Tan Pek Gaik and Diana Teo and former employee, Ms Eileen) who told him what they heard from Swee Hock’s customers. As P has not called any of these employees or customers of Swee Hock or Ms Eileen to testify as to what D3 had said, I find that these are but bare allegations based wholly on hearsay evidence. For instance, I would attach little weight to Tan Pek Gaik’s testimony on behalf of P[^30] that she heard from the owner of Munch that he was surprised that Swee Hock was still in active business and the owner of Siant International Pte Ltd that she only found out that D1 was no longer Swee Hock’s employee after receiving AQ’s invoice[^31] as the truth of what was said to her could not be verified or tested. P could have called the owner of Munch or Siant to give evidence as to what D3 told them. In any event, what Tan Pek Gaik heard from Munch and Siant pertains to the perceptions that they had regarding Swee Hock. It is unclear as to how these customers’ perception came about, let alone how these perceptions had anything to do with what D3 had purportedly told them.

73     In addition to a lack of cogent or reliable evidence to prove the truth of what was allegedly said by D3, in cross-examination, P’s testimony regarding the statements that were purportedly made by D3 to Swee Hock’s customers or that purportedly shows that D3 had tried to pretend to be Swee Hock’s employee while soliciting for business for AQ was completely incoherent[^32].

74     Against this backdrop of unclear and unreliable evidence from P, D3 has testified that the first time he met former customers of Swee Hock (such as Siant International and Sathya Minimart), he had handed to them his business card that showed clearly that he was with AQ[^33].

75     In closing submissions, counsel for P submitted that D3 had admitted in cross-examination that Sathya Minimart and Siant International had stopped doing business with AQ after receiving the invoices from AQ and that the most logical explanation for this is that they had refused to give business to AQ after discovering that they had been misled by D3 into thinking that he was still an employee of Swee Hock. I find this argument to be fallacious. What D3 had admitted to is a fact – the fact that Siant International and Sathya Minimart had stopped doing business with AQ after one transaction. P has not adduced any evidence to show why they had stopped doing business with AQ; let alone evidence to show that D3 had intentionally misled them into thinking he was with Swee Hock in order to solicit their business. On the facts, P had by then sent out a notice to all of his customers to inform them that AQ is not related to Swee Hock. It is possible that customers like Siant International and Sathya Minimart made a business decision to continue to do business with Swee Hock only and this has nothing to do with any representations given to them by D3.

76     In conclusion, I therefore find that P has failed to show that D3 has made any false representations to Swee Hock’s customers or engaged in any unlawful act that constitutes an unlawful interference of trade.

### P’s case against all the Defendants

#### Have the Defendants conspired to cause harm to P by unlawful means?

77     P claims that D1 had planned to compete with him since 10 November 2016 and that from that point, the conspiracy among D1, D2 and D3 was hatched[^34]. The alleged conspiracy consisted of D1 and D2 incorporating AQ and causing AQ to compete with Swee Hock while D2 was still employed with Swee Hock. P also claims that D1 and D2 had caused D3 to be employed by AQ and that in addition to D2 and D3, DI had conspired with D2 and D3 to jointly cause AQ to employ 5 other persons who were Swee Hock’s former employees[^35].

78     Additionally, P also relies on what he has heard from Swee Hock’s employees as regards what they have purportedly heard from Swee Hock’s customers for his case that the Defendants have conspired to cause harm to him.

79     On a totality of the evidence adduced, I find that P has not established that D1 had left Swee Hock with the intention to set up AQ to compete with Swee Hock. It is also not established that D3’s move to AQ is part of this “conspiracy” or that the Defendants had conspired to cause 7 of Swee Hock’s former employees to leave Swee Hock to join AQ. As I have found as regards P’s claim against D3, there is also no reliable or cogent evidence to show that D3 or any other employee of AQ has given false representations to Swee Hock’s customers with a view to cause harm to P or Swee Hock.

80     P’s testimony is that since 2007, he had made it known to D1 that he was the most suitable candidate to eventually take over Swee Hock when he retires[^36]. According to P, D1 was however impatient to take over the business and he felt that his remuneration was too low[^37].

81     If what P said was true, and he had genuinely felt that D1 was the most suitable candidate to take over Swee Hock, then what P subsequently did (this is not denied), that is, downgrading D1’s responsibility to only minor administrative responsibilities and reducing his salary from $5000 to a take home pay of a mere $1,934.58 in November 2016[^38] in response to D1’s alleged complaints is utterly illogical and inexplicable. One would have thought that he would have had a conversation with D1 about D1’s alleged complaints. Instead, P unilaterally downgraded his role and cut his salary without giving him any explanation.

82     The only evidence that D1 was planning to leave Swee Hock is the testimony of Lim Wee Tai[^39] and what P heard from Lim Wee Tai[^40]. Regarding this, D1 admitted that he did tell Lim Wee Tai, his cousin, on 10 November 2016 that he was thinking about leaving Swee Hock and starting his own business. D1’s testimony is that he had said that out of frustration[^41]. I note that by then, P and D1’s parents were already in dispute over D1’s parents’ HDB flat as a “family asset” belonging to P’s parents. In cross-examination, Lim Wee Tai explained that though he heard from D1 that he wanted to leave Swee Hock, he had no idea as to the reasons why and he conceded that only D1 and P would be in a position to know the reasons for D1 expressing to him that he was planning to leave Swee Hock[^42]. In cross-examination, P himself has also conceded that D1 has never told him he did not want to wait any longer to take over Swee Hock[^43].

83     Therefore, while it is not disputed that D1 had expressed thoughts of leaving Swee Hock, there was no discussion between D1 and Lim Wee Tai and between D1 and P as to why D1 wanted to leave Swee Hock. On that basis, P’s allegation that D1 wanted to leave Swee Hock because he was impatient to take over Swee Hock is but a mere concocted excuse or conjecture on the part of P.

84     Based on the available evidence, even if I were to accept that D1 was planning to leave Swee Hock as at 10 November 2016, there is no evidence that it was an act done out of conspiracy. D1 had given his reasons that he was frustrated with P’s reaction over a certain incident involving another employee, Chia Chi Teng. Whatever D1’s reason for wanting to leave Swee Hock was, the evidence shows that as at November 2016, there was at best, a plan to leave Swee Hock to set up his own business. There is no evidence to show that at that point, there was anything else in addition to a “plan” that he had entertained mentally. It is irrelevant whether D1’s statement to Lim Wee Tai that he was planning to leave Swee Hock to set up his own business was said out of frustration or was because he had genuinely planned to leave Swee Hock. In essence, it was only a “plan” that D1 had in his mind. Merely entertaining the thought of leaving and setting up his own business cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be considered as an act in conspiracy.

85     In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, D1 has testified that on 18 November 2016, his role was reduced from being in charge of sales and operations to an administrative role answering to the store manager and that on 21 November 2016, he was told by P at a meeting involving him, D2 and his other uncles and Lim Wee Tai that Swee Hock had to be shut down because P had no money to continue operations and that the salaries of D1 and various family members had to be reduced. D1’s testimony is also corroborated by D2[^44]. However, as testified by D2, in contrast to their pay reductions, the majority of the staff received increments subsequently, in January and April 2017. It is therefore likely that P had used “no money to continue operation” as an excuse to drastically cut D1’s salary from $5000 to only $1,934.58 from November 2016. It can be seen that by 9 December 2016, P had stripped D1 of all involvement in sales and operations and made him work under the supervision of the storeman. D1 had also been told to return the warehouse and car keys. As such, the evidence in fact shows that P himself had planned to cut down D1’s role in Swee Hock with a view to cutting him off from Swee Hock.

86     All of these go to show that D1’s departure from Swee Hock on 9 December 2016 was more of a push factor arising from P’s action in reducing his role and his remuneration than it being an act of conspiracy or a move that is the result of a “hatched” plan on his part.

87     I accept that after D1’s departure from Swee Hock, it is reasonable for D1 to consider what options he had as a means of livelihood. By then, he was no longer under any obligations of loyalty and good faith to Swee Hock. As D1 has been in senior management for many years and had been dealing with suppliers and customers while he was at Swee Hock, I accept his evidence that he knew which are the suppliers to contact for goods and who are the customers to solicit business from. P cannot claim monopoly over the suppliers and customers. At the end of the day, in the business world, it is a matter of fair play based on pricing and service standard. Therefore, the fact that some customers had continued to contact D1 on his mobile phone because of their familiarity with him cannot, per se, be taken as evidence of conspiracy.

88     As for D2, I have already made my finding that other than her husband providing money ($100,000) to D1 to set up AQ and her consenting to her name being added as director and shareholder by virtue of her husband’s investment, there is no evidence whatsoever to show that she has done anything in a “conspiracy” with D1 against P.

89     Similarly, for D3, there is also no reliable or cogent evidence of him having done anything in “conspiracy” with D1 and/or D2 for the benefit of AQ, whether during his employment with Swee Hock or after.

90     As for P’s allegation of conspiracy against the Defendants based on what he purportedly heard from Ms Eileen or from employees who heard from customers of Swee Hock, I find that these are but bare allegations from P. In addition, the allegation of conspiracy is based wholly on hearsay evidence that is inadmissible insofar as it pertains to the truth of what was said to Swee Hock’s customers.

91     Even if I were to take what was told to employees like Tan Pek Gaik at face value, it is still unclear as to why these customers formed those perceptions and how those perceptions had anything to do with what any of the Defendants had done. There is no basis whatsoever for me to reach a finding that the Defendants had engaged in acts of conspiracy.

92     In addition, the evidence of Teo Boon Siang Diana with regard to a one-off complaint lodged with Popular bookstore at the Clementi Branch from D1 regarding the “expired” products supplied by Swee Hock to that bookstore, is insufficient to prove “malice” because it is not disputed by Swee Hock that the products had indeed expired. In any event, P has also not alleged that Popular bookstore had switched from Swee Hock to AQ as a result of this complaint (as can be seen from the list of AQ’s customers[^45], Popular bookstore is still not a customer of AQ).

93     As stated above, I also find P’s testimony in court regarding the statements that were purportedly made by D3 or AQ’s representatives to Swee Hock’s customers or that purportedly shows that D3 or AQ’s representatives had tried to pretend to be Swee Hock’s employees while soliciting for business for AQ to be completely incoherent[^46].

94     On 6 May 2017, before D2 and D3 had tendered their resignation, P had sent out a message to the employees of Swee Hock, inviting them to “leave Swee Hock” if they did not want or were unwilling to work hard for Swee Hock[^47]. D3 has testified that after D1’s departure, he had felt stressed and lost because prior to D1’s departure, he and other staff had depended a lot on D1[^48]. D3 further testified that after receiving the said message, he was sure he wanted to leave Swee Hock[^49]. The WhatsApp message sent by Koh Gek Chin, a former employee of Swee Hock and now an employee of AQ to an employee of Swee Hock on 3 July 2017 well expressed the sentiments of some of these employees who left Swee Hock to join AQ – some of them such as Koh Gek Chin had left Swee Hock because “_after the sudden departure of D1 who was suddenly laid off, the company was no longer the same as before_.”[^50]

95     All of these lead me to find that it is possible that the “exodus” of some of Swee Hock’s former employees to AQ was precipitated by the stressful environment after the departure of D1 and P’s message of 6 May 2017, which caused further unhappiness among some of them, rather than such arising out of proactive poaching on the part of D1, D2 and D3. In the absence of any cogent evidence of acts of conspiracy, I am not satisfied that the voluntary departure of former employees to join AQ is attributable to acts of conspiracy by D1 or any of the Defendants.

### Defendants’ counterclaim for wrongful dismissal

#### D1’s counterclaim for wrongful dismissal

96     DI’s counterclaim is on the basis that he was wrongfully dismissed, albeit constructively, by P on 9 December 2016 and that he is therefore entitled to be paid salary in lieu of notice.

97     The chronology of events that led to D1’s departure from Swee Hock is as follows:

> (a)     On 28 November 2016, P called for a meeting with Swee Hock’s employees (excluding D1) to inform them of D1’s plan to leave Swee Hock. In cross-examination, P added that he also shared that D1 would no longer be “in charge of important work”[^51]

> (b)     DI 's take home remuneration plunged from $5000 before deductions for petrol expenses (for e.g., his take home pay was $4,848.23 for the month October 2016) to $1,934.58 for the month of November 2016[^52]

> (c)     On 2 December 2016, P held a meeting with Swee Hock’s employees. D1 was told to leave the meeting. Thereafter, P told Swee Hock’s employees that D1 would be removed from his then current position and that D1 “would no longer have authority to make important decisions in Swee Hock”[^53]

> (d)     On 9 December 2016, P told D1 to hand over his warehouse and car keys and that D1 would have to work under the storeman’s supervision[^54].

98     According to D1, when he was told to work under the storeman’s supervision, he felt humiliated and that he was forced to leave Swee Hock[^55]. Counsel for D1 submitted (and I agree) that based on the facts and circumstances of the case, D1 had constructively been dismissed by P.

99     The concept of constructive dismissal is explained by the Court of Appeal in _Wee Kim san Lawrence Bernard v Robinson & co (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 357</span> ("_Wee Kim San_”) at \[23\]-\[24\] as follows:

> "23    The concept of constructive dismissal and the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in an employment contract are distinct but closely related. "Constructive dismissal refers to the situation where the employer's repudiatory breach entitles the employee to treat himself as discharged from the employment contract; although it is the employee himself who terminates the contract, he is considered as having been "constructively" dismissed by the employer. It is as though the employer had effectively terminated the contract by manifesting an intention no longer to be bound by the contract, which position is then accepted by the employee. The concept was explained thus by Lord Denning MR in the English Court of Appeal decision of Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd vs Sharp <span class="citation">\[1978\] QB 761</span> at 769:

>> If the employer is guilty of conduct which is a significant breach going to the root of the contract of employment, or which shows that the employer no longer intends to be bound by one or more of the essential terms of the contract, then the employee is entitled to treat himself as discharged from any further performance. If he does so, then he terminates the contract by reason of the employer's conduct. He is constructively dismissed. The employee is entitled in those circumstances to leave at the instant without giving any notice at all or, alternatively, he may give notice and say he is leaving at the end of the notice. But the conduct must in either case be sufficiently serious to entitle him to leave at once. "

> 24    The developed formulation of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, as far as the employer is concerned, is that the employer shall not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between employer and employee... A breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence by the employer would constitute a breach of a fundamental term of the contract of employment, and an employee who accepts this breach as a repudiation of the contract would be treated as though he has been "constructively" dismissed by the employer...”

100    Additionally, section 26 of the Employment Act provides that except for deductions authorised under the Act, no deduction from the salary of an employee shall be made by an employer. It is not disputed that P has, unilaterally and without due inquiry or providing any reasons, deducted D1’s salary in the month of November 2016. This therefore is another breach that goes to the root of the employment and a breach that seriously damages the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between employer and employee.

101    In the present case, D1 is relying on P’s constructive dismissal as a repudiatory breach on the part of P as the employer. As I have found in the above, P is in repudiatory breach by unilaterally removing D1’s responsibilities and by drastically reducing his remuneration. The result of this repudiatory breach by P is that D1 is then entitled to accept the breach and to resign without giving notice. Upon acceptance of the repudiatory breach, D1 is also entitled to sue for damages for the wrongful dismissal.

102    With regard to damages, the measure can be calculated to include the amount of salary D1 would have earned for the period until P could have lawfully terminated his service. Section 11 of the Employment Act (Chapter 91) (“EA”) provides that an employer may terminate an employment contract by giving the requisite notice or pay to the employee a sum equal to the amount of salary at the gross rate of pay which would have accrued to the employee during the period of the notice. In the instant case, there is no written contract that provides for the requisite notice period for termination of employment. As such, section 10(2) read with section 10(3) of the EA would apply (_section 10(2) EA provides that the notice period shall be in accordance with section 10(3) in the absence of any provision for the notice_). As D1 has been in the employment of Swee Hock for more than 5 years, the notice period is 4 weeks (_see section 10(3)(d) EA_). Therefore, D1 is entitled to damages in the sum equivalent to 4 weeks’ or one month’s worth of his salary.

103    On D1’s salary, P’s case is that his monthly salary based on official records is $2,600 as at 2016. D1’s case however is that his take home salary is $5000 a month before deductions for petrol expenses[^56]. In cross-examination, P conceded that D1 was paid $5000 before deductions for petrol expenses every month, even though his CPF contribution was calculated based on a monthly salary of $2,600[^57]. In light of this, I find no reason not to use the amount of $5000 for the purpose of calculating the quantum of damages that are due to D1. The damages payable to D1 would therefore be the shortfall in salary for the month of November 2016 and 4 weeks or 1 month’s salary in lieu of notice from 9 December 2016 to 8 January 2017.

104    Hence, DI is entitled to the sum of $8,902.30 for wrongful dismissal, the breakdown of which is as follows:

#### D2’s counterclaim for salary in lieu of notice

105    According to D2, on 5 June 2017, P told her that her last day of work would be 9 June 2017 as Swee Hock was not doing well and that he had no money to pay her salary[^58]. P’s case however is that D2 had resigned on 16 June 2017 upon his invitation and he had invited her to consider resigning because her sales numbers had dropped significantly. P attributed D2’s drastic drop in her sales figures to her poor morale after the departures of both her father and D1[^59]. Based on P’s own testimony, in the case of D2, it would be a constructive dismissal based on alleged poor performance. However, P has not adduced any relevant documentary evidence to support his allegation that D2's sales numbers had dropped significantly, even though such documentary evidence would well be in his possession. Therefore, P’s dismissal of D2 is wrongful as there is no evidence to justify his dismissal.

106    There is also no written contract for D2’s employment. In the same way as I have found in the case of D1, D2 is entitled to a 4-weeks’ or 1 month’s notice for the termination of her service. Taking her testimony that she was told to leave Swee Hock on 5 June 2017, she is entitled to one month’s notice or salary in lieu of that one month’s notice, with the one month calculated from 5 June 2017. As D2 was only paid her salary for the month of June 2017, there is a short payment of salary for the period 1-4 July 2017. Counsel for the Defendants has quantified her pro-rated pay for 1-8 June as $709 based on the claim that her monthly salary was $2600. As P has not adduced any evidence to contradict this claim, I find no reason not to accept that D2’s monthly salary was $2600. Accordingly, D2’s pro-rated salary for 1-4 July 2017 that is due to her would be half of $709, i.e., $354.50.

107    Hence, I award D2 the sum of $354.50 for her counterclaim for wrongful dismissal against P.

#### D3’s counterclaim for salary in lieu of notice

108    Clause 8 of D3's written employment contractwith Swee Hock provides that he has to provide one month’s notice for resignation and that similarly, Swee Hock has the right to terminate his service with one month’s notice if he failed to meet Swee Hock’s performance criteria. As D3 had tendered his resignation on 15 May 2017, his last day of employment should have been 14 June 2017, based on the one-month notice requirement. However, he was told by P that his last day would be 26 May 2017. D3 also testified that he was “forced” by P to sign the documentstating that he had agreed to stop working from 26 May 2017[^60].

109    In contrast, P’s explanation as to why he had asked D3 to leave on 26 May 2017 (before the expiry of his one month’s notice) is because on 26 May 2017, while he was accompanying D3 on the latter's daily work routine, he noticed that D3 was no longer interested in his work as he was seen "dragging his feet" in collecting outstanding debts from customers[^61].

110    Based on the contrasting testimonies of P and D3, I am satisfied that D3 had signed the document stating that he agreed to stop working from 26 May 2017 because he was asked to do so. Nevertheless, his agreement to stop working from 26 May 2017 does not affect his entitlement to salary in lieu of notice because that agreement is not the same as an agreement to waive his salary in lieu of notice. In any event, even if I were to accept P’s own testimony for his termination of D3’s employment, it would be based on alleged poor performance or failure to meet Swee Hock’s performance criteria. In accordance with Clause 8 of D3’s employment contract, P would still be obliged to give D3 one-month’s notice or salary in lieu of notice.

111    Accordingly, D3 is entitled to be paid salary up till 14 June 2017. He is therefore entitled to the short payment of salary for the month of May 2017 and pro-rated salary from 1 to 14 June 2017 in the amount of $1,545.00[^62].

### D1 and D2’s counterclaim for defamation

#### Whether the offending message is defamatory of D1 and D2

112    D1 and D2’s counterclaim for defamation is based on a message published by P on 8 July 2017 sent to 8 people – D2, 2 business partners of Swee Hock, 2 of P’s relatives and 3 former employees. On this counterclaim, I am satisfied that the offending message is defamatory of D1 and D2 and I find P to be liable in damages for defamation.

113    A statement is considered defamatory of an individual if the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of: (a) lowers the individual in the estimation of right-thinking members; (b) causes the individual to be shunned or avoided; or (c) exposes the individual to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

114    In _Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 465</span> (“_Microsoft_”), the Court of Appeal set out at \[53\] the principles applicable in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in a defamation action as follows:

> ". . . The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense... The test is an objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant... The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out. The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines..."

115    Applying the test as set out in _Microsoft_, I am satisfied that an ordinary, reasonable person receiving the said message from P would think that the person or persons referred to in the message has or have “_absconded the company_”, “_instigated his conspirators_”, “_usurped the ancestral assets for himself_”, has or have “_begun deliberate and devious scheme_” with the intention to “_steal P’s business_”. Words such as “abscond”, “usurp”, “steal” clearly have negative connotations, signifying that the acts were done by force or by using illegitimate or wrongful means. It is clear to me that the words would lower the individual or individuals referred to in the estimation of right-thinking members.

116    As for the persons identified in the message, the test of whether the offending words refer to the claimant is an objective one, and it is simply whether the ordinary reasonable person who, at the material time, was aware of the relevant circumstances or special facts (if any) would reasonably understand the claimant to be referred to by the offending words (see _Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien Loon_g <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 52</span> at \[49\]).

117    On the facts, the recipients include the then employees and business partners of Swee Hock who would be aware of D1’s departure on 9 December 2016 and relatives who are aware about the dispute over “ancestral assets” that P is having with D1 and D2’s parents. By the time P sent out this message, D1, D2 and D3 have left Swee Hock. The specific reference, “_he absconded the company on 9 December 2016_” in the message would clearly be understood by the recipients to refer to D1. These recipients who are aware of the relevant circumstances and special facts surrounding the departure of D1 and D2 and of the family dispute between P and the parents of D1 and D2 would therefore understand the offending words to be referring to D1. As for D2, by virtue of her connection with D1, her departure from Swee Hock, and that it was her parents whom P was having a family dispute with, these recipients who have knowledge of the special facts surrounding the circumstances of the message would also reasonably understand the offending words to be referring to D2 as one of D1’s “_conspirators_” mentioned in the offending message as well. In fact, in his cross-examination, P admitted that D2 was one of D1’s conspirators whom he was referring to in the offending message[^63].

118    Therefore, the offending message is clearly defamatory of both D1 and D2.

#### Whether P has established his defence of justification

119    It is clear that the burden of proof lies on P to show that what he has stated in the offending message is substantially true.

120    With regard to the offending words, “_usurped the ancestral assets_”, P had made reference to the incident “on the night of 7 July 2016”. It is not in dispute that this refers to a family meeting on 7 July 2016 regarding the HDB flat that D1 and D2’s parents are residing in. That family dispute is a dispute involving P, P’s brothers and D1 and D2’s parents. Both D1 and D2 are not involved in that family dispute as they are neither owners nor occupiers in that HDB flat. By this fact alone, it is clear that P’s claim that there is justification in his statement, “_on the night of 7 July 2016, (D1) usurped ancestral assets for himself_” would necessarily fail.

121    As for the other aspects of the defamatory statements such as “_D1_ had absconded from the company on 9 December 2016”, “D1 had instigated other conspirators _(such as D2)_ “to steal and rob _Swee Hock’s_ business information which they could use in future”” – in light of my findings that D1’s termination of employment was one that was forced upon him by P; that P has failed to show that there was breach of confidence as well as use of confidential information belonging to Swee Hock, the defence of justification cannot stand.

122    In conclusion, P has failed to establish his defence of justification.

#### Whether P has established his defence of qualified privilege

123    P’s defence of qualified privilege is premised on the following:

> (a)     The recipients of the offending message are P’s family members, former employees and/or business associates;

> (b)     The offending message refers to matters which relate to the character and conduct of DI and/or D2 in their professional capacity as business persons and therefore, P had a legitimate duty and/or interest to communicate the offending message to the recipients who had a legitimate interest to receive and/or be informed of the same.

124    I am of the view that P’s defence of qualified privilege is not established for the following reasons.

125    First, in the offending message, P had alleged that DI had usurped ancestral assets for himself. This statement pertains to P’s and D1’s private family matter and has nothing to do with D1’s conduct in his professional capacity as a business person. In cross-examination, P acknowledged this[^64]. Therefore, in so far as P’s former employees and business associates such as Sin Hua Hock Kee, Santa Boeki Pte Ltd, Koh Gek Chin and Goh Sai Kheng are concerned, there would be no legitimate duty or interest on the part of P to communicate to them that DI had usurped ancestral assets; nor would these recipients have any business or legitimate interest to receive such communication.

126    Further, as noted by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard__v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 506</span> at \[90\], the defence of qualified privilege can be defeated by malice, which may be proven by knowledge of its falsity, or a recklessness, or lack of belief in the defamatory statement; or where there is a genuine or honest belief in the truth of the defamatory statement, but the dominant motive of the sender in sending the message is to injure the other party. In this connection, I find that P was reckless in making the statement that DI had usurped ancestral assets on 7 July 2016 because he knew that the alleged ancestral asset – the HDB flat is not D1’s but his parents’ and P does not have any other evidence to show that D1 has otherwise taken money or benefitted himself by the appropriation of ancestral assets belonging to P's parents.

#### Conclusion on D1 and D2’s counterclaim for defamation

127    In conclusion, D1 and D2’s claim for defamation against P is allowed.

## Conclusion

128    In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s claim against all four Defendants is dismissed. In respect of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff is ordered to pay to the 1st Defendant the sum of $8,902.30, to the 2nd Defendant the sum of $354.50, and to the 3rd Defendant the sum of $1,545.00 for wrongful termination or termination without notice and without salary in lieu of notice respectively. In addition, the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ counterclaim for defamation is allowed. As the Court has been informed via the Plaintiff’s solicitor’s letter dated 25 June 2021, damages to the 1st and 2nd Defendants are awarded at the agreed amounts of $8000 and $4000 respectively. Accordingly, both the costs for the Plaintiff’s claim and for the Defendants’ counterclaim are awarded to the Defendants, with such costs to be fixed by the Court, if not agreed. The Defendants may write in to request the Court to fix the quantum for party and party costs if there is no agreement on the quantum for such costs.
