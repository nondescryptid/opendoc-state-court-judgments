Building and Construction Law – Dispute resolution – Stay of enforcement

Building and Construction Law – Statutes and regulations

20 April 2022

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       An adjudication determination made under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (“**SOPA**”) is unique in that while it is interim in nature, the successful claimant is entitled to enforce the determination with expediency. But what if the respondent eventually secures victory? To protect the respondent’s interest, the court has the discretion to stay enforcement of the adjudication determination where it is sufficiently clear that the monies paid over would not be ultimately recoverable. The reality, however, is that the _possibility_ of non-recovery can hardly ever be ruled out. Deciding where the balance is to be struck is as much a legal question as it is one of policy, considering the purpose of SOPA.

2       The present application in Summons No 3467 of 2021 (“**Application**”) concerned an attempt by Elmeader Pte Ltd (“**Elmeader**”) to stay the enforcement of an adjudication determination obtained by LJH Construction & Engineering Co Pte Ltd (“**LJH**”).

3       After hearing parties, I dismissed Elmeader’s Application. In my view, it was clear that LJH was not in actual insolvency. As to the wider ground premised on the payments being unrecoverable in future, I was of the view that the party resisting enforcement could not simply point to some _possibility_ of non-recovery. It was not even sufficient to prove this to a “_prima facie_” or “_good arguable case_” standard. The court had to be satisfied that it was more likely than not that there _would be no recovery in the future_, and Elmeader had failed to discharge this burden.

4       I set out the detailed grounds of my decision below.

## Factual and Procedural Background

5       Elmeader was the owner of a two-storey conservation building at 28 and 29 Mohamed Sultan Road (the “**Properties**”) and had appointed LJH as the main contractor for construction works at the Properties.

6       Various disputes ensued in respect of these construction works. On 30 June 2021, LJH filed adjudication application SOP/AA 140/2021 (“**SOP 140**”) against Elmeader. On 1 July 2021, the adjudicator issued a determination (which was subsequently revised on 6 July 2021) (collectively, the “**Adjudication Determination**”), ordering Elmeader to pay LJH the sum of S$195,802.51 (inclusive of GST) and costs of S$2,816.78 (collectively, the “**Adjudication Amount**”). On 3 August 2021, LJH filed DC/OSS 137/2021 for leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination pursuant to Section 27 of SOPA. A Deputy Registrar heard the application and judgment was entered on terms of the Adjudication Determination on 10 August 2021 (the “**AD Judgment**”). On 1 September 2021, Elmeader filed the present Application to the stay the enforcement of the AD Judgment.

7       In the meantime, between June and September 2021, Elmeader commenced proceedings in High Court against LJH for damages in respect of alleged breaches in connection with the construction project. To be clear, Elmeader did not apply to set aside the Adjudication Determination or the AD Judgment. Elmeader’s claims in the High Court proceedings related to cross-claims in respect of the same construction project for the Properties.

8       The High Court proceedings were subsequently stayed in favour of arbitration. At the time this Application came up for hearing before me in October 2021, no arbitration proceedings had yet been commenced.

## Issue and Parties’ Positions

9       The only issue in the Application was whether the enforcement of the AD Judgment should be stayed pending the final decision in the prospective arbitration in respect of Elmeader’s cross-claims.

10     Elmeader submitted that a stay should be granted because LJH was insolvent and “_there is a real and significant risk_” that monies paid to LJH pursuant to the AD Judgment would not ultimately be recovered.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) In support of this contention, Elmeader referred to a myriad of circumstances such as LJH’s case-flow issues in end-2016 and early-2017, the late filing of LJH’s annual returns, the unfortunate demise of LJH’s former director, the fact that LJH no longer held a “_builder’s licence_” issued by the Building and Construction Authority (“**BCA**”), questions on LJH’s management accounts and on-going projects and allegedly “_evasive_” conduct on the part of LJH.[^2] I would consider these specific allegations in the course of my decision below. In addition, Elmeader submitted that there was no reason why a stay should not be granted, since LJH’s “_financial distress_” was not caused by Elmeader and LJH was not in a similar financial weakness when parties first entered into the construction agreement in mid-2016.[^3]

11     LJH responded by submitting that it was clearly not in actual and present insolvency.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) As for the alternative argument that monies paid to LJH would not ultimately be recovered, LJH submitted that the threshold for this was high, and that in any event, the evidence showed that LJH was in a healthy financial position with ongoing business. In support, LJH disclosed its management account for the period of January to September 2021,[^5] redacted bank statements for June to September 2021 showing a cash balance of $148,891.71 as at 21 Sept 2021,[^6] as well as an extract of a letter of award issued to LJH by one Sun Global Traders Pte Ltd (“**Sun Global**”) for an on-going project for a de-salination plant on Jurong Island, together with payment claims and payment certificates associated with the said project.[^7]

## My Decision

### The Law

12     It is trite that the court has the power to stay enforcement of an adjudication determination where justice requires it. This follows from the provisional nature of an adjudication determination. The leading authority on this is _W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 380</span> (“**_W Y Steel_**”), where the Court of Appeal held that a stay of an adjudication determination may ordinarily be justified where (at \[70\]):

> (a)     there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency (“**1st Limb**”); or

> (b)     the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent’s favour by a court or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body (“**2nd Limb**”).

13     In addition, a court could also consider whether the claimant’s financial distress was caused by the respondent’s failure to pay the adjudicated amount and whether the claimant was already in a similar state of financial strength or weakness at the time the parties entered into their contract: see _W Y Steel_ at \[70\]. The threshold is a high one and a stay “_will not readily be granted having regard to the overall purpose of the_ \[SOPA\]_, which is precisely to avoid and guard against pushing building and construction companies over the financial precipice_”: see _W Y Steel_ at \[71\] and \[72\].

14     The test laid down in _W Y Steel_ has been consistently applied: see, for example, _Aik Heng Contracts and Services Pte Ltd v Deshin Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 293</span> (“**_Aik Heng_**”); _Kingsford Construction Pte Ltd v Deli Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 174</span>; _Dongah Geological Engineering Co Ltd v Jungwoo E&C Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 239</span>.

15     In _CEQ v CER_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 192</span> (“**_CEQ_**”), the High Court clarified that the 1st Limb and 2nd Limb are disjunctive, and “_the inquiry under the_ \[2nd Limb\] _is broader in nature_” which “_ought to be more properly recognised as a guiding principle that is to be applied in every case_”: see _CEQ_ at \[10\] and \[11\]. There is no closed category of cases falling under the 2nd Limb, but examples include where there is a “_real risk of dissipation of the disputed funds_” and where there is “_prima facie_ _evidence or suspicion that the claimant had been using its claim as an abuse of process_”: see _CEQ_ at \[11\].

16     With these principles in mind, I turn to consider whether Elmeader made out its case for a stay under either the 1st or the 2nd Limb.

### 1st Limb – Was LJH insolvent?

17     In seeking to make out a case under the 1st Limb, Elmeader relied on evidence of financial difficulties which LJH countered in the course of carrying out the constructions works on the Properties in 2016 and 2017. During this period, LJH had on various occasions requested that Elmeader make direct payments to LJH’s sub-contractors and consultants involved in the construction project because of cash-flow issues which LJH faced then.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

18     LJH accepted that it did encounter “_temporary cash flow issues_” in 2017.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) However, LJH submitted that these past cash flow issues did not constitute “_clear evidence_” of LJH’s _present_ insolvency.

19     I agreed with LJH’s submission. As a matter of law, what was relevant was LJH’s financial status _as at the time of the Application_, and not four years ago in 2017: see _Aik Heng_ at \[38\]. At best, past financial impecuniosity _may_ give rise to an _inference_ of present insolvency, but, without more, that could only be a very weak inference, if any at all.

20     Perhaps recognising this, Elmeader submitted further that there was no reason to believe that LJH’s finances would have improved since 2017, since LJH had not been actively carrying on business and was, by 2021, a “_dormant_” company.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) Elmeader relied on the following circumstances to show that LJH was a “_dormant_” company:

> (a)     One of LJH’s former director, one Mr. Lim, passed away in 2019.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

> (b)     LJH was not listed as a licensed “_builder_” in the BCA directory.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> (c)     LJH’s records with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“**ACRA**”) showed that it last filed its annual returns in 2015 and was not GST registered since 2017.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

> (d)     LJH did not appear to be maintaining any office premises. [\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

#### Passing of LJH’s director

21     On the first point, I agreed with LJH that the passing of one of its directors could not show that LJH was insolvent. The correlation was not apparent and not explained by Elmeader.

#### Lack of a builder’s licence

22     As for LJH not being listed as a licensed “_builder_” in the BCA directory, LJH confirmed that was true, but explained that there was no requirement for LJH to be licensed as a “_builder_” for the purpose of carrying out general building works as a _sub-contractor_.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) Under Section 29A of the Building Control Act (Cap. 29), LJH would only need to procure such a licence if it were carrying on the business of a “_general builder_”, which it was not.[^16]

23     I accepted this explanation given by LJH. Elmeader’s counsel also confirmed during the hearing before me that a builder’s licence issued by BCA was _not required_ for LJH to conduct sub-contractor work. However, Elmeader’s counsel submitted that this nevertheless evidenced a change in the business model of LJH and proceeded to postulate that LJH had failed to obtain the licence because LJH could not fulfil the requirement(s) prescribed by BCA for the licenced contractor to demonstrate good financial health. I was unable to accept this and found the submission to be speculative. There was no evidence that LJH “_failed_” to obtain the BCA licence as a general builder because of issues relating to its financial condition. In fact, there was no evidence that LJH even _attempted_ to procure such licence in 2021. There was therefore no basis for Elmeader to speculate the reason(s) for any alleged “_failure_” to obtain such licence. Without more, being a licensed builder was at best equivocal as to the company’s solvency. Licensed builders can be insolvent, and solvent builders can be unlicensed.

#### Non-filing of annual returns

24     As for Elmeader’s submission that LJH failed to file its annual returns, while this was true at the time the Application was made, by the time the Application came up for hearing in October 2021, LJH had already filed its annual returns up to the year of assessment ending April 2021.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) Accordingly, the issue, at its highest, was one of late filing and insufficient to constitute clear evidence of insolvency.

#### Lack of office premises

25     Lastly, I address Elmeader’s allegation that LJH was a dormant company because LJH did not maintain any office premises.

26     As a matter of logic, I was prepared to accept that not having _any_ office premises _might_ be an indicator that the company in question had no on-going operations, but that depended also on the nature of the company’s business. The evidence submitted by Elmeader, however, fell far short.

27     Elmeader gave two reasons for its assertion that LJH did not maintain any office premises:

> (a)     First, when LJH commenced SOP 140, LJH had listed a service address at 240 Macpherson Road. However, according to searches conducted by Elmeader, the 240 Macpherson Road address was not LJH’s registered address and in fact appeared to be the registered address of various other entities unrelated to LJH. [\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (b)     Second, LJH’s registered address was a residential address within a Housing and Development Board estate, and construction works could not possibly be carried on from that residential address.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

28     Based on the foregoing, Elmeader deduced that LJH did not maintain any office premises, and was a dormant company.

29     LJH provided cogent and credible explanations to refute these assertions, and supported them with documentary evidence:

> (a)     First, LJH explained that the 240 Macpherson Road address was a shared office space and this explained the perceived peculiarities noted by Elmeader.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) To substantiate this, LJH exhibited a copy of the sub-tenancy agreement between LJH and one Arma International Pte Ltd (“**Arma**”) which showed that LJH had entered into a two-year lease with Arma for an office space at 240 Macpherson Road, commencing 15 September 2020.[^21] On the face of the sub-tenancy agreement, the lease was still subsisting at the time of the Application. LJH further explained that such “_arrangement to share office is not uncommon in the construction industry as many construction companies do not require a large office space to run their operations_”.[^22] In the case of LJH, since it typically sub-contracted its works and undertook a “_project management and co-ordination_” role, a shared office space was sufficient for its purpose. [^23]

> (b)     As for the use of a residential address as its registered address, LJH explained that was to “_facilitate the physical service of documents or delivery by post_”, to avoid potential complications of delivery at a shared office space where documents may be picked up by employees of other entities.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

30     I accepted these explanations put forward by LJH. I did not consider that there was anything untoward about a company using a shared office space or a residential address as its registered address, particularly considering that most of the work undertaken by LJH could be conducted on-site or remotely. There was no basis to infer that LJH was insolvent simply because it used a shared office space or a residential address for service.

#### Summary on the 1st Limb

31     In summary, I was of the view that Elmeader had failed to show that LJH was insolvent at the time of the Application. The 1st Limb was not made out.

### 2nd Limb – Has Elmeader shown that monies paid to LJH would be unrecoverable?

32     Elmeader’s failure on the 1st Limb was not fatal as its case stood on two legs. In fact, the 2nd Limb was Elmeader’s focus.

33     To justify a stay under the 2nd Limb, Elmeader had to show that if the Application was not granted, monies paid to LJH pursuant to the Adjudication Judgment would not be recoverable if the dispute was eventually resolved in the Elmeader’s favour.

#### Background

34     When the Application was first filed, Elmeader referred to a rather limited set of circumstancing which it said pointed to a “_real risk_” that the monies paid to LJH would not be recoverable:[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

> (a)     The fact that LJH commenced SOP 140 after more than three years of silence after the disputes arose,[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) which meant that LJH “\[did\] _not have an urgent need to collect the adjudicated amount_”.[^27]

> (b)     LJH had taken a loan of around $32,000 from Arma to pay the applications fees and deposits for SOP 140. This showed that LJH was in a weak financial position.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

35     In addition, Elmeader also submitted that there was no reason not to grant the stay because:

> (a)     LJH’s financial distress was not caused by Elmeader’s failure to pay the adjudicated amount;[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> (b)     LJH was not in a similar state of financial weakness at the time parties entered into the construction contract in respect of the Properties in 2016;[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) and

> (c)     Elmeader was prepared to pay the adjudicated sums to a third party escrow agent.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31)

36     However, Elmeader’s case evolved significantly as the matter progressed.

37     To assuage Elmeader’s concerns, LJH’s general manager Mr. Li Dan deposed on affidavit in unequivocal terms that “_LJH_ \[was\] _not facing financial distress_”.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) To substantiate, LJH submitted the following documentary evidence to demonstrate its on-going business activities and solvency status:

> (a)     Extract of a letter of award dated 17 December 2020 issued by Sun Global to LJH (the “**Letter of Award**”), awarding certain sub-contracts to LJH relating to a desalination plant on Jurong Island (the “**Jurong Island Project**”), with an estimated sub-contract sum of $3,500,000;[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

> (b)     Copies of payment claims submitted by LJH to Sun Global and payment certificates issued by Sun Global to LJH for the Jurong Island Project;[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

> (c)     Copy of LJH’s management account for the period from January 2021 to 21 September 2021 (the “**Management Account**”), which showed that LJH generated revenue of $1,147,437.95 during this period, with a net profit of $69,836.52; [\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) and

> (d)     Redacted bank account statements from June 2021 to September 2021 (the “**Bank Statements**”) in respect of LJH’s bank account held with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“**OCBC**”), showing that LJH had been receiving payments from its business activities and that as at 21 September 2021, there was a balance of $148,891 standing to LJH’s credit in the OCBC bank account.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) Although the Bank Statements were redacted for entries unrelated to the Jurong Island Project, the unredacted portions showed the following credits into LJH’s OCBC bank account between June to September 2021: [^37]

38     Unfortunately, LJH’s attempt to explain appeared only to have fueled Elmeader’s suspicion. A myriad of accusations were levied by Elmeader on the information and documents provided by LJH:

> _On the Management Account_

> (a)     The Management Account was unreliable and/or did not assist LJH because:

>> (i)       it was unaudited;[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

>> (ii)       it was unclear who prepared the Management Account, and whether such person had the “_relevant and requite knowledge_” to do so;[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

>> (iii)       there was a “_lack of explanation_” given by LJH on various “_line items_” in the Management Account. For example, LJH did not explain “_whether the ‘Accounts Receivable’ in the Balance Sheet are actually receivables that can be collected_” or bad debts;[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

>> (iv)       it was unclear if the “_Nett Ordinary Income_” recorded on the Management Account would be “_retained in cash_” until the end of the arbitration proceedings;[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)

>> (v)       there were “_considerable doubts on the face of the_ \[Management Account\]”, for example, it was unclear where LJH would store its “_Plant and Machinery_” allegedly worth $98,201.40 as indicated in the Management Account.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42)

> _On the Bank Statements_

> (b)     The Bank Statements did not show that LJH was in good financial health because:

>> (i)       they were redacted and therefore “_insufficient_”; [\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

>> (ii)       LJH’s conduct in redacting the Bank Statements was “_evasive_” and this suggested that “_LJH simply_ \[did\] _not have much money in its bank account_”;[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44)

>> (iii)       the unredacted portions of the Bank Statements showed that monies deposited into LJH’s account were often withdrawn very shortly after.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)

> _On the Jurong Island Project_

> (c)     There were “_numerous doubts as to the veracity of LJH’s alleged involvement in the_ \[Jurong Island Project\]”[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) because:

>> (i)       a “_personal contact_” of one of Elmeader’s representatives visited the site of the Jurong Island Project on 5 October 2021 (the “**Visit**”) and it was observed that the “_signboard located outside the site_” which set out the main contractor and other “_key personnel/companies involved_” in the project did not mention Sun Global or LJH;[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

>> (ii)       it was “_highly improbable_” that the main civil and structural contractor for the Jurong Island Project, one Zhengda Corporation Pte Ltd (“**Zhengda**”), would have subcontracted the works to Sun Global and then onto LJH, because LJH and Zhengda were previously engaged in litigation in 2019;[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

>> (iii)       photographs of the project site taken during the Visit showed “_no sign of any presence or activity of Sun Global or LJH at the site_”;[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

>> (iv)       it was unusual for the Letter of Award to be issued in December 2020, when the expected completion date for the Jurong Island Project as indicated on the “_signboard outside the project site_” was April 2020;[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50)

>> (v)       the “_scale and magnitude_” of the Jurong Island Project was “_inconsistent with Sun Global_\[‘s\] _profile and scale of operations_”;[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)

>> (vi)       it was “_implausible_” that works in the Jurong Island Project would be subcontracted to a small company like LJH;[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52)

>> (vii)       yet another “_personal contact_” of Elmeader’s representative visited the alleged “_registered office_” of Sun Global, and found the premises to be vacant with advertisements putting the premises up for rental.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53)

39     Although the issues raised by Elmeader were numerous, they can broadly be summarised as follows:

> (a)     First, LJH had no on-going business (see \[38(c)\] above);

> (b)     Second, LJH was lacking in funds (see \[34(b)\] and \[38(b)(iii)\] above); and

> (c)     Third, LJH had been evasive and selective about the evidence put forth in this Application (see \[38(a)\] to \[38(c)\] above).

#### LJH’s on-going business

40     I did not accept Elmeader’s submission that LJH had no on-going business and specifically reject the suggestion that LJH was not actually involved in the Jurong Island Project.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) Although Elmeader did not put it in so many words, the clear insinuation was that LJH had fabricated evidence as to its involvement in the Jurong Island Project. In my view, Elmeader did not have good grounds to make such serious allegation (even by insinuation).

41     As a starting point, it must be noted that Elmeader’s director (who affirmed affidavits in support of this Application) admitted that he was “_in no position to personally ascertain matters regarding the_ \[Jurong Island Project\]”.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) This must be right, as Elmeader was not involved in the Jurong Island Project. Notwithstanding, Elmeader proceeded to question “_the veracity of LJH’s alleged involvement_”[^56] in the Jurong Island Project and sought to “_put_ \[LJH\] _to strict proof_”[^57] on this issue.

42     Elmeader was misconceived as to where the burden lied. The Application was Elmeader’s. The burden was on Elmeader to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that monies paid to LJH would be unrecoverable. If Elmeader wished to assert that the monies would be unrecoverable because LJH had no on-going business operations, then Elmeader had to prove that. It was not for Elmeader to put LJH “_to strict proof_” on an issue which Elmeader bore the burden of proving.

43     More importantly, there was no good reason for Elmeader to suggest that LJH was not involved in the Jurong Island Project. Such involvement was clearly documented in the Letter of Award and there was no evidence that the Letter of Award was forged or fabricated.

44     Insofar as Elmeader’s suspicion arose out of LJH’s apparent lack of “_presence_”[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) at the Jurong Island Project site during the Visit, this was immaterial. LJH never claimed to be so substantially involved in the Jurong Island Project such that its present on-site could reasonably be expected around the clock. That being the case, what significance was there to LJH not having been seen working on site on the _one particular occasion_ of the Visit? If there was no reason to expect LJH’s personnel to be onsite on the date and time of the Visit, then their absence on such an occasion was immaterial.

45     As to the lack of mention of LJH on the “_signboard_” at the project site, I did not consider that unusual given LJH’s limited involvement in the Jurong Island Project. There was no reason to expect that the names of all the sub-contractors involved in the project would be listed on the signboard. Even on Elmeader’s own case, the signboard listed only the “_key personnel/companies involved_” in the Jurong Island Project.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59)

46     I also did not find it difficult to believe that LJH could have been awarded a sub-contract for the Jurong Island Project despite its earlier dispute with Zhengda in 2019. There are no forever friends or enemies in business. Rather, the previous litigation between LJH and Zhengda tended to suggest, albeit weakly, that LJH was not a “_dormant_” company as alleged by Elmeader.

47     As to why LJH could have been awarded a sub-contract for the Jurong Island Project in December 2020 even though the original expected completion date was April 2020, LJH had already explained that the project had been delayed due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and variation works. The project was therefore only expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) In fact, photographs taken of the project site during the Visit showed that the Jurong Island Project was still on-going in October 2021 (i.e. long _after_ the original expected completion date of April 2020) and was not abandoned. This was consistent with LJH’s evidence that the project had been delayed. Seen in that light, there was nothing unusual with LJH having been awarded a sub-contractor in December 2020.

48     Lastly, I saw no merit in Elmeader’s bald assertion that the “_scale and magnitude_” of the Jurong Island Project was “_inconsistent with Sun Global’s and/or LJH’s profile and scale of operations_”.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) This assertion was made on the thin basis that Sun Global had only one director and one shareholder, making it a “_one man show_”, that Sun Global “_may_” be operating out of a shared office and that LJH was neither GST registered nor licensed as a “_general builder_” by BCA, with a nominal number of employees. I was prepared to accept that both Sun Global and LJH are companies of relatively small scale. But that was as far as it could go. What basis was there to assert or infer that such companies, because they were of a relatively small scale, could not conceivably be involved in the Jurong Island Project? I was unable to discern any.

49     Accordingly, I declined to accept Elmeader’s submission that LJH was not involved in the Jurong Island Project and had no on-going business.

50     Before leaving this point, I should add that a lack of current business activities, even if proven, was but _one possible basis upon which to infer_ that monies paid would be unrecoverable. It was not conclusive of the test under the 2nd Limb. For example, if the company had no income from on-going business activities but also no liability, and there was no other reason to think that the adjudicated sums once paid over would be quickly dissipated, then the lack of business activities alone should not ordinarily lead to an inference that adjudicated sums would be unrecoverable. Elmeader’s case proceeded on the basis that LJH had to demonstrate that it had sufficient income-generating businesses “_that would generate sufficient funds for_ \[LJH\] _to repay the adjudicated amount to Elmeader_”.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) That was a false premise. There was no need for the recipient to “_generate sufficient funds_” (or demonstrate its ability to do so) for possible future repayment, if there was no basis to think that the monies paid would be dissipated in the first place.

#### LJH’s financial status

51     Elmeader’s case was that LJH was lacking in funds. LJH disputed this.

52     The documentary evidence provided by LJH showed:

> (a)     there was a sum of $148,891 standing to LJH’s credit in its OCBC bank account as at 21 September 2021;[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

> (b)     LJH’s unaudited management account showed that LJH generated revenue of $1,147,437.95 between January 2021 to 21 September 2021, with a net profit of $69,836.52; [\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

> (c)     LJH received credits in excess of $800,000 between June and September 2021 in its OCBC bank account, although there were also substantial withdrawals from that same account;[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) and

> (d)     LJH’s unaudited management account showed that LJH had “_Retained Earnings_” of $78,017.26.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66) These “_Retained Earnings_” were maintained in LJH’s OCBC bank account and formed part of the account balance of $148,891 as at 21 September 2021.[^67]

53     The documentary evidence submitted by LJH, taken at face value, showed that LJH was a company with cash in hand in excess of $140,000 and was generating modest profit through its business activities. On its face, LJH was not in financial distress as suggested by Elmeader.

54     Elmeader’s case was that these document should not be taken at face value. In this connection, Elmeader raised numerous questions on the Management Account and the Bank Statements (see \[38(a)\] and \[38(b)\] above).

55     I deal first with the Management Account. Elmeader took issue with the fact that the Management Account was not audited and it was not clear who prepared it. Questions were raised on various “_line items_” in the Management Account, although Elmeader proffered no answer to these questions.

56     It was undisputed that LJH was an exempt private limited company and was exempted from filing audited accounts or financial statements.[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) Although LJH had previously procured audited financial statements, they were only up to the year ending 30 September 2019.[^69] Thereafter, there was no evidence that LJH continued to prepare audited financial statements and/or that it was under any obligation to do so. As a result, LJH submitted and I accepted that it was reasonable for LJH to have shown the Management Account instead of audited financial statements prepared back in 2019, as the latter would have little relevance to this Application (see \[19\] above).

57     As for Elmeader’s complaint about the lack of explanation on “_line items_” in the Management Account, it was insufficient for Elmeader to raise questions without providing any basis for an answer. For a start, how would the court be in a position to determine if Elmeader had even raised legitimate questions which call for answers? The Management Account was an accounting document and although it was possible to discern certain information on the face of it, Elmeader’s complaints went further than that. For example, Elmeader submitted that the Management Account comprised only a “_barebones_” profit & loss statement and balance sheet, that there was a “_complete lack of explanation of the line items_”, and that there was an “_absence of source of documents_” in the Management Account.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) For the court to accept these submissions and to conclude on such basis that the Management Account was therefore “_unreliable_”, the court had to be in a position to assess, preferably with the assistance of evidence from an accounting expert, what level of information or detail a management account would _typically_ contain and whether, against such backdrop, the Management Account in question can be said to be inadequate, inconsistent or unreliable. There was simply no such evidence before me.

58     In fact, at the hearing of the Application, Elmeader’s counsel confirmed that it was _not_ that Elmeader’s case that the Management Account was fabricated or inaccurate, and Elmeader had no evidential basis to make such serious allegations. In those circumstances, what relevance was there to the questions raised by Eleamder? If Elmeader accepted that the Management Account accurately showed that LJH had cash of $148,891 and generated profits of around $69,000 between January to September 2021, then what was the relevance of an inquiry into where LJH could have stored its “_Plant and Machinery_” [\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) or how likely it was for LJH to recover its outstanding “_Accounts Receivable_”? [^72] Given Elmeader’s confirmation that it was not challenging the authenticity or accuracy of the Management Account, I considered it unnecessary to deal with each of the questions raised by Elmeader on the document. There would have been insufficient evidential basis for me to venture such an attempt in any event.

59     I next address the issues raised by Elmeader on the Bank Statements (see \[38(b)\] above). Elmeader submitted that the Bank Statements were redacted and such “_evasive_” conduct showed that “_LJH simply_ \[did\] _not have much money in its bank account_”.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) Elmeader further submitted that LJH was in a dire financial situation, because the unredacted portions of the Bank Statements showed that monies deposited into LJH’s account were often withdrawn very shortly after.[^74]

60     I did not consider it possible to conclude that LJH was evasive or lacking in funds simply because it chose to redact the Bank Statements. Bank statements are confidential documents and it was understandable that LJH would not wish to turn over its filing cabinet to Elmeader unless there was a need to do so. More importantly, the fact of the matter was that the Bank Statements showed that LJH had $148,891 standing to its credit as at 21 September 2021 and this was the _most recent_ status of LJH’s OCBC bank account. That being the case, it was inconceivable how any _prior_ redacted entries could have established that “_LJH simply_ \[did\] _not have much money in its bank account_”.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75)

61     As for the frequent withdrawals from the OCBC bank account, this was not disputed by LJH. LJH’s explanation was that such withdrawals were in the ordinary course of business, and that this pattern of conduct was not uncommon in the construction industry. I accepted this explanation. Cash-flow is the life-blood of the construction industry. A high frequency of cash (or cash-like) transactions was therefore only to be expected of a company in the construction industry with on-going business. This was also consistent with the nature of LJH’s operations as a construction “_project management_” [\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) company, which meant that LJH would likely have to pass on project payments to its sub-contractors frequently and quickly. In fact, I would have found it strange if all the project payments received by LJH had remained intact in its bank account.

62     In view of the foregoing, I was not satisfied that Elmeader had shown that LJH was a company in a dire financial situation.

#### Alleged evasive conduct on the part of LJH

63     Elmeader’s allegation that LJH had “_acted evasively in proving its viability as a company_”[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) was intertwined with the issues raised by Elmeader on the Management Account, Bank Statements and the Jurong Island Project. I had already dealt with them at \[44\] to \[48\] and \[55\] to \[60\] above, and do not propose to repeat. In short, I did not agree that LJH had acted “_evasively_”. LJH provided documentary evidence of its financial position and its on-going business. The evidence were relevant, cogent and of probative value. Insofar as some of the documents were redacted (i.e. the Bank Statements), there were reasonable grounds for LJH to have redacted the document. The redaction also did not affect the probative value of the unredacted portions. Accordingly, I did not consider such conduct to be “_evasive_” (see \[60\] above). As for evidence which LJH had but did not produce (i.e. the 2019 financial statement), I had explained why such evidence had little relevance to the question at hand (see \[56\] above). That being the case, it was reasonable for LJH not to have produced the document, and the lack of such production therefore did not mean LJH was being “_evasive_”.

64     Accordingly, I was not satisfied that LJH had been “_evasive_” in the presentation of evidence in this Application, and there was insufficient basis for me to infer that LJH was in a dire financial position.

#### Other factors

65     For completeness, Elmeader also relied on the following to establish that it was unlikely to recover the Adjudication Amount from LJH:

> (a)     First, that LJH had brought its claims in SOP 140 after more than three years of silence, and LJH’s claim in SOP 140 initially included amounts which Elmeader had already paid directly to LJH’s sub-contractors;[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78)

> (b)     Second, that in or around April 2021, LJH took a loan from Arma to pay the application fees and deposit for SOP 140, amounting to around $34,000.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79)

66     These could be dealt with briefly.

67     On the alleged delay in the commencement of SOP 140, I was unable to see how such delay gave rise to an inference that Elmeader would be unable to recover the Adjudication Amount. As noted in _SH Design & Build Pte Ltd v BD Cranetech Pte Ltd_ \[2018\] SGH 133 (at \[90\]), arguments like this was a double-edged sword because it could just as well suggest that LJH was not in any financial difficulties, and therefore not in a hurry to recover on any adjudication award.

68     As for the loan from Arma, LJH explained that Arma was a related company and the loan was simply a “_related company loan_” which was not uncommon.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) Elmeader submitted that Arma and LJH were not in fact “_related companies_” because the two companies only had a common director. I was inclined to agree with Elmeader that Arma and LJH were not “_related companies_” in the strict sense of the term, but found this inquiry to be a red herring. Ultimately, the issue was whether the taking of a $34,000 loan (a fact not disputed by LJH) showed that LJH was so impecunious that the Adjudicated Amount paid by Elmeader would eventually be unrecoverable. I was not satisfied that was the case. Based on the evidence adduced in this Application, at the time of this Application, LJH had more than sufficient funds in its bank account to repay the $34,000 loan to Arma (if the loan was still outstanding). There was therefore insufficient basis for me to conclude that funds paid to LJH would be unrecoverable because it would have been applied towards the discharge of existing liabilities. Further, even if the taking of the loan suggested that LJH was cash-strapped in April 2021, it must not be forgotten that the loan was taken for the specific purpose of enabling LJH to commence SOP 140. Accordingly, I would have been prepared to accept that in any event, the need for the loan was occasioned by Elmeader’s conduct.

#### Summary on the 2nd Limb

69     Elmeader relied heavily on the decision in _CEQ_ (see \[15\] above) in advancing its case under the 2nd Limb, and it was therefore only right that I addressed this decision before concluding on the 2nd Limb.

70     In _CEQ_, the High Court granted a stay under the 2nd Limb. The decision in _CEQ_ turned mainly on the respondent’s evasive conduct and failure to address the material allegations made against it. In this regard, the High Court Judge noted that the respondent in _CEQ “chose to largely remain silent in the face of numerous and serious allegations levelled against it”_ and only responded selectively and inadequately when given an opportunity to do so: see _CEQ_ at \[19\]. The frustration of the High Court Judge arising from such evasive conduct was apparent (at \[21\]):

> The simplest way in which the Respondent can prove that it has ongoing work and receivables would be to adduce evidence of its bank account and the relevant transactions before the court. In the event that it is unable to do so for valid reasons, the Respondent could simply state those reasons on affidavit. Not only was this a point that I had made repeatedly to the Respondent, I had given ample opportunity to it to provide the evidence or explanation. Despite this, it stubbornly maintains its position and repeatedly refuses to either disclose the information or to even explain its refusal to do so.

71     It was in view of the deafening silence on the part of the respondent and the outright refusal to provide some semblance of an explanation or clarification to address the allegations against it that the High Court had found it appropriate to draw the necessary inference against the respondent in _CEQ_, and conclude that the respondent was being evasive.

72     The case at hand, however, was far removed from the situation in _CEQ_. This was not a case where LJH has failed to provide “_a shred of positive evidence_” in its favour and sought to rely only on legal submissions: see _CEQ_ at \[20\]. To the contrary, as mentioned, LJH provided the Management Accounts, the Bank Statements, its tenancy agreement and the Letter of Award relating to the Jurong Island Project (see \[29\] and \[37\] above).

73     Of course, at each turn Elmeader questioned the explanations and evidence provided by LJH. However, as I had explained above, many of the issues raised by Elmeader were speculative and/or immaterial. They could not, in my view, form sufficient basis for this court to draw any adverse inference against LJH.

74     As Elmeader’s counsel candidly acknowledged, Elmeader’s case was _not_ that LJH had fabricated evidence as to its involvement in the Jurong Island Project or that the Management Account was inaccurate or manipulated. Rather, Elmeader’s case was that LJH was a company that was living “_from hand to mouth_” and this gave rise to an inference that monies paid to LJH would not be recoverable in the future.

75     Having reviewed the evidence in detail, I was prepared to accept that LJH did not appear to be a very profitable company. As Elmeader pointed out, even LJH’s own Management Accounts showed that LJH’s net income from January to September 2021 was only $69,836.52, which translated to around $7,700 per month. Further, it was apparent from the unredacted portions of the Bank Statements that project payments which LJH received were frequently transferred out of its bank account shortly after receipt.

76     However, “_not very profitable_” was a qualitatively different evaluation from being in “_financial distress_”[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81) and, for that matter, neither was the test.

77     The test under the 2nd Limb required the court to be satisfied “_on a balance of probabilities_” that the monies paid to the claimant “_would not ultimately be recovered_”: see _W Y Steel_ at \[70\]. Accordingly, Elmeader could not simply point to _some possibility_ of non-recovery. Elmeader must prove that it is _more likely than not_ that there would be _no recovery_ in the future. This burden could not be discharged simply by showing that LJH was not a very profitable company, or even by showing that LJH was in some degree of financial distress. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, even evidence of “_serious_” financial difficulties would not usually suffice: see _W Y Steel_ at \[68\]. There had to be something more. Otherwise, the 2nd Limb would simply be a convenient back-door to the 1st Limb, rendering the 1st Limb otiose.

78     In saying the foregoing I recognised that requiring an applicant to prove the _certainty_ of a future event (i.e. non-recovery of payment) on a balance of probabilities at this interlocutory stage was a high threshold. However, in my view, the bar was intentionally set as such, and for a good reason. As the Court of Appeal explained in _W Y Steel_ (at \[71\]):

> In our judgment, a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination may ordinarily be justified where there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency, or where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered…

> In the course of the arguments before us, **it was suggested that the above approach would tilt the balance unduly in favour of the successful claimant and place the unsuccessful respondent unfairly at risk**. It was also suggested that this would leave a successful claimant in an adjudication under the Act in a better position than a party who had succeeded at a trial but where an appeal was pending. Whether that is true or not, the comparison is not one that is apt. **An adjudication determination is provisional in the sense that it may ultimately be reversed** if it is challenged in a court or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body. **However, as far as the rights of the parties to the adjudication are concerned, to the extent that the adjudication determination remains intact pending any such challenge, it has the effect of absolutely and conclusively determining the parties’ rights until and unless it is eventually reversed** in accordance with the provisions of the Act …. **Hence, while we are prepared to recognise the possibility of granting a stay of enforcement** of an adjudication determination because of the possibility of a different outcome emerging eventually, **a stay will not readily be granted having regard to the overall purpose of the Act**, which is precisely to avoid and guard against pushing building and construction companies over the financial precipice.

(emphasis added in bold)

79     On the facts of this case, I was not satisfied that Elmeader had adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy the test under the 2nd Limb.

## Conclusion

80     For the reasons given above, I dismissed the Application. Having heard the parties on costs, I ordered that costs of the Application be paid by Elmeader to LJH fixed at $2,500 (all in).

81     In conclusion I wished to record my appreciation to counsel for both Elmeader and LJH for their detailed and measured submissions, which assisted me greatly in my consideration of this Application.
