He also consented to the remaining charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. He was sentenced to 29 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane in total. He is appealing against his sentence which he is now serving.

6       I ordered the imprisonment sentences for two charges (emphasised in bold) to run consecutively. These two charges (“**two material charges**”) comprise the reduced drug-trafficking charge and the charge for unlawful assembly. The imprisonment sentences for the remaining 4 proceeded charges were ordered to run concurrently.

7       The total sentence added up to 29 years and 3 months’ imprisonment and 25 strokes of the cane. In view of s 328 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Cap. 68) (“CPC”), the sentence of caning is limited to 24 strokes. The imprisonment sentence was also back-dated to 19 April 2017 i.e. the day he was first remanded.

> **14**      **As Devin, Dinesh and their friends walked closer towards the group of Malay males, Devin noticed that they were behaving aggressively and tried to avoid them whilst heading to the carpark. However, Abdul Rahim confronted Devin and claimed that Devin had been staring at them. Abdul Rahim repeatedly asked Devin what he was looking at before the entire group of Malay males charged towards Devin and Dinesh and started attacking them. Alex, who was nearby, heard the commotion and came over to assist Devin and Dinesh, but was punched in the eye and all over his body by the group of Malay males.**

> **15**      **The common object of the group of Malay males (including the accused) was to voluntarily cause hurt to the victims and all the members of the group had intentionally joined the group being aware of that common object. The assault on Devin and Dinesh was sustained and attracted the attention of several members of public in the vicinity, who called the police.

## Antecedents

9       Apart from the drugs-related prior convictions which form the predicate antecedents for the present charges which rendered the accused liable for enhanced punishments, the prosecution did not highlight or rely on other antecedents.[^3] The predicate antecedents were of course embodied in the charges and SOF which the accused had already admitted. In particular, the accused has a set of previous convictions in December 2011 which included a conviction for drug-trafficking also of diamorphine. He was sentenced in total to 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. That would mean that the present set of drugs offences were committed not long after his release from prison.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

10     The prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 29 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for the reduced drug-trafficking charge and at least 3 months’ imprisonment for the charge of unlawful assembly. The learned DPP also proposed various sentences for the remaining 4 proceeded charges. The learned DPP asked that the imprisonment sentences for only the two material charges to run consecutively.

## Mitigation

11     Counsel for the accused presented a very brief oral mitigation._[^4]_ The court was told that the accused is 34 years old and married with two young children. He was employed at the time of the offences but committed the offences due to gambling debts. Counsel accepted that the amount of drugs was reduced from 16.98 grams to 14.99 grams. Counsel also acknowledged that the accused has prior convictions for drug-trafficking and accepted the prosecution’s sentencing position that the starting point (in respect of the reduced drug-trafficking charge) ought to be 29 years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, counsel urged the court not to impose a crushing sentence in respect of the reduced drug-trafficking charge due to the accused’s plea of guilt, co-operation with the investigations and the fact that he was only in his thirties. In short, counsel was asking for a further discount off the 29-year imprisonment sentence sought by the prosecution.

12     In respect of the remaining proceeded charges, counsel fully accepted the prosecution’s sentencing position and proposals. In particular, counsel had no quarrels with the prosecution’s submission for a 3-month imprisonment sentence for the charge of unlawful assembly, and to run the sentences in respect of only the two material charges consecutively.

## Reasons for Sentence

13     As noted above, counsel for the accused largely accepted the prosecution’s submission on sentence, except that he was urging the court to give a lower sentence than the 29-year imprisonment term that the prosecution sought in respect of the reduced drug-trafficking charge. In terms of the number of sentences to run consecutively, the accused could not have gotten a better outcome than what was ordered i.e. the imprisonment sentences running consecutively for only the two material charges.

#### Prescribed punishment

14     In respect of the reduced drug-trafficking charge, the prescribed punishment is a minimum imprisonment term of 20 years going up to a maximum term of 30 years, plus 15 strokes of the cane.

15     In arriving at their submission[^5] for 29 years’ imprisonment for trafficking a quantity of not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine, the prosecution referred to Menon CJ’s sentencing metrics when considering repeat drug-trafficking offences in _PP v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 151</span> (“_Lai Teck Guan_”) at \[38\]: (i) the quantity of drugs and (ii) the circumstances in which the repeat offence came about (e.g. how soon after did the repeat offender commit the repeat offence after his last conviction). The prosecution further referred to and relied on the sentencing tables (adapted from _Lai Teck Guan_) in _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 260</span> at \[44\] and \[55\] with respect to sentencing first-time and repeat drug-traffickers:

16     I agreed with prosecution’s submission that given the weight of the diamorphine that was trafficked and the role of the accused, the minimum uplift in sentence would be appropriate i.e. 29 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, because the accused acted mostly alone and that the drug-trafficking was not sophisticated and he also did not take active or special efforts to avoid detection.

17     It bears repeating that counsel for the accused did not disagree with the starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, he gave three reasons why a lower sentence should perhaps be considered. I did not agree with the reasons canvassed because:

> (i)     The sentencing framework would have factored in the fact that the accused was pleading guilty;

> (ii)     There was no elaboration as to how the accused had co-operated with investigations; and

> (iii)     The overall sentence was not at all crushing given that only two imprisonment sentences were ordered to run consecutively and the second term of imprisonment was a very short 3-month sentence.

18     On the other hand, there were good arguments in support of an even longer aggregate term of imprisonment i.e. the overall culpability as reflected by the number of charges; his specific role as a seller and not merely that of a courier; the principal of escalation in that the accused has committed a greater number and more serious offences; and that the present offences were committed shortly after release from prison for similar drugs-related offences demonstrating that he is a recalcitrant and persistent offender. Given these aggravating facts and circumstances, the prosecution’s submission for only two sentences to run consecutively would appear to be most charitable.

19     I further find nothing exceptional and mitigating in the personal circumstances of the accused. Therefore, his personal and family circumstances had no mitigating value. The fact that he had committed the drugs-related offences because of gambling debts was hardly mitigating.

20     At the end of the day, I did not think that the mitigating factors relied upon by counsel would justify reducing the sentence sought by the prosecution.

#### Charges taken into consideration

21     The accused also consented for 30 charges to be taken into consideration by the court for sentencing purposes. The effect of taking into consideration outstanding charges (especially since these are also drugs-related) is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in respect of the proceeded charges (see _PP v UI_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 500 at \[38\]). There was therefore legal justification to impose a higher sentence than what would ordinarily be imposed for the reduced drug-trafficking charge.

## Conclusion

22     At the end of the day, the rationale underpinning the various principles to be considered when determining the global sentence is that of proportionality in punishment (see _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span>).

23     Bearing this in mind, I was satisfied that having regard to the facts of the case, the overall culpability of the accused, the multiplicity of the charges, and applying the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence, I am of the view that the global sentence imposed is by no means excessive.
