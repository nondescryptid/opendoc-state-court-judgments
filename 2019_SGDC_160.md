## Statement of Facts

4       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts below without qualification -

**_Public Prosecutor v Lim Kim Guan_**

**_SC-907686-2018_**

**_STATEMENT OF FACTS_**

_(Incorporating 4 charges)_

> _1_.     _The accused, Lim Kim Guan, is a 35-year-old male Singapore Citizen. At the material time, the accused was employed as an Associate Engineer by NetLink Trust Operations Company Pte Ltd (“_ **_NLTOC_** _”). NLTOC is one of the subsidiaries of NetLink Trust (“_ **_NetLink_** _”) which is the owner and operator of the fibre network in Singapore. As the Associate Engineer of NLTOC, the accused undertook duties for NetLink._

> _Background Facts_

> _2_.     _The accused was employed as an Associate Engineer from October 2014 up to September 2017 when his employment was terminated by NLTOC. As the Associate Engineer for NetLink, the accused was in charge of routine maintenance, ad-hoc repair and replacement and projects for the 7 facilities under NetLink and would need to call for contractors for quotations if works were required. The accused also liaised with the Managing Agent of these 7 facilities and oversaw their inspection of repairs and maintenance works carried out by the relevant contractors._

> _3_.     _Under NetLink’s procurement policy, if the value of the works exceeds $200,000, a tender must be called. If these works do not exceed $200,000, the user department can decide whether to call for a tender or source for 3 independent quotes. The accused was in charge of sourcing for such quotes for the 7 facilities under NetLink before recommending the suitable contractor to his superior for approval._

> _4_.     _On 30 November 2015, NetLink awarded a 3-year term contract (“_ **_Term Contract_** _”) worth $152,055 to Liong Construction Pte Ltd (“_ **_Liong Construction_** _”). Under the Term Contract, Liong Construction was required to carry any plumbing works for all 7 facilities under NetLink. On 8 April 2016, Liong Construction was also awarded a 6-month contract, starting from May 2016, worth $357,505 by NetLink for the removal of aesthetic mortar boxes and repainting and repair works of NetLink’s Ang Mo Kio Central Office. The accused got to know Liong Kah Wei Jason (“_ **_Jason Liong_** _”), Manager of Liong Construction, when Liong Construction was awarded the Term Contract._

> _Facts relating to the 5th, 10th and 12th Charges – DAC-927634-2018, DAC-927639-2018 and DAC-927641-2018_

> _5_.     _Between 2016 and 2017, various works had to be carried out at the 7 facilities under NetLink and the accused was tasked by his superior to source for quotes for these works. As these works were below $200,000, the accused knew he was required to source for 3 quotes from 3 independent contractors._

> _6_.     _For these works, the accused did not source for 3 independent quotes but instead agreed with Jason Liong for the latter to submit support quotes, together with quotes from Liong Construction, for these works. These support quotes were purportedly issued by different bidding companies and were in fact fictitious quotes contained fixed-up prices so that Liong Construction can secure these projects with NetLink._

> _7_.     _Pursuant to the agreement between the accused and Jason Liong, the accused received the following documents from Jason Liong for the respective works:_

> _8_.     _The above stated document were quotations created by Jason Liong using the letterhead of the company involved. The document contained defective statements as the quotation set out in these document was fixed-up by Jason Liong so that Liong Construction can be awarded the respective works._

> _9_.     _When the accused received these documents from Jason Liong, he knew that these were support quotes intended to mislead NetLink into believing that these were independent quotes sourced from open market. The accused then proceeded to submit these quotes to his superior together with the relevant quote from Liong Construction in order to recommend for Liong Construction to be awarded the works. Liong Construction was eventually awarded the respective works by NetLink._

> _10_.     _Had NetLink known that the quotes the accused provided were support quotes, it would not have accepted these quotes and would not have given approval for Liong Construction to be awarded with these projects as the procurement process of NetLink had been compromised._

> _11_.     _By the foregoing, the accused being an agent of NetLink did knowingly use with intent to deceive NetLink the above stated documents which were submitted to NetLink and contained defective statements that were intended to mislead NetLink, and he has thereby committed offences under section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241 (“PCA”)._

> _Facts relating to the 1st Charge - DAC-927614-2018_

> _12_.     _Sometime during late-January 2017, the accused and Jason Liong met to discuss about work matters. When Jason Liong went into the accused’s car, he took out a white envelope and placed it inside the glove compartment of the accused’s car. The accused opened the envelope and saw a stack of cash in the denominations of $50/-, amounting to $2,500/-. The accused understood the monies was for allowing Jason Liong to submit support quotes for the NetLink’s works and enabling Liong Construction to be awarded these works._

> _13_.     _The accused knew he was not allowed to receive such monies but proceeded to keep these monies. He thereafter used the monies for his own family expenses._

> _14_.     _By the foregoing, the accused being an agent of NetLink had corruptly received gratification from Jason Liong as an inducement to advance the business interest of Liong Construction with NetLink and he has thereby committed an offence under section 6(a) of the PCA._

> _Others_

> _15_.     _In December 2017, the accused surrendered the sum of $8,000 to CPIB. On 3 August 2018, NetLink had terminated the Term Contract with Liong Construction before the expiry of the term. As of that date, Liong Construction is no longer a vendor of NetLink._

## TIC Charges

5       The accused also consented to have 13 other charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Three of these charges were for accepting bribes under s 6 (a) of the PCA and 10 other TIC charges under s. 6 (c) of the PCA for the offence of an agent using a document with intent to deceive a principal.

## Antecedents

6       The accused is untraced.

## Prescribed Punishment

7       The prescribed punishment for the offence of an agent accepting a bribe under section 6 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both. There is a similar punishment under section 6 (c) of the PCA for the offence of an agent using a document with intent to deceive a principal and which contained false statements knowingly intending to mislead the principal.

## Prosecution submissions

8       The Prosecution had submitted for 4 weeks’ imprisonment for each proceeded charge and a global sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

9       The following aggravating factors were highlighted by the Prosecution.

10     It was submitted that there was _abuse of trust and authority_ since the accused was tasked with the duty of obtaining independent quotes and to recommend the vendors for his company’s projects. The accused did not do so and instead he abused this trust by knowingly using defective support quotes obtained from Jason Liong in order to recommend Jason Liong’s company, Liong Construction, as the preferred vendor. This conduct of the accused formed the subject matter of the s. 6 (c) PCA charges.

11     The Prosecution also submitted that there was abuse of trust when the accused had received bribe monies from Jason Liong in return for preferring a vendor’s interests over his own company’s interests when he allowed Jason Liong to use defective quotes and also recommended Liong Construction for NetLink’s projects. This conduct of the accused had formed the subject matter of the s. 6 (a) PCA charges.

12     A second aggravating factor that was submitted by the Prosecution was that there was persistent offending by the accused. It was highlighted that the accused committed the offences from October 2016 to May 2017 and over 13 occasions. In particular, it was noted that:

> i.     The accused had accepted bribes, totalling $8,000, from Jason Liong over 4 occasions;

> ii.     The accused had used defective quotes provided by Jason Liong for 7 NetLink projects with a total value of _$911,867.40_

13     A third aggravating factor that was submitted by the Prosecution was that there was premeditation by the accused. It was submitted that the accused had committed these offences with a significant degree of deliberation and premeditation. During the period from October 2016 to May 2017, the accused and Jason Liong clearly established a course of dealing where he had to work with Jason Liong to ensure 3 quotations were obtained before he could make his recommendation for Liong Construction to be awarded the respective projects. It was submitted that this course of dealing was indicative of the level of planning embarked upon to ensure that Liong Construction would be given the respective projects.

14     Further, a key part of the Prosecution submissions was that the accused’s conduct fell under the _Category 2_ description of cases established in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel \[2015\] 3 SLR 116 (“_**_Romel_**_”)._ I shall deal with this submission together with the Defence’s contrary submission on this issue in a later part of this judgment. The Prosecution submitted that the accused was under a duty to source for independent quotes and to make recommendations based on these quotes. Instead of doing so, he knowingly used defective quotes provided by Jason Liong to enable Jason Liong to be awarded projects from NetLink amounting to $911,867.40. In turn, he received monies from Jason Liong for preferring Liong Construction’s interest in this manner.

15     In view of the above aggravating factors, the Prosecution accordingly submitted that the custodial threshold had been crossed for each of the proceeded charges.

## Mitigation and Defence submissions for a Fine

16     The Defence submitted that the accused was untraced and was of good character. It was also submitted that the charges occurred over a short period of time and there was no premeditation. It was also submitted that this case involved private sector corruption and with no aggravating factors. There was also no economic loss or detriment suffered. As such, the Defence submitted for a non-custodial sentence and that a global fine of $20,000 to $30,000 would be appropriate.

## Applicable sentencing considerations

17     In cases involving corruption, it is trite and uncontroversial that the paramount sentencing consideration is inevitably one of general deterrence.

18     At the same time, this is a case of private sector corruption. However, it is undisputed that the prevailing legal position is that there is no presumption that a non-custodial sentence will be imposed for all cases of private sector corruption. In these circumstances, I therefore agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the facts of the present case and the gravity of the offence must be carefully considered to determine whether the compelling need for general deterrence for corruption offences can only be satisfied with a custodial sentence and not a fine.

19     In this regard, the case of _PP v Ang Seng Thor <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span>_ has now set out clearly the position that where there are aggravating factors, the custody threshold would be breached even for private sector corruption offences. It should be noted also that _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ had elucidated the use of a non-exhaustive list of aggravating factors with regard to the triggering of a public service rationale, while also emphasizing that the custodial threshold _can be breached in other circumstances_. I note in particular, the cautionary words that –

> _“Although triggering the public service rationale is one way in which a private sector offender may be subject to a custodial sentence_, **_it is not the only way: the custody threshold may be breached in other circumstances, depending on the applicable policy considerations and the gravity of the offence as measured by the mischief or likely consequence of the corruption ……….._** _In addition, factors such as the size of the bribes, the number of people drawn into the web of corruption and whether such conduct was endemic will all be relevant to the consideration of whether a custodial sentence is justified.” (Paragraph 33)_

> (Emphasis added)

20     More guidance was provided in this area of private sector corruption by the observations stated in the case of _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span>_, where Sundaresh Menon CJ stated that:

> _“26_.     _The ways in which private sector corruption can manifest its ugly head are diverse_ _. But in my judgment_, _the factual patterns that emerge from much of the prevailing case law can, for convenient analysis, be fit into three broad and non-exhaustive categories:_

>> (_a_)     _First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest._

>> (_b_)     _Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest._

>> (_c_)     _Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest”._

> (Emphasis added)

21     Sundaresh Menon CJ also found it necessary to make the position abundantly clear that the common impression that public sector corruption inevitably results in a custodial sentence, while private sector corruption typically attracts only fines was incorrect and not a true reflection of the law in Singapore. His Honour also stressed that while private sector corruption with lower culpability levels could be dealt with through fines, it did not give rise to or support a presumption in favour of non-custodial sentences, whenever private sector corruption was involved.

### Non-reliance on sentencing framework in PP v Gursharan Kaur

22     The Prosecution had in the course of oral submissions informed the court that it would not be relying on the sentencing framework which it had urged the District Court in _PP v Gursharan Kaur <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 217</span>_ to successfully adopt. The Defence claimed that it was taken by surprise by this position now adopted by the Prosecution as it had expected that the sentencing framework would be similarly relied upon for the present case. The Prosecution explained however that this was an internal decision as the _PP v Gursharan Kaur_ case was on appeal to the High Court. In the circumstances, I accepted the Prosecution explanation. Accordingly, I have not relied on the _PP v Gursharan Kaur_ sentencing framework. The Prosecution had instead cited several precedents to assist the court in arriving at its sentencing position. I will discuss these precedents below.

## The Court’s Decision

### (I)   Step one

### Determining the individual sentences

#### (i)   Analysis – two-step approach

23     The facts of the present case involved the sentencing of the accused who had committed multiple offence and also a consideration of the aggregate sentence to be imposed upon the accused. I should state here that I was guided in my approach to the sentencing of the accused by the very recent decision of Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (“_Gan Chai Bee_”). _Gan Chai Bee_ is a wide-ranging decision and has also provided clarity on the proper approach for determining the aggregate sentence in cases involving multiple offences each of which, taken alone, may be a minor offence meriting only a light sentence, but when taken together, demonstrated a single course of criminal conduct.

24     Sundaresh Menon CJ had enunciated, to achieve transparency and consistency in sentencing, a two-step sentencing approach at paragraphs \[22\] to \[23\] in the following manner –

> _“22_      _In such cases, the only way to ensure consistency in outcomes and transparency in reasoning is, in my judgment_, **_to engage in the two steps in sequence_****_. The sentencing judge must first reach a provisional view of the individual sentence for each offence. If the amount involved for each offence is small, he ought not to be concerned over saying that prima facie the offence warrants only a fine and not imprisonment. Turning to the second step, he ought then to consider whether the existence of any cumulative aggravating factors – such as the total amount of dishonest gain or the totality of the criminal enterprise – justifies calibrating the individual sentences upwards and running those calibrated sentences consecutively. If any such adjustment is thought necessary, the reason for making it should be spelt out._** _The observations of Chao Hick Tin JA in Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor __<span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span>__(“Terence Ng”) at \[72\] are pertinent in this context:_

>> _Where an accused faces multiple charges, it may be necessary for the sentencing court to recalibrate the sentences imposed for each offence by reason of the totality principle (particularly since s 307(1) of the CPC mandates that a court which convicts and sentences an offender to three or more sentences of imprisonment must order the sentences for two of them to run consecutively). In such a situation, it is important for the court to proceed sequentially: it must first decide on the appropriate sentences for each offence (that is to say, absent consideration of the totality principle) before deciding on the adjustments that are required to be made to the individual sentences imposed in the light of the totality principle. This was done in Azuar … and PP v AOM … In our judgment, this promotes transparency and consistency in sentencing. At \[66\] of Shouffee ..., Sundaresh Menon CJ explained the point as follows:_

>>> _… By stating explicitly that the individual sentence that would otherwise have been imposed is being recalibrated by reason of the totality principle, the sentencing judge not only demonstrates principled adherence to the applicable sentencing benchmarks but_ _also ensures that the integrity of those benchmarks for the discrete offences is not affected by the recalibration that he has done in the particular case that is before him by reason of the particular facts and circumstances at hand._ _\[emphasis in original\]_

> \[Emphasis in original\]

> _23_      _I acknowledge that the challenge of sentencing for multiple similar offences that constitute a single course of criminal conduct may, to some degree, have been ameliorated by recent amendments to the CPC which have permitted a single charge to be framed in respect of two or more incidents of the commission of the same offence which, having regard to their time, place and purpose, amount to a course of conduct: see s 32 of the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018 (No 19 of 2018); s 124 of the CPC. If an accused person is convicted on such a charge, then the sentencing judge would likely not be faulted if he approached sentencing for that charge in a single step, focusing solely on the totality of the accused’s criminal conduct. However, the amended provisions permit the amalgamation of only property-related offences. Even in this context, there may be disagreement over whether the individual offences, when taken together, truly amount to a course of conduct for the purpose of amalgamation._ **_If sentencing is to be approached with clarity, the need to follow the two-step analysis where multiple similar offences have been committed remains important as a matter of general principle, and therefore warrants careful consideration here.”_**

> (Emphasis in bold and underlined added)

25     Applying the above approach, the first step of the sentencing analysis would be to determine the individual sentences for each proceeded charge. The second step of the sentencing analysis would be to consider the offending conduct in totality: see _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ at paragraphs \[31\] to \[40\].

#### (ii)   Precedents tendered by Prosecution

26     At this first step stage, I needed to determine the appropriate individual sentences for each of the proceeded charges the accused faced. Here, I found it useful to consider a number of similar precedents. As mentioned above, the Prosecution had tendered a table of sentencing precedents to assist the court. The table is reproduced below for ease of reference –

27     I will consider first the s. 6 (a) precedents for accepting a gratification.

28     In the case of _PP v Sawant_, the accused faced 5 proceeded charges under s. 6 (a) of the PCA, with another 9 charges also under s. 6 (a) PCA that were TIC. The accused had obtained bribes over one year from staff of an IT contract staff provider, in return for: (1) engaging the company to provide IT contract staff to his employer; or (2) refraining from showing disfavour to the IT contract staff. The accused had initiated the bribes. The bribes amounted to a total amount of _$27,800._ The accused was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment per charge involving amounts from $2,600 to $3,300. He was given a global sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment with 2 charges ordered to run consecutively.

29     The next case was _PP v Ong Seng Wee_ where the accused faced 2 proceeded charges under s. 6 (a) of the PCA, with another one charge also under s. 6 (a) PCA that was TIC. The accused, a facility manager of a semiconductor company, had solicited and received bribes totalling $20,000 in return for assisting the two givers to secure contracts worth about $150,000. He surrendered $12,000 to CPIB in the course of investigations. The accused was sentenced to _8_ weeks’ imprisonment for the charge involving $7,000 and sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the charge involving $10,000. He was given a global sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment with the 2 charges ordered to run concurrently.

30     In the case of _PP v Toh Hong Huat_, the accused had claimed trial to 29 charges under s. 6 (a) of the PCA. The accused, a beverage systems manager in Nestle Singapore, had received 29 payments (totalling $62,071) between January 2012 and February 2013 as corrupt rewards for recommending his friend’s company (SCAD) as Nestle “maintenance and repair” contractor and sorting out SCAD’s problems. The payments were calculated as 50% of SCAD’s profit from its contract work with Nestle. On conviction the accused was sentenced to 1 month’s imprisonment for bribes of $918 - $2000, 2 months’ imprisonment for bribes of $2040 - $3080, 3 months’ imprisonment for bribes of $5000, 4 months’ imprisonment for bribes of $7,535 and 5 months’ imprisonment for bribes of $9000. He was sentenced to a total of 8 months’ imprisonment and this sentence was upheld on appeal.

#### (iii)   Amount of the gratification

31     It was not immediately apparent to me that the Prosecution took the position that for the _single_ s 6 (a) charge involving the accused receiving a gratification of only $2,500, that this conduct fell under Category 2 of the _Syed Mostafa Romel_ categorization. Certainly the Defence took the opposing view that since the sum fell below the amount of $30,000/ which was the custodial threshold suggested for private sector corruption, a fine would be sufficient as a deterrent sentence. In this regard, I am mindful that in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ \[2015) SGHC 117, CJ Menon had also stated that “ _where private sector agents are concerned, offences which register a lower level of culpability can be dealt with by the imposition of fines. Such cases are generally those where the amount of the gratification is below $30,000_ _and where there is no real detriment to the interests of the principal.”_

32     In any case, going by the total bribe amounts in the 2 cases above of PP _v Sawant_ and _PP v Ong_ cited by the Prosecution, where the amount of gratification received ranged from $20,000 upwards, sentences of between 8 – 10 weeks’ imprisonment had been imposed per proceeded charge. I note however that the case of _Toh Hong Huat v PP_ is not an entirely relevant precedent as the accused had claimed trial and there were also a large amount of 29 s. 6 (a) charges.

33     By comparison, the present case involved a single proceeded charge under s 6 (a) PCA involving a small sum of $2500. Even considering the three s. 6 (a) of the PCA TIC charges, the total sum involved would still only be $8,000, still nowhere close to the suggested threshold of $30,000 for private sector corruption.

34     In view of the above, at this first step of the two-step approach, I think it would be quite difficult to put forward and justify a custodial sentence for the s. 6 (a) PCA proceeded charge in this case against the accused, given that the amount of the gratification involved in the proceeded charge was small. I am mindful however that the accused in _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ had only s. 6 (c) charges against her (a total of 154 charges, with 10 proceeded charges) and not a single s. 6 (a) of the PCA proceeded charge or even s. 6 (a) of the PCA TIC charges. Nonetheless, as the amount involved for the s. 6 (a) PCA offence was small, I took the provisional view that “_prima facie_ the offence warrants only a fine and not imprisonment.” As enjoined by the two-step approach in _Gan Chai Bee v PP_, I next had to consider “_whether the existence of any cumulative aggravating factors – such as the total amount of dishonest gain or the_ **_totality of the criminal enterprise – justifies calibrating the individual sentences upwards and running those calibrated sentences consecutively_****.”**

(Emphasis added)

35     In my view, a consideration of whether the custodial threshold was crossed is one that can only be examined meaningfully by examining the totality of the accused’s offending conduct. As such, I now proceed to the second step of the analysis.

### (II)   Step two

### Determining the aggregate sentence

#### Aggravating Factors

36     The following three aggravating factors _common_ to both the single s 6 (a) PCA charge and the three s 6 (c) PCA charges were cited by the Prosecution in support of a custodial sentence.[^1]

#### (i)   Abuse of trust

37     A major plank of the Prosecution submissions was that the accused’s conduct fell under the Category 2 description of cases established in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel \[2015\] 3 SLR 1116 (“_**_Romel_**_”)._ I should state here that the Defence took a contrary view and submitted that the accused’s conduct fell instead under Category 1 description and which usually resulted only in a non-custodial fine. I will therefore examine both submissions carefully as the correct classification will lead to a better understanding of the accused’s conduct and his culpability and consequently result in the appropriate sentence being passed.

38     To reiterate, the Prosecution took the position that the accused was under a duty to source for independent quotes and to make recommendations to his employer principal based on these quotes. Since he did not do so and had actually agreed and worked with Jason Liong to submit fictitious support quotes, this was tantamount to an abuse of trust and authority. The Defence counter was a simple one and the submission was that the accused had difficulty in obtaining quotations.[^2] In elaboration of this “difficulty” in being able to obtain quotes, the Defence indicated that since Liong Construction was a Term Contractor of NetLink, it was bound by NetLink’s Schedule of Rates. This also meant that Liong Construction as a result had to submit quotes that were significantly lower than non-term contractors who were not bound by the Schedule of Rates. This therefore would discourage the non-term contractors from submitting any quotations as their quotations would tend to be higher and they would therefore be unlikely to awarded the contract. [^3]

39     I note that Liong Construction was awarded a 3-year Term Contract by NetLink on 30 November 2015. The accused got to know Jason Liong, Manager of Liong Construction, when Liong Construction was awarded this Term Contract. On 8 April 2016, Liong Construction was also awarded a 6-month contract commencing from May 2016. As submitted by the Prosecution, I accept that there was therefore an established course of dealing between the accused and Jason Liong from November 2015. I am also mindful that under NetLink’s procurement policy, if the value of the works exceeds $200,000, a tender must be called. If these works do not exceed $200,000, the user department can decide whether to call for a tender _or_ source for 3 independent quotes – paragraph 3 of SOF.

40     I observed that the statement of facts at paragraph 5 states that between 2015 and 2016, “_various works had to be carried out at the 7 facilities under NetLink and the accused was tasked by his superior to source for quotes for these works. As these works were below $200,000, the accused knew he was required to source for 3 quotes from 3 independent contractors.”_ This indicates that the accused was familiar with the process of calling for quotes. Moreover, the accused was _tasked_ to source for quotes. It is also clear that the value of the works being less than $200,00, the Term Contractors need not be used and if so, 3 quotes had to be obtained from independent contractors. I note that there is no evidence that the accused had approached his superiors to inform them of his difficulties in securing such quotations. First, this is a bare assertion of the Defence. Second, this is also a convenient and self-serving position taken by the accused. Third, for the Defence to claim that Liong Construction was bound by the Schedule of Rates for Term Contactors and thereby have to submit higher non-competitive bids is illogical, as the value of the works was _below_ the $200,000 limit for which a tender must be called under NetLink’s procurement policy. I therefore reject the Defence submission that for the above reasons, the accused had difficulty in securing quotations.

41     In addition to the above, a further submission by the Defence was that there was no abuse of trust or position by the accused as the accused did not occupy a senior position in his Company. It was submitted that the nature of the duty owed to the company cannot be considered in isolation as the accused’s seniority and position within the company also needs to be considered.[^4] In particular, it was submitted that for abuse of trust to be an aggravating factor, “more is required” such as a position of seniority, a high level of control or an application of coercion, intimidation or exploitation. It was further argued by the Defence that the accused was required to source for quotes before merely recommending to his superior for approval.

42     I find this submission by the Defence to be unmeritorious. The accused was an Associate Engineer in NetLink. This was a responsible position by any estimation. I should also state that I do not accept that job designations or titles only are to be considered to reflect a position of seniority. Titles alone can never be conclusive. Further, I note that the accused was in charge of routine maintenance, ad-hoc repair and replacement and projects for the 7 facilities under NetLink. He would also need to call for contractors for quotations if works were required. The accused also liaised with the Managing Agent of these 7 facilities and oversaw their inspection of repairs and maintenance works carried out by the relevant contractors. These are all responsible tasks and not merely clerical or routine in nature. The tasks performed by the accused would also have required a significant level of control, management and supervision.

43     Furthermore, I also take the view that to _recommend_ to a superior for approval is in itself indicative of a senior position, with accompanying control and authority. To be tasked to recommend is also a responsible duty placed on an employee. An improper recommendation can carry serious consequences for the company. I therefore reject the Defence submission that there was on the present facts, no abuse of trust by the accused who in his role of an Associate Engineer, was required to recommend and submit quotes involving large sums of money to his superiors for approval.

#### (ii)   Persistent offending

44     I recognized that the accused had committed the offences from October 2016 to May 2017 and over 13 occasions. I was also made aware that the accused had accepted bribes, totalling $8,000, from Jason Liong over 4 occasions. Further, the accused had used defective quotes provided by Jason Liong for 7 NetLink projects with a total value of $911,867.40. In these circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused was involved in persistent offending conduct. This was not a one-off transgression or a momentary lapse of judgment. It was deliberate, sustained and persistent offending conduct of the accused and constituted a clear aggravating factor.

#### (iii)   Pre-meditation

45     The accused could not carry out his dishonest and misleading actions against his principal without the help and assistance of Jason Liong. Between 2016 and 2017, various works had to be carried out at the 7 facilities under NetLink. The accused was tasked by his superior to source for quotes for these works. However, for these works, the accused did not source for 3 independent quotes. He instead _agreed_ with Jason Liong for Jason to submit support quotes with defective statements, together with quotes from Liong Construction. These support quotes were purportedly issued by different bidding companies and were in fact fictitious quotes that contained fixed-up prices so that Liong Construction could successfully ‘bid’ for these projects with NetLink. It was in furtherance to this agreement made between the accused and Jason Liong that the accused had received three made-up quotations in documents received from Jason Liong for the required works. This was the subject matter of the three proceeded charges under s 6 (c) of the PCA. There were also 10 other s.6 (c) PCA charges covering the period between September 2016 to May 2017 that were TIC charges. In these circumstances, I find that there was not only an agreement between the accused and Jason Liong, but also that in coming to this agreement the accused acted with pre-meditation.

46     I pause here to note that the Defence had argued that the essence of pre-meditation is the taking of steps to avoid detection. It was submitted that pre-meditation was found in _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ because the Accused Gan Chai Bee and Ms Cheong the other party to the s. 6 ( c ) PCA charges , took ‘deliberate steps to minimise the risk of their scheme being detected.’[^5] The passage where this sentence (see underlined sentence below) was taken from must be read in the context of the entire paragraph in _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ to derive its proper meaning. The full paragraph \[70\] states that -

> _“It is well established that committing an offence with premeditation and planning is an aggravating factor. This factor is a distinct aspect of the offender’s culpability and it is amply present in this case._ _The appellant and Ms Cheong took deliberate steps to minimise the risk of their scheme being detected_ _. They arranged for the moneys to be paid first to D3’s workers before being transferred to Ms Cheong and her colleagues. This ensured the absence of any record of payment from Nike to Ms Cheong directly. The appellant and Ms Cheong also ensured that each invoice was inflated by only a small amount so as not to arouse any suspicion of their scheme. These actions were deliberated, carefully planned and designed to create a veneer of legitimacy so as to avoid detection. They constitute a significant aggravating factor, and as they demonstrate a high degree of conscious choice on the appellant’s part, they enliven the need for a sentence that deters the appellant specifically from repeating such conduct: see Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng _ _<span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span>_ _ at \[22\]._

47     In my judgment, the above cited passage does not go so far as to state that there can be no pre-meditation _in the absence of steps taken to avoid detection._ It is a matter of logic and common sense that no accused person ever sets out to encourage his own detection and apprehension. Furthermore, in my view the passage above merely suggests that _one of the indicia of pre-meditation_ is the taking of steps to avoid detection. As such, I am of the view that the Defence has put its argument higher than what _Gan Chai Bee_ v PP has actually decided. In any case, I note from paragraph \[45\] above, that the accused had _agreed_ with Jason Liong for Jason to submit support quotes with defective statements, together with quotes from Liong Construction. It was in furtherance to this agreement made between the accused and Jason Liong that the accused had received three made-up quotations in documents received from Jason Liong for the required works. These “_actions were deliberate, carefully planned and designed to create a veneer of legitimacy_….” I am of the opinion that this certainly constituted pre-meditation on the part of the accused so as to deceive and mislead his principal. I find therefore that the accused had acted with pre-meditation in committing these 17 offences over a period of some 8 months.

#### (iv)   Harm caused by the accused’s conduct

48     Besides the single s. 6 (a) PCA proceeded charge of receiving a bribe, the accused was also convicted on 3 other proceeded charges under s. 6 (c) of the PCA for the offence of an agent using a document with intent to deceive a principal and which contained false statements knowingly intending to mislead the principal. For these three s. 6 (c) PCA proceeded charges, the prosecution had submitted that the accused’s conduct had caused significant harm to his principal in that the principal had parted with property to the value of $911,867.40/. The procurement process of the principal was also compromised. It was therefore submitted that this was also a significant aggravating factor.

49     On its part, the defence took the view that Liong Construction being a term contractor of NetLink, “_would in all likelihood”_ have been awarded the contracts. It was further argued that there was no evidence that NetLink had suffered detriment at all. [^6] The facts of the present case were also analogous to the case of _Heng Tze Yong v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 976</span>._ It was stated by Chao JA concerning detriment suffered, that –

> _“In my view, however, this submission was not quite on point. The fact remained that there was no allegation of any real loss suffered by Micron. For example, there was no claim that the HEPA filters were over-priced or did not work. Furthermore, there was a pre-existing business relationship between ANM and Micron that was independent of the corrupt transactions. ANM had been awarded a contract for the supply of HEPA filters even before the corrupt transactions took place, and ANM was awarded the contracts for providing parts cleaning services without Ben Ong’s influence (see \[4\]–\[9\] above)._ **_These facts indicated that Micron was generally satisfied with the products and services provided by ANM, and did not suffer any real loss.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

50     I should add at this juncture, that I found the Defence assertion that Liong Construction being a term contractor of NetLink, “_would in all likelihood”_ have been awarded the contracts somewhat puzzling. First, it was a bare assertion made without any supporting evidence tendered before the court. Second, and more crucially, this assertion was _inconsistent_ with paragraph 10 of the SOF which stated quite unequivocally that -

> _“ Had NetLink known that the quotes the accused provided were support quotes_, **_it would not have accepted these quotes and would not have given approval for Liong Construction to be awarded with these projects as the procurement process of NetLink had been compromised. “_**

> (Emphasis added)

51     It is apposite at this juncture to also state the mischief that s. 6 (c) of the PCA is targeted at. The recent case _of Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span>_ is most instructive on this point and states as follows –

> _“56_      **_This is not to say that s 6(c) does not serve any broader social purpose. Its enactment recognises that the agent-principal relationship, which is an important and often inevitable incident of business, has vulnerabilities that make it readily susceptible to abuse through dishonest means, and therefore should be granted penal protection to promote its integrity and utility._** _This was also the view of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Luk Kin Peter Joseph \[2015\] HKCU 2767, where McWalters JA opined that s 9(3) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap 201) (HK), which is in pari materia with s 6(c) of the Act_, **_“\[b\]y targeting non-bribery conduct that also undermines the integrity of the principal : agent relationship … in its own distinct and separate way, plays a broader role in protecting and preserving the integrity of this special relationship_**_” (at \[160\])._

> _57_      _That s 6(c) targets “non-bribery conduct”, in the words of McWalters JA, seems clear on further examination of the case law on bribery itself. In Romel at \[26\], I described three non-exhaustive ways in which bribery can manifest in the private sector:_

>> (_a_)     _First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest._

>> (_b_)     _Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest._

>> (_c_)     _Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest._

> _\[emphasis in original\]_

> _58_.     **_An offence under s 6(c) falls into none of these categories._** _When such an offence is committed, the receiving party has typically deceived the paying party into parting with value to benefit the former. By contrast, where bribery has occurred, neither the receiving party nor the paying party is properly regarded as a perpetrator or a victim in relation to each other. The harm is realised not between their bilateral relationship, but instead, as V K Rajah JA put it in Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (“Ang Seng Thor”) at \[40\], through “the distortion of the operation of a legitimate market, preventing competition in the market from functioning properly, to the detriment of the eventual consumer, who will have to bear the cost of the bribe”. Their dealing is regarded as part of the scourge of corruption on society in general: see Ang Seng Thor at \[41\]. Nor does a s 6(c) offence necessarily involve bribery in the public sector. This form of corruption simply refers to circumstances where it is public servants who are involved in any of the three categories of conduct described in Romel, resulting in the erosion of public confidence in the essential institutions of government: see Ang Seng Thor at \[30\] and \[33(a)\]._ **_But none of these conditions is necessary to establish a s 6(c) offence._**

> _59_      **_In my judgment, therefore, the central mischief targeted by s 6(c) is the dishonest exploitation of an agent-principal relationship, whether by a person who knowingly presents a false document to the agent or by the agent himself who knowingly presents a false document to his principal. The usual result of the offence is economic harm to the principal, and therefore the degree of such harm will often be a significant indicator of the seriousness of the offence in most cases_** **_. That said, an offence under s 6(c) may have wider repercussions._** **_Depending on the facts, it may be seen to undermine integrity in business dealings_** **_or, as was the case in Charan Singh (\[37\] above), to damage the credibility of a public institution. As the Court of Appeal recognised in Review Publishing (\[54\] above) at \[75\]_**, **_“\[i\]t is not inconceivable that some \[kinds\] of dishonest act … falling within s 6(c) … may be regarded as corrupt conduct”. Where this has happened, the sentencing judge should take account of it as an aggravating factor._**

> _60_      _In this case, nothing indicates the appellant has been involved in corruption in the private or public sector._ **_Therefore, the only harm relevant to the appellant’s sentence is the economic harm her offences caused Nike_** _. I shall therefore analyse the degree of that harm.”_

> (Emphasis added)

#### (v)   Dishonest exploitation of the agent-principal relationship

52     Guided by the above pronouncements by Sundaresh Menon CJ, I proceed now to examine the facts in relation to the agent-principal relationship between the accused and NetLink. I note that the Prosecution has accepted that there was no economic loss caused to NetLink the principal, as the jobs awarded to Liong Construction were completed.[^7] Nor was there any evidence before the court that the contract jobs were not performed satisfactorily.

53     Notwithstanding the absence of any economic loss caused to NetLink, I am mindful that as stated above by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the _Gan Chai Bee_ case, the central mischief which s. 6 (c) of the PCA seeks to address is the dishonest exploitation of an agent-principal relationship. While in most cases, the usual result of a s. 6 (c) PCA offence is economic harm to the principal, and therefore the degree of such harm will often be a significant indicator of the seriousness of the offence in most cases, this need not always be so. In fact, Sundaresh Menon CJ went on to observe that an offence “…_under s. 6 (c) may have_ _wider repercussions__.”_ And the crucial part of this observation is the statement that _“_**_Depending on the facts_**_, it may be seen to undermine integrity in business dealings._” And it was also further observed by CJ Menon that “ _some kinds of dishonest acts … falling within s 6 (c)…._**_may be regarded as corrupt conduct_**_.”_ The exhortation was then given to sentencing judges, to take account of it as an **_aggravating factor._**

(Emphasis added)

54     Applying the above pronouncements by Sundaresh Menon CJ to the facts of the present case, I accepted the Prosecution submissions that NetLink’s procurement process was compromised by the accused’s dishonest actions in submitting defective support quotes provided by Jason Liong. In particular, I am mindful that the evidence before the court indicates that NetLink considered the accused’s conduct to be a serious breach of its procurement policy, as if it had known the true position, it would (i) _not_ have accepted these support quotes, and (ii) _not_ have awarded the jobs to Liong Construction. Further, NetLink itself was also of the view that its procurement policy had been compromised by the accused’s dishonest exploitation and misleading acts.[^8] This is significant and also indicates that the offending acts of the accused were not just trifling dishonest acts misleading a principal, but a serious undermining of the integrity of business dealings between NetLink and Liong Construction. It is not surprising therefore that NetLink was of the clear view that if they were aware of the accused’s dishonest actions, they would not have awarded the jobs to Liong construction. Further, I also find that the actions of the accused being carried out over a not insignificant period of 8 months and involving not one, but seven contracts worth a considerably large sum of $911,867.40 also significantly contributed to the undermining of the integrity of the procurement policy of NetLink and its business dealings with Liong Construction.

55     Further, a critical and significant aspect of this case is the need to appreciate that the conduct of the accused towards his principal cannot be seen in isolation as mere dishonest actions taken to mislead his principal through the submission of defective quotations. It is significant that the accused had also pleaded guilty to one proceeded charge under s. 6 (a) of the PCA in respect of receiving a bribe of $2500/ from Jason Liong in late January 2017 as an inducement for advancing the business interests of Liong Construction with NetLink. While a s. 6 (c) offence is strictly not a corruption offence as it does not require the essential element of corrupt gratification but only dishonesty, it was stated in _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ that _“…i__t is not inconceivable that some kinds of dishonest act … falling within s 6(c) … may be regarded as corrupt conduct”._ In my view, although the accused had been convicted of three charges under s. 6 (c) PCA and only one charge of accepting gratification under s. 6 (a) PCA (but with a further three s. 6 (a) charges that were TIC), the accused’s dishonest acts when viewed together with the totality of his entire offending conduct, there were “elements of corrupt conduct” also included in his total criminal offending. This was a cumulative aggravating factor that clearly justified a custodial sentence and made the imposition of a fine wholly inappropriate.

56     In other words, when considering the totality of the sentencing paradigm at this second step of the analysis in the light of the above considerations, the overall tenor of this case changes considerably. As stated in _Gan Chai Bee_ at paragraph \[39\], Sundaresh Menon CJ held that “_when the amounts paid on the claims reflected in all the charges, both proceeded with and taken into consideration, are aggregated, it will readily be seen that the property which the victim has parted with was of more than negligible value._ **_What follows from this is that the conclusion that the custodial threshold was crossed is one that pertains to the totality of the appellant’s offending conduct …”._**

(Emphasis added)

57     Considering the facts of the present case, the offending conduct involved dishonest acts of the accused, these dishonest acts were carried out over a sustained and a long period of time, it was premeditated and involved a course of dishonest dealing with Jason Liong and also involved the presence of s. 6 (a) PCA charges that imbued the dishonest acts of the accused with elements of ‘corrupt’ conduct that also undermined the integrity of the agent-principal relationship and thereby also affecting a course of business dealing that involved a total amount of $70,367.24. In these circumstances, to impose a fine would have been totally inadequate.

58     Under these circumstances, I found that a fine is not a suitable sentence to be imposed upon the accused. I turn now to address the separate issue of the appropriate length of the imprisonment term to impose on the individual proceeded charges.

### Global sentence

59     The Prosecution had submitted for a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for each proceeded charge and a global sentence of at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors in their submission for a global sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment – the abuse of trust, persistent offending and premeditation on the part of the accused.

60     The Defence submitted that the accused was untraced and was of good character. It was also submitted that the charges occurred over a short period of time and there was no premeditation. It was also submitted that this case involved private sector corruption and with no aggravating factors. There was also no economic loss or detriment suffered and therefore a high fine would suffice.

## Conclusion

61     I have already discussed at length above why a fine would be inappropriate on the facts, especially having regard to the totality of the accused’s offending conduct and bearing in mind the two step analysis required as laid down in _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ above at paragraphs \[23\] to \[25\] above.

62     As for the accused, I have taken into consideration in mitigation that the accused had pleaded guilty and is untraced and is of generally good character.

63     At the same time, considering the relevant mitigating factors as against the need for general deterrence in this case, as well as the aggravating factors such as the number of offences committed, the period of the offending conduct, the culpability of the accused as regards his dishonest conduct in misleading his principal with the use of defective support quotes to commit the s. 6 (c) PCA offences, the mitigation had to be balanced against the need for a custodial sentence having regard in particular to _the totality of his criminal conduct_. I have considered also the precedents cited by the Defence. I note that all of these precedents pre-dated the case of _Gan Chai Bee v PP_. As stated earlier, I was very much guided by _Gan Chai Bee v PP_ which required a proper approach for determining the _aggregate sentence_ “in cases involving multiple offences each of which, taken alone, may be a minor offence meriting only a light sentence, but when taken together, demonstrated a single course of criminal conduct. ”

64     Under these circumstances, I was therefore of the view that a sentence of imprisonment of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the four proceeded charges would be fair and proportionate to the _totality_ of his single course of criminal conduct.

65     The accused was therefore sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the four proceeded charges as follows –

> (a)      _DAC-927614-2018 -_ 4 weeks’ imprisonment

> (b)      _DAC-927634-2018-_ 4 weeks’ imprisonment

> (c)      _DAC-927639-2018 -_ 4 weeks’ imprisonment

> (d)      _DAC-927641-2018 -_ 4 weeks’ imprisonment

66     As there were four proceeded charges against the accused, I ordered 2 sentences to run consecutively as below –

> (a)      _DAC-927614-2018 -_ 4 weeks’ imprisonment

> (b)      _DAC-927641-2018_ - 4 weeks’ imprisonment

67     In my view, the global sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment was also a sentence that was appropriate and in keeping with the accused’s record and prospects and was not a crushing sentence.

68     The accused is presently on bail pending the hearing of this appeal, with a stay ordered on the execution of the global sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment.
