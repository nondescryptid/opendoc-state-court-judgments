Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Young offenders – Offender pleaded guilty to voluntarily causing grievous hurt – Whether probation or reformative training is the most appropriate sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9435/2020/01.\]

30 July 2020

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Public Prosecutor. The Accused had pleaded guilty to several charges ranging from being a member of an unlawful society, violence-related offences and theft offences. Pre-sentence reports were called for both probation and reformative training. He was assessed to be suitable for both regimes.

2       I ordered the Accused to be placed on probation. The Prosecution had submitted for reformative training. Being dissatisfied with the sentence, Prosecution had filed a notice of appeal against the order of probation and also applied a stay of the probation order. I granted the stay.

3       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## The charges

4       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charges :

> _1_ st _Charge - DAC 950054/2020_

5       The Accused also admitted and consented to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, 2 charges of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code and another charge of theft in a dwelling place under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.

## The Statement of Facts

6       The Accused is Muhammad Izan Mirza Bin Mohd Sam Saimon. He is a Singaporean and is currently 17 years old. His date of birth is 12 March 2003.

### Facts relating to the 1st Charge (DAC-905504-2020)

7       At the material time of the first charge, he was a student from Northlight School. The Accused was recruited to be a member of the ‘Sio Kun Tong’ Secret Society of the ‘18’ Group (“SKT”) since June 2018 when he was 15 years old. He remained a member till the date of his arrest on 8 February 2019 in relation to an incident which had taken place on 2 February 2019 (the subject of DAC-905505-2020, a charge taken into consideration). The SKT is not a registered society in Singapore under the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (“SA”) and is an unlawful society. The Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under section 14(3) of the SA.

### Facts relating to the 3rd Charge (DAC-905506-2020)

#### Parties

8       The co-accused persons are:

> (i)     Khalish Bin Khamis (“Khalish”), a 16-year-old Singaporean; and

> (ii)     Mohammad Azaidy Bin Mohammad Ariffin (“Azaidy”), an 18-year-old Singaporean.

9       The witness is one S, a 14-year-old Singaporean male. He video-recorded the incident.

10     The victim is Roshan Khan Rahim, a 16-year-old Singaporean. The victim is acquainted with S and Khalish. Khalish was in a relationship with victim’s classmate.

#### First Information Report

11     On 26 March 2019 at about 6.01 a.m., the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”) informed the police about a case of assault. The victim had sought treatment at KKH after he was attacked by the Accused, Khalish and Azaidy.

#### Facts surrounding the 3rd Charge

12     In the afternoon of 24 March 2019, the Accused met up with S, Khalish and Azaidy in the vicinity of Toa Payoh Central, Singapore. S and Khalish told the Accused they were going to meet the victim as Khalish was unhappy with the victim’s interactions with his girlfriend. The Accused agreed to follow them.

13     On 24 March 2019 at about 5.00 p.m., S asked the victim to meet him at the sky garden, located above the multi-storey carpark at Block 79E Toa Payoh Central, Singapore 315079. The victim reached the meeting location and saw S, Khalish, Azaidy and the Accused waiting for him.

14     The victim approached the group to ask about the purpose of the meeting. The Accused punched the victim and the victim fell. Azaidy and Khalish then joined in to attack the victim and punched him several times. The Accused punched the victim multiple times on his head and kicked his face. Their attack on the victim was captured on video footage recorded by S.

15     The Accused then told the victim to follow him to the multi-storey carpark located one floor below the sky garden. At the carpark, the Accused punched the victim again and Azaidy and Khalish joined in to punch the victim.

16     After they had attacked the victim, they brought the victim to the nearest convenience store and bought him a bottle of mineral water and a packet of tissue to wash his wounds.

17     On 25 March 2019, the victim sought medical attention at KKH and the following injuries were noted, as set out in a medical report dated 2 May 2019:

> a)     Swollen and bruised right eyelid;

> b)     Right subconjunctival haemorrhage laterally with pseudomembranes;

> c)     Irregularly shaped right pupil.

18     The victim was referred to the Singapore National Eye Centre, and was noted to suffer the following injuries, as set out in a medical report dated 6 May 2019:

> a)     Swollen and bruised multiple facial fractures involving the frontal wall of the right front sinus, right lamina papyracea, right orbital floor, anterior wall of the right maxillary sinus and frontal process of the right maxillary bone;

> b)     Impingement of the right inferior rectus muscle along the plane of the right orbital floor fracture resulting in significant restriction of right eye elevation and a severely constricted field of binocular single vision.

19     The Accused, together with Khalish and Azaidy, and in furtherance of the common intention of them all, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to the victim. By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under section 325 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.

### Facts relating to the 5th Charge (DAC-905508-2020)

#### First Information Report

20     On 10 July 2019 at about 1.33 a.m., one Mr Tan called the “999” police hotline and reported “SH78?? Comfort robbed money and bag. Take run”. The incident location was given as Block 29 Lor 5 Toa Payoh Singapore. The victim is Tan Chai Hock (“Tan”), a 74-year-old taxi driver.

#### Facts surrounding the 5th Charge

21     On 10 July 2019 at about 1.11 a.m., Tan picked up three passengers, including the Accused, in his taxi from along Sims Avenue near Lorong 23 Geylang, Singapore. They asked to go to Block 29 Lorong 5 Toa Payoh Singapore.

22     Upon reaching the destination, the Accused told his friends he would make payment of the taxi fare. The Accused’s two friends alighted from the taxi while the Accused remained seated at the rear left passenger seat.

23     The Accused’s friends returned to the taxi and asked him why he was taking so long, before leaving. The Accused snatched the sling bag that was placed beside Tan on the front passenger seat and fled. The sling bag contained cash amounting to S$97.60, which was in Tan’s possession.

24     Tan sounded the horn to seek assistance from members of the public and called the police. By taking the sling bag containing S$97.60 out of Tan’s possession without his consent, the Accused has committed theft punishable under section 379 of the Penal Code.

25     The Accused was stopped by patrolling police officers and he admitted to committing the theft. The sling bag was recovered and the cash was recovered in full, with assistance from the Accused.

### Facts relating to the 7th Charge (DAC-905510-2020)

#### Parties

26     The co-accused persons are:

> (i)     Khalish;

> (ii)     Azaidy; and

> (iii)     Divagan s/o Sivaraja (“Divagan”), a 16-year-old Singaporean.

#### First Information Report

27     On 27 August 2019 at about 3.19 p.m., one Neo Wen Kai (“Neo”) lodged a police report at Whampoa Neighbourhood Police Post to report 5 occasions of theft of cigarettes at Hao Mart. The incident location was given as Block 74 Whampoa Drive #01-332/6 Whampoa Court Singapore 320074. Neo was the shop assistant working at Hao Mart.

#### Facts surrounding the 7th Charge

28     On 1 August 2019, at about 3.18 a.m., the Accused, Khalish, Azaidy and Divagan went to Hao Mart located at Block 74 Whampoa Drive #01-332/6 Whampoa Court Singapore 320074. Hao Mart is a building used for the custody of property.

29     Azaidy spoke to Neo, and brought him to a corner of Hao Mart. Khalish and the Accused then took turns to jump over the cashier counter to steal the cigarettes, which were kept behind the cashier. Divagan kept a lookout. The Accused and the co-accused persons left Hao Mart without making payment of the items they had taken.

30     The Accused and the co-accused persons took the following items from Hao Mart, out of Neo’s possession, without his consent:

> (i)     1 carton of Marlboro Black Menthol cigarettes valued at S$134,

> (ii)     1 carton of Marlboro Light Pocket cigarettes valued at S$120,

> (iii)     1 carton of LD Blue 100s cigarettes valued at S$115,

> (iv)     1 carton of Camel Yellow cigarettes valued at S$105,

> (v)     1 carton of Marlboro Ice Blast cigarettes valued at S$134,

> (vi)     1 carton of Winston Red cigarettes valued at S$120,

> (vii)     2 packets of Winston Red cigarettes valued at S$24.

31     The Accused, together with Khalish, Azaidy and Divagan, stole the aforementioned items amounting to the total value of S$752 out of the possession of Neo, and has committed an offence under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.

## Antecedents

32     The Accused has no previous convictions.

## Prosecution’s submission on sentence

33     The Prosecution submitted that probation was not appropriate. First, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused had downplayed what he did by pointing out glaring differences between his account given to the Probation Officer and what was contained in the Statement of Facts for the offence of causing grievous hurt. In the Probation Report, the Accused had informed that the victim was hostile when the Accused met him and that the victim had kept resisting and fighting back[^1]. Prosecution contended that this was not the case.

34     Prosecution also did not accept that the Accused had committed theft to cover his daily needs as informed by the Accused to the Probation Officer[^2]. This was because at the time of the offence of theft of a bag, he was taking a taxi ride showing that he was not so short of money.

35     The Prosecution also pointed out that the Accused had committed shop theft offences for cigarettes, which was not a necessity.

36     On the home front, the Prosecution highlighted that the parents had been lax and permissive given that his offences had spanned 5 months. The Accused’s mother related that the father would often search for him around the neighbourhood when he was not home by 9.00pm thus showing their inability to control the Accused[^3].

37     The Prosecution also referred to the comments of the Social Worker who was assigned to the Accused when he was referred by his school for ESU (Enhanced Step Up Programme) due to his poor school attendance[^4]. The Social Worker noted that the Accused’s mother was permissive towards him and was often unaware of his whereabouts. The Social Worker also reported that the Accused chose not to meet with her.

38     The Prosecution further highlighted that the school had reported that the Accused’s parents were uncooperative and not firm in ensuring that he attended school[^5]. The Prosecution also referred to the attitude of the parents that they had no issue with the Accused’s idle time[^6].

39     The Prosecution referred to the Reformative Training Report (“RT Report”), highlighting that the RT Report was consistent with the Probation Report in that it had found that the Accused’s father had difficulty controlling the Accused’s behaviour[^7]. The RT Report further stated that the Accused’s father also did not attend school conference on Accused's disciplinary issues and his parents had allowed the Accused to misbehave without sufficient intervention on their part.

40     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused's tendency towards violence necessitated a structured environment for his rehabilitation. The Prosecution highlighted that his school record set out in the Probation Report had referred to assault on 2 boys and also defiance and rudeness on the part of the Accused[^8].

41     The Prosecution then referred to the RT Report, submitting that its findings on the Accused’s propensity towards violence was consistent with those in the Probation Report. The RT Report stated that the Accused started getting involved in fights since secondary 3. The RT Report also stated that the Accused justified his violence as a form of self defence[^9].

42     The Prosecution rebutted the positive factor raised in the Probation Report with regard to Accused’s willingness to work by pointing that out that the Accused had not been able to hold down a job for more than 3 months.

43     The Prosecution thus submitted that in the Reformative Training would be the most appropriate regime as it would provide the necessary vocational training in a structured environment.

## Mitigation

44     The Accused expressed his remorse and said that he regretted what he had done in the past. He further stated that he would do his best to change for the better and that he had learned his lesson. He then pleaded for a chance at probation so he could support his family by working.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### Sentencing Principle for Young Offenders -2 stages of inquiry

45     The sentencing principle for young offenders below the age of 21 has been well established, which is that rehabilitation would generally be the dominant consideration. As stated by Yong CJ in _Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 439 at \[21\], young offenders “are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law abiding adults are better.” The law takes the view that rehabilation is presumptively the dominant consideration when sentencing youthful offenders.

46     The sentencing court would have to approach the sentencing of a young offender in a 2-step inquiry:

> (i)     the first stage is to identify and prioritize the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence; and

> (ii)     the second stage is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that is placed on the relevant ones – see _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari in Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> at \[77-78\] and _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[28\].

#### The first stage- is rehabilitation still the dominant consideration?

47     At the first stage of the inquiry, on the present facts, I found that rehabilitation still remains the dominant sentencing consideration. The nature of the offences is not so serious as to rule out rehabilitation as the primary sentencing principle. Most of the offences would be considered as relatively non-serious such as theft as well as being a member of an unlawful society. The more serious offences would be those of a violent nature, particularly the one where grievous hurt was caused.

48     The harm caused in this case was severe as there were multiple facial fractures and and the victim’s vision was adversely affected. The Accused had engaged in a group attack together with 2 others and multiple blows were delivered to a vulnerable part of the victim’s body, namely, the head and face. In the light of such injuries, clearly the sentencing principle of deterrence will arise. Nonetheless, the offence was not so egregious nor the harm caused so severe as to displace rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration, particularly as the Accused had only just turned 16 when this offence was committed. There is nothing in the medical report to confirm that the injuries described were permanent.

49     I also noted that the Accused had managed to curb his violent offending behaviour since the offence of voluntarily causing hurt on 27 March 2019 (DAC 905507, a charge taken into consideration). Since that day, there has been no more violent offence reported to date. His subsequent offences are all theft related with the last offence commited on 1 August 2019.

50     Hence, it can be said that the Accused had managed to steer clear of trouble with the law for the last 9 months. There has been definitely a de-escalation of criminal behaviour, from violence to theft related and to currently zero incidents. He had also ceased being a member of a secret society gang since February 2019.

51     The Accused has therefore shown some semblance of growing maturity over the last 9 months. Although he has clearly shown a total lack of interest in schooling, he had engaged himself meaningfully by being employed in various jobs since December 2018 to date.

52     The Probation Officer also reported that the Accused managed to abide by the time restrictions imposed during the preparation of the Probation Report. The Probation Officer stated that the Accused had been compliant since the imposition of such time restriction from 6 April 2020[^10]. This is no small achievement considering that the Accused had been used to a rather unbridled lifestyle previously with frequent late nights.

53     The Prosecution appear to be in agreement that at the first stage of the inquiry, rehabilitation still retains its primacy as the dominant sentencing principle as they had submitted for a sentence of reformative training. Otherwise, they would have submitted for a normal imprisonment term to be imposed.

#### The second stage – is probation or reformative training the most appropriate sentence?

54     Having determined that primary sentencing principle should still be rehabilitation, I then moved onto the second stage of the inquiry. At this stage, the issue in contention is which of the two regimes, probation or reformative training, would be the most appropriate sentence. It was held at \[67\] of _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> that, at this second stage of the framework,

> “the court must select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation: _Boaz Koh_ at \[35\]; see also \[33\] above. In contrast, where there is a need for both deterrence and rehabilitation, reformative training may be the most suitable sentence, given that it offers the court a useful middle ground between sending the offender to prison and meeting the desire to rehabilitate a young offender: _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]–\[39\] and _Al-Ansari_ at \[57\]–\[58\].”

55     The Accused was assessed to be at high risk of re-offending by the Probation Officer. Several factors were highlighted in the Probation Report by the Prosecution as set out above and hence they have submitted that probation is not suitable.

56     However, I found that a number of criticisms raised by the Prosecution were not justified. The first criticism was that the Accused had played down his role in the offences committed and hence was not genuinely remorseful.

57     I found that that this criticism was unwarranted. The Accused had merely explained why he had lost control of himself. He did not dispute anything that is stated in the Statement of Facts but sought to give an account of the event from his own perspective as to what had triggered his violent response. In my view, he was not trying to justify his actions. He informed the Probation Officer that he had observed the victim to appear hostile when they met, and he thought to attack the victim first so that he would not get hit. He did not run away from the fact that he was the first to hit the victim.

58     Further, he informed that he had continued hitting the victim as he reported feeling angry that the victim kept resisting and fighting back. Although the Statement of Facts did not mention that the victim had resisted or fought back but that could very well have been the impression received by the Accused. He also admitted that he had continued to hit the victim until he was stopped by his accomplices[^11] thereby admitting to a relentless attack on his part. I did not consider that description as downplaying his role at all.

59     Next is the criticism by Prosecution that the Accused did not commit the offence of theft in order to meet his daily needs as the Accused had been riding in a taxi at the material time showing that he was in such a dire strait. I found that this criticism was clearly an overstretch. The Accused was riding in a taxi with a group of friends. There is no indication that the Accused was going to foot the entire fare alone. In fact, from the Statement of Facts, it may be inferred that the Accused had no intention of paying for the fare as after offering to settle the fare he stayed behind and snatched the bag away without making any payment.

60     The fact is that the Accused did not come from a well to do family. It was disclosed in the Probation Report that the family lives in a 2-bedroom rental flat. The Accused’s father was a bus driver who recently got retrenched in January 2020. The Accused’s mother is a housewife. The Accused’s father informed that he was in debt of about $13,000. The family gets some financial assistance in the form of $600 every 3 months from the Social Support Office[^12]. Hence the Accused had been working since 2018 in various jobs as a kithen crew member in fast-food restaurants as well as a mover to support himself as well as to contribute to his family. Hence, it is more likely than not that the Accused would genuinely feel some financial pressures.

61     The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused was not remorseful by latching onto the RT Report’s comments that the Accused had tried to justify his use of violence as a form of self-defence and that he had condoned violence as a form of coping with his anger. Here I must really caution the way in which such assessment reports should be read.

62     The Accused was giving a candid account of his past violent behaviour and why he had reacted violently in various incidents. Thus the comments about him condoning his violence and use of it as a form of self-defence had to be seen in that light and should not be interpreted to be still his current state of mind and attitude towards violence.

63     The Probation Officer at the hearing confirmed this understanding. He agreed with the comments in the RT report about the attitude of the Accused but stated that it was so at the time of the incidents and that the Accused did not hold such a view any more and was prepared to change.

64     This is indeed borne out by the fact that the Accused, even before any intervention in this area, had ceased committing any violent offences from March 2019.

65     Similarly the same caution and circumspection must be exercised when evaluating the assessment of the Accused based on historical data from his school about his past misbehaviours and shortcomings. This would similarly apply to the comments about poor parental supervision. Such failures and shortcomings are noted as a way of explaining what had gone wrong and why the Accused had committed the present offences. However such failures and shortcomings should not thereby immediately lead one to conclude that the Accused is incapable of being rehabilitated whilst remaining in the community or under the care and supervision of his parents.

66     I accepted the Probation Officer’s assessment that there was a change in the Accused’s attitude and that this attitude of justification of use of violence is something of the past. The Probation Officer has also assessed that despite the past failure on the part of the parents to effectively supervise the Accused, there has been a change in their commitment level, making probation still a viable option.

67     The Probation Officer had highlighted 3 factors[^13] which augured sufficiently well for rehabilitation in the community for probation to be recommended:

> (i)     positive changes to the Accused’s behaviour since his arrests indicated his readiness for rehabilitation;

> (ii)     the Accused’s commitment to continue working since his withdrawal of school reflected his motivation to be constructively engaged;

> (iii)     acknowledgement by the Accused’s parents of their shortcomings as well as responsiveness and willingness to work with the Probation Officer to improve their parenting and supervision skills highlighted their commitment in supporting him in his rehabilitation.

68     In _A Karthik_, the High Court had elaborated on why the recommendations of the probation officer ought to be given considerable weight, at \[79\]:

> “In my view, it makes good sense for the court to give careful consideration to the reports prepared by probation officers. It is the probation officer who is usually best apprised of the offender’s circumstances and, hence, of his suitability for the probation regime. Therefore, the court should ordinarily be slow to depart from the recommendations of a probation officer unless:

>> (a)    it is clear that the circumstances upon which the probation officer’s recommendations were based were factually incorrect or have since changed materially; or

>> (b)    there was no proper basis for the probation officer’s recommendations.”

69     I found in the present case, there was ample ground for the Probation Officer for his positive assessment for probation. The Accused had shown that he managed to desist from violent behaviour and had also been able to abide by the time curfew set for him. Although it may be a relatively short period of just about 3 months, it does speak well of the Accused’s commitment to make a serious change.

70     The Accused had also displayed some maturity and responsibility by engaging in various employement after he had stopped schooling to support himself as well as to give a monthly contribution of $100 to his parents[^14].

71     I am also gratified to note that the parents had acknowledged their shortcomings and past permisiveness as well as by their show of commitment to work with the Probation Officer in the rehabilitation of the Accused. They have also noted recent positive changes in the Accused’s behaviour. The Accused’s father had opined that the Accused had been more receptive after his arrests and followed his instructions to stay out of trouble. They had also spent time together having meals and playing mobile games together occasionally[^15].

72     On the whole, I found that there was sufficient basis to believe that the Accused will be able to undergo rehabilitation successfully under the probation regime and that there are enough protective factors to make such an order.

73     One significant factor I had often looked at is the age of a youthful offender when he committed the offences. Here, the Accused was just 15 when he first joined a secret society and had just turned 16 in the month when he committed the violent offences. I would therefore give the Accused more allowance that, in the light of his tender age and immaturity, he would be more susceptible to negative peer influence and impulsive behaviour.

74     Finally, with regard to the observations made that the Accused had shown very poor response to the efforts of the school and the social worker to keep him in school, I found that the Accused had clearly given up on academic pursuits. Unfortunately, this issue was not a recent malaise as it has set in since primary school where it was reported that he had poor academic performance and irregular attendance. This continued to secondary school with irregular attendance culminating in him being absent in 2018 for a long period. His placement in ESU did not yield any fruit and he attended school only twice in 2019 before dropping out completely in that year.

75     Whilst education and vocational training would be important for the Accused and these would be provided under the programme in Reformative Training, I am of the view that it may be better at this stage to work on the other areas of his life given that he is now productively engaged with work and be is motivated to be self-sufficent and to support his parents. As he grows in maturity and work through his life goals with the Probation Officer, there will still be opportunity for him to avail himself to relevant vocational training or courses to improve his future job prospects.

## Conclusion

76     Where an offence is serious and harm caused severe, reformative strikes a useful balance between deterrence and rehabilitation for youthful offenders. In the present case, I would consider the seriousness and harm caused by the offence of grievous hurt to be on borderline level where an element of deterrence ought to be injected into his rehabilitative journey. However, the Accused had shown that he is not a recalcitrant and hardened offender. He had managed to de-escalate his offending and lower his risk factors by dissociating himself from negative peers. He also has an intact family behind him to support him.

77     I thus found sufficient proteective factors for probation to be the better rehabilitative regime and that he ought to be given a chance for rehabilitation whilst remaining engaged in the community and not to be institutionalised immediately.

78     I have accordingly granted probation but with a relatively longer period as well as additional conditions to ensure greater supervision and control over his previously unbridled lifestyle:

> i.     Length of 27 months (6 months intensive and 21 months supervised;

> ii.     electronic monitoring scheme for 6 months;

> iii.     100 hours of community service;

> iv.     Progress Accountability Court review session in 4 months for the Accused to give an account of his progress together with his parents; and

> v.     parents to be bonded in the sum of $5,000 to ensure the good behaviour of the Accused and his compliance with the probation conditions.
