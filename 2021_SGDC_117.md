CRIMINAL LAW – Offences – Statutory offences – Misuse of Drugs Act

30 June 2021

### District Judge Samuel Hwa Kuan Chua:

1       The Accused is Prakash s/o Mathivanan, a 37-year-old male Singapore citizen (Date of Birth 24 March 1984). He claimed trial to one charge under section 8(b)(ii) p/u section 33A(2) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”).

2       The Accused was represented by Defence Counsel Muhammed Riyach Bin Hussain Omar (“DC Riyach”) at the trial on 10 to 11 September 2019. On 11 September 2019, the trial was adjourned for further trial dates to be given and the Accused was released on bail of $50,000 after a successful bail review. Due to the disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was scheduled to resume on 3 to 5 August 2020. In the meantime, the Accused absconded. A Warrant of Arrest was issued against the Accused. On 3 August 2020, DC Riyach applied to discharge himself from representing the Accused, which application was allowed. The Accused was subsequently arrested and remanded in custody. On 13 November 2020, the Accused instructed Defence Counsel M Ravi (“DC Ravi”) to represent him. On 15 December 2020, DC Ravi applied to discharge himself from representing the Accused. The trial was scheduled to resume on 10 to 12 and 13 May 2021. The Accused instructed Defence Counsel Ramesh Tiwary (“DC Tiwary”) to represent him at the trial. However, when the trial resumed on 10 May 2021, DC Tiwary applied to discharge himself from representing the Accused. The Accused was self-represented for the remainder of the trial. The Accused claimed to be ill on various days of the trial, which necessitated the vacation of various trial dates for him to be assessed by the prison doctor or as a result of medical leave being given to him by the prison doctor. Additional trial dates were obtained in May and June 2021 for the trial to be completed.

3       The charge states:

> You … are charged that you, on or before 12 January 2017, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, **methamphetamine**, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act;

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on the 11 March 2013 in Court No. 11 of the Subordinate Courts of Singapore, _vide_ DAC 39314/2012, convicted for an offence of consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, **methamphetamine**, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punished under section 33A(1) of the MDA with five (5) years imprisonment and three (3) strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside till date, and you shall now be punished under section 33A(2) of the MDA. (_sic._)

4       The Prosecution called 11 witnesses to prove its case at the main trial, namely:

> (a)     PW1 - Police officer Yeo Kah Ming (arresting party)

> (b)     PW2 - Police officer Ong Lee Peng (arresting party)

> (c)     PW3 - Police officer Muhammad Rafi Bin Ishak (arresting party)

> (d)     PW4 - Police officer Sani Bin Mohd Ramli (arresting party)

> (e)     PW5 - CNB officer Muhammad Shalihan Bin Mohamed Ansary (escorted the Accused from Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up to the CNB office; recorder of the Accused’s long statement; alleged escorting officer for the Accused’s urine procurement)

> (f)     PW 6 - CNB officer Ramadhan Bin Salim (transported both bottles of the Accused’s alleged urine specimen to the Health Sciences Authority)

> (g)     PW7 - CNB officer Adrian Seet Zu Ming (operator of the Instant Urine Test machine and conducted a preliminary test on the Accused’s urine specimen)

> (h)     PW8 - Health Sciences Authority analyst Maggie Tiong Su Su (analysed one bottle of the Accused’s alleged urine specimen)

> (i)     PW9 - Health Sciences Authority analyst Bellene Chung (analysed second bottle of the Accused’s alleged urine specimen)

> (j)     PW10 - CNB officer Chia Eu Foong (escorted the Accused from Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up to the CNB office; sealed both bottles of the Accused’s alleged urine specimen)

> (k)     PW11 - CNB officer Lee Swee Leng (Investigating Officer; recorder of the Accused’s further long statement and cautioned statement).

5       For the ancillary hearing to determine the voluntariness of the Accused’s long statement that was recorded on 13 January 2017, the Prosecution and the Accused each called three witnesses. At the end of the ancillary hearing, the long statement was admitted into evidence.

6       At the end of the Prosecution’s case at the main trial, I called on the Accused to give his defence under section 230(1)(j) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The Accused gave his defence.

## Undisputed Facts

7       On 12 January 2017, between 9.30pm and 9.35pm, police officers arrested the Accused and his girlfriend, namely, Malani Naidu d/o Prabhakar Naidu (“Malani”), at 5 / 7 Lorong 15 Geylang, for the following offences:

> (a)     Housebreaking by night with common intention;

> (b)     Possession of utensils for consumption of controlled drugs;

> (c)     Possession of controlled drugs; and

> (d)     Suspected consumption of controlled drugs.

8       When police officers entered Room 305 which the Accused and Malani were residing in, they found suspected drug exhibits and suspected drug utensils on the bed, which items were enumerated in the police report lodged by Police officer Sani Bin Mohd Ramli on 13 January 2017.

9       On 13 January 2017, at about 3.24am, the Accused was in-processed at the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up (“the lock-up”). On the same day, at about 3.43pm, CNB officers Muhammad Shalihan Bin Mohamed Ansary (“Shalihan”) and Chia Eu Foong (“Chia”) escorted the Accused out of the lock-up to the CNB office within the grounds of Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters (“the CNB office”). At about 7.27pm, the Accused was escorted back to the lock-up.

10     At about 3.54pm, a urine specimen which was supposedly the Accused’s was in-processed for the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) using the IUT machine operated by CNB officer Adrian Seet Zu Ming (“Adrian”). The urine specimen tested positive for Amphetamine. Thereafter, two blue-capped bottles of urine specimen which were supposedly the Accused’s were sealed by Chia. The seals each bore the Accused’s name and NRIC number, and a signature which was supposedly the Accused’s. Both bottles of urine specimen were thereafter deposited into a pair of locked metal containers which were stored in the locked freezer within the CNB office.

11     On 16 January 2017, CNB officer Ramadhan Bin Salim (“Ramadhan”) transported the pair of locked metal containers from the locked freezer within the CNB office to the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). The pair of locked metal containers were unlocked by a Laboratory officer. The Laboratory officer tallied the contents of the pair of locked metal containers against the Urine Submission Form containing the names and NRIC numbers of the persons whose bottles of urine specimens were in the metal containers. Along with other sealed bottles of urine specimen belonging to other persons, two sealed bottles of urine specimen bearing the Accused’s name and NRIC number were retrieved from the pair of locked metal containers. The seal on each of the two bottles contained a signature which was supposedly the Accused’s. The two bottles of urine specimen were independently analysed by HSA analysts Maggie Tiong Su Su (“Maggie”) and Bellene Chung (“Bellene”) respectively, and were both found to contain Methamphetamine. Maggie and Bellene each prepared a certificate under section 16 MDA which stated that on analysis, the urine specimen that they each analysed was found to contain Methamphetamine.

12     The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume Methamphetamine on or before 12 January 2017.

13     On 11 March 2013, in Court No. 11 of the Subordinate Courts of Singapore, _vide_ DAC 39314/2012, the Accused was convicted for consumption of a specified drug, Methamphetamine, under under section 8(b)(ii) p/u section 33A(1) MDA. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. His conviction and sentence have not been set aside to-date.

## Disputed Facts

14     While the Accused did not dispute that his urine specimen was procured from him on 13 January 2017 while he was in custody, the Accused disputed the circumstances surrounding the procurement of his urine specimen, namely:

> (a)     the identity of the officer who escorted him to the toilet for his urine specimen to be procured,

> (b)     when and where his urine specimen was procured;

> (c)     the process through which his urine specimen was procured, and

> (d)     the ownership of the two blue-capped bottles of urine specimen that each bore his name, NRIC number and supposed signature which were transported to the HSA and subsequently analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s Case

15     Shalihan and Chia testified that on 13 January 2017, at about 3.43pm, they escorted the Accused from the lock-up to the CNB office. Shalihan testified that at the CNB office, he escorted the Accused to the toilet to wash his hands. As instructed by Shalihan, the Accused chose one red-capped master bottle out of other similar bottles, and two blue-capped bottles out of other similar bottles. Shalihan observed the Accused urinating into the red-capped master bottle. As instructed by Shalihan, the Accused transferred a specimen of his urine from the red-capped master bottle into the two blue-capped bottles. The two blue-capped bottles were placed into a plastic bag which Shalihan then heat-sealed, together with a barcode label stating the Accused’s name and NRIC number. Shalihan instructed the Accused to hold onto the heat-sealed plastic bag containing the two bottles of his urine specimen at all times.

16     Shalihan testified that some of the Accused’s urine remained in the red-capped master bottle. The IUT operator siphoned some of the Accused’s urine from the red-capped master bottle into a test tube for the IUT. Shalihan then instructed the Accused to discard the red-capped master bottle.

17     Adrian testified that he was the IUT operator who conducted the IUT on the Accused’s urine specimen on 13 January 2017. The Prosecution’s case was as follows:

> (a)     Adrian logged into the computer to register the Accused’s personal details for the IUT.

> (b)     Adrian printed out a barcode label stating the Accused’s name and NRIC number, and pasted the barcode label onto a test tube.

> (c)     After the Accused’s urine specimen was procured under Shalihan’s supervision and the Accused had poured a specimen of his urine into the two blue-capped bottles, the Accused was escorted to the urine counter with the red-capped master bottle containing the remainder of his urine.

> (d)     Thereat, Adrian instructed the Accused to state his (i.e. the Accused’s) name and NRIC number and verified that against the barcode label on the test tube.

> (e)     Upon confirming that the test tube stated the Accused’s name and NRIC number, Adrian siphoned some urine from the red-capped master bottle into the test tube. He placed the test tube into a tray of other test tubes, placed the tray into the IUT machine, and ran the IUT.

> (f)     After the IUT on the Accused’s urine specimen was completed, Adrian checked the result of the IUT, which showed that the Accused’s urine specimen was positive for Amphetamine.

> (g)     Adrian printed out the Accused’s Urine Test Result Slip (“IUT Result Slip”) and two HSA labels bearing the Accused’s name and NRIC number.

> (h)     Adrian handed the two HSA labels to Chia to seal the two blue-capped bottles containing the Accused’s urine specimen.

> (i)     After Chia had completed sealing the two-blue capped bottles, Adrian requested Chia and Shalihan to sign on the Accused’s IUT Result Slip, in their capacities as the sealing officer and escorting officer respectively.

18     Chia testified that on 13 January 2017, he was the sealing officer who sealed the two blue-capped bottles containing the Accused’s urine specimen. He described the process as follows:

> (a)     The Accused and the heat-sealed plastic bag containing the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen were handed to Chia. There was a barcode label stating the Accused’s name and NRIC number inside the plastic bag.

> (b)     In the Accused’s presence, Chia opened the heat-sealed plastic bag and took out the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen.

> (c)     Chia used a piece of tissue paper to check for any leakage of urine from the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen.

> (d)     Upon confirming that there was no leakage, Chia sealed the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen with masking tape.

> (e)     After sealing the bottles, Chia showed to the Accused the two HSA labels that IUT operator Adrian had handed to him.

> (f)     Chia requested the Accused to check the two HSA labels and confirm that they bore his name and NRIC number.

> (g)     After the Accused confirmed that the two HSA labels bore his name and NRIC number, Chia instructed the Accused to sign on both labels.

> (h)     Chia pasted one signed label on each of the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen.

> (i)     Chia used clear scotch-tape to wrap around the urine label on each of the two blue-capped bottles.

> (j)     As instructed by Chia, the Accused deposited the two blue-capped bottles of his urine specimen separately into the pair of locked metal containers, which Ramadhan subsequently transported to the HSA on 16 January 2017.

## Ancillary Hearing

19     The Accused challenged the admissibility of the long statement that Shalihan had recorded from him on 13 January 2017 on the bases that:

> (a)     While being escorted from the lock-up to the CNB office for his statement to be recorded, Shalihan told the Accused not to make his (Shalihan’s) life difficult and to make his job easy, to be a gentleman and to admit to his drug consumption offence, failing which the Accused’s girlfriend (i.e. Malani) might be charged for trafficking the drugs that were found at 5 / 7 Lorong 15 Geylang where they were arrested.

> (b)     At the CNB office, at the start of the statement-recording, Shalihan used his left hand to smack the right temple area of the Accused’s head when the Accused informed Shalihan that he did not consume Ice.

> (c)     At the CNB office, in the midst of the statement-recording, Shalihan reiterated to the Accused that if he did not admit to his drug consumption offence, Malani might be charged for trafficking the drugs that were found at 5 / 7 Lorong 15 Geylang where they were arrested.

> (d)     At the CNB office, in the midst of the statement-recording, Shalihan acceded to the Accused’s request to speak to Malani, and told the Accused that he would be given pizza to eat and cigarette to smoke.

20     The Prosecution called Shalihan to testify on the process of recording the Accused’s long statement. Shalihan testified that on 13 January 2017, he recorded the Accused’s long statement at a workstation in the outer office of the CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters. The statement-recording started at 5pm. The Accused chose to speak in English. Shalihan posed some questions to the Accused, and the Accused answered Shalihan’s questions. Shalihan then typed the Accused’s answers in sentences in a Microsoft Word document. After every sentence was recorded, Shalihan read it back to the Accused. At 6.04pm, Shalihan copied the Accused’s statement in the Microsoft Word document and input it into the CNB computer system. According to Shalihan, this explained why even though the statement-recording started at 5pm, the time of 6.04pm was auto-generated on the first page of the Accused’s statement. After Shalihan finished recording the Accused’s statement and input it into the CNB computer system, Shalihan showed the Accused his statement and read it back to the Accused. Shalihan offered the Accused the opportunity to make any amendments to his statement but the Accused declined to do so. Shalihan then asked the Accused to sign on every page of his statement. The Accused signed at the bottom left of every page of his statement, and also wrote his NRIC number below each of his signatures. Shalihan then signed at the bottom right of every page of the statement. The statement-recording process concluded at 6.15pm. Shalihan testified that the Accused had given his statement voluntarily and that he did not threaten or offer the Accused any inducement either before, during or after the statement-recording.

21     The Accused gave evidence and called Malani and one Sivakandesh to testify in his defence. The Prosecution thereafter called two rebuttal witnesses, namely, CNB officers Nurshilawati Binte Hosaini (“Nurshilawati”) and Andrew John Joachim (“Andrew”).

22     Nurshilawati testified that she recorded Malani’s long statement in the inner office of the CNB office from 4.05pm to 5.45pm on 13 January 2017. Nurshilawati knew that Malani and the Accused were co-accused persons who had been arrested together and referred to the CNB duty team. Nurshilawati also knew that Shalihan was recording the Accused’s long statement in the outer office of the CNB office at about the same time. Nurshilawati testified that she was only Malani’s statement-recording officer and not Malani’s Investigating Officer. Nurshilawati testified that during the statement-recording, no other accused person or CNB officer had spoken to Malani. She testified that if accused persons wished to talk to each other, CNB officers would have allowed them to do so only after their statement-recording was completed. She testified that she did not give Malani any cigarettes to smoke. Nurshilawati could not remember whether there was pizza in the CNB office at the time that she was recording Malani’s long statement, or if she had brought Malani to the toilet. She also could not remember:

> (a)     Malani telling her that the drug exhibits that were found upon their arrest belonged to someone else and that she had only stored them for that person;

> (b)     Having any discussion with Shalihan about the drug exhibits;

> (c)     Shalihan telling Malani that she would be charged for drug trafficking if she had kept the drug exhibits for someone else;

> (d)     Shalihan telling Malani to push all responsibility for the drug exhibits to the Accused;

> (e)     Allowing Malani and the Accused to speak to each other so that the Accused could tell Malani to push all responsibility for the drug exhibits to him; and

> (f)     Allowing Malani to sit with the Accused after Malani’s statement-recording had concluded for them to talk to each other.

23     Nurshilawati disagreed that:

> (a)     She left Malani unattended at least once during the statement-recording;

> (b)     Shalihan spoke to Malani while she was recording Malani’s statement; and

> (c)     Shalihan threatened to charge Malani for drug trafficking if Malani did not push all responsibility for the drug exhibits to the Accused.

24     Andrew testified that he recorded Sivakandesh’s long statement in the inner office of the CNB office from 5.30pm to 6.15pm on 13 January 2017, and that he did not witness any assault by Shalihan on the Accused. Andrew testified that he had been a CNB officer for 25 years and if he witnessed a CNB officer assaulting an accused person, he would first physically separate the persons who were involved in the incident and then bring the incident to the attention of his supervisors. Andrew could not recall seeing the Accused in the CNB office on 13 January 2017. He also could not recall seeing the Accused and Malani seated together eating pizza in the outer office of the CNB office.

25     Andrew disagreed that:

> (a)     He stepped away from the workstation where he was recording Sivakandesh’s long statement in order to check if Sivakandesh’s IUT result was back;

> (b)     He asked one of his colleagues to keep an eye on Sivakandesh while he stepped away; and

> (c)     He lied in Court in order to save Shalihan from losing his job as a CNB officer for assaulting the Accused.

26     While it was the Prosecution’s legal burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had given his statement to Shalihan voluntarily, it was the Accused’s evidential burden to prove the instances of threat, inducement or promise that he alleged Shalihan had committed against him for the purpose of obtaining a positive statement from him.

27     In analysing the evidence, I found material inconsistencies between the evidence that the Accused, Malani and Sivakandesh had given, even though Malani and Sivakandesh were supposed eyewitnesses to the alleged acts against the Accused.

> (a)     While the Accused asserted that Malani’s recording officer had **_left her alone_** at some point during the statement-recording which provided the opportunity for Shalihan to speak to Malani,[^1] Malani testified that her recording officer was **_present_** when Shalihan spoke to her.[^2]

> (b)     While the Accused asserted that he **_knew_** that Malani was in the inner office while he was in the outer office because they **_had communicated_** with each other and seen each other through the opened doorway between the inner and outer offices,[^3] Malani testified that she **_did not know_** where the Accused was, and **_had not communicated_** with the Accused, before they were brought together and allowed to speak to each other.[^4] According to Malani, the first time that she and the Accused had spoken to each other was when Shalihan brought them together in the midst of her statement-recording.[^5]

> (c)     While the Accused asserted that Malani was brought out of the inner office into the **_outer office_** to speak to him,[^6] Malani testified that the Accused was brought into the **_inner office_** to speak to her.[^7] She later claimed that she was not sure if she was brought to the Accused, or whether the Accused was brought to her.[^8]

> (d)     While the Accused asserted that Shalihan was **_standing in front_** of him when Shalihan smacked him,[^9] Sivakandesh testified that Shalihan was **_sitting opposite_** the Accused when Shalihan smacked the Accused on his head.[^10] Sivakandesh later claimed that Shalihan was standing when he smacked the Accused on his head.[^11]

> (e)     While the Accused asserted that Shalihan had smacked him using his **_left_** hand,[^12] Sivakandesh testified that Shalihan had smacked the Accused using his **_right_** hand.[^13]

> (f)     While the Accused asserted that Shalihan had smacked him on his **_right_** temple,[^14] Sivakandesh testified that Shalihan had smacked the Accused on the **_left_** top portion of his head above the ear.[^15]

> (g)     While the Accused asserted that Sivakandesh’s recording officer had **_stepped out_** of the outer office when Shalihan smacked his head,[^16] Sivakandesh testified that his recording officer was **_present_** and that Shalihan had smacked the Accused in the presence of his recording officer, who told Sivakandesh not to look at what was happening.[^17]

28     The Accused admitted that he did not inform any officer on or after 13 January 2017 that Shalihan had allegedly assaulted him.[^18]

29     I also did not find the Accused’s allegations to be logical or reasonable. First, the Accused alleged that Shalihan had threatened or induced him into admitting to his drug consumption charge in order to prevent Malani from facing a trafficking charge in respect of the drug exhibits that were found upon their arrest. In my analysis, any drug consumption charge against the Accused was wholly unrelated to the possibility of a trafficking charge against Malani, as they concerned totally different offences. This was not a case of threatening or inducing the Accused to take responsibility for the seized drug exhibits and therefore admit to a possession charge or a possession for the purpose of trafficking charge, in order for Malani to be absolved of any criminal wrongdoing in respect of the said drug exhibits. Moreover, the Accused already knew that Malani had consumed ‘Ice’ and would have had to accept the punishment for drug consumption. This was therefore also not a case of threatening or inducing the Accused to admit to consuming ‘Ice’ in order to prevent Malani from getting prosecuted.

30     Second, all CNB officers including Shalihan would likely have known about the presumption under section 22 MDA, in that if it was proven that the Accused’s urine specimen had been properly procured according to the requirements under the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, and both bottles of the urine specimen were independently analysed by HSA analysts and found to contain a controlled drug, the Accused would be presumed to have consumed that controlled drug, until the contrary is proved. In this regard, the evidential burden would be shifted onto the Accused to prove that he had not consumed the said controlled drug. As such, while it would have been evidentially helpful to the Prosecution for the Accused to have given a positive statement in respect of his alleged drug consumption, a positive statement was not imperative in order for the Prosecution to prove the drug consumption charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

31     Further, I noted that Shalihan had recorded the Accused’s statement in the course of carrying out his duties as a CNB officer, that he had no prior personal contact with the Accused before 13 January 2017 and that he had no particular incentive to secure a positive statement from the Accused. I also noted that Malani and Sivakandesh’s recording officers were similarly carrying out their duties as CNB officers while recording their respective statements, and that there was no reason for them to have colluded with Shalihan in order for Shalihan to secure a positive statement from the Accused.

32     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing and having considered the evidence adduced before me, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had provided his long statement to Shalihan voluntarily, and I admitted the said statement into evidence.

## Summary of the Accused’s Defence

33     The Accused gave evidence in his defence. In summary, the Accused’s defence was based on the following assertions:

> (a)     The two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen were procured from him by an unidentified male Malaysian Chinese Aetos auxiliary police officer in the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up toilet, and not by Shalihan in the CNB office urine procurement toilet.[^19]

> (b)     Thereafter, the Accused lost physical custody of the two blue-capped bottles of his urine specimen after they were placed in a police exhibit bag and handed to an unidentified female Malaysian Indian Aetos auxiliary police officer (subsequently identified by the Accused to be Aetos officer Thiviya Darshini A/L Lecthumanan) who was seated at the desk in the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up office.[^20]

> (c)     When Shalihan and Chia took over custody of the Accused to escort him to the CNB office, the unidentified male Malaysian Chinese Aetos auxiliary police officer handed the police exhibit bag containing the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen to Chia.[^21]

> (d)     Upon reaching the CNB office, the Accused lost sight of the police exhibit bag containing the two blue-capped bottles of his urine specimen and did not know what happened to them thereafter.[^22]

> (e)     While in the CNB office, Shalihan escorted the Accused to the urine procurement toilet. As instructed by Shalihan, the Accused provided 10ml to 20ml of urine into a red-capped bottle which Shalihan then handed over to an unknown officer supposedly for the IUT.[^23]

> (f)     The Accused did not pen his signature on the two HSA labels used to seal the two blue-capped bottles supposedly containing his urine specimen.[^24]

> (g)     The Accused did not witness the sealing of the two blue-capped bottles supposedly containing his urine specimen with the signed HSA labels.[^25]

> (h)     The Accused did not drop the two blue-capped bottles supposedly containing his urine specimen into the pair of locked metal containers for transportation to HSA.[^26]

> (i)     In view of the abovementioned, it was the Accused’s case that:

>> (i)       the Accused’s urine specimen was not procured by a person who was authorised to do so under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

>> (ii)       the Accused’s urine specimen was not procured in compliance with the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

>> (iii)       The Accused was not the owner of the two blue-capped bottles of urine specimen that each bore his name, NRIC number and supposed signature which were transported to the HSA and subsequently analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine.

34     In his long statement dated 13 January 2017 recorded by Shalihan, the Accused admitted to smoking ‘Ice’ on 10 January 2017 not because he had consumed ‘Ice’, but because Shalihan had threatened to charge Malani with drug trafficking for the drug exhibits that were found upon their arrest unless the Accused admitted to his drug consumption charge.

35     In his further long statement dated 6 June 2017 recorded by IO Lee Swee Leng, the Accused admitted to smoking ‘Ice’ using the drug utensils that were found in his possession upon his arrest because he assumed that she was recording his statement in relation to his subsequent arrest on 30 May 2017.

36     In his cautioned statement dated 6 June 2017 recorded by IO Lee Swee Leng, the Accused self-wrote “No. I have nothing to say but I ask for leniency. Thank you.” because IO Lee had told him that he could say whatever he wished to say to the Court during his trial.[^27]

37     The Accused sought to call the unidentified male Malaysian Chinese Aetos auxiliary police officer who supposedly procured his urine specimen in the lock-up and the unidentified female Malaysian Indian Aetos auxiliary police officer who supposedly handled his urine specimen in the lock-up as his defence witnesses.[^28] I directed IO Lee Swee Leng and the Prosecution to do their utmost to identify these two officers.[^29]

38     In view of the IO and Prosecution’s difficulty in identifying the two Aetos officers, the Accused sought, on the basis of the entries in the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters electronic lock-up diary (P6), to call the following officers in the hope that they might have witnessed the events of 13 January 2017 or might be able to assist the IO or the Prosecution in identifying the two Aetos officers:[^30]

> (a)     Ranavir Kumar Yadaw s/o Ramsing holder of NRIC SXXXX266B

> (b)     Nur Sakinah Binte Surani holder of NRIC SXXXX497F

> (c)     Razali Bin Samin holder of NRIC SXXXX589B

> (d)     “APO Nasir”

> (e)     “SC Jin Rui”

> (f)     “SC Irfan”

> (g)     “APO Hairee”.

39     In addition, the Accused sought to recall five Prosecution witnesses who had completed giving evidence during the Prosecution’s case, supposedly to ask them additional questions which he had omitted to ask while they were on the stand.[^31] On the basis that the Prosecution’s case and the Accused’s case had remained unchanged throughout the trial and that the Accused or his previous Defence Counsel had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and did in fact cross-examine the witnesses extensively, I did not allow the Accused’s application to recall the witnesses pursuant to section 230(1)(r) CPC,[^32] with the exception of HSA analysts Bellene Chung and Maggie Tiong Su Su.[^33]

40     On 31 May 2021, I recalled Bellene and Maggie to the stand, for the Accused to cross-examine them as part of his Defence’s case, pursuant to section 230(1)(q) CPC. Bellene and Maggie confirmed that according to their laboratory protocol, the HSA labels used to seal the two blue-capped bottles, the two blue-capped bottles and the urine specimen contained in the said bottles had been disposed by HSA after completion of the analysis, interpretation of the analysis results, preparation of the analysis reports and collection of the reports by CNB.[^34]

## The Prosecution’s Rebuttal Witnesses

41     At the close of the Defence’s case, the Prosecution called four rebuttal witnesses pursuant to section 230(1)(t) CPC, namely:

> (a)     PW12 - Aetos officer Gary Lee Chee Wai (“Gary”) (Officer-in-Charge for Police Custodial Department overseeing deployment of Aetos officers to all lock-ups in Singapore)

> (b)     PW13 - Ex-Police Constable Irfan Shah Bin Salleh (“Irfan”) (previously serving National Service in Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up)

> (c)     PW14 – Ex-Police Constable Teo Jin Rui (“Teo”) (previously serving National Service in Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up)

> (d)     PW15 – CNB officer Quah Yong Sen (“Quah”) (Officer-in-Charge for Investigations at CNB Ang Mo Kio and Woodlands Enforcement Divisions).

42     The Prosecution also recalled IO Lee for the singular purpose of updating the Court on her efforts in locating the witnesses that the Accused had requested to be called.

43     Thereafter, the Court, with the assistance of the Prosecution and IO Lee, called two additional witnesses who could have matched the Accused’s description of the unidentified male and female Malaysian Aetos officers:

> (a)     CW1 – Aetos officer Thiviya Darshini A/L Lecthumanan (“Thiviya”) (deployed for patrolling and escorting duties at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional lock-up in January 2017); and

> (b)     CW2 – Ex-Aetos officer Chin Boon Chien (“Chin”) (deployed for patrolling and escorting duties at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional lock-up in January 2017).

## The Law on Procurement of Urine Specimens for Urine Tests

44     Section 8(b)(ii) MDA states that “Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to … smoke, administer to himself or otherwise consume … a specified drug.”

45     Section 31(1) MDA provides that “Any officer of the Bureau, immigration officer or police officer not below the rank of sergeant may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(b), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.”

46     Section 31(4) MDA prescribes what is to be done to a suspect’s urine specimen after it has been procured from him:

> “(4)  A specimen of urine provided under this section shall be divided into 3 parts and dealt with, in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed, as follows:

>> (a)    a preliminary urine test shall be conducted on one part of the urine specimen; and

>> (b)    each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint for such purpose.”

47     Regulation 3(1) r/w First Schedule Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations prescribes how a suspect’s urine specimen is to be procured from him:

> “Every suspect who is required to give a urine specimen for urine tests under section 31 of the Act or regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3), and every enforcement officer or other officer authorised by the enforcement officer taking the urine specimen, must do so in accordance with the First Schedule.”

48     An excerpt of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations is enclosed for easy reference.

**PROCUREMENT OF URINE SPECIMEN**

> 1.    A suspect who is required to provide a specimen of his urine shall be directed by an enforcement officer to wash and dry his hands.

> 2.    The suspect shall be asked by an enforcement officer to choose, in the presence of the enforcement officer, a master bottle that is pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 10 bottles provided by the enforcement officer and 2 containers that are pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 20 containers provided by the enforcement officer.

> 3.—(1)    The suspect shall then carry with him the master bottle and the 2 containers of his choice and be escorted by the enforcement officer (or some other officer authorised by the enforcement officer) to an appropriate place to provide his urine specimen.

> (2)    The master bottle and 2 containers shall, in the presence of the suspect and officer escorting the suspect, be removed from the sealed packs, whether before or after the suspect is escorted to the appropriate place to provide his urine specimen.

> 4.—(1)    The suspect shall urinate into the master bottle.

> (2)    The officer escorting the suspect shall ensure that the urine specimen in the master bottle is that of the suspect and not that of any other person.

**Where urine specimen in master bottle is 80 ml or more**

> 5.—(1)    Where the volume of the suspect’s urine specimen in the master bottle is 80 ml or more, 30 ml or more of the urine specimen shall be transferred by the suspect or an enforcement officer, with both present, from the master bottle into each of the 2 containers.

> (2)    The remaining urine specimen in the master bottle shall be used for a urine screening test and the master bottle shall then be discarded.

> (3)    While waiting for the screening test result, the 2 containers may be temporarily sealed by an enforcement officer and returned to the suspect.

> (4)    After the screening test result is ready, an enforcement officer shall seal the 2 containers in the presence of the suspect for the purpose of analysis by the Health Sciences Authority, following the procedures as set out in paragraph 13.

**Where urine specimen in master bottle is less than 80 ml**

> 6.—(1)    Where the volume of the suspect’s urine specimen in the master bottle is less than 80 ml, some of the urine specimen may be transferred by the suspect or an enforcement officer, with both present, from the master bottle into one of the 2 containers.

> (2)    The transferred urine specimen in the container shall be used for a screening test and the container shall then be discarded.

> (3)    At any time before the suspect makes a second attempt to provide more urine, he shall be directed by an enforcement officer to wash and dry his hands again and choose one container that is pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 10 containers provided by the enforcement officer.

> 7.    Before the suspect provides more urine, the master bottle and any container that had earlier been removed from the sealed pack may be temporarily sealed by an enforcement officer and returned to the suspect.

> 8.    When the suspect is ready to provide more urine, the suspect shall carry the same master bottle and the 2 containers and be escorted by an enforcement officer (or some other officer authorised by the enforcement officer) to an appropriate place to provide his urine specimen.

> 9.—(1)    The suspect shall urinate into the same master bottle.

> (2)    The officer escorting the suspect shall ensure that the urine specimen in the master bottle is that of the suspect and not that of any other person.

> 10.    If the volume of urine specimen in the master bottle is still less than 80 ml, the process referred to in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 shall be repeated until the volume of urine specimen in the master bottle is 80 ml or more.

> 11.—(1)    If the volume of urine specimen is 80 ml or more, not less than 30 ml of urine specimen shall be transferred from the master bottle into each of the 2 containers.

> (2)    If a screening test has not been conducted yet, the procedures set out in paragraph 5(2), (3) and (4) shall apply.

> 12.    An enforcement officer shall seal the 2 containers in the presence of the suspect for the purpose of analysis by the Health Sciences Authority, following the procedures set out in paragraph 13.

**Sealing of containers for analysis by Health Sciences Authority**

> 13.    An enforcement officer must observe the following procedures when sealing the 2 containers for the purpose of analysis by the Health Sciences Authority:

>> (a)    the officer shall ensure that the 2 containers are capped tightly and that there is no leakage;

>> (b)    the name of the suspect, the number of his National Registration Identity Card or passport or other identification document, the date of his urine test and any other necessary details shall be entered by the officer on 2 self-adhesive labels;

>> (c)    the suspect shall be allowed to check and sign the labels in the presence of the officer. If the suspect is unable to read, the officer shall read the particulars on the labels to the suspect. The officer shall then affix the labels to seal the containers;

>> (d)    the officer shall ask the suspect himself to deposit one container of the urine specimen into each of the 2 security boxes which shall be kept locked at all times until the boxes are delivered to the Health Sciences Authority.

49     Apart from CNB officers, police officers not below the rank of sergeant are empowered to procure urine specimens from suspects: see section 31(1) MDA and regulation 2 Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations. Section 2 MDA states that “police officer” has the same meaning as in the Police Force Act. Section 2(1) Police Force Act defines “police officer” to mean “any member of the Police Force and includes a temporary constable”. Police officers are appointed under section 7 Police Force Act. This contrasts with auxiliary police officers who are appointed under Part IX of the Police Force Act. There is nothing in the legislation to show that auxiliary police officers are empowered to procure urine specimens from suspects under section 31(1) MDA or to exercise the powers of police officers not below the rank of sergeant to procure such specimens.

## Analysis of the Evidence

50     It was the Prosecution’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused’s urine specimen had been procured from him in accordance to section 31 MDA as well as Regulation 3(1) r/w First Schedule Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, that his urine specimen was analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine and that he had consumed Methamphetamine in contravention of the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

51     Regrettably, the CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters did not have the practice of maintaining station diaries to track the personal details of suspects or accused persons who entered and left the office, their movements within the office and the purpose for their attendance at the office.[^35] While the CNB office maintained a HSA Urine Label Book in which an extra copy of the HSA labels that were used to seal the blue-capped bottles was pasted, together with the handwritten signatures of the owner of the urine specimen, the escorting officer and the sealing officer, there was no established protocol for such entries to be made into the Book for all urine specimens that were procured, sealed and sent to HSA for analysis.[^36] There was also no conscientious compliance by the CNB officers or effective supervision and enforcement by the middle or senior management within the CNB office to ensure that the Book was consistently and properly updated.[^37] In addition, the CNB officers who were attached to the said CNB office were also not required to maintain any record of their daily deployment or duties in their personal pocket books, unless something unusual or out of the ordinary occurred.[^38]

52     The only documentary records of the Accused’s urine procurement on 13 January 2017 were in the form of the IUT Result Slip dated 13 January 2017 (P2) and the Accused’s long statement which Shalihan had recorded on 13 January 2017 (P3). Apart from these two documents, there was no documentary record in the possession of the said CNB office or its officers of the identities of the escorting officer, IUT operator and sealing officer, or of the propriety of the urine procurement process.[^39]

53     According to the IUT Result Slip, the officer who escorted the Accused for procurement of his urine specimen was Shalihan, the officer who operated the IUT machine and ran the IUT on the Accused’s urine specimen was Adrian and the officer who sealed the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen was Chia. While the IUT Result Slip provided fields for the names and signatures of the abovementioned three officers, it did not provide any field for the Accused to append his signature to confirm the identities of the escorting officer, the IUT operator and the sealing officer. As such, while the IUT Result Slip bore the names and signatures of the abovementioned three officers, it did not bear the signature of the Accused, as the prevailing position was that there was no requirement for the Accused to sign the IUT Result Slip.

54     Only a very brief account of the urine procurement process was provided in paragraph 3 of the Accused’s long statement, namely:

> “The next day (13/1/2017) about 3 plus in the afternoon, a few plain clothes officers came and took me out of the lock up and they bring me up to their office. In the office, I was invited to drink some water and I was then escorted to the toilet. I did provide my urine into a bottle. After a while, I was informed that my urine is positive for Amphetamine. My urine sample was then sealed by an officer. I was also informed that my urine will be sent to HSA for further analysis.” (_sic._)

55     The Accused’s long statement did not identify the officer who escorted the Accused for procurement of his urine specimen, the officer who operated the IUT machine and the officer who sealed the Accused’s urine specimen. The Accused’s long statement also did not state that:[^40]

> (a)     The Accused was directed to wash and dry his hands and that he in fact did so.

> (b)     The Accused was asked to choose, in the presence of an enforcement officer, a red-capped master bottle that was pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 10 bottles provided by the enforcement officer and two blue-capped bottles that were pre-packed and sealed from a lot of not less than 20 bottles provided by the enforcement officer.

> (c)     The Accused carried with him the red-capped master bottle and two blue-capped bottles and was escorted by the enforcement officer to the toilet to provide his urine specimen.

> (d)     The red-capped master bottle and two blue-capped bottles were removed from the sealed packs in the presence of the Accused and the enforcement officer who was escorting the Accused to the toilet to provide his urine specimen.

> (e)     The Accused urinated into the red-capped master bottle.

> (f)     The enforcement officer who was escorting the Accused to the toilet ensured that the urine specimen in the red-capped master bottle was the Accused’s and not that of any other person.

> (g)     The Accused provided sufficient urine in the master bottle.

> (h)     The Accused or an enforcement officer transferred the Accused’s urine specimen, with both present, from the red-capped master bottle into each of the two blue-capped bottles.

> (i)     The remaining urine specimen in the red-capped master bottle was used for the IUT, after which the master bottle was discarded.

> (j)     While waiting for the IUT result, the two blue-capped containers were temporarily sealed by an enforcement officer and returned to the Accused.

> (k)     After the IUT results were obtained, an enforcement officer sealed the two blue-capped bottles containing the Accused’s urine specimen in the Accused’s presence for the purpose of the HSA analysis.

> (l)     The Accused’s name, NRIC number, date of urine test and any other necessary details were entered by the enforcement officer on two self-adhesive labels.

> (m)     The Accused was allowed to check and sign the two labels in the presence of the enforcement officer.

> (n)     The enforcement officer affixed the two labels to seal the two blue-capped bottles.

> (o)     As instructed by the enforcement officer, the Accused himself deposited one container of the urine specimen into each of the two locked security boxes which were to be delivered to the HSA for analysis.

56     Shalihan, Adrian and Chia gave oral evidence on their respective roles in the process of procuring the Accused’s urine specimen on 13 January 2017, with their only documentary references being the IUT Result Slip which bore their names and signatures (and nothing more).

57     As highlighted above, there was no contemporaneous record on 13 January 2017 in the form of a CNB station diary or pocket books kept by the individual CNB officers that the Accused’s entire urine procurement process had taken place within the CNB office on 13 January 2017 and that they had participated in the said process in the ways that they had testified. The procurement and sealing of the Accused’s urine specimen on 13 January 2017 was also not accounted for in the HSA Label Book.[^41]

58     With nothing substantial or meaningful to assist them in their recollection, it was my assessment that the three officers had given evidence based not on their actual recollection of the specific event of procuring the Accused’s urine specimen that had taken place nearly four and a half years ago on 13 January 2017, but on what the standard urine procurement protocol was, what their usual practice of urine procurement was and their belief that the Accused’s urine procurement process on 13 January 2017 had complied with the required protocol and was consistent with their usual practice. In this regard, while the three officers were able to describe the process in which the Accused’s urine specimen had been procured on 13 January 2017 with surprising ease and particularity, they were unable to recall even basic facts on that day which were not directly related to the urine procurement.

59     For example, Shalihan could not recall:

> (a)     What time he started work on 13 January 2017;[^42]

> (b)     What time he ended work on 13 January 2017;[^43]

> (c)     The identity of the CNB officer who partnered him in escorting the Accused from the lock-up to the CNB office;[^44]

> (d)     Whether he talked to the Accused while escorting him from the lock-up to the CNB office;[^45]

> (e)     Where in the CNB office the Accused was held after the Accused’s urine specimen was procured and sent for IUT at about 3.54pm and before his statement-recording commenced at 5pm - whether the Accused was held in the urine procurement area of the CNB office or in the outer office of the CNB office;[^46]

> (f)     Who was guarding the Accused between 3.54pm and 5pm;[^47]

> (g)     How he came to know the results of the IUT and how he came to append his name and signature on the IUT Result Slip as the escorting officer;[^48]

> (h)     Whether he showed the Accused the physical drug exhibits during the statement-recording (until his attention was drawn in cross-examination to the Recorder’s Note in paragraph 4 of the Accused’s long statement which stated that the drug exhibits were shown to the Accused);[^49]

> (i)     Whether he escorted the Accused to the CNB office toilet after the statement-recording was completed;[^50]

> (j)     Why the Accused remained in the CNB office after his statement-recording ended at 6.15pm and why he was escorted back to the lock-up at only 7.27pm;[^51]

> (k)     What the Accused did in the CNB office between 6.15pm when the statement-recording ended and about 7.27pm when he was escorted back to the lock-up;[^52] and

> (l)     Whether he personally escorted the Accused from the CNB office back to the lock-up.[^53]

60     When Adrian was asked to describe what he did as the IUT operator on 13 January 2017, Adrian described the protocol involved in conducting an IUT on a person’s urine specimen, rather than what he in fact did on 13 January 2017:[^54]

> “\[Q\]  Can you describe what you were doing as the instant urine test operator on duty on the 13th of January 2017?

> \[A\]    I **_will_** log into the system to register the, uh, accused for instant urine test. … Well, after I register the accused, I **_will_** print out the test tube barcode which---which stated the accused’s name and NRIC number. After that, I **_will_** paste on the test tube. So after the escorting officer done---escorting the accused for urine, the escorting officer together with the---escorting officer together with the accused will come to the urine---urine counter than I **_will_** take the test tube and ask the accused to read out his full name and his NRIC to me to verify the barcode whether is it correct. Once, I affirm that it is correct. I **_will_** then siphon the accused’s urine bottle and I **_will---will_** siphon into the tube. After that I **_will_** take the tube, put in the tray and put into the IUT machine to run the test. Shortly after, I checked on the result and the result show that is positive for amphetamine. Thereafter, I print out the urine test result slip and the HSA label. After I print out the HSA label, I handed over to the sealing officer. Once---uh, once the sealing process is done, I then look for the escorting officer and the sealing officer to sign on the urine test result slip. That is all Your Honour.

> \[Q\]    So, this process that you have just described, this is your---is---is it your evidence that this is the process that was followed in respect of this case, this accused on the 13th of January 2017?

> \[A\]    Yes. Yes, Your Honour.” (_sic._) (Emphasis mine.)

61     Adrian could not remember:

> (a)     Whether he was in the same team as Shalihan on 13 January 2017;[^55]

> (b)     Which shift he was working on 13 January 2017;[^56]

> (c)     Whether 13 January 2017 was a urine reporting day;[^57] and

> (d)     Seeing Chia sealing the Accused’s urine specimen (except by referring to the IUT Result Slip stating the same).[^58]

62     When Chia was asked to describe his role in the urine procurement process on 13 January 2017, he initially referred to Shalihan as the IUT operator[^59] and testified that the Accused and the two bottles of his urine specimen were handed to him for sealing at about 3pm plus.[^60] It was only upon being referred to the IUT Result Slip which stated Adrian as the IUT operator and 3.54pm as the time that the Accused’s details were input into the IUT machine for the IUT to be conducted that Chia clarified that the IUT operator was Adrian and that the Accused and the two bottles of his urine specimen were handed to him for sealing at about 4pm plus.[^61]

63     Chia candidly testified that he could not remember the Accused in the dock.[^62] He could not confirm or recall:

> (a)     Whether the lock-up officers had handed to him a police exhibit bag containing two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen when he and Shalihan escorted the Accused from the lock-up to the CNB office;[^63]

> (b)     Whether the police exhibit bag contained any red-capped master bottle;[^64] and

> (c)     Whether he heard the Accused and Shalihan talking to each other while he and Shalihan were escorting the Accused from the lock-up to the CNB office.[^65]

64     Had the Accused’s long statement contained a contemporaneous, chronological and detailed description of the actual urine procurement process that he had just recently participated in and which he had confirmed to be true and accurate by appending his signature on the statement, the statement could have served as a contemporaneous record of the urine procurement process for the Accused and the officers who participated in the process. In the face of subsequent allegations concerning the propriety of the urine procurement process, as were made in the present trial, such a contemporaneous record would have assisted the Court in its findings of fact.

65     In addition, had the CNB officers been required to maintain personal pocket diaries in which they recorded contemporaneous and detailed records of the official duties that they carried out in the course of each work day, these diaries would have served as a good reference point for the CNB officers to refresh their memory before and when giving oral evidence in Court.

66     Further, had the CNB officers maintained one or more station diaries within the CNB office to account for the activities that were carried out within the office, including the movement of accused persons, suspects or witnesses into, within and out of the office, these station diaries would have similarly served as a good reference point for the CNB officers before and when giving oral evidence in Court. Similarly, had the CNB office conscientiously maintained the HSA Urine Label Book that documented the procurement, IUT testing and sealing of all urine specimens that were procured and processed in the CNB office, it would also have served as good reference material for the CNB officers and assisted the Court in its findings of fact.

67     In respect of the Defence’s case, while the Accused alleged significant non-compliance with the urine procurement protocol provided in section 31 MDA as well as Regulation 3(1) r/w First Schedule Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, he was unable to fulfil his evidential burden to adduce evidence to support or prove his allegations, pursuant to sections 103 and 104 Evidence Act.

68     This was notwithstanding that the Prosecution and IO Lee had, as directed by the Court throughout the trial, extended their assistance to the Accused to identify, locate and contact the officers whom the Accused alleged were involved in the urine procurement process, and to identify, locate and obtain documentary exhibits which the Accused alleged existed.[^66] Specifically,

> (a)     The Accused was unable to identify and produce in Court the male Malaysian Chinese Aetos auxiliary police officer who allegedly accompanied him to the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up toilet, where he allegedly urinated into two blue-capped bottles instead of a red-capped master bottle.[^67]

> (b)     The Accused was unable to identify and produce in Court the other male enforcement officer who allegedly accompanied him to the abovementioned toilet and witnessed his urine procurement.[^68]

> (c)     While the Accused was able to identify Thiviya Darshini A/L Lecthumanan (“Thiviya”) as the female Malaysian Indian Aetos auxiliary police officer who allegedly sat at the desk in the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up office and who took possession of the police exhibit bag containing the two blue-capped bottles of the Accused’s urine specimen, Thiviya had no recollection of being deployed for duty at the lock-up on 13 January 2017. She did not recognise the Accused. She could not remember seeing the Accused in the lock-up on 13 January 2017 and could not remember handling the two blue-capped bottles of his urine specimen in the ways that he had alleged.[^69]

69     In this regard, Aetos officer Gary Lee, who has been the Officer-in-Charge for Police Custodial Department overseeing deployment of Aetos officers to all lock-ups in Singapore, testified that Aetos kept the hardcopy daily deployment rosters for only three years, Aetos was not able to locate the deployment roster for the lock-up for 13 January 2017 as it had been disposed[^70] and Aetos did not possess softcopies of the said roster.[^71]

70     Aetos officers Gary Lee, Thiviya and Chin provided clear and unwavering testimony that Aetos officers who are deployed to undertake patrolling and escorting duties in police lock-ups are not allowed to procure urine specimens from suspects or to handle their urine specimens.[^72]

71     In order to substantiate his allegations concerning his alleged urine procurement in the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters lock-up toilet (instead of the CNB office) and his loss of custody over his urine specimen, the Accused requested the Prosecution and IO Lee to assist him in obtaining the CCTV recordings of the lock-up on 13 January 2017, as well as the physical lock-up station diary and the physical person-in-custody lock-up station diary of 13 January 2017.[^73] IO Lee testified that she had checked with the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional lock-up operational team, who informed her that they did not have the CCTV recordings from 13 January 2017[^74] nor any physical station diaries from 13 January 2017.[^75]

72     IO Lee testified that the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional lock-up started maintaining electronic station diaries instead of hardcopy station diaries from August 2016, and used hardcopy station diaries only when the computer system was down.[^76] IO Lee could not be sure if hardcopy lock-up station diaries were used on 13 January 2017 as Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional lock-up personnel had tried to find the hardcopy lock-up station diaries from 13 January 2017 but were unable to find any.[^77]

73     The Accused admitted to consuming ‘Ice’ in the long statement that Shalihan had recorded from him on 13 January 2017, as well as the further long statement that IO Lee had recorded from him on 6 June 2017. Further, he did not contest the charge but instead pleaded for leniency in the cautioned statement that he self-wrote on 6 June 2017. Subsequently, he indicated his intention to plead guilty to the present charge in his Case for the Defence dated 10 December 2018. The relevant extracts are reproduced below:

> (a)     Accused’s long statement dated 13 January 2017:

>> “4    All the items that is recovered in the hotel room belongs to me. (Recorder’s Note: Drug items was then shown to B1). The Item ‘2’ is ‘Panadol’, item ‘3’ is Sex pills, item ‘8’ is ‘Ice’, item ‘12’ is ‘Ecstasy’ and item ‘18’ is ‘Ganja’. The 02 packet of ‘Ice’ is the balance of ‘Ice’ that have 03 days ago which is on 10/1/2017. I have yet to smoke the ‘Ganja’. I bought 02 packet of ‘Ice’ for $100. As for the ‘Ganja’, I paid $100 for all of it. I bought all the drugs from a friend name ‘Chandra’. ‘Chandra’ is my childhood friend and I have known him since young. He is in his late 20s. I am unable to contact ‘Chandra’ for the past few days. I suspected that he has been arrested by Police as I know that he has a Police case. As for the drug utensils recovered, I used it to smoke ‘Ice’. I will keep it for myself for my next.

>> 5    I smoke ‘Ice’ on 10/1/2017. I smoke ‘Ice’ using the improvised glass bottle that has rubber tube and glass pipe attached to it. I will fill some water in the glass bottle and then placed some ‘Ice’ on the glass pipe. I will then burn the glass pipe from below using a lighter and then inhale the smoke from the rubber tube. In total I took about 10 puffs. After smoking ‘Ice’, I felt awake and energetic. The feeling lasted about 4 hours. I have been smoking ‘Ice’ since August 2016. I smoke ‘Ice’ twice a week. I learned how to smoke ‘Ice’ through my old friends and I have not been contacting them since. The very first time that I smoke ‘Ice’ was when I was 20 years old.

>> …

>> 7    Other than smoking ‘Ice’, I did not take any other illegal drugs like ‘Heroin’, ‘Erimin-5’ or ‘Ganja’ before. I am also not on any medication prescribed by any doctors or any over the counter medications.” (_sic._)

> I had earlier found that the Accused had given his long statement voluntarily, and I gave full evidential weight to his admission.

> (b)     Accused’s further long statement dated 6 June 2017:

>> “8    The drug utensils found on me are one orange straw; ten cut straws/ tubes, one improvised drug utensil with 2 tubes and one glass pipe, three glass tubes and one tube. I only used the one improvised drug utensil with 2 tubes and one glass tube to consume ‘Ice’. The rest are broken and/or spare which I intend to throw away. I smoke ‘Ice’ by putting ‘Ice’ into the glass tube of the improvised utensil, use lighter to burn the glass tube and when smoke produce, I inhale through one of the tube connected to the improvised utensil.” (_sic._)

> The Accused did not challenge the voluntariness and admissibility of this further long statement, even when he was represented by Defence Counsel. I did not accept the Accused’s assertion that he had given the further long statement in the misapprehension that it was related to his arrest on 30 May 2017 instead of his positive urine test on 13 January 2017. First, IO Lee testified that the Accused was arrested on 30 May 2017 pursuant to a Police Gazette notification against him and not for any drug-related offences.[^78] Second, it was apparent from the paragraph numbering for the further long statement that it was a continuation of a previous statement, which had to be the long statement that Shalihan had recorded from the Accused on 13 January 2017 since he was not facing any other drug-related charges at that point of time. Third, IO Lee testified that she had informed the Accused that she was recording a further long statement from him that followed from his initial long statement recorded by Shalihan.[^79]

> (c)     Accused’s cautioned statement dated 6 June 2017:

>> “No. I have nothing to say but I ask for leniency. Thank you.” (_sic._)

>> Once again, the Accused did not challenge the voluntariness and admissibility of his cautioned statement, even when he was represented by Defence Counsel. Second, I noted that the Accused had written the abovementioned sentences himself.[^80] Third, IO Lee testified that the Accused had written the abovementioned sentences after she had read the Notice of Warning to him and asked him what he had to say in relation to the charge.[^81]

> (d)     Accused’s Case for the Defence dated 10 December 2018:

>> “… I am pleading guilty to all my drugs related charges …

>> I will be pleading guilty to the remaining 20 charges. However, I believe that there were some changes to the law recently and am not sure on how my charge for DAC-919123-17 would be affected. I hope to be given some information on this particular charge by the Prosecution before I decide on what to do with that charge because I am unrepresented and without legal advice.

>> However, if the change to the law has no bearing to DAC-919123-17, and is of no diffence to me, then I would also be pleading guilty to that charge as well. …” (_sic._)

> I noted that there was only one Case for the Defence in the Court’s records, which was the abovementioned document that the Prosecution had tendered while cross-examining the Accused.[^82] According to the DPP, the Accused had filed the said document after the Prosecution had filed and served on the Accused its Case for the Prosecution and after the Accused had been directed to file his Case for the Defence, in the course of the pre-trial Criminal Case Disclosure process.[^83]

74     The Accused never stated in all the abovementioned documents the grounds on which he had argued his Defence at trial, which suggested that these grounds were afterthoughts, namely:

> (a)     That his urine specimen had not been procured by Shalihan but by an Aetos auxiliary police officer from the lock-up who was not authorised to do so;

> (b)     That his urine specimen had been procured not in accordance with the urine procurement protocol set out in legislation;

> (c)     That there were breaks in the chain of custody of the two blue-capped bottles containing his urine specimen;

> (d)     That the two blue-capped bottles of urine specimen that were sent to HSA, analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine were not in fact his urine specimen;

> (e)     That he had admitted to consuming ‘Ice’ in the long statement that Shalihan had recorded from him on 13 January 2017 as a result of physical assault and threats by Shalihan and inducements from Shalihan concerning Malini;

> (f)     That he had admitted to consuming ‘Ice’ in the further long statement that IO Lee had recorded from him on 6 June 2017 because of a misapprehension of the context for which she was recording his statement;

> (g)     That he had not stated his defence in the cautioned statement that IO Lee had recorded from him on 6 June 2017 because she had told him to say whatever he wished to say to the Court during his trial; and

> (h)     That he had intended to dispute the present drug consumption charge and to claim trial to it in his Case for the Defence.

75     Notwithstanding the Accused’s admissions in his long statement and further long statement to having consumed ‘Ice’ before his arrest on 12 January 2017 and his indications that he would plead guilty to the present charge in his cautioned statement and Case for the Defence, the fact remained that any conviction of the Accused on a drug consumption charge must be based on the proper procurement and analysis of his urine specimen in accordance with the requirements under section 31 MDA as well as Regulation 3(1) r/w First Schedule Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations. In this regard, the legal burden remained on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused’s urine specimen had been properly procured from him, analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine.

76     While the Prosecution might have succeeded in rebutting the Accused’s allegations and thereby undermined his Defence’s case, there remained in the Prosecution’s case two inherent and fundamental weaknesses:

> (a)     first, that there was insufficient documentary proof of the Accused’s urine procurement process and the extent to which it complied with the requirements under section 31 MDA as well as Regulation 3(1) r/w First Schedule Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations; and

> (b)     second, that Shalihan, Adrian and Chia’s testimony concerning their participation in the Accused’s urine procurement process was based not on their actual recollection of what they had in fact done on 13 January 2017, but on what the standard urine procurement protocol was, what their usual practice of urine procurement was and their belief that the Accused’s urine procurement process on 13 January 2017 had complied with the required protocol and was consistent with their usual practice.

77     Where the main issue in dispute in this case centred on the propriety of the urine procurement process (as opposed to, for example, a medication or spiking defence), it was for the Prosecution, through its witnesses and the exhibits tendered through them, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused’s urine specimen had been procured from him in compliance with the requirements under section 31 MDA as well as Regulation 3(1) r/w First Schedule Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, and that his urine specimen was properly analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine. This, in my assessment, the Prosecution had not succeeded in doing in the present case. In this regard, section 22 MDA, being merely an evidential tool to assist the Prosecution in meeting its legal burden of proof, could not assist the Prosecution in overcoming the fundamental weaknesses in its case.

78     As the Court of Appeal noted in **_Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter_** <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> at \[149\](f)\], “\[o\]nce the court has identified the flaw internal to the Prosecution’s case, weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with, because the Prosecution has simply not been able to discharge its overall legal burden”.

## Decision on Conviction

79     Having assessed the evidence in its totality, I found that even though the Accused was unable to establish an affirmative defence to prove his innocence, the Prosecution had not proven the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I acquitted him on the charge accordingly.

## Conclusion

80     The Accused is currently remanded for numerous other outstanding charges. No bail was offered to him as he had previously absconded and allegedly re-offended while on court bail.

81     I would like to thank DPP Theong Li Han for the professionalism with which she had conducted this protracted trial, and the assistance that she and Investigating Officer Lee Swee Leng had rendered to the Court in identifying and locating the additional witnesses and exhibits that were relevant to the Court’s assessment of the evidence.

82     In stark contrast, the Accused had throughout the trial conducted himself belligerently and had on repeated occasions made baseless allegations against the DPP, the Investigating Officer, the Prosecution witnesses and even the Court. The trial lasted ten days. The Accused had received the Notes of Proceedings for the first eight days of the trial by 7 June 2021. Despite the Court’s reminders for the Accused to put in his application for the Notes of Proceedings for the final two days of the trial expeditiously upon the conclusion of the trial on 8 June 2021, his application was made through ICMS only on 21 June 2021, after the Court-directed timeline of 18 June 2021 for parties to file their closing submissions. The Accused’s application for the Notes of Proceedings for the final two days of the trial was approved on 21 June 2021, and the Notes of Proceedings were provided to him on the same day. The Accused was invited to make his closing submissions orally.
