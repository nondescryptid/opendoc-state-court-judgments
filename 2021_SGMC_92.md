### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

1       The accused is 55 years old, and pleaded guilty to two charges, one of which was using his mobile phone to record “upskirt” videos (“upskirt videos”) of 70 female victims on 70 occasions taken at various locations, where these incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct, giving rise to an amalgamated charge under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“PC”) read with section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)(“CPC”). The other charge relates to an attempt to insult the modesty of one female victim, by attempting to record an upskirt video of her using his mobile phone, which offence is punishable under Section 509 read with Section 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       Two other charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing, namely, that of attempting to insult the modesty of a female by attempting to record an upskirt video by using his mobile phone, which offence is punishable under Section 509 read with Section 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and possession of 13 films which are obscene, which offence is punishable under Section 30(1) of the Films Act, Chapter 107.

3       The accused was sentenced to a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment. The defence counsel applied for the accused to defer serving his sentence to 3 December 2021, which was duly granted. On 26 November 2021, the accused, who was unrepresented, filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence. The execution of the sentence has been stayed pending the appeal. The accused is presently on bail pending the appeal.

## The proceeded charges

4       The two charges which the accused pleaded guilty to were as follows:

> **MCN 901313-2020 (2nd charge)**

> You \[..\] are charged that between 20 April 2019 and 10 October 2019, on no less than 70 occasions at various locations in Singapore, including Beauty World MRT Station, did insult the modesty of not more than seventy (70) unidentified women, to wit, by recording upskirt videos of the said seventy (70) women using your mobile phone, and these incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which charge is amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

> **MCN 901314-2020 (3rd charge)**

> You \[..\] are charged that you on 10 October 2019, at or about 10.30pm, at Beauty World MRT Station, Singapore did attempt to insult the modesty of one female victim, V2 \[redacted\], to wit, by attempting to record an upskirt video of her using your mobile phone, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 read with Section 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **Charges Taken into Consideration (TIC)**

> **MCN 901312-2020**

> You \[..\] are charged that you, on 11 September 2019, at or about 3.20pm, at Collyer Quay, #26-01, Ocean Financial Centre, Singapore, did attempt to insult the modesty of one female victim, V1 \[redacted\], to wit, by attempting to record an upskirt video of her using your mobile phone, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **MCN 901315-2020**

> You \[..\] are charged that you on 2 October 2019, at or about 6.40pm, at 47 Yuk Tong Avenue, Singapore, did have in your possession 13 films which are obscene, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 30(1) of the Films Act, Chapter 107 (“Films Act”).

## The Facts

5       On 11 September 2019, at 7.28pm, V1, 25-year old, female victim, lodged an electronic police report alleging that she had caught the accused taking upskirt videos of her earlier that day. The incident location given was Collyer Quay, #26-01, Ocean Financial Centre, Singapore (subject matter of the TIC charge).

### MCN 90313-2020

6       The accused’s mobile phone was seized which revealed that it contained upskirt videos of 70 unidentified women. The accused had with intent to insult the modesty of the victims, recorded the upskirt videos of these victims at various locations in Singapore, including Beauty Word MRT station, between 20 April 2019 and 10 October 2019. The recording of the upskirt videos were acts which intruded upon the privacy of the respective victims. These victims were unknown. The 70 incidents, taken together amounted to a course of conduct, giving rise to the amalgamated charge.

### MCN 901314-2020

7       On 10 October 2019 at about 10.15pm, the female victim, V2, 25 years old, was riding on the escalator at Exit B of Beauty World MRT station. While she was on the escalator, she felt a brush on her legs. She turned around and spotted the accused holding his mobile phone which was on video recording mode, with intent to insult the modesty of V2 by taking an upskirt photograph of her. However, the video was not recorded as V2 discovered what he was doing and confronted the accused. The accused then fled from the MRT station. However, passers-buy assisted to detain the accused at Exit A of the said MRT station until the police arrived.

## Antecedents

8       The accused is a first offender.

## Prescribed punishment

9       The prescribed punishment for an offence of insulting the modesty of a woman by taking upskirt videos for the amalgamated charge under section 509 PC read with section 124(4) CPC, is an imprisonment term which may extend up to two years or with fine or with both. The punishment prescribed for the attempted charge of insulting the modesty of V2 in attempting to record an upskirt video of her is an imprisonment which may extend up to six months or with fine or with both[^1].

## Calling of the Mandatory Treatment Order (MTO) Suitability Report

10     The defence had sought for a MTO Suitability Report (“MTO Report”) to be called to assess the accused’s suitability to be sentenced to an MTO for the following reasons[^2]. The prosecution did not object to the calling of the same.

> (a)     Since 2009, the accused had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and hypomania. The severity of his condition and his lack of judgment was apparent from the psychiatrist’s observation that the accused was “irritable and threatened his siblings and also threatened to harm himself” when he was first admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) as an inpatient then[^3].

> (b)     During the period when the offences were committed, the accused was seeking treatment and under medication for his condition.

> (c)     When the accused attended in IMH after his arrest, he was observed to be “circumstantial and complained of fluctuating mood for a few months[^4]”. It was submitted that the accused was most likely to be in a similar state of mind at the material time when the offences were committed, and that he had acted completely out of character.

> (d)     It was further submitted that the accused had “significant rehabilitative potential” (see _GCX v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span> at \[39\] (“_GCX_”)) as he “had been regularly receiving medications for his disorder and had been compliant in his medication intake”.

11     As noted in _GCX_ at \[39\], See Kee Oon J had observed as follows:

> …an MTO should be considered – and the calling of an MTO suitability report contemplated – only if the offender possessed sufficient rehabilitative potential. This balancing exercise, however, should only be _tentative and provisional_ in nature at this stage. This was because the court lacked sufficient information at this point to fully appreciate and assess the true rehabilitative potential of the offender.

12     Given the lack of sufficient information to assess the ‘true rehabilitative potential’ of the accused save for the defence’s assertion that the accused has been regularly taking his medication and undergoing treatment for his psychiatric condition, I called for the MTO suitability report before determining the appropriate sentence for the current case.

## Findings of the MTO Report

13     In the MTO Report dated 12 July 2021, it was stated as follows:

> (a)     The accused had bipolar disorder at the material time of the offending, and “appeared to be suffering from a hypomanic episode with mixed features”, which was evidenced by the “co-existence of both depressive and hypomanic features within the same time frame”. It is likely that the accused’s judgment would have been impaired, thus making him more likely to act on his urges to make upskirt films.

> (b)     The IMH psychiatrist, Dr Ganesh Kudva Kundadak (“Dr Ganesh”) opined that there was a “degree of causal contribution from the above psychiatric condition with the offences for which he has been convicted of”.

> (c)     Dr Ganesh further assessed that the accused had “limited insight into his condition and “has demonstrated throughout his treatment history, a penchant for being non-compliant to prescribed medications and scheduled appointments.

> (d)     The accused had limited social support and was estranged from his family. The accused’s brother, Mr Lim Kah Chuan (“Mr Lim”), reported that the family was unable to render the necessary supervision to ensure that the accused takes his medication.

14     Dr Ganesh, had taken into account the memo from Dr Tan Chue Tin (“Dr Tan”), dated 28 August 2020, the accused’s private psychiatrist, whom the accused had been undergoing treatment for his bipolar disorder from 27 August 1991 to 11 July 2008 (“Dr Tan’s memo”) and in light of the foregoing reasons as stated in \[13\] above, the accused was not recommended for MTO.

15     In light of the MTO Report, the defence had sought for a MTO Clarification Report to clarify the following:

> (a)     Whether the accused’s mental condition had impaired his impulse control to the extent that it inhibited his ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions.

> (b)     Whether the accused’s non-compliance of medication could be resolved through an increase in the number of follow-up sessions and whether the accused’s mental condition was likely to improve with treatment.

16     The prosecution did not object for defence counsel to clarify the same.

## MTO Clarification Report

17     In the MTO Clarification Report dated 30 August 2021 (“MTO Clarification Report”), Dr Ganesh highlighted the following key salient points and for the reasons stated below, it was assessed that the accused was unsuitable for an MTO:

> (a)     Whilst the condition affected the accused’s judgment and made it difficult for him to control the urges to take upskirt videos, it did not impair him sufficiently so that he was unaware of his actions or unaware of the wrongfulness of those actions.

> (b)     The accused had further stated that he had taken steps to conceal his recording device, and that he had continued engaging in these acts because he had not been caught. These factors demonstrate his awareness of the wrongfulness of his actions.

> (c)     The accused had manifested a long-standing history of non-compliance to follow-up appointments and treatment. The accused had suffered from relapses of his illness, mainly due to his non-compliance to prescribed medications. This non-compliance has continued to the present day, namely, during the clinical review on 4 August 2021, where the accused had also ingested lower doses of medication than prescribed.

> (d)     The accused often defaulted his appointments and have not been compliant in taking his medication.

> (e)     During the assessment for the MTO, the accused was “not psychiatrically unwell” but nonetheless manifested “limited insight into his condition”. Dr Ganesh opined that it was unlikely that the accused’s insight would improve with an improvement of his psychiatric condition and was likely to continue to remain limited.

> (f)     Even if the appointments were to be held at a greater frequency, “the paucity of supervision at home would mean that there \[was\] no reasonable way to ensure that the accused \[was\] ingesting the medication that \[was\] prescribed. The accused’s family was not able to supervise his “medication ingestion”.

18     Following the MTO Clarification Report, defence counsel had applied for a Supplementary MTO Report given that the accused was in discussion with his family members to supervise his consumption of medication. The prosecution did not object for a Supplementary MTO Report to be obtained given that the accused was in discussion with his family members to address the issue of his non-compliance with medication.

## Supplementary MTO Report

19     In preparing the Supplementary MTO Report dated 27 October 2021 (“Supplementary MTO Report”), Dr Ganesh examined the accused on 26 October 2021 and spoke to Mr Lim, the accused’s brother as mentioned in \[13(d)\] above. He opined that the accused was not suitable for MTO for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, there has been a “significant pattern of non-compliance to appointments and medications”. This was also noted by Dr Tan as per \[14\] above. Further, the accused had in more recent times, defaulted on multiple appointments and continued “to ingest lower than prescribed doses of his medications”.

> (b)     Second, the accused’s family had demonstrated an inability to supervise him. Despite Mr Lim’s claims that he was willing to escort the accused for future appointments at the IMH, the accused continued to default in his appointments even as recently over the past two to three months. This was evident from the fact that the accused had failed to attend a scheduled appointment four weeks after his appointment with Dr Ashvini Selvaraj (“Dr Ashvini”) on 4 August 2021. The accused had called the case manager from IMH, one Mr Ryan Ee (“Mr Ee”), on 1 September 2021, to schedule an appointment the following day as he claimed that he had two to three days left of medication. However, Mr Ee had difficulty contacting the accused thereafter to facilitate the appointment as phone calls made to the accused would be declined. Mr Lim was contacted and he confirmed that the accused “was difficult to contact”. Even if Mr Lim were able to “escort” the accused to IMH for appointments, it was clear that Mr Lim was unable to supervise the accused’s daily ingestion of his medication.

> (c)     Third, “even if an intramuscular depot antipsychotic” were to be administered, it would not be able to replace the sodium valproate (oral medication) which the accused was required to take to stabilise his mood. Given the accused’s “penchant for defaulting appointments”, Dr Ganesh opined that it was “reasonable to assume that he will also default the appointments for him to receive his intramuscular depot antipsychotic.” It was assessed that this was not a viable option for the accused to ensure compliance to treatment.

> (d)     Fourth, what was “apparent” in Dr Ganesh’s interviews with the accused was the accused’s lack of insight into his psychiatric condition, in particular, “his need to consume the appropriate dosage of medications and the need to attend appointments regularly”. Dr Ganesh further assessed that the accused’s claims “to change his ways in the future were often poorly substantiated and elaborated on”. As such, given the accused’s previous history of defaulting in his appointments not only with Dr Tan, his private psychiatrist, as well as the appointments in IMH to date, Dr Ganesh opined that the accused was of “at high risk of breaching the MTO”.

## Defence’s application for a second MTO report

20     Counsel had sought for another MTO report to assess the accused’s suitability on MTO as his friend, one Careen Tan, whom he has known for one year, was prepared to supervise his medication.

21     The prosecution objected to the application on the basis that the accused lacked insight into his mental condition and had been defaulting in his appointments with IMH. Further, he has been non-compliant with medication and his family was not willing to supervise his medication. His rehabilitation needs would be best served in a structured environment, namely, prisons, where his medication may be supervised.

22     I declined to call for another MTO report to assess the accused’s suitability for MTO given the latest report, namely, the Supplementary MTO report did not recommend the accused for MTO for the reasons as stated in \[19\] above. Thereafter, parties were invited to address the Court on sentence.

## Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions

23     The prosecution relied on its sentencing submissions tendered earlier and submitted that the key sentencing consideration for the present case was general deterrence[^5]. The High Court in _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) noted at \[27\], that it is “_derived from the overarching concept of ‘public interest’_” and that it “_aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender_” (see \[24\]). In the present case, it was submitted that:

> (a)     Such offences, by their very nature, cause public disquiet.

> (b)     The offences affected a large number of victims.

> (c)     Such offences are easy to commit – especially with the advent of modern technology – but difficult to detect. In _PP v Albert Tay_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 778</span> (“_Albert Tay_”), the offender placed a video camcorder in his home toilet and filmed two of his friends showering and relieving themselves. Yong Pung How CJ noted at \[23\] that with the advent of modern technology, tapes from video camcorders run the risk of possible circulation to other people, which necessitated the imposition of an imprisonment term. Similar observations were made by the High Court in _PP v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> (“_Chong Hou En_”), in which the offender, had inter alia, filmed his girlfriend’s family members using the shower. Chan Seng Onn J held at \[65\] that:

>> …I am in agreement that general deterrence is particularly relevant. Given the fact **that mobile phones with camera functions are now ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions come in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper to acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting women almost anywhere…The need for general deterrence is even more pressing now than during the time that** **_Albert Tay_** **was decided, given how far technology has advanced. Cameras have shrunk remarkably in size while the clarity with which images are captured has improved. The miniaturisation of cameras has made it increasingly easier for them to be concealed and harder for the victims to detect, thereby encouraging voyeurs to take more risks. In addition, the ease with which films can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this day and age further warrants the need for general deterrence. Unimaginable shame and distress to the victims may be caused if the films are disseminated worldwide via the Internet**. Although in this case no films were uploaded and disseminated, **the danger, which is not fanciful but very real, that it could have happened is sufficient to warrant a deterrent sentence.**

24     It was further submitted that the observations in _Albert Tay_ and _Chong Hou En_ illustrate that technological advancements have made the public more susceptible to such voyeuristic behaviour and underscore the pressing need to deter the commission of such offences.

25     For the reasons as stated in \[13\] above, the accused was found unsuitable for MTO. The prosecution highlighted the following twin considerations in the current case: (i) first, the accused needs to be deterred for a fairly serious offence committed numerous times over half a year; and (ii) second, there was a recognition that the accused needed to receive proper treatment for his mental condition. In that regard, it was submitted that these twin objectives would be best achieved in a _structured environment_, such as a prison, where there can be proper administration of consultations and medications for his condition[^6].

26     The prosecution objected to other sentencing options to be imposed, namely, that of probation or other community-based sentences (“CBS”) such as the Day Reporting Order (“DRO”) for the following reasons:

> (a)     These sentencing options do not adequately take into account the serious nature of the offences committed over a prolonged period.

> (b)     The recurring issue of lack of family and social support would likely be a common thread where there would be no support network to ensure that the accused undergoes such programmes successfully and that his mental condition would be managed in the meantime such that he received the help that he needs, and that he did not re-offend while he was in the community.

27     Whilst the accused was untraced, the prosecution submitted that he could not be considered a first-time offender given his multiple offending: see _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v PP_ \[2003\] 2 SLR (R) 334.

28     The prosecution referred to two High Court cases, namely, that of _Chong Hou En_ and _PP v Ang Zhu Ci Joshua_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1059</span> (“_Joshua Ang_”) as sentencing precedents. In _Chong Hou En_, the male offender pleaded guilty to five charges of insulting the modesty of a woman by intruding upon her privacy under section 509 PC and one count of possession of obscene films under section 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) (“Films Act”). 10 other charges under section 509 PC and one charge under section 30(1) of the Films Act were TIC for purposes of sentencing.

29     For one charge under section 509 PC, which involved taking an upskirt video with a mini-camera which the offender attached to the tip of his shoe with Blu-Tac, he came up from behind the victim and placed his foot underneath the skirt of the victim. This took place in the supermarket. As for the other four charges, the offender had, through a series of carefully planned episodes, recorded his girlfriend’s family members in the shower. The offender knew that they would take a shower once they had switched on the water heater. He would then enter the toilet to place a digital camera (that was disguised as a lighter to avoid detection) there. After the family members had finished their showers, the offender would retrieve the camera and access the videos.

30     Through the above steps, the offender filmed the older sister of his girlfriend (aged 30 years old at the time of the offence) and his girlfriend’s two young nieces (aged 12 and 10 at the time of the offence). His girlfriend’s sister-in-law (aged 31 at the time of the offence), who was the mother of the two nieces, was also filmed. These obscene videos captured the victim fully nude with moving images of their breasts and vulvas.

31     Although the offender was diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder and fetishism, the High Court held at \[61\] that ‘voyeurism is merely a clinical description of what is essentially a perverse behavioural option and that it does not deprive a person of his self-control in the way that an impulse control disorder does’.

32     The prosecution’s appeal was allowed and the High Court sentenced the offender to 12 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the charges under section 509 PC and 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the charge under section 30(1) Films Act. Sentences for one charge under section 509 PC and one charge under section 30(1) Films Act were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

33     In _Joshua Ang’s_ case, the male offender, a 29 year old former auditor, had pleaded guilty to 15 proceeded charges consisting of 13 counts of filming upskirt videos under section 509 PC and two counts of attempting to film upskirt videos under section 509 read with section 511 PC. The remaining 112 charges of filming or attempting to film upskirt videos under section 509 PC or section 509 read with 511 PC respectively, were TIC for purposes of sentencing.

34     The offender in _Joshua Ang’s_ case had filmed upskirt videos of his female friends, acquaintances, and former colleagues for a period of three years. All of the eight women in the 127 charges (save for one) were known to him. The offender’s modus operandi was as such: he would hold the said phone/recording device in his hand, switch the said phone/recording device to “video mode” and flip the mobile phone with the back camera lens facing upwards. Thereafter, he would deliberately move near his intended victim to record the upskirt video. On two occasions, he had hidden the phone in a paper bag and moved the paper bag under the skirt of his intended victim to film the upskirt video. Thereafter, he would download the said videos into his laptop and save the videos in his portable hard disk, where he created folders to organise the upskirt videos which he had taken according to the names of the victims.

35     The District Judge in _Joshua Ang’s_ case imposed a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment with three of the sentences ordered to run consecutively. On appeal, the High Court held that the sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment per charge was in line with the precedent cases and given that he had committed or attempted to commit such a serious offence 127 times and over a long period of three and a half years, it was held that the offender ought to be appropriately punished for his actions (see \[5\]). However, the High Court allowed the appeal and ordered two of the sentences to run consecutively instead, in light of the offender’s high degree of remorse, his exceptional rehabilitation and the strong support from his family and community, resulting in a global sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment (see \[6\] – \[8\]).

36     In light of the present accused’s mental condition, his plea of guilt and the sentencing precedents of _Chong Hou En_ and _Joshua Ang_ referred to above, a sentence of at least five to six months’ imprisonment was sought for the amalgamated charge in MCN 901313-2020, consisting of 70 upskirt videos of unknown victims, recorded over a period of about six months, which was an uplift from the sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment imposed for a single occasion of an offence under section 509 read with section 511 PC (for _Joshua Ang’s_ case). As for the charge in MCN 901314-2020, which was a charge of attempting to insult the modesty of the victim, a sentence of two to three months’ imprisonment was sought. It was submitted for both sentences to run concurrently, resulting in a global sentence of at least five to six months’ imprisonment.

## Defence’s Mitigation Plea and Sentencing Submissions

37     Counsel relied on her mitigation plea previously submitted on 17 June 2021, in seeking for a MTO report to be called for. The accused’s personal circumstances were highlighted:

> (a)     The accused is the sixth out of seven children in his family and he has a younger sister.

> (b)     The accused’s father passed on in 1978 when the accused was only 12 years old. Despite being in a big family, the accused never got much emotional support growing up. As a result, he was unable to get over the loss of his father and had to endure a tumultuous period of growing up. This had impacted him psychologically.

> (c)     The accused’s relationship with his family members became increasingly strained over the years and his family members grew increasingly estranged from him., and their interactions often turned into acrimonious exchanges. The accused was often left with the impression that his family members were disdainful towards him because of his mental disorder, and this had a detrimental effect on his psychological well-being.

38     Given the accused’s mental condition at the material time, it was submitted that the accused’s judgement was impaired, which resulted in his offending behaviour. Given the accused’s strained relationship with his family, which sometimes, involved the police, this has led the accused to feel unloved and uncared for, which affected his mood swings. In that regard, a community-based sentence (CBS) was sought for or in the alternative, for the court to impose the most lenient sentence possible.

## The sentence

39     In the present case, the High Court decision in _PP v Chong Hou En_ would be particularly instructive as to the sentencing principles that the court should consider, in determining the appropriate sentence for similar offences of taking upskirt videos.

40     General deterrence was particularly relevant as observed by the High Court in _Albert Tay_ and _Chong Hou En_, as the advent of modern technology has consequently led to such offences being easily committed but difficult to detect, given that mobile phones and electronic devices with camera and recording functions are now ubiquitous (see \[23(c)\] above). As noted in _Joshua Ang_ and _Chong Hou En_, for offences such as the present, public interest and deterrence had to be accorded due weight.

41     Similar to the approach taken by the High Court in _Chong Hou En_ and _Joshua Ang_, was determining the mitigating value to be attributed to an offender’s mental condition. The key question was whether the nature of the mental condition was such that the individual retained substantially the mental ability or capacity to control or refrain himself when he committed the criminal acts. If the individual’s ability to refrain himself was not impaired, and he instead chose not to exercise his self-control, then the presence of the mental condition would be given little or no mitigating value (see _Chong Hou En_ at \[28\] and _Joshua Ang_ at \[3\]).

42     In the MTO Report, the accused was assessed to be suffering from bipolar disorder and was in a “a hypomanic episode with mixed features” at the material time and it was “likely” that his judgement “would have been impaired thus making him more likely to act on his urges to make upskirt films”.

43     In the MTO Clarification Report, Dr Ganesh clarified that whilst the accused’s condition affected his judgement and “made it difficult for him to control his urges to take up-skirt videos, it did not impair him sufficiently so that he was unaware of his actions or unaware of the wrongfulness of those actions”. In fact, the accused was aware of what he was doing at the material time. He had taken steps to conceal his recording device, and that he had continued engaging in these acts because he had not been caught. It was clear that the accused was aware of the “wrongfulness of his actions”.

44     From the above, it was evident that the accused retained the capacity to control himself when he committed the offences but chose to do so, as he continued to take steps to conceal the recording device when he was not caught, resulting in the recording of upskirt videos of 70 unidentified female victims over a period of six months, which was the subject matter of the second charge.

45     On the contrary, there was no evidence before me that the accused was not able or that he was substantially not able to control or refrain himself from committing the present offences because of his mental disorder or that punishment was unlikely to be effective in instilling fear in him and to deter him from committing the same criminal acts in future because of his mental disorder.

46     Further, the accused was not recommended for MTO and in this regard, any report made by the appointed psychiatrist, namely, Dr Ganesh, ‘shall be taken to be **final and conclusive** as to the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a), (b) and (c)’ (see section 339(9) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) (“CPC”)).

47     The relevant provisions under section 339(3)(a)-(c) CPC are below:

> (a)    the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment;

> (b)    the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

> (c)    the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence.

48     Additionally, section 339(5) CPC provides as follows:

> (5)    In assessing whether an offender is a person suitable for treatment for his psychiatric condition, the appointed psychiatrist may take into account the following factors:

>> (a)    whether the offender is likely to attend the treatment session on such day and at such time and place as the appointed psychiatrist may require;

>> (b)    the physical and mental state of the offender; and

>> (c)    the financial standing of the offender and his ability to pay all or any part of the costs of his treatment which is it reasonable for him to pay.

49     It was clear from across all reports put up by Dr Ganesh, namely, the MTO report, MTO Clarification Report and the Supplementary MTO Report, that the accused lacked insight into his mental condition and that he was non-compliant to any prescribed medication. Further, his lack of familial support made it untenable for his family members to supervise his medication on a regular basis. Further, the accused continued to default on his appointments even as recent as the last two to three months when the various reports were prepared[^7]. According to Dr Ganesh, the accused had failed to attend his appointments between 4 August 2021 and 26 October 2021. He was unable to offer a clear explanation for failing to attend his appointments. Despite stating that he had consumed the medication daily, the accused was “unclear” as to how he still had his supply of medication even when he failed to attend his appointments between August 2021 and October 2021. By his own admission, the accused had been taking less medication than what had been prescribed[^8].

50     Given that the accused was not recommended for MTO by Dr Ganesh, MTO could not be imposed by the court pursuant to the clear wording of section 339(4) CPC which states as follows:

> (4)    A court **must not** make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender if the report submitted by the appointed psychiatrist states that he is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c).

51     That said, I agreed with the prosecution that the imposition of other alternative CBS, like DRO or probation would similarly not be tenable given the lack of familial and social support to ensure that the accused takes his medication or that he undergoes treatment in the IMH regularly. More tellingly is the fact that Dr Ganesh had opined that “it was unlikely that the accused’s insight would improve with an improvement of his psychiatric condition and was likely to continue to remain limited” (see \[17(e)\] above\]. In this regard, Dr Ganesh explained that the accused “continues to demonstrate a lack of insight insofar as not accepting that he has a mental illness, and not accepting that he needs treatment for his illness[^9]”.

52     Whilst there was “a degree of causal contribution” between the accused’s psychiatric condition and the commission of the offences at the material time, the fact that the accused was not recommended for MTO was a clear indication of the appointed psychiatrist’s assessment that the accused had low rehabilitative potential. With poor familial support, there was little optimism in so far as rehabilitation in the community would be a viable option. Whether rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing principle or not would involve finding the “right balance” between the various sentencing considerations: see _Lim Ghim Peow v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1287</span> at \[39\] referred to by High Court in _GCX_ at \[78\].

53     In my view, the principles of deterrence and retribution did not recede in significance in this case even though the accused’s psychiatric condition affected his judgement and made it difficult for him to control his urges to take upskirt videos as it did not impair him sufficiently such that he was unaware of his actions, or unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions. The accused had possessed some capacity to retain control to commit such offences despite being aware of the wrongfulness of his actions as he had even taken steps to conceal the recording device, to avoid detection.

54     General deterrence was particularly relevant as observed by the High Court in _Albert Tay_ and _Chong Hou En_, as the advent of modern technology has consequently led to such offences being easily committed but difficult to detect, given that mobile phones and electronic devices with camera and recording functions are now ubiquitous (see \[23(c)\] above). As noted in _Joshua Ang_ and _Chong Hou En_, for offences such as the present, public interest and deterrence had to be accorded due weight.

55     That said, I was prepared to give some mitigating weight to his psychiatric condition, his early plea of guilt and his lack of similar antecedents, in determining the appropriate sentence. Rehabilitation could still take place within the confines of prison upon his incarceration as recommended by Dr Ganesh that the accused “should be seen regularly by a psychiatrist and should be continued on his current medications[^10]”.

56     All considered, I determined that a sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment for the amalgamated charge of insulting the modesty of the female victims, consisting of 70 female victims by taking upskirt videos of them over a six-month period was a fair sentence, as it was an uplift from 12 weeks’ imprisonment imposed for one similar charge of insulting the modesty of one female victim (by taking an upskirt video) as in the case of _Joshua Ang_ (notwithstanding there were 112 charges TIC). As for the attempted charge of taking an upskirt video under section 509 read with section 511 PC, the punishment prescribed was up to six months imprisonment or a fine or both, I am of the view that a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment was a fair one given that there were also two TIC charges, which included a charge of attempting to insult the modesty of a female by attempting to take an upskirt video of the said female victim. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, resulting in a global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment, which adequately reflected the accused’s culpability.

## Conclusion

57     Whilst it was troubling that the accused lacked insight into his mental illness and the need to undergo treatment and take his medication on a regular basis, it is still hoped that the accused would be able to realise the seriousness of the offences that he has committed and continue his treatment upon his release from prison.

58     In my judgement, and for the reasons as stated above and notwithstanding the accused’s psychiatric condition at the material time, there was clearly a heightened need for deterrence, especially in light of the nature of the offences, where a strong message must be sent to deter like-minded individuals from ‘abusing on technological advancements to prey on unsuspecting victims’.

59     In the final analysis, I was also mindful that the overall sentence should not be a crushing one that ‘_could destroy any hope of recovery and reintegration_’ of the accused as it is in the public interest that this does not happen (see _Joshua Ang_ at \[5\] which referred to _Chong Hou En_ at \[67\]).

60     All considered, I was of the view that the global sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment was thus appropriate in the circumstances. This would also adequately take into account the number of victims involved in the amalgamated charge.
