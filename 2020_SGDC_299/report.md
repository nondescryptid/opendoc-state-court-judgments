Criminal law – Offence – s 12(1) Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, Rev Ed 2009) – s 15(3A) Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, Rev Ed 2009) – Duty of employer to take reasonably practicable measures necessary to ensure safety of employees – Supervisor doing a negligent act which endangers safety of others and himself

31 December 2020

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused company, Underwater Contractors Private Limited (‘UWC’) was incorporated in 1979. It had been in the ship repair and marine diving industry for 35 years as of the date of the incident. UWC had 18 full-time divers and four diving supervisors at the material time.

2       The accused, Ng Wei Li, David (Huang Weili, David) (‘David’), has been employed by UWC as a diver since Feb 2013. He was promoted to an assistant diving supervisor in early 2014. Prior to working with UWC, he worked as a commercial diver for about 6 to 7 years.

3       UWC is alleged to have failed to take reasonably practicable measures in contravention of s 12(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A) (‘WSHA’) Act, as were necessary to ensure the safety and health of its employees; namely, that it failed to: (a) ensure that adequate safety measures, in respect of safe work procedures, were taken in respect of the process used by the divers; and (b) implement the existing risk control identified in its risk assessment, in contravention of s 12(1) read with s 20 and punishable under s 50(b) WSHA.

4       Against David, he was alleged to have without reasonable cause performed a negligent act which endangered the safety of others; namely that he instructed the divers under his charge to perform underwater survey works at the vessel when he was aware that the starboard sea chest pumps were in reduced flow, an offence under section 15(3A)WHSA.

5       I was satisfied that the charge against UWC and David was established beyond a reasonable doubt. UWC was fined $300,000. David was sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment. Both UWC and David have appealed against their conviction and sentence. The prosecution has cross-appealed against the sentence of David. The execution of their sentences has been stayed.

## The Case for the Prosecution

### Agreed facts

6       The deceased, Kwok Khee Khoon, aged 36 years, was employed by UWC as a diver. On the day of the incident, he was tasked by David to open and clean the gratings of the sea chests by using a scrapper to scrap off the barnacles, and to take photographs to document the works that were carried out at the starboard and port sea chests.

7       Hartmann Schiffahrts GMBH & CO. KG (‘Hartmann’), the occupier of the vessel MV Frisia Kiel (‘vessel’), engaged Sleipner Shipping Pte Ltd (‘Sleipner’) to carry out underwater survey works for the vessel, which was anchored at the Eastern Working Anchorage. The anchorage is a workplace within the meaning of the WSHA. Sleipner thereafter engaged UWC to carry out the underwater survey works at the vessel. The underwater survey works were scheduled to take place on 4 June 2014 and had to take place on that day to facilitate the vessel’s travel plans.

8       The underwater works comprised of cleaning and welding works in the starboard and port sea chests, bow thruster, and emergency sea chest (see exh P8 & D22). On 3 June 2014, UWC prepared a risk assessment for the underwater survey works. The risk assessment was submitted to both Hartmann and Sleipner.

9       On 4 June 2014 at about 12.45pm, David conducted a toolbox briefing for all five divers, including the deceased. The toolbox briefing was conducted at Marina South Pier on board UWC’s workboat SR3039B.

10     Prior to the toolbox briefing, Hartmann had informed UWC that the port sea chest pump would be shut down and the starboard sea chest pump would be kept in reduced flow. The starboard aft sea chest pump had to be kept running to cool the auxiliary engines of the vessel and provide power to the vessel during anchorage.

11     David briefed the divers on their respective job scope and informed them to approach the sea chest box with caution. In particular, he told the divers to test the level of suction or water intake rate of the starboard sea chest pump by placing their fins or scrappers at the grating before entering the sea chest box.

12     After completing the toolbox briefing, David and the divers proceeded to the vessel on two workboats. Upon reaching the vessel at about 2pm, David went on board the vessel with a ‘Diving Safety’ checklist (Annex B to P1). The items that he went through with the Chief Officer, Saijin Sherwin Otico, and the Chief Engineer, Arendt Adam Andrzej, were the following:

![]([2020] SGDC 0299_Image/[2020] SGDC 0299_image1.png)

13     The Chief Engineer initially wrote ‘Port in use’. After checking with the engine room, ‘Port’ was struck off. It was amended to ‘in use STDB’. It was agreed that the port pump will be shut down and the starboard pump will be operated at reduced flow, which would result in minimum suction force from the starboard aft sea chest pump. The ‘Diving Safety’ checklist stated that “during an underwater maintenance operation, the master or person-in-charge shall not test the main engines of the vessel or turn the vessel’s propeller or thrusters without obtaining clearance from the diving supervisor”. The diving supervisor referred to was David.

14     In return, the vessel issued a ‘Diving Operation Safety’ checklist (Annex C to P1) to UWC as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0299_Image/[2020] SGDC 0299_image2.png)

Under remarks, the last sentence reads ‘PS \[Portside\] seachest close, stb \[starboard\] open and reduced flow’.

15     On 4 June 2014 at approximately 2.35pm, the first diving operation commenced with six divers, including the deceased and David. The divers were split between two workboats, with one group working on the starboard bow and welding the anodes at the bow thrusters, while the second group worked on the port aft, cleaning the port sea chest gratings (Annex D). The deceased and Goh Hui Heong (‘Joe’) were in the second group. The work activities proceeded without any incident for 2 hours and 15 minutes.

16     At about 4.50pm, the divers were informed by the vessel’s crew to stop work for a fire pump testing to be carried out by third-party surveyors. Concurrently, a lifeboat load test was also to be done at the aft of the vessel. The fire pump testing required drawing sea water through the emergency fire pump sea chest.

17     As such, the divers stopped their diving operations. They went on-board their respective workboats. The workboat SR3039B proceeded to the starboard aft sea chest area and workboat SR3384 to the port aft area while waiting for the testing to be completed.

18     At about 6pm, the divers were informed by the vessel that the surveyors had completed their surveys and that they could continue with their diving operations. The deceased was paired with Joe. David was paired with Lim Hong Wai Mario (‘Mario’). Saw Kyar Doe (‘Saw’) and Saidon Bin Ibrahim (‘Saidon’) remained on top the workboat SR3039B.

19     When the diving operation resumed, David and Mario dived first and tested the suction level of the starboard aft sea chest pump by placing their fin and/or scrapper on the sea chest gratings. Both divers were satisfied that the suction level was at a minimal and at the same level prior to 4.50pm and it was safe for conducting underwater work activities. Subsequently, the deceased and Joe tested the suction level at the sea chest gratings and were similarly satisfied that it was safe to enter the sea chest box.

20     The works to be done in the starboard aft sea chest included chipping off the paint works around the area where the anodes were to be welded, before the new anodes were welded in their positions.

21     At about 6.05pm, the deceased entered the starboard aft sea chest and assisted David by using his mask light to illuminate the work area where David was carrying out chipping and welding works. The deceased exited the starboard aft sea chest after the chipping and welding works were done without any problem. At the same time, Mario was able to take photographs of the anodes of the vessel and the starboard sea chest pump pipe inlet at a distance of less than 50cm. This showed that the sea chest pump was running at a reasonably low level.

22     Between 6.10pm and 6.30pm, the deceased entered the starboard aft sea chest two more times to document the completed chipping works and welding of anodes. The deceased exited the starboard aft sea chest without any problem after his second entry (Annex E).

23     During the deceased’s third entry into the starboard aft sea chest, he took a photograph of chipping and welding works that were completed by David. After David completed the chipping works, the deceased moved away from the starboard sea chest floorboard to make way for David to conduct welding works at the same area. Thereafter, the deceased’s fin hit David, who was in the midst of welding anodes on the starboard sea chest floorboard. David turned and saw that the deceased was being sucked into the pipe orifice.

24     David managed to grab the deceased’s hand and tried pulling him. The deceased managed to hold on for a few seconds before losing his grip. As David was not able to pull the deceased away from the pipe orifice, he exited the starboard aft sea chest and saw Joe. He signalled to him to enter the starboard aft sea chest to help to pull the deceased out. David then surfaced to the workboat and shouted at Saw to ask the vessel to turn off the valve. David thereafter dived back in and saw Joe struggling to pull the deceased out of the pipe orifice.

25     Meanwhile, on board the vessel, the vessel’s Third Officer called the engine control room, and informed the Oiler to turn off the valve. As the Oiler did not have the authority to shut down the main sea water pumps, he called the Chief Engineer and informed him of the request.

26     David thereafter re-surfaced and went on board the vessel. He demanded that the Captain shut down the main sea water pumps. The Chief Officer subsequently called the Chief Engineer to switch off the main sea water pumps. It took approximately 20 minutes and another call from the dive boat to the vessel’s Third Officer before the main sea water pumps were finally shut down.

27     Several attempts by the other divers to pull the deceased away from the pipe orifice failed. The deceased was finally pulled out and brought on board the workboat after the starboard sea chest pump was finally shut down. The deceased was motionless and pronounced dead by attending paramedics at about 7.38pm. The cause of death was certified as traumatic asphyxia.

## Evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses

28     The prosecution called eight witnesses. The salient aspects of their evidence is summarised below.

#### Evidence of PW1 – Wong Wen Leong (‘Wong’)

29     Wong is the managing director of N&P Maritime (S.E.A.) Pte Ltd (‘N&P Maritime’) which specialises in lifeboat inspection. On 4 June 2014, Wong together with two colleagues were involved in conducting the inspection and load test for the lifeboat and rescue boat of the vessel, which is done every 5 years.

30     After performing the functional and operational tests on the lifeboat and rescue boat, they moved on to perform the load test on the lifeboat using water bags. In order for the load test to be conducted, they had to fill eight water bags with water. Wong informed the Third Officer of the vessel that they required water. They were provided with a hose but were told that they had to wait for about one and a half hours before they could draw the water. They were informed that this was because there were underwater works being carried out.

31     After the water pump was switched on to draw the water, it took about 45 minutes to fill the eight water bags. Wong was unable to remember if the water bags were filled with sea water but he said that was mostly how it was done. He stated that each bag weighed 300kg. Thereafter, they performed a functional test to ascertain if the lifeboat could be deployed with the load of the water bags.

32     After the test was completed, the water was drained out from the water bags into the sea with a diaphragm pump. The diaphragm pump was operated with compressed air pumped via an air hose from the vessel. Wong stated that the draining out of the water will not have an effect on the sea chest. The draining of the water was completed at around 6pm. Wong did the documentation thereafter.

33     It was Wong’s evidence that he heard some shouting. He did not state at what time he heard the shouting. Sometime later, he came to know that one diver had passed away.

#### Evidence of PW2 – Lam Khing Siew (‘Lam’)

34     Lam was a marine surveyor between 1995 to January 2018. He was working for DNV-GL when he was assigned to attend to a survey on the vessel on 4 June 2014. He was unable to remember the scope of the survey he did on the vessel.

35     He was shown the statement which he made on 12 June 2014 to the Ministry of Manpower. He stated that the events were fresh in his mind when he made the statement. He was allowed to refresh his memory by reading the statement in the witness box. After reading the statement, he stated that he was still unable to remember the events. As a result, the statement that he gave was admitted as P2.

36     In his statement, he stated that he boarded the vessel between 2.15 to 2.30pm. He discussed with the Captain the scope of the survey. He started the survey on the bridge of the vessel. Between 3 to 4pm, he requested the Chief Officer to ask the divers to stop their diving operations for five minutes in order for him to test the fire pump and the emergency fire pump. He said he required two minutes (one minute per pump) for testing the two pumps as he only needed to witness the length of the water jet emitted. He explained that he asked the diving works to stop due to safety considerations because the main fire pump required suction to draw sea water from the sea chest. He performed other checks whilst waiting for the Chief Officer to communicate with the divers. He stated that the 5-minute testing of the two fire pumps took place between 3 to 4pm.

37     Between 5 to 6pm, he witnessed the load testing of the lifeboat. He did not know how the water bags were filled with water. He said the load testing took 15 to 20 minutes.

38     At about 6pm, he went to have his dinner on the vessel. At about 6.30pm, he heard some shouting and there was a blackout. Subsequently he was informed that the survey had to be cancelled due to an accident.

39     Under cross-examination, asked if the Chief Officer arranged for a crew to increase the pump pressure for the fire pump test, he said he was unaware if that happened. Asked if he requested the Chief Officer to increase the pump pressure for the test, he said he only told him to start the pump. He confirmed that the main fire pump is normally located in the engine room and it draws sea water from the sea chest. He agreed that he was satisfied that the pump pressure was sufficiently high to propel the water into the sea based on the length of the water jet.

#### Evidence of PW3 – Abdul Wahab Bin Ahmad (‘Abdul Wahab’)

40     Abdul Wahab is an employee of UWC. He was the captain of the workboat Uwcon with registration number SR3039B.

41     On 14 June 2014 at about 10.25am, Uwcon was anchored at Marina South Pier. At 12pm, he started piloting the boat with five colleagues on board. They were David, Mario, Saidon, Saw and Haji. David was the diving supervisor. Mario and Saidon were the divers. Saw was the standby diver and tender. His role as tender was to support the diving operation when required. Haji was the engineer.

42     He testified that a toolbox meeting was conducted by David as the workboat was moving. Abdul Wahab heard that the divers had to clean the bow thruster, the two sea chests and the fire pump chest located below the bow thruster and to do hot work on the vessel, which was anchored at the Eastern Working Anchorage. He said that his workboat was not involved in the cleaning of the sea chests but in the welding of the anodes in the sea chests. He said that another workboat, SR3384, was involved in the cleaning. It was commanded by Sultan and had two divers, Joe and the deceased on it.

43     Upon arrival alongside the vessel at about 2pm, David went up to the vessel. About half an hour later he returned. David placed the Diving Safety Checklist on the table (Annex B of P1). It had been signed by the vessel and stamped. He was asked what he understood by ‘Minimized Sea Chest Pumps” in the Checklist. He replied it meant that there was ‘slow suction by the pump’. Asked if he was aware of the risks involved when diving in such a situation, he replied that if the pump is minimised, the suction would not be able to suck even a small fish. He was asked why there was no option in the Checklist to completely shut the sea chest pumps, to which he replied that the vessel will then be very dark and unable to run anything on board.

44     Upon David’s instructions, workboat SR3039B was tied to the starboard bow of the vessel. He said this was because David instructed that the bow thruster was to be cleaned first. The other workboat SR3384 was tied to the vessel’s port side before diving commenced.

45     It was Abdul Wahab’s evidence that he was inside the wheelhouse where the marine radio is located. He said the workboats and the vessel’s Third Officer or Duty Officer would communicate with each other on VHF Channel 72. He said that he remained in the wheelhouse for every job.

46     After the work at the starboard bow was completed, the vessel was informed via the marine radio VHF Channel 72 that the workboat would be shifted to the starboard quarter of the vessel for the welding of the anodes.

47     At 4.50pm, the Duty Officer of the vessel requested the underwater works to stop in order to test the fire pump. This instruction was communicated via VHF Channel 72. From his estimate, about half an hour later, the Duty Officer gave instructions to resume diving on the starboard aft. He said it would have been around 5.20pm. Abdul Wahab informed Saw that the vessel had given the green light to resume work. However, he said that before the divers resumed work, the Duty Officer again gave instructions to stop diving to continue the pump again.

48     At 6.10pm, the Duty Officer informed him through VHF Channel 72 that the testing of the pump had been completed. Abdul Wahab requested the stand-by diver, Saw, to inform David who was at the deck of the instructions. He said that the diving must have resumed one to two minutes thereafter.

49     At about 6.30pm, Abdul Wahab heard Saidon informing Saw that a diver was stuck at the sea chest suction. Abdul Wahab tried to contact the vessel via VHF Channel 72 to stop the pump. There was no response from the vessel. At around the same time, he saw David coming up to the deck. David rushed to try to contact the vessel on VHF 72. However, there was still no response from the vessel.

50     Abdul Wahab said a loud hailer was used to attempt to get the attention of the vessel but there was still no response. He said that David then went up the pilot ladder to the vessel. Abdul Wahab continued to try to contact the vessel on VHF Channel 72. He said that the vessel’s suction was stopped after David went on board the vessel. Asked what David did upon returning from the vessel, Abdul Wahab replied that David was on the stern deck but he did not know what he was doing.

51     In the vessel’s logbook (exh D2), Abdul Wahab made the following entry for 6.30pm:

> 1830 hours: Instructed vessel to stop sea chest suction due to diver stuck in sea chest. And she takes about 15 to 20 minutes to stop suction.

52     It was his evidence that at around 6.45pm the vessel responded on VHF Channel 72 to inform that they had stopped the sea chest suction. Thereafter, Abdu Wahab contacted the Maritime Port Authority (‘MPA’) to inform them of the incident.

53     He stated that about 15 to 20 minutes after the vessel had stopped the pump, the deceased was brought up to the deck of the workboat. Subsequently, officers from the MPA and the Police Coast Guard (‘PCG’) arrived. At 1.50am, the workboat was allowed to return to Marina South Pier.

54     Under cross-examination, he stated that the emergency plan when a diver is stuck at the sea chest is to immediately inform the vessel and thereafter MPA and PCG.

#### Evidence of PW4 – Goh Hui Heong (‘Joe’)

55     Joe started off as a trainee diver in 2010. After six to nine months of on the job training, he became a commercial diver. On 1 November 2012, he started working for UWC. In 2017, he went to New Zealand for four to five weeks training in commercial diving.

56     On 4 June 2014 at 12.45pm, he was deployed to work on the vessel. He testified that a toolbox meeting was conducted by David on the workboat SR3039B at Marina South Pier. He stated there were six divers on board – David, Saidon, Saw, Mario, the deceased and himself. David was the supervisor. He briefed them on the scope of work on the vessel and the safety measures. The work involved welding of anodes at the bow thruster tunnel, the emergency fire pump and sea chests, and cleaning of the sea chests gratings and fire pump gratings.

57     The deceased and him were tasked to clean the sea chests gratings. In addition, he had to unbolt sea chest grating 1 on the port and starboard side. He explained that the purpose of a sea chest grating is to prevent rubbish from being sucked into the vessel’s cooling system. He stated the sea chest gratings were to be cleaned from the exterior of the vessel using a scrapper. In addition, for grating 1 (see Annex E of P1), he was required to open it for the divers to enter and exit to carry out the welding of anodes inside the sea chests. He said David, Mario, Saidon and Saw were in charge of the welding works.

58     As for the safety aspects of the work to be carried out, he said it was a standard safety briefing. David told them to approach the sea chest gratings with caution and to check for suction when they approached. They were asked to ensure that there was no suction before entering the sea chest box. He agreed he was reminded to use the socket to ascertain the correct tool to unbolt the sea chest gratings. He said David also instructed the divers tasked to carry out welding works to wear protective rubber gloves at all times.

59     Joe stated he was taught, when he started diving, to observe if there was rubbish being sucked into the sea chest. If there was, it would indicate that there is suction. If there was no rubbish stuck on the gratings, he was taught to use his hand or fin to feel if there is suction.

60     He stated that a vessel cannot switch off all its pumps in anchorage such that there is no suction because of its cooling system. He said that from his experience, he was not able to feel any suction when there is minimum flow. He stated that if he were to feel suction, he would not proceed with the work.

61     Joe and the deceased were on workboat SR3384 and the rest of his colleagues were on SR3039B. At about 2pm, the workboats arrived alongside the vessel. David went on board the vessel for the safety meeting. After David returned to his workboat, he informed via Channel 72 that the diving could commence and that the starboard sea chest was on minimised suction. He said that he understood that the port sea chest pump was not in operation.

62     Joe took about one hour to fasten his workboat SR3384 on the portside. Thereafter, at about 3.35pm, he went down to fasten the downline from the workboat to the sea chest. He explained that the downline is used as a guide for descending and ascending to the sea chest.

63     Thereafter, he opened four bolts on the sea chest grating on the port sea chest and did the same on the starboard side. It took him about 20 to 30 minutes to open the four bolts on one grating. He said that he did not feel any suction throughout. He stated that he did not see any rubbish or debris along the sea chest gratings and did not feel any suction when he opened the starboard sea chest gratings. The deceased took photographs when he opened the gratings.

64     Next, the deceased and him started cleaning the gratings on the portside. Whilst they were cleaning at the portside, there was a break. He estimated it to be around 5pm. He stated that the break was around one hour.

65     At around 6pm, he heard the vessel communicating over Channel 72 of his workboat that the testing had been completed and the diving could resume. Joe and the deceased returned to the portside to finish the cleaning of the sea chest gratings. He did not feel any suction. Thereafter, Joe went over to the starboard side. The deceased was still at the portside.

66     At the starboard side, he did not see any rubbish or debris at the sea chest gratings. He also did not feel any suction. Joe saw David was inside the sea chest, next to grating No. 1. He was doing chipping work. Joe proceeded to grating No. 3 to do the cleaning. He said that Mario was inside the sea chest at grating No. 3. It was Joe’s evidence that he did not feel any suction or increase in suction whilst at grating No. 3.

67     Thereafter, whilst he was at grating No. 3, David rushed out and asked him to help to pull the deceased out. Joe went over to grating No. 1. He saw that the deceased’s fin was protruding slightly out of the grating and his leg was motionless. He said that the deceased was stuck in the pipe orifice behind grating No. 1, which was used to suck the sea water to cool the vessel’s systems. Asked how the suction was at that point, he replied that he was unable to comment. He said that he tried to pull the deceased’s leg but was unable to pull him out. Under cross-examination, he was asked[^1]:

> Q:    Would it be fair to say that there was very high suction coming from the pipe orifice behind grating 1 for Edmund to be stuck in that manner?

> A:    Yes.

> …

> Q:    Now, you could appreciate the high suction power coming from pipe orifice which resulted in Edmund being stuck in that manner.

> A:    Yes, agree.

> Q:    Assuming there was such a high suction power, would you have felt it when you placed your hand at sea chest grating 1?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    But at all times when you were carrying out underwater survey works on 4th of Ju---4th of June 2014, prior to the accident happening, you felt no suction whatsoever from the sea chest gratings. Could I confirm that?

> A:    Yes.

> Q    So, would it be fair to say that the only possible situation where Edmund could be sucked by the pipe orifice in that manner was that someone increased the sea chest pump rate?

> A    Yes.

68     In response to my question, he said that he did not in fact feel any increase in suction. He said that he did not know for a fact if the vessel increased the pump rate.

69     After Joe was unable to pull the deceased out, he went on board the workboat as he was low on air. He shouted that Edmond was stuck. He quickly changed his tank, took a downline and dived. He brought the downline to tie to the leg of the deceased so that Saidon, Saw and Abdul Wahab who were on the deck of the workboat could assist to pull the deceased. He tied the downline to the deceased’s leg but they were unsuccessful in pulling him out.

70     Joe was referred to his statement which he gave at the Ministry of Manpower on 25 June 2014 to refresh his memory of the accident. After referring to his statement, he stated that he had also asked Mario to assist him to pull the deceased. He confirmed the deceased was pulled out after the vessel had switched of its pump. Mario and him then brought the deceased up to workboat SR3039B. He said that the ambulance was called and they waited for MPA.

71     Asked what the risks were of carrying out works when the starboard sea chest pump was minimised, he replied that the risk is that the crew may accidentally turn on the pump. Questioned on how this risk could be minimised or eliminated, he answered that the safety checklist which was signed by the Chief Engineer and the Chief Officer was the safeguard. He stated that as long as lockout/tagout was done with the vessel as per the Diving Safety checklist, it was safe to dive near the sea chest. He was referred to his statement to MOM in which he stated that he had undertaken works in a sea chest on three prior occasions. He said the basic precaution was not to go too deep inside the sea chest unless one is confident to do so.

72     He was referred to Singapore Standard SS511:2010 Code of Practice for Diving at Work (‘SS511:2010 Code’) (exh P9). He stated that he had not seen the document before the accident. He was referred to clause 6.1.4 on ‘Dive Plan’ which states a dive plan must be prepared and agreed upon by all parties involved prior to the commencement of the dive and which addressed the ‘Specific hazards and the methods used to address them’. Asked if this was complied with, Joe replied that he used his hand to feel for suction before he opened the gratings.

73     Asked if the accused had during the toolbox briefing discussed how to recover a diver who is stuck in a sea chest, he said there was no discussion on what to do in an emergency as they were professional divers. He was then asked if the matters stated in sub-paragraphs (a) to (h) of 6.1.4 on ‘Dive Plan’ of the SS511:2010 Code were covered during the toolbox meeting. He replied that they discussed the method of performing the tasks, they were assigned their respective roles, they checked their diving equipment, and the safety aspect, i.e. to check for suction when approaching the sea chests. However, he said that they did not discuss the emergency response plan.

74     He was referred to his MOM statement which he made on 25 June 2014 where he was asked why the works in the sea chest were being carried out when the starboard sea chest pump was not fully closed. He answered that he assumed it was closed as David was inside. However, he maintained that a diver could definitely work inside the sea chest with reduced flow.

75     He did not have access to the risk assessment prepared by UWC in respect of the works undertaken on the vessel. However, he said there would be an annual briefing in January or February and he was familiar with the document. He was referred to serial No. 2 where the activity described is ‘Diver proceed to Dive’ and the potential hazard is ‘Divers trapped by suction from sea chest’. The ‘Risk Control’ was stated as ‘Capt/ Chief Engineer to shut down pumps at sea chest to be inspected’. Joe stated that it was not possible for the vessel to completely switch off its pumps as it required electricity for its cooling system. He agreed that the ‘Severity’ was major and the ‘Risk Level’ was ‘Medium’. Under cross-examination, he agreed that the likelihood of the event occurring was ‘Remote’ as stated in the risk assessment. He said that based on his experience this was a reasonable assessment.

76     He was next referred to Serial No. 5 ‘Cleaning of sea chest gratings’. The ‘potential hazard’ is stated as ‘Divers trapped by suction from sea chest’. Under the ‘Existing risk control’, it is stated as ‘Ensure sea chest grating is tagged out.” Joe explained that this meant the suction was at minimum. Under cross-examination, he confirmed that the likelihood of such a hazard occurring was ‘Remote’, as described. He confirmed that the assessment was reasonable.

77     He was next referred to Serial No. 7 ‘Diver entering sea chest box for inspection.’ Under ‘Potential Hazards’ it is stated as ‘Divers trapped by sea suction.’ And under ‘Existing Risk Control’ as “Ensure no sea suction before entering the box.’ Joe explained that ‘Ensure no sea suction before entering the box’ meant that the pump is running on minimum and not to go near the suction pipe. Under cross-examination, he agreed that this hazard occurring was ‘Remote’, as stated. He confirmed that the assessment was reasonable based on his experience.

#### Evidence of PW5 – Saw Kyar Doe (‘Saw’)

78     Saw has been a commercial diver since 1993. He has been working for UWC for about six years. He does underwater cleaning and welding works.

79     On 4 June 2014, he was assigned to be the standby diver for the underwater works by David. He recalled that he proceeded to the vessel on a workboat from Marina South Pier. There were two workboats which brought the six divers to the vessel.

80     He confirmed that David conducted a toolbox meeting on the workboat. He said he briefed the divers on the activities to be performed as stated in the ‘Diving Safety Checklist’ (Appendix B to P1), and on their respective duties. Saw was not briefed on his duties as a standby diver. He said he knew his duty was to assist the divers when they required assistance, for example, passing tools.

81     He said they were not briefed on the method of carrying out their duties or the equipment to be used in carrying out the work. Asked if David went through the diving equipment, breathing gases and quantities needed for the operation, he said that it was unnecessary as all the divers were familiar with the equipment.

82     He stated that they were told to be very careful and were asked to check the suction power of the sea chest by using the hand. Saw said that one can determine the rate of suction by using the ‘hand test’ (feeling with the hand) and the ‘eye test’ (by looking at the debris moving into the sea chest).

83     He testified that there was no briefing on the emergency response plan. He said that his understanding was that if a diver was in trouble in the sea chest, one of the divers will surface to the workboat to inform, and the standby diver will dive from the downline to pick up the diver. It was his evidence that he did not do anything during the incident when the deceased was stuck except to watch.

84     Saw agreed that David informed the divers that the starboard sea chest pump will be kept running at a minimum flow. In examination-in-chief, he stated that the only safe way to work inside a sea chest is when the sea chest pump is switched off due to the danger of being sucked into the pipe orifice. He said that he had not worked in a sea chest when the pump was running at a minimum flow as the divers are not supposed to do so. He was asked[^2]:

> Q    In the event when you do the eye test and the hand test, if there is some sort of suction, what are you told to do?

> A    We---we clean the sea chest from outside only. If we go inside, the pump had to be stopped.

He went on to confirm that the sea chest pump had to be switched off for welding works within the sea chest. He said he would not know what the suction power will be if the pump is operating in a minimum flow. In response to my questions, he gave the following answers:[^3]

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

So, have you ever come across a situation where you were told that the sea chest pump is at minimum level?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I had never worked inside the sea chest when it was at the minimum.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What about outside? Have you worked outside the sea chest when it’s at minimum?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, I had worked before outside the sea chest.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, are you able to tell us what is the---what would you feel when you were outside when the sea chest is at the minimum?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I can see the water moving very slowly into the sea chest.

 |

  
  

85     Under cross-examination, he agreed that when a vessel is anchored, its pumps will be kept running at a minimum level. He also agreed that he was aware that a diver must check to ensure that there is no suction or very little suction when approaching a sea chest. Contrary to his evidence-in-chief, he went onto agree that the divers are able to work if the pump is running at a minimum flow. He agreed that he was referring to a ballast operation when he said that divers are not allowed to work in a sea chest when the sea chest pump is in operation. He gave the following answers in response to learned counsel’s questions[^4]:

> Q    And when the sea chest pump is running at the minimum level, you may feel no suction at all or you may see sediments moving very slowly towards the sea chest. Agree or disagree?

> A    Yes, I know. I agree.

> Q    Thank you. Now, Mr. Saw, assuming the sea chest pump was running at minimal and you see sediments moving very slowly towards the sea chest, the suction power is so low that it cannot even affect a small fish. Agree or disagree?

> A    Yes, I agree.

> …

> Q    Now, if a s---pump is running at a minimal level, such that it cannot even affect a fish’s movement, you know that you can enter the sea chest box safely. Agree or disagree?

> A    It is safer to off the pump.

> Q    Thank you. I think that’s a fair evidence. Safer to off the pump. That would be the best case scenario. But you also agreed with me earlier that when a vessel is anchored, the pumps will definitely be kept running at a minimal level.

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, Mr. Saw, seen in that context, where a pump had to be kept at the minimal level, when a fish’s movement will not be affected, you know in your years of experience as a diver, that it is safe to enter the sea chest box. Agree or disagree?

> A    Yes, I agree.

86     He agreed that he was aware how to render assistance in the event that a diver was stuck in a sea chest. He agreed that this may entail having to dive to assist, to inform the captain of the workboat, to call the PCG or MPA, or the medical help emergency hotline. He confirmed the contact numbers of PCG and MPA were displayed on the workboats.

87     He agreed that David came up to the workboat and informed him and Captain Wahab that the deceased was stuck in the sea chest. He agreed that David told him and Captain Wahab to inform the vessel to shut the starboard sea chest pump. He said Captain Wahab carried out the instructions. He agreed that he released another lifeline to assist to bring the deceased to the surface.

88     In re-examination, he stated that it is safer not to work inside the sea chest when the sea chest pump is switched on.

#### Evidence of PW6 – Lim Hong Wai, Mario (‘Mario’)

89     Mario became a diver in 2011. He worked with Dive-Marine and T&T Salvage before he joined UWC. He left UWC sometime in 2017.

90     On 4 June 2014, Mario boarded the workboat together with the other divers at Marina South Pier. He confirmed that a toolbox meeting was conducted on the workboat by David. He said that it covered the scope of work, where the work was to be done and the allocation of work to the divers. They were advised to take precautionary measures and to approach the sea chests with caution.

91     Mario was assigned to chip the paintwork at the bow thruster, emergency fire pump, the starboard and port sea chests in order for another diver to weld the anodes. He was required to take photographs before and after the paint work had been chipped.

92     Upon the workboat reaching the vessel, David proceeded to board the vessel. After he came down back to the workboat, he informed the divers that he had cleared the checklist. He again briefed them on the job scope and their duties. He informed them that the starboard sea chest pump will be running on minimum suction. He asked the divers to exercise caution. David also instructed for a safety downline at the bow thruster, the port and starboard sea chests. The downline served as a signpost between the workboat to the location underwater.

93     Based on Mario’s experience, whenever he performed underwater works at an anchorage, one sea chest pump would always be running at minimal suction. He said that he was an experienced diver and was therefore aware that he had to approach the sea chest with caution and test the suction level. He explained that his practice was to observe whether any debris was stuck on the grating and thereafter to use his fin or glove to check if there was suction before getting close to the sea chest. He felt no suction at the starboard sea chest, and he accordingly tied the safety downline from the workboat to the 3rd grating of the sea chest.

94     He had ‘some recollection’ of work having started at the starboard sea chest before the break at 4.50pm. At around 6pm, the vessel informed the workboats via VHF Channel 72 that the underwater works could resume. He said David cautioned the divers to check the suction level at the sea chest before resuming work.

95     Mario dived in together with David. Mario did a visual test and placed his fin against the starboard sea chest gratings. He did not feel any suction. He entered the starboard sea chest and also did not feel any suction. He took photographs of the area where the anodes were to be welded. One of the photographs was of the sea chest pump inlet which was opposite to grating 1. This pipe orifice has a butterfly valve. Mario stated that the pipe orifice was about one to two meters from the entrance to the sea chest. He confirmed that he was in a horizontal position when he took the photograph (see exh D9), and his body was inside the sea chest whilst his fin was outside. He estimated that he was less than one arm’s length from the pipe orifice. He took about five minutes to take the photographs in the starboard sea chest. He described the sea chest to be calm and he did not feel any suction.

96     Upon completion of the photograph taking at the starboard sea chest, Mario went over to the port sea chest to do the same. Thereafter, he returned the camera to the workboat. He then took over the chipping of paint work from David. He stated that David had completed chipping at grating 1. Mario stated that he was doing chipping at grating 2 when he saw the deceased entering the sea chest.

97     After Mario had moved to grating 3, he felt a stirring of the water. He also saw someone flashing a flashlight from outside the sea chest grating and knocking on it. Mario felt that the stirring of the water could be due to someone struggling or suction. He was not sure at that stage what was the cause. He decided to exit the sea chest. On his way out, he saw the deceased was stuck in the butterfly valve. Mario felt ‘a bit’/ ‘slight’ suction. Under cross-examination, he estimated that the level of suction was 5 out of a scale of 10. He tried to pull the deceased’s leg and fin for about 5 to 10 minutes but was unsuccessful. As he was almost out of air, he went up to the workboat to change his tank.

98     After he had done so, he came down. Thereafter, he managed to pull the deceased out. He said a rope was thrown down and the deceased was pulled up to the workboat.

99     Asked if there was a standby diver stationed outside the starboard sea chest, he said that Joe was the standby diver as he assumed that Joe had already completed his work. However, he said that he did not see Joe outside the starboard sea chest when he entered to commence work.

100    He was aware of the existence of the SS511:2010 Code but said he was not familiar with the contents. Mario stated that they used SCUBA because it is easier to access and safer to work within a confined space like a sea chest. He stated that there was a risk of entanglement with the use of SSBA. He also said that one downline between the standby diver and the topside tender on the workboat was sufficient because they were working within the same area.

101    Asked if the emergency procedure to be adopted in the event of a diver being trapped by suction was discussed, he replied that it was not. Under cross-examination, he agreed that he knew instinctively how to render assistance, i.e. to pull the deceased to safety, to get help from standby divers and the workboat captain, to inform the vessel’s officer of the incident, to inform PCG and/or MPA, and to call for medical help. He agreed that someone from the workboat released a lifeline to assist to bring the deceased up to the workboat. He explained that no medical help was sought because he knew the deceased could not have survived as his regulator was dislodged and his face had turned purple.

102    Under cross-examination, he stated that there was no difference between the port sea chest and the starboard sea chest in terms of the size and there was also no difference in the suction level. He confirmed that David welded an anode on the wall of the sea chest box (pg 204 of D33- grid box B5) and was close to the pipe orifice at the time. Mario agreed with learned counsel’s suggestion that UWC took all reasonable practicable measures to ensure the safety of the divers and that David did not endanger their safety by instructing them to perform the works.

#### Evidence of PW7– Darren Anthony Brunton (‘Darren Brunton’)

103    Darren Brunton has a Master of Science in Occupational Health and Safety and Environment. He is the managing director of a group of companies called KB Associates Private Limited (‘KB Associates’), KBA Training Centre Private Limited, KBA Marine Services Private Limited and KBA Associates Europe Limited, which is a company in Aberdeen, Scotland.

104    KB Associates was set up in Singapore 17 years ago. It is a consultancy company. It provides auditing and safety management services globally to diving contractors and oil and gas operators. Darren Brunton started diving when he was 19 years old. He spent 12 years in military diving and 12 years as a commercial saturation and air diver, of which approximately three years were as a diving supervisor. He has been a diving safety consultant for the last 17 years. For the last 15 years, he has also been a member of the Diving Division Management Committee which sits within the International Marine Contractors Association and issues the Industry Safe Operating Guidance for Commercial Diving. He is also the Vice-Chair of the Commercial Diving Association, Singapore. He is the Chairman of the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, UK. He also the chairs the Singapore branch, which is General Overall Safety and is a volunteer post.

105    He has the HSE Part 1, which is an industry-recognised surface-supplied diving qualification, and the HSE Part 2, which is the saturation diving, training and certification. He also has the IMCA (International Marine Contractors Association) air diving supervisor, saturation diving bell supervisor, Life Support Technician Certifications.

106    Darren Brunton was part of the working group on the SS511:2010 Code. In January 2019, he was engaged by the Ministry of Manpower to give his opinion on the safe practices and the considerations to be taken into account whilst doing work which involved cleaning, photography, chipping and welding in a sea chest. He was not given the facts of the instant case. His report dated 14 February 2019 was admitted as P3.

#### Dive plan

107    He stated that is the duty of the employer and the diving supervisor to establish safe diving procedures and part of that would be to provide or ensure a dive plan is established. He explained that a dive plan was fundamental as it outlined how the task is to be done, the people involved and their duties, how the known hazards and the inherent hazards are to be managed and mitigated, the diving equipment to be used and the emergency procedure to adopt. He stated the document would detail step-by-step procedures and actions to complete the task. He said that having step-by-step actions enables each activity to be confirmed, completed, before moving onto the next activity, and if there was any change in the environment, the equipment, or any other factors, the work would be stopped and the risk assessment and procedure revisited, to see how to move forward for the next step. He stated that if the dive plan was not complete and work continued, there would be an elevated risk of something going wrong or a work task being missed that a client may require to be completed.

108    Asked if P8 was sufficient as a dive plan, he stated that it was not. He explained that there were many missing items required for a dive plan, for example, how the task was to be performed, the equipment to be used, the responsibilities of individuals, emergency procedures, how the risks or hazards were going to be managed, the pre-dive checks, and the depth of water.

#### Appointment of diving supervisor and duty not to dive

109    Clause 4.3.1 of the SS 511:2010 Code states the diving supervisor shall be appointed in writing. He explained that this is to establish accountability and responsibility as the diving supervisor is in charge of the dive and the safety of the divers in the water. Clause 4.3.3 states that “The diving supervisor shall not dive while acting as diving supervisor.” Darren Brunton explained that the rationale for this was that the diving supervisor is responsible for the safety of the dive. He cannot do that while he is diving. He needs to be able to communicate with the divers in the water, manage and respond to their needs and requirements for the work task, communicate with clients, manage and supervise the surface attendants, and in the event of an emergency, manage and have direct supervision over that emergency. He cannot do these tasks if he is in the water. He stated that if the diving supervisor were to dive, another diving supervisor is required to be on the surface. He said there is a need for somebody who has attended a supervisor’s training course not to dive.

#### Composition and size of diving team

110    Clause 4.3.3, sub-clause (e) states that “The composition and size of the diving team is sufficient for the assigned operation...” The SS 511:2010 Code outlines that for 1 diver in the water working, a requirement is for 1 diver’s attendant who would be holding his lifeline or umbilical. In addition, one standby diver on the surface is required for every two divers in the water. The limit of two divers in the water for one standby diver is related to the capacity to rescue an injured diver, which is one diver could rescue two if needed. As regards the underwater works on the vessel, Darren Brunton stated that 12 diving personnel were required. His explanation was as follows[^5]:

> Q    Mr. Brunton, it is not a disputed fact in this case that there were 4 divers diving during this particular diving operation on the 4th of June 2014. Using that as an example, can you please tell this Court who else in terms of the diving personnel will be required for this operation?

> A    To do it, this operation in accordance with the SS511, each diver in the water would require attendant. So that’s 4 plus 4, 8. For every 2 divers in the water you require a standby diver. So that’s 2 divers, 2 standby divers, 10. Each standby diver requires an attendant, that’s 12. …

#### Unsuitable diving equipment

111    Darren Brunton stated that the driving equipment to be used should have been Surface Supplied Diving Equipment (SSDE) which provides suitable air supply (main and back up), an umbilical with a lifeline and hard wire communications between the diver and supervisor at all times.

112    He stated that clause 8 of the SS 511:2010 Code precluded the use of SCUBA for cleaning and welding activities which require physical exertion for a long period, underwater welding as it involves controlling the welding cables and tools from the surface, and for work inside a sea chest as it does not allow direct access to the surface. He stated that with SCUBA, there is no unlimited air supply, no communications and no lifeline to carry out a safe diving operation.

113    It was his evidence that SSDE is the chosen method by industry and himself. Asked about the risks of using SSDE, he agreed that there was a potential risk of umbilical entanglement and puncturing by welding and explosion due to the potential build-up of air. He stated that these concerns could be managed and were not to the extent of precluding the use of SSDE.

#### Lockout/ tagout (‘LOTO’)

114    Lockout/tagout is not specifically mentioned in the SS 511:2010 Code. It refers to isolating and turning off any power source to engines, propellers, pumps, et cetera, by physically locking so the power source cannot be turned on in any way. He elaborated as follows[^6]:

> So when we isolate power, if it’s an engine, the engine would be turned off and the power to start the engine would be turned off and lockout-tagout signage would be posted at that venue where it is turned off and on the bridge where the chief and the master have control of the ship. In a robust lockout-tagout system there would be a padlock which would lock the switch and only 1 key, and that key would be with the diving supervisor or the master of the vessel. If it is not possible to lock it, somebody would be stationed at that switch, to ensure nobody inadvertently turned it on, until the work had been completed. So that is isolation.

115    Darren Brunton stated categorically that it was unsafe to dive because the pump was still in operation. He said[^7]:

> With knowledge that the other pump is working, we wouldn’t dive there. We would say it cannot be done until that pump is closed down and the opposite pump is working to service the vessel. If that is not possible, then that work on the side of the vessel with the pump working should not be carried out.

He explained that it was unsafe because one would not know if there will be a sudden surge of power, whether there is a blockage which may be released leading to increased flow, and due to the latent risk of potential pressure differential (Delta-P) which may be undetected. He stated that there was a pressure differential between the sea water being sucked from outside to the inside of the vessel and he stated that in his opinion Delta-P did occur leading to the deceased being sucked into the pipe orifice.

116    Under cross-examination, he stated that he has met Mr Gan at industry meetings since 2009 or 2010. He said that KB Marine Services is in the marine industry as Underwater Contractors. He agreed that the company was not doing well financially. He stated that he was not provided any documents when asked to prepare his expert report.

#### Evidence of PW8 – Tan Yeo Guan (‘IO Tan’)

117    IO Tan was an investigation officer (‘IO’) attached to the Occupational Health and Safety Inspectorate of the Ministry of Manpower when he was in charge of the investigations into the instant case. He testified that the Ministry of Manpower was informed of the case on 4 June 2014 at 9.27pm. His colleagues arrived at the scene at around midnight.

118    On 5 June 2014 sometime in the afternoon, IO Tan went on board the vessel. He took the measurements of the pipe orifice from the vessel’s drawings and took two photographs of the vessel. He also recorded statements from the crew members of the vessel.

119    Subsequently IO Tan was given a photograph which showed the portside of the vessel by a crew member. He later took photographs of the dive workboats and the diving equipment of the deceased (see P6 for the eight photos).

120    IO Tan ascertained that one of the divers, Saidon Bin Ibrahim, died of a natural cause on 25 January 2015. He had recorded his statement on 1 July 2014 with the assistance of a Malay interpreter at the Ministry of Manpower. The statement was admitted by consent as P11.

121    IO Tan was unaware where the water for the fire pump test was drawn from. He, however, established that the water for the lifeboat testing was drawn from the starboard sea chest using a fire hose.

## Prima facie case

122    There was rightly no submission of ‘no case’ at the close of the prosecution’s case. The two courses were explained to the representative of UWC and David. They both elected to give evidence. Four witnesses were called for the defence.

## Defence case

#### Evidence of DW1 – Gan Chong Bin Michael (‘Michael Gan’)

123    Michael Gan is the managing director of UWC. He is a qualified commercial diver. He started diving in 1971. In August 1979, he incorporated UWC. As at June 2014, UWC had 18 divers and 4 supervisors. He stated that the diving community in Singapore is small and very competitive with price undercutting.

124    He stated that UWC has a team comprising mostly of experienced certified divers. As regards the deceased, he was a diving supervisor with another diving company, Dive Marine, before he started to work part-time with UWC. About a year later, in 2014, the deceased was employed on a fulltime basis. UWC undertook 60 to 70 diving assignments per month which involved similar scope of works. He said the divers would have therefore performed about 800 dives annually. As regards the scope of works, most of the works were done outside the sea chests. He estimated that the divers performed work in the sea chests on 60 to 100 occasions per year.

125    He stated that the divers receive regular training, which is mostly conducted in-house. In addition, the divers have to be certified medically fit annually by a diving medicine specialist, Dr Kevin U Chan, who also provided Standby Telemedicine Emergency Deployment services 24/7.

126    He went on to say that all diving jobs are risky. However, he said that it can be made less risky by having proper work procedures, proper tools and training. He stated that for each underwater job, the composition of the team of divers assembled to carry out the works will be dependent on the nature of the tasks to be performed. He stated that risk assessment and emergency planning would also be done prior to carrying out the job. He said that UWC also checked its diving equipment regularly.

127    He confirmed the works to be undertaken on the vessel were contracted to UWC by Sleipner on 21 May 2014 (see D22). He said that UWC was familiar with the nature of the work to be performed. A team of six divers and two workboats which were piloted by two captains and a chief engineer were deployed. He said his operations manager, Gan Chong Lek, was in charge of conducting the risk assessment in relation to the safety risks posed to the divers in carrying out the works.

128    As regards Darren Brunton, he came to know him when the Commercial Diving Association of Singapore (‘CDAS’) was formed. Michael Gan was a committee member for five years since 2008, whilst Darren Brunton was the Vice-Chairman. He stated that Darren Brunton setup KB Diving Marine in 2013, and their respective companies then became competitors. He went onto say that Darren Brunton gave a biased report because he wanted to eliminate him as a competitor. He claimed that he was untruthful when he said that the expert report was not targeted to the facts of the incident. Under cross-examination, he stated that Darren Brunton had complained to the Ministry of Manpower on seeing his diver climbing up a boat ladder with SCUBA.

129    As regards the risk assessment (P7) that was prepared on 3 June 2014, for the potential safety risk of ‘Divers trapped by suction from sea chest’ (S/No. 2), he stated that UWC requested for the sea chest pumps to be shut down. However, David was informed when he went up to the vessel that it could not be done and the starboard sea chest pump would be running in minimal flow. He said that David went ahead because he and the divers were of the view that they could manage by keeping a safe distance from the pipe orifice. As regards S/No.5, where the risk control of ‘cleaning of sea chest gratings’ is stated as ‘ensure sea chest grating is tagged out’, he replied that it also referred to the best scenario of shutting the pumps. For the potential safety risk of ‘diver entering sea chest box for inspection’ at S/No. 7, he stated that the risk control measure similarly referred to the best scenario. However, he said that as UWC was a service provider, his divers would not abort the job right away if their request was not met. He said David and the divers exercised due diligence to check if it was safe to perform the tasks at the starboard sea chest. He stated that the divers worked in pairs with a buddy, and they would watch each other’s back to ensure that they were not too close to the pipe orifice. He also stated that Joe was outside the starboard sea chest and had a safety line attached to him which was being tendered to by Saw.

130    With respect to the SS 511:2010 Code, he stated that it was a technical advisory which UWC was not obliged to comply with. He asserted that SCUBA was chosen because of the enclosed space and the depth of the dive was only about four meters. He said they also wanted the job to be done quickly and avoid issues of entanglement and air build-up. He stated that they did not want to worry about managing the umbilical cables and damage to the umbilical cables from sparks from the welding.

131    With respect to Delta-P, he said that he was familiar with it and claimed that it could not have occurred as both the starboard and port sea chest were at the same level. Asked if Delta-P was taken into consideration in the risk assessment, he replied that the divers were always asked to approach the sea chest with care.

132    As regards the diving supervisor who is stated shall not dive in clause 4.3.3 of the SS 511:2010 Code, he claimed that David nominated a senior diver, Saidon, to control the dive in his place. He said that Saidon knew what to do and illustrated by saying that Saidon had jumped into the water when the accident happened and David then went up to the workboat. Asked if the delegation of duty was allowed under the SS 511:2010 Code, he replied that it was sufficient if there was a diver on topside to handle the situation. He stated that he did not agree with clause 4.3.3. He then went onto say that clause 4.3.3 represented the best scenario where the diving supervisor does not dive but the situation may warrant the diving supervisor to dive. He said that David was a fast welder, and as there was a ‘live’ pump running at minimal flow, they wanted to do the job right ‘quickly and get out of it safely’.

133    For the use of SSDE equipment in diving operations, table 1 of clause 7 of the SS 511:2010 Code states that for every additional diver in the water, a diver attendant is required to attend to the diver’s umbilical/lifeline. In addition, there shall be one standby diver on the surface for every two divers in the water. Under cross-examination, he stated that if SSDE has been used, he would have required 12 divers and that would make it too expensive and ship owners would go elsewhere. He said that UWC’s method was ‘safe enough’ and cheaper. UWC had a diving team of six members, of which four divers were in the water. Mr Michael Gan questioned the need for so many attendants. He stated UWC was aware of the danger of the intake of water into the pipe orifice and wanted its divers to complete the works expeditiously.

#### Evidence of DW2 – Ng Wei Li, David (‘David’)

134    David started off as a trainee diver in 2007. He joined UWC in February 2013 as a diver. About a year later, he was promoted to an assistant diving supervisor. He said as a supervisor he oversees diving operations and is the spokesman with the office whilst on site. He does about 15 underwater works monthly.

135    He confirmed that he was the assistant diving supervisor for the underwater works on the vessel. He agreed that the divers acted on his instructions. He agreed he saw the risk assessment (P7) which was prepared in connection with the works. He said he had discussed the risk assessment with Gan Chong Lek on a day before the work was to be done. He stated that the risk assessment was prepared based on the best scenario of completely shutting down the pumps.

136    He stated that he conducted a toolbox meeting on the workboat SR3039 at Marina South Pier where he briefed the divers on the scope of work and the risks. He said that he discussed the equipment to use and they chose SCUBA because of the hazards of using SSDE. He said that the emergency response plan was not discussed because all the divers were very experienced and had been briefed previously on what to do in the event of an emergency. Asked under cross-examination, if he knew that the port sea chest pump would be shut down and the starboard sea chest pump would be kept in reduced flow prior to the toolbox briefing, he replied that he was unable to recall.

137    He explained that SCUBA was chosen because of the high risk of entanglement of the umbilical cords and welding cables within the confined space of the sea chest and the risk of the cables being sucked into the sea chest or being burnt by the welding rod. He said that there will also be a need to flush more frequently due to the build-up of carbon dioxide within the helmet and the discharged air and the sparks from the welding may thus lead to a potential explosion. In contrast, he stated that SCUBA only comes with a tank regulator and a mask and the diver is able to exhale completely without any air being trapped in the mask. He stated that SSDE will be used only for deep dives (more than 25 metres deep) and for prolonged dives (more than 90 minutes).

138    As regards the works carried out on the vessel, he rated the level of difficulty of welding works to be 3 or 4 out of a scale of 10 and 1 or 2 for the rest. He said that the works were distributed amongst the six divers based on their specialisation and skills.

139    At about 2pm, David boarded the vessel. He presented the ‘Diving Safety Checklist’ (Annex B in P1) to the Captain, Chief Engineer and Chief Officer. He was informed that the starboard sea chest pump will be in use. Asked why he did not insist that it be shut down, David explained that a vessel is unable to shut down the pumps in both sea chests at anchorage as it requires to intake sea water to cool its generator. He said that he did not know if the port sea chest pump could be operated such that the vessel could rotate the operation of the pumps in the sea chest. He said that he accepted the condition that the starboard sea chest will be in minimum flow ‘because we work on this status on all the time’. He stated that the vessel’s checklist (Annex C of P1) was handed to him by the Chief Officer. He stated that when Annex B and C were endorsed by the Captain, Chief Engineer, Chief Officer (on Annex B) and by himself, he understood that the process of lockout/tagout had been completed.

140    He then returned to the workboat SR3039B and informed the divers that the ‘starboard in use, minimised, port is shut’ and informed Joe and the deceased via VHF 72 as they were on the other workboat. He also told the divers to proceed with caution and to test the suction first.

141    At 2.35pm, the underwater works commenced. He stated that the divers on workboat SR3039B (except for Saw) were working at the starboard bow. He instructed Saw to ‘take care of the deck and VHF’. The other workboat with Joe and the deceased were tasked to open and clean the sea chest gratings on the port and starboard sides.

142    He stated that the maximum depth of the dive was four to five meters and it took about 20 seconds for a diver to surface.

143    At 4.50pm, the diving works were asked to stop due to the testing of the fire pump. He said that at this stage the works at the bow of the vessel had been completed by his team on SR3039B. He was unaware what works Joe and the deceased had completed.

144    At 6pm, when diving recommenced, Saw and Saidon remained on the dive boat. He said Saw was the topside tender. He handed his duties to Saidon because he was going to do the welding. He said Saidon was then the stand-in diving supervisor. Mario dived first. He tied the downline to grating no. 3. of the starboard sea chest. David held onto the downline and brought down his welding cable to the sea chest. He said the grating of the sea chest had already been opened. After he had placed the welding cable in the sea chest, David returned to the dive boat to transport the first anode to the sea chest. After he had done so, he began on the work to weld the 1st anode.

145    He stated that the 1st anode was to be welded onto the wall of the sea chest which was quite close to the pipe orifice. He checked the pipe orifice and ascertained it had no marine growth. He indicated the position of the 1st anode at page 204 of exh D33. He estimated that the pipe orifice was about one arm’s length from where the 1st anode was to be welded. He stated that there was very slow movement of particles in the water and he was unable to feel any suction. He said that the sea chest was very dark and he told the deceased that he required more lighting. David was standing vertically when he did the chipping of paint and the welding of the 1st anode. The deceased was in a prone position near to grating 1 and only half of his body was in the sea chest. David estimated that he took not more than 15 minutes to complete the welding of the 1st anode. Thereafter the deceased took a photograph of the finished work.

146    David then proceeded to the second grating. He sketched the stiffener plate onto which the 2nd anode was to be welded with dotted lines at pg 204. David stated that he did some chipping of the paint first because Mario had not done it correctly. He was in a prone position when he did that. The deceased was facing him in a prone position. After he had completed chipping, the deceased took a photograph. When he was ready to commence welding, he told the deceased to raise himself. David did not know if the deceased raised himself horizontally or stood up. After David started to weld, he felt a fin ‘slap’ his head. David looked up and saw the deceased being sucked into the pipe orifice. He immediately pulled the deceased’s hand and the deceased also tugged at it. After about two seconds, David felt that the deceased was no longer holding his hand. He then knew that the deceased had passed on. He tried to pull him a few more times and realised that he was stuck. He then exited the sea chest.

147    It was David’s evidence that he surmised that someone must have started the pump for the deceased to have been sucked in. However, he stated that he formed that conclusion only after he saw the deceased had been sucked in.

148    When David exited the sea chest, he saw Joe outside and cleaning grating 2. He told him to attend to the deceased. When David surfaced to the waterline, he shouted at Saidon and Saw to inform the vessel to shut the pump.

149    Thereafter, David returned to the sea chest. From the outside, he saw that Mario was at grating 3. He used his torchlight to shine into the sea chest and banged at the grating. He signalled to him to proceed to grating 1. Joe was still pulling at the deceased. David surfaced to the water again and went straight to the vessel. He said that he shouted at the Master who had started the pump and demanded for it to be switched off. He also asked to see the Chief Engineer. He said that the Master did not know what had happened. Whilst he was waiting, he saw Mario and Joe had pulled the deceased out. David said that he then broke down for a few minutes. He stated that he had known the deceased from 2008 or 2009. He described him to be a close friend. He then proceeded to the workboat.

#### Evidence of DW3 – Gan Shu Wen Kenneth (‘Kenneth’)

150    Kenneth is the general manager at UWC. He was given the secondary appointment of Work, Health and Safety officer after the incident when UWC was placed on the Business Under Surveillance (BUS) programme for 12 months until 3 July 2015 (see D31). He is trained as a naval architect. He stated that he has knowledge on fluid dynamics, ship structures and ship design. He became a qualified commercial diver in January 2017.

151    As regards the SS511:2010 Code, he said UWC complied with it “as far as reasonably practicable”. He averred that UWC will comply “if the circumstances are right” but will take steps to improve or mitigate when there are risks.

152    He stated that SSDE was not used because of limited manoeuvrability, the risk of entanglement of the umbilical cords which pose a difficulty if evacuation is required due to an emergency, the risk of damage to umbilicals by the welding works, and a resultant explosion. He stated that the depth between the sea chest to the dive boat was only four meters and it would have taken less than five seconds for a diver to surface. He claimed that the use of SCUBA was justified by clause 8.2.2(b). He stated that the works were divided between the experienced divers. He also asserted that UWC complied with the minimum number of personnel required for SCUBA as stated in table 2 at clause 8.4.1.

153    As for lockout/tagout, he stated that it was the responsibility of the vessel to implement it as agreed in the safety checklist (Annex B) which was endorsed by the key personnel. He stated that where the sea chest pump was at minimal flow, generally the level of suction felt by the divers would be between 1 to 3 out of a scale of 10.

154    He said that UWC had a quality manual which described the emergency response flow chart (D31). It stated that the diving supervisor and his team was required to render aid to the distressed diver until help arrived or the diver was evacuated to shore. He stated that if necessary, the 24-hour emergency medical hotline could be contacted, and the authorities informed.

155    Under cross-examination, he stated that he has not dived into a sea chest or opened the sea chest gratings. He stated that he has only cleaned the gratings from the exterior.

#### Evidence of DW4 – Ian Andrew Duncan (‘Ian Duncan’)

156    Ian Duncan is a marine engineer consultant. He was a chief engineer on vessels for 10 years.

157    He stated that it is the responsibility of a chief engineer to do the lockout/tagout but he may instruct his personnel to do so. He said that divers are normally not allowed into the engine room to witness the lockout/tagout due to security considerations and they would also not be familiar with the piping system. He stated the Diving Operation Safety-Checklist (Annex C to P1) issued by the vessel to UWC would have ensured that the agreed lockout/tagout has been undertaken and it is maintained throughout the operation.

158    In March 2015, Ian Duncan was asked by the law firm Haridass Ho & Partners on behalf of UWC to provide an opinion on the cause of the accident. He put up a report which was admitted as D35. He opined that it was very unlikely that the deceased went too close to the pipe orifice because he was aware of the minimum flow. He noted that the divers had entered the sea chest several times without problem with the suction at the sea water pipe. Based on statements of the divers, he understood that there was a sudden disturbance in the water, and he surmised that it must have been caused by the starting of another pump or the opening of a valve. He stated that he relied on the accounts of the divers that there was a sudden increase in turbidity and slit moving around the time the deceased was sucked.

159    As regards Delta P, he said that for it to occur, there must be a change in conditions causing a greater suction. He surmised that there was no evidence to indicate this except for a pump starting or a valve turning.

160    Under cross-examination, he stated that he did not have experience in diving. He stated that as a chief engineer he would not be able to assess if the divers could work in a sea chest with minimal flow and would leave the decision to the divers. He agreed that diving with minimal flow was not an ideal situation. He stated that if both sea chests were available to use, then the divers could have worked safely on one whilst it was isolated and the vessel could have changed to the other one thereafter.

#### Evidence of DW5 – Sarjit Singh s/o Sardara Singh (‘Sarjit’)

161    Sarjit is a safety, health and environment consultant. He has been in this field for about nine years. His services were engaged by UWC to determine the cause of the accident and to look at their systems. He was requested by Michael Gan to put up a report. His redacted report dated 10 January 2018 was admitted as D37.

162    He stated that a risk assessment prepared in the ‘office environment’ may differ from the actual situation onsite. He said the supervisor will have to take note of the differences and communicate the changes to the employees. He said the supervisor will also have to take different steps to manage the particular hazard.

163    As regards the risk assessment (P7) prepared for the diving job, he stated that the ‘severity’ of the hazard for the work activities at S/Nos. 2, 5 and 7 should be identical, i.e. major instead of moderate for serial numbers 5 and 7.

164    He pointed out that S/No. 2 stated the chief engineer was required to shut down the pumps at sea chest but asserted that this risk assessment was done one day prior to the actual work when UWC was unaware of the actual situation. Under cross-examination, he said that he was not told that UWC was in fact aware that the starboard sea chest would be running at minimum flow before the toolbox meeting. He said that his understanding was that David only came to know of it when he went on board the vessel.

165    Nevertheless, his evidence was that UWC and David had done what was reasonably practicable to deal with the hazard as David had obtained the endorsement on the ‘Diving Safety Checklist’ (Annex B of P1), briefed the divers on the change, told them to exercise caution when approaching the sea chest, and all the divers who were experienced felt no or very little suction and agreed it was safe to proceed with the works in the sea chest. He stated that the sea chest pump had been locked out/tagged out at a minimum flow which was deemed safe by the vessel and the divers. He emphasised that the divers had worked for 20 minutes in the sea chest without incident.

166    As regards safe work procedures, he said they are a sequence of steps to carry out an activity and the steps are derived from the risk assessment. He said the steps do not have to be documented but said that it was a good practice to do so. He said that the risk assessment (P7) detailed 14 activities of work, and the safe work procedures will mirror it.

167    Under cross-examination, he agreed that he did not look at the SS511:2010 Code and the Technical Advisory for Inland/Inshore Commercial Diving Safety and Health issued by the Workplace Safety and Health Council (P13) before he prepared his report. He agreed that he is unable to appreciate the danger of working in a sea chest as he has no diving experience.

168    He agreed the safest situation was for the sea chest pump to be shut off completely. However, he maintained that there was no risk of suction when the sea chest was at minimum flow. He gave the following evidence when questioned on para 6.18 of his report:

> Q    The 2nd sentence I’ll read it to you. “It is my view that the ship, as an occupier had created an unsafe condition by either not shutting down the sea chest pump completely”, can you see that?

> A    Yes, Your Honour.

> Q    So based on your own words which is as what I read, you agree that it was not safe for the divers to dive in a condition where the sea chest pumps are not completely shut off, agree?

> A    My statement is based on the best situation.

#### Evidence of DW6 – Dr Kevin U-Jyn Chan (‘Dr Kevin’)

169    Dr Kevin specialises in diving and occupational medicine. Since 2006, UWC has engaged him to look after its emergency and non-emergency cases. He stated that UWC appointed him as the diving physician under the Standby Telemedicine Emergency Deployment (STED) since 2009 whereby he could be contacted 24 hours for basic telemedical advice or he could be activated to render medical assistance at site or at his clinic.

170    He stated that UWC’s divers were required to undergo an annual fitness certification. He agreed that medical reassessment was a requirement under Clause 10 of the SS511: 2010 Code. He stated the divers were issued with a card with the emergency hotline number. He said that his telephone number was also displayed on the workboats. In addition, the workboats were equipped with lifesaving equipment and first aid kits and UWC’s divers had undergone training on the use of the equipment.

171    As regards the fatal incident involving the deceased, he said he was not activated or contacted for advice.

172    He agreed that an emergency response plan required more than just an emergency number to call. He was referred to the Technical Advisory for Inland/Inshore Commercial Diving Safety and Health by the WSH Council (ex P13) which states at para 14.2:

> The Diving Contractor’s Emergency and Contingency Manuals should include flowcharts that will indicate the process for dealing with diving emergencies. These flowcharts are generic in nature, therefore specific emergency contact checklists will need to be generated for each diving worksite. A …sample of a Emergence Flow Chart is referenced in Annex K.

He agreed that a basic emergency response plan must be tweaked to be specific to each dive location.

## Determination

### Causation

173    UWC and David sought to defend themselves by asserting that the cause of the deceased being sucked into the starboard sea chest pump pipe inlet was not reasonably foreseeable as it was not attributable to the operation of the starboard sea chest pump in reduced flow. Instead, they blamed the vessel and alleged that it had increased the suction power without notice in violation of the ‘Diving Operation Safety - Checklist’ (Annex C to P1) issued by it to UWC.

174    There can be an offence under s 12(1) WHSA without an accident, and if there has been an accident, causation is not an element of the offence. The offence lies in the failure to ensure safety so far as reasonably practicable, i.e. in exposure to risk of injury (see _Tangerine Confectionery Ltd and Veolia ES (UK) ITD v The Queen_ \[2011\] EWCA Crim 2015 (‘_Tangerine Confectionary_’). The allegation that the vessel had increased the suction power by opening a valve or starting a pump is thus a side-issue which diverts attention from the real question of whether the divers were exposed to risk to their safety which reasonably practicable precautions should have avoided.

175    Nevertheless, I shall deal briefly with this allegation by the defence. The chief engineer or any other officer from the vessel were not available to give evidence as they are outside the jurisdiction. The only other witnesses who could give a first-hand account of the events were the divers who were working in and outside the starboard sea chest.

176    David was the closest in proximity to the deceased at the material time. He was in a prone position at the area in grating No.2 where he did some chipping of paintwork at the stiffener plate situated at the base of the sea chest in order to weld an anode (indicated as No.2) at the position marked in pages 203 and 204 of D33. The deceased was also in a prone position but he was at the area of grating No. 1 and was facing David. He was positioned there to provide illumination for David to do the chipping and to take a photograph after it had been completed. After the photograph had been taken, David asked the deceased to make space by rising to a higher position.

177    It is not known if the deceased raised himself in a prone position or if he stood up to make way for David to weld. However, what can be said with certainty is that the deceased was in close proximity to the pipe inlet drawing sea water, and which had an approximate diameter of 60cm with a butterfly valve. After the deceased had made space, David started to weld. Whilst he was doing so, the deceased’s fin hit his head. What is significant is that David did not feel any increased suction as he was welding before the mishap. He was only alerted when the deceased’s fin hit him. His evidence is set out below[^8]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Was there a difference in terms of the water flow rate when you were carrying out the first welding versus the second welding?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No different.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So before you saw Edmund being sucked into the pipe, did you realise that the pump had been started? So really at what point in time did you realise?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

You did not?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

No. If the pump is started, I couldn’t do anymore task inside the sea chest box.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. So you tell us at what point in time did you realise the pump had been started?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

When Edmund is sucked in and I can’t pull him up.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. So your deduction that the pump had been started, is it just based on the fact that Edmund was sucked in and you could not pull him out, or is there any other basis for you to state that the pump was started?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

No basis.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

No other basis?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

178    David’s position was not far from the pipe inlet. He was closest to the deceased. When the deceased’s fin hit his head, his reaction was as follows: “_I raised my head up and I saw him being sucked into the pipe orifice. Immediately, I pull his hand and he gave me a tug. …He pulled back using force and in less than 2 seconds, there’s no more force on his hand._”[^9] The fact that David did not feel any increased suction before the deceased’s fin hit his head is contrary to the defence’s allegation that the vessel had increased the suction by opening a valve or pipe in breach of its ‘Diving Operation Safety- Checklist’ (Annex C of P1) .

179    As for the evidence of the other two divers who were working at the sea chest, Joe did not enter the sea chest. He performed cleaning of the gratings from the outside. His evidence was that he did not feel any suction before, during and after the incident. He conceded that he could not say for a fact that the suction had increased. His evidence therefore did not support the defence’s theory.

180    The other diver, Mario, was in the sea chest and at the third grating when the accident happened. He did not feel any suction prior to the incident. He felt a stirring after the incident had happened. When he came to grating 1, he felt ‘a bit of’ suction. However, he was unable to state what caused the sediments to stir as seen by the following answers which he gave[^10]:

>   
| 

Witness:

 | 

Um, it’s either that---to---to me, that there’s 2---2 chances, as in, like, uh, it’s either someone struggling inside to---to make the st---stir off all the sediment floating around.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Or it might be caused by suction.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, at that point in time, did you reach any conclusion as to what caused it?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

No, Ma’am.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

You---you did not know?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

No, Ma’am.

 |

  
  

181    It is significant to note that David’s evidence was that Mario was still inside the sea chest at grating 3 when he returned after having surfaced. He used his torchlight to shine into the sea chest and banged on the grating to get Mario’s attention. Mario confirmed that someone had flashed his torchlight and knocked on the grating to alert him. He then sensed something was wrong. If there had been an increase in suction, it is inexplicable that Mario did not feel it and only sensed something was wrong after he was alerted by David.

182    Ian Duncan’s opinion that there ‘was a rapid increase in suction’ was based on the following[^11]:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

So, when you said from the evidence there was a rapid increase in suction, what evidence are you referring to?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

This is from, uh, all the statements and everything else where the divers said everything was fine and then suddenly there was a disturbance in the water.

 |

  
  

He had no first-hand knowledge of the incident. His opinion was based on out-of-court statements of the divers. It is not clear if he had spoken to the divers or had only referred to their written statements. The circumstances under which the divers gave the statements and to whom is also unknown. In any case, the out-of-court statements used to render the opinion were inadmissible. What is significant, is that the evidence of David, Joe and Mario in court failed to lend support to the defence’s theory.

183    With respect to the hazard of suction caused by the operation of the pump in reduced flow, it is significant that Michael Gan stated the importance of his divers keeping away from the pipe inlet. He said[^12]: “---_yah, we are keeping away all the time, all of us all the 3 of them knowing the pumps are running at slow and then we test, we know it’s keeping away our distance_.” He asserted[^13], “…_we could enter it because as long as we keep away from it, we can do our work. And all the anodes are away from it. We just manage that._” However, Michael Gan’s evidence that the anodes were away from the pipe inlet and that his divers could keep a distance from it was fundamentally erroneous. The position of the anodes was marked in exhibit D23. The deceased’s position was in close proximity to the pipe inlet. The distance from the pipe inlet to the deceased could not have been more than one arm’s length. In fact, David himself stated, “_I’m pretty sure when I raised myself up, I’m very near to the pipe orifice_.”

184    Accordingly, I found that there is a paucity of evidence to establish the defence’s allegation that the vessel had unilaterally increased the suction by opening a valve or pump. As Darren Brunton explained, Delta P can be assumed to exist when water is being drawn at an intake point. Here, the intake point was about 60cm in diameter. However, the exact force of suction is unknown. He also stated that Delta P is a latent hazard and as such it may not be detected by divers when they are at a safe distance. Here, the deceased was the closest in proximity to the sea water being sucked into the pipe inlet, and accordingly he was in all likelihood drawn into the pipe inlet when he encroached into the force of the suction. This would explain why David, Joe and Mario did not feel any increased suction before the deceased was trapped.

185    Even taking the defence case and assuming that there was an unforeseeable act of increase in suction power caused by the vessel, this fact alone cannot exonerate UWC and David. As stated above, it is not necessary for the prosecution to establish that the accused caused the injury for there to be an offence under either s 12(1) or s 15(3A). As Lord Hughes stated in the _Tangerine Confectionary_ at \[12\]:

> These offences are not primarily concerned with ascribing responsibility for the cause of injury. Indeed, they are primarily concerned with avoiding injury. The offences can just as well be committed when there has been no injury as when there has. Of course, it often happens that an injury, especially a severe one, is the occasion of an investigation of the systems of work and that an allegation of one or both offences is the outcome of the investigation. The offence(s) may well be alleged to have been committed on the day of the injury. But that does not mean that the offence has as one of its constituents the causing of any injury at all. Neither offence has. The offence lies in the failure to ensure safety so far as reasonably practicable, ie in exposure to risk of injury, not in the doing of actual injury. Causation of the injury is not an ingredient of either offence.

At \[36\], he stated:

> None of this, however, means that in a prosecution under either section it is incumbent on the Crown to prove that the accident which occurred was foreseeable. That would convert the sections into ones creating offences of failing to take reasonable care to avoid a specific incident. **It means no more than that the sections are concerned with exposure to risk of injury, and that the extent to which injury is foreseeable is part of the enquiry into the level of risk. The sections do not command an enquiry into the likelihood (or foreseeability) of the events which have in fact occurred. They command an enquiry into the possibility of injury.** They are not limited, in the risks to which they apply, to risks which are obvious. They impose, in effect, a duty on employers to think deliberately about things which are not obvious. (emphasis added)

## Did UWC fail to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure safety and did David negligently endanger safety?

### The general duties

186    It is not in dispute that the Eastern Working Anchorage is a workplace within the meaning of the WSHA and that the deceased was working at the vessel which was anchored there. Section 12(1) of the WSHA states the duty of an employer towards its employees in the following terms:

> 12−(1) It shall be the duty of every employer to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of his employees at work.

Section 12(1) is expressed in general terms and it requires every employer to achieve the result of ensuring the safety and health of employees. The duty is not absolute but is qualified by the words ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’.

187    The measures necessary to ensure the safety and health of persons at work stipulated in s 12(3) include the following —

> (c)    ensuring that those persons are not exposed to hazard arising out of the … manipulation, … working or use of things---

> …

> (d)    developing and implementing procedures for dealing with emergencies that may arise while those persons are at work;

188    Regulations 4 of the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations (Cap 354A, RG 8) states:

> 4.− (1)    In every workplace, the employer, self-employed person and principal shall take all reasonably practicable steps to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who may be affected by his undertaking in the workplace.

> (2)    Where it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate the risk referred to in paragraph (1), the employer, self-employed person or principal shall implement —

>> (a)    such reasonably practicable measures to minimise the risk; and

>> (b)    such safe work procedures to control the risk.

>> …

> (5)    In this regulation –

>> …

>> “safe work procedure” means any procedure for carrying out work safely, and includes any procedure which is to be taken to protect the safety and health of persons in the event of any emergency;

189    Section 47 of the WSHA places on UWC a reverse onus of proof on the balance of probabilities on the issue of reasonable practicability. It reads:

> 47.    Where in any proceedings for an offence under any provision in this Act, it is alleged that any person failed to comply with a duty to do something so far as is reasonably practicable, it shall be for the accused to prove that —

>> (a)    it was not reasonably practicable to do more than what was in fact done to satisfy that duty; or

>> (b)    there was no better practicable means than was in fact used to satisfy that duty.

190    The charge against David involves a negligent act which endangered safety. Section 15(3A) reads:

> Any person at work who, without reasonable cause, does any negligent act which endangers the safety or health of himself or others shall be guilty of an offence…

191    Culpable negligence has been defined to mean “acting without the consciousness … that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the caution incumbent upon him and if he had\[,\] he would have had the consciousness (see _PP v Teo Poh Leng_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 541</span>, which was approved in _PP v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span>). In _Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 413</span> (‘_Nurun Novi_’), it was held that the test for negligence is objective and the court must “consider whether a reasonable man in the same circumstances would have been aware of the likelihood of damage or injury to others” (see _Ng Keng Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 89</span>).

### The failure to implement the risk assessment

192    One of the ways in which UWC is alleged to have failed in its duty of safety towards its divers is that it failed to ‘implement the existing risk control identified in \[its\] risk assessment’. Insofar as David is concerned, the nature of the unsafe act particularised in the charge is similar, i.e. the performing of works in the starboard sea chest whilst the pumps were in reduced flow.

193    It was submitted by the defence that UWC was “required to adopt a safe method of work, and not the _safest_ method of work” and that where it was not possible to eliminate the risk, it could take reasonably practicable measures to minimise the risk. It was argued that all the divers had the consensus that it was safe and acceptable to dive in reduced flow and to take the necessary precautionary measures before going close to and into the sea chest. It was claimed that David was therefore not negligent and that UWC had satisfied the statutory duty by having the vessel carry out the lockout/tagout of reduced flow and the divers taking precautionary measures before approaching the sea chest.

194    The duty to ensure safety of course does not connote that no accident could possibly occur or mean the elimination of every conceivable risk. I did not agree with the defence that the extent of the duty of safety was for UWC to “adopt a safe method of work, and not the _safest_ method of work.” The standard of ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’ is a high one. The decision between the elimination or minimising of the risk is heavily weighted to ensure safety. Only if the safety measures are grossly disproportionate to the risk can they be ruled out (see _Edwards v National Coal Board_ \[1949\]1 KB 704). As Lord Upjohn (one of the majority) said in _Nimmo v Alexander Cowan and Sons Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1968\] AC 107</span> (p 126C-D), the “section requires the occupier to make it \[the workplace\] 100 per cent safe (judged of course by a reasonable standard of care) if that is reasonably practicable and, if it is not, to make it as safe so far as is reasonably practicable to a lower percentage.”

195    The nub of the issue was whether by carrying out works in the starboard sea chest without the identified risk control in its risk assessment being in place to eliminate the risk of suction, UWC had failed in its duty to ensure the safety of its divers and whether David was therefore negligent. In this regard, I deemed it relevant to consider whether there was exposure to a likelihood of risk or danger and the gravity of the risk in working in the starboard sea chest when the pump for drawing sea water was in reduced flow. Whilst reasonable foreseeability of a risk is not necessarily an element in the duty of safety, an assessment of the likelihood and the gravity of the risk may be relevant in considering the reasonable practicability of taking measures.

196    On 3 June 2014, the Operations Manager of UWC, Gan Chong Lek, carried out a risk assessment of the works to be carried out at the vessel. The requirement to carry out a risk assessment is stipulated by Regulation 3 of the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations (Cap 354A, RG 8), which states:

> 3\. – (1)    In every workplace, the employer, self-employed person and principal shall conduct a risk assessment in relation to the safety and health risks posed to any person who may be affected by his undertaking in the workplace.

197    The requirement to carry out a risk assessment for all activities, factoring in the hazards of the workplace together with the possibility of injury resulting from them, is essential to assist employers in considering the measures needed to eliminate or to control those risks. In this regard, in respect of the activity of diving near and in the sea chest, the risk or hazard identified in the risk assessment was divers trapped by suction from sea chest. The ‘existing risk control’ measure identified was ‘Capt/ Chief Engineer to shut down pumps at sea chest to be inspected’, ‘ensure sea chest grating is tagged out’ and ‘ensure no sea suction before entering box’. The severity of injury, likelihood and risk levels were stated as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0299_Image/[2020] SGDC 0299_image3.png)

198    David agreed that he was involved in the discussion of the risk assessment that was put up one day before the work was done. He agreed that the risk assessment stated the risk control as to completely switch off all pumps at the sea chest to be inspected (S/Nos. 2, 5 and 7). However, he stated that his discussion with Gan Chong Lek on 3 June 2014 was that the divers will work in the sea chest with reduced flow. He explained that Gan Chong Lek had stated the ‘best scenario’ in the risk assessment but in fact it was a common practice to perform the works with minimum flow.

199    The defence witnesses Ian Duncan and Sarjit were unaware of the fact that David and Gan Chong Lek had discussed one day before the operation that the divers were to perform their works with reduced flow. In ignorance of this fact, Ian Duncan gave the following evidence[^14]:

> The actual situation is not what they would have expected. They would have expected to change over sea chests, so they would work on one that was isolated and then change over to the other one.

As regards Sarjit, he was ignorant of the agreed fact that UWC had been informed that the port sea chest was down and the starboard sea chest pump will be at minimal flow before the toolbox meeting was conducted. He did not know that David had discussed with Gan Chong Lek that the dive activity will take place with minimal flow but the risk assessment had nevertheless stated the best scenario. The plank of Sarjit’s evidence that UWC and David had complied with the risk assessment but had departed from it only because David found out the change in situation after he boarded the vessel was fundamentally flawed. Sarjit also conceded that he has no experience in the diving industry and had not even looked at the SS511:2010 or the Technical Advisory for Inland/Inshore Commercial Diving Safety and Health (P13).

200    Despite David and Gan Chong Lek having discussed that the work will be done with reduced flow, the relevant safety measure stated in the risk assessment was to shut down the sea chest pump in the sea chest to be inspected. Michael Gan accepted that the safety measure in the risk assessment was not implemented. However, he tried to justify it as follows[^15]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Sure, I will repeat again. I put it to you that the existing risk control identified in your risk assessment was not implemented. Do you agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I agree, but this risk assessment was requested---the condition were---we requested the shut---uh, the pumps to be shut and all that. That’s what we wanted. But it couldn’t be done because the ship didn’t give us. We were given another situation. Unfortunately starboard sea chest is---were being used and ---we said---in use. I’m sure they didn’t say in use in what sense. It says okay, we agree at minimal. So, the situation changed in situ, this is in the---in the office, this was brought, this was discussed on board the ship. Ideally, it needs to be shut down. So, the situation changed on board the ship and we were given another situation and we said okay we know that the pump is running. We said we will try and see whether we can work with it. And that’s what we did. So, this risk assessment doesn’t apply anymore because on board the ship it changes.

 |

  
  

Michael Gan’s evidence that the situation had changed on board the vessel (similar to Ian Duncan and Sarjit’s evidence) was contrary to the agreed fact that UWC was informed prior to the toolbox meeting that the starboard sea chest will be in reduced flow. His evidence was also contradicted by David’s evidence that he and Gan Chong Lek had discussed that the work will be done with reduced flow when the risk assessment was put up. Also, Michael Gan’s assertion that David had conveyed to the vessel the request to shut down the pumps as stated in the risk assessment measure was not borne out by David’s evidence.

201    David, Michael Gan and Kenneth Gan also tried to justify the non-implementation of the risk assessment by asserting that it stated the best scenario or the safest scenario. In this regard, David gave the following evidence[^16]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So what is the diving supervisor, in this case, you, on the 4th of June 2014---what were you responsible for in respect of shutting down the pumps at the sea chest?

 |
| 

A

 | 

To the best scenario, sea chest to be shut down, this is being discussed with ops manager, Mr. Gan Chong Lek on 3rd of June. But to this scenario, when vessel is in anchorage, this cannot be done.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Ng, when you said the---“to the best scenario”, do you also mean this would be the safest scenario when performing this work activity as stated in serial number 2?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I can agree as this is done by Mr. Gan for risk assessment. So the best scenario for him to put on is stated here.

 |

  
  

202    I rejected David’s evidence that a shutdown of the sea chest pump to be inspected cannot be done at the anchorage. It was common ground between the prosecution’s expert, Darren Brunton, and the defence expert, Ian Duncan, that vessels isolate the operation of the sea chest pump and do a change over when work is done in the particular sea chest. In fact, the rotation of the operation of pump is the method used to isolate a sea chest to eliminate the risk of suction for the safety of divers. Ian Duncan had clearly stated this in his report (D35) at para 3.3:

> Part of the requirement of the vessel’s checklists was for the seawater flow through the starboard sea chest to be reduced to minimal flow as the port sea chest was not in use as the sea strainer was reportedly due for cleaning. **If both sea chests were available for use then the divers could have worked safely on one whilst it was isolated and then the vessel could have changed to the other one.** There appears to have been no forward planning for the replacement of the anodes. (Emphasis added)

203    Regulation 3 of the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations requires the risk assessment to deal with the safety risks posed to employees affected by their undertaking in the workplace. The action to eliminate or minimise the risks identified cannot simply be to state the best case scenario if it is not mechanism to be used to eliminate or control the risks associated with the diving activity. The risk assessment is prepared prior to the work activity. It must therefore state the action to be implemented which is targeted to the specific risks to be undertaken by the work activity at the workplace.

204    David, Michael Gan and Kenneth Gan had no explanation as to why the risk assessment did not address the actual scenario of reduced flow. Michael Gan merely stated as follows[^17]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Gan, if the scenario of performing works inside a sea chest on a minimal flow was done in your words many times, why was this risk not addressed in your risk assessment?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Simply like I said, the best scenario for us is to dive with a shutdown. That’s what we want all the time when we go on board to discuss m--- so if they can’t do it, more than often they can do it, but if they can’t do it, when they say it’s a minimal flow, we have to check ourselves to see whether it can be done or not. That’s why it’s not written here. We always want it to be shut down, that’s the best scenario. But if we can’t get it then we have to do work---think out of the box and get it and see whether it can be done or not. That’s why it’s not written, because that’s how it is. We want it to be shut down for sure.

 |

  
  

It was an agreed fact that the occupier had prior to 12.45pm on 4 June 2014 informed UWC that the port sea chest pump would be shut down and the starboard sea chest pump would be kept in reduced flow. Moreover, David’s evidence was that the risk assessment which was discussed with Gan Chong Lek involved working in reduced flow. A scenario of reduced flow where the sea water is being sucked into the pipe inlet cannot be considered as to ‘shut down pumps at sea chest to be inspected’ and ‘ensure no suction’. This was admitted by Michael Gan, as seen from the answers which he gave under cross-examination[^18]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, Mr. Gan, back to exhibit P7, 2nd page under item 5. Now, item 5 reads that, “A potential hazard from the work activity of divers cleaning the sea chest gratings is a hazard of divers getting trapped by suction from the sea chest and the existing control measure is to ensure that the sea chest grating is tagged out.” What does Underwater Contractors mean by the term “Tagged out”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, to tag out for safe---the best scenario is of course to shut down the pumps. That’s the best scenario. That’s what we mean by “Tagged out”.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And under item 7 on the same page. It says that the potential hazard from the work activity of divers entering a sea chest box for inspection is a hazard of divers getting trapped by sea suction. Do you see that, Mr. Gan?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, I do.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And the existing risk control is to ensure that there is no sea suction before entering the box. Is this risk control measure sufficient?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, like I said, when we do this risk assessment, we are looking at the best scenario for the divers. Things change on board vessels which we don’t know until we are on board, until we discuss, go through the checklist and they say, no, this cannot be done, that cannot be done. And so on and so forth. But the bottom line is for us, it’s always to accept what we are given, but with due diligence we check before we do entry whether it’s safe or not to get in, and I believe all my divers have done that, and basing on that, like I said, if we, uh, manage that by keeping away from the distance, all my divers know that, just like a vacuum cleaner, you run a vacuum cleaner and you’re far away, you doesn’t get sucked but when you’re too close, you’re zapped in, you get sucked into it. This is the same principle. All my divers are experienced divers. We work all the time with sea chest at minimal, during hull cleaning and propeller polishings, we always approach with care.

 |

  
  

205    In a nutshell, Michael Gan’s evidence was that UWC was providing a service to the vessel and ‘_we have to try our best to provide our service as of course in a safe manner_’. As for ‘safe manner’, his approach was that the risk to safety could be managed by the exercise of due diligence and keeping a safe distance by his experienced divers. Pressed on what the safe distance would be, he replied that he was unable to state the distance as he did not know ‘what is the actual flow’. In my judgment, Michael Gan’s evidence that his divers would ensure that they will maintain a safe distance reinforced the fact that the divers were vulnerable to the hazard of suction of the sea water into the pipe inlet. In fact, the defence expert, Ian Duncan, also alluded to the danger of getting close to the pipe inlet. He stated[^19]:

> I consider unlikely the diver would have gone too close because they had already been in and out of the sea chest numerous times. They were very aware that there was minimum flow, uh, so, I cannot see them being so lax as to---got too close.

To simply expect that the divers would not be lax and come into close proximity with the pipe inlet whilst working is clearly insufficient and unsuitable in reducing or eliminating the risk of suction. This was especially so as some of the works were being undertaken in close proximity to the pipe inlet. In fact, the deceased’s position was directly in front and in close proximity to the pipe inlet when he was asked to raise himself.

206    UWC had been given notice that the sea chest pump at the starboard side will be in reduced flow before its workboats left Marina South Pier. In its risk assessment, UWC had assessed the reasonably practicable measure to ensure the safety of the divers to be a situation of no flow. This was also the unanimous opinion of both experts. Darren Brunton stated categorically in his report (P3 at pg 9) that “_If there is any flow of water no diving should take place. If there is seen to be a minimum amount of water flow – diving should not continue. If the isolation cannot be made, diving should not commence_.” The defence expert, Ian Duncan, who has 10 years of experience as a chief engineer, agreed that it was not an ideal situation for divers to work in a sea chest with minimal flow. In fact, he had not come across a situation where divers had worked inside a sea chest when it could not be fully isolated. The UK Health and Safety Executive’s Report on ‘Differential pressure hazards in diving’ issued in 2009 (‘HSE UK 2009 Report’) stated at para 7.2.2: “_Given the difficulties divers face, detecting and escaping from differential pressure hazards, the default position should always be to avoid or eliminate the hazard prior to diving. This embraces best practice recommended by the ADC_.”

207    Despite its own risk assessment which stated the default position of best practice, UWC and David sought to exonerate themselves by relying on the evidence of the divers in an attempt to prove that it was safe to dive in reduced flow and by the divers exercising caution when approaching the sea chest. In addition, the defence relied on the following extract from the evidence of Ian Duncan to support it position that diving in reduced flow was common[^20]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Now, based on your experience as a marine engineer and chief engineer, is it common or uncommon for divers to work in a reduced flow environment?

 |
| 

A

 | 

In my understanding, it is quite a common occurrence.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Thank you.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, why is it a common occurrence instead of using the rotation---rotational way of working on, say, port sea chest when it shut down, and then switching over to the---

|

|

the ideal situation would be to change them over. But you do get situations where the ship side valve and other valves don’t seal completely. So, the---we would have a minimum flow situation even with valve shut.

 |

  
  

It is clear that Ian Duncan was not referring to a situation where the sea chest pump is left to operate in reduced flow but rather one where there may be some flow even though the valve has been shut but it is unable to ‘seal completely’.

208    The defence also tried to contend that lockout/tagout was established with the sea chest running at minimum flow. In this regard, Sarjit, David and Kenneth Gan asserted that the pump could be isolated at minimum flow. I rejected their evidence. Their evidence was contradicted by UWC’s representative, Michael Gan, who frankly conceded under cross-examination that lockout/tagout was not established. His answer is reproduced below[^21]:

> Q    That’s not my question Mr. Gan. I’m not asking you who’s job it was. I’m asking you was the sea chest pumps on the starboard side of MV Frisia Kiel on 4th of June 2014 locked out and tagged out.

> A    No, it was running at minimum flow.

Michael Gan’s evidence was consistent with Darren Brunton’s evidence that lockout/tagout can only be established when there is no flow.

209    Turning now to the evidence of the divers on working in reduced flow. Saw’s evidence is unhelpful to the defence as his evidence was that he has not worked inside a sea chest with the pump in reduced flow. He also took contradictory positions on whether a diver can work in reduced flow. Saidon in his statement simply stated that it will be possible if the ‘suction power is small’. Joe and Mario testified that they had worked within a sea chest with reduced flow with their previous employers. The exact details of those situations are of course unknown. The evidence of Joe in fact suggests that the situations were not where the vessels needed to keep the sea chest pump running in reduced flow to keep the engine in operation but instead where there may have been some flow as the vessels were unable to completely shut the valve possibly due to design. His evidence is set out below:[^22]

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

You see when I read this literally, “Ensure no suction”, it gives me the impression that it’s completely switched off, no suction at all. How do you read it in practice? What is the understanding of this?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

To us, minimum is quite---we can enter with minimum, because like what I tell you earlier on, some vessel might not be able to shut the whole valve.

Yah, valve.

210    The extract of Joe’s evidence appears to be similar to Ian Duncan’s evidence (see \[207\]). Ian Duncan’s evidence was that he had not come across divers working in a sea chest in reduced flow. The prosecution’s expert, Darren Brunton, also testified that it was not common for divers to undertake works in minimal flow. He said:[^23]

> I have been asked to advise on the safest way to complete this work activity in accordance with industry guidance, code of practice and that’s what I’ve done. When you’re saying norm to divers entering or working in sea chest with knowledge that it is in a Delta P scenario, it would not be a norm because safe diving procedures are the norm. However, there are individuals companies globally as per their own reports that we’ve read that do not follow safe diving procedures. Why they don’t follow is many reasons. It was stated due to commercial reasons, due to lack of awareness of Delta P.

211    The fact that UWC may have previously undertaken works in a sea chest with reduced flow and other diving companies may also have done so (although the circumstances are unknown), does not by itself assist UWC and David. In _Ng Huat Seng and another v Munib Mohammad Madni and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1074</span> at \[74\], it was held that “_negligent conduct does not cease to be so simply on account of repetition and normalisation. In assessing the standard of care to be met, therefore, it would be just as unwise to accept a common industry practice uncritically as it would be to simply ignore it_.”

212    If it was indeed a common industry practice that was safe to undertake works in reduced flow, then logically UWC’s risk assessment would not have stated to shut down pumps at sea chest to be inspected. Michael Gan and David conceded that a no flow situation was the best scenario. Darren Brunton who has the necessary industry knowledge stated in his report that “_if there is any flow of water no diving should take place. If there is seen to be a minimum amount of water flow- diving should not continue. If the isolation cannot be made, diving should not commence._” This was precisely what the risk assessment of UWC stated to address the risk of divers being trapped by sea suction.

213    As regards the contention that the deceased had entered the sea chest thrice and exited twice and that Mario was able to take the photograph of the pipe inlet and David had also worked in its vicinity, it is reasonable to infer that the position of the divers in relation to the pipe inlet could not have been identical to the eventual position of the deceased just before he was sucked in. When David welded the 1st anode, only half of the body of the deceased was in the sea chest. This was in stark contrast to his positioning just before he was sucked in. In any case, as Darren Brunton stated[^24], _“The fact that several divers went in and out of the sea grating while it was known the flow was there, I would say it’s luck, that they could do that without incident.”_

214    The foreseeability of risk which UWC as employer and David as diving supervisor who was in charge of the safety of the dive operation ought to have safeguarded against is an objective measure to be assessed with reference to the standards of a prudent and reasonable employer/man. In this regard, it is clear that the only acceptable standard was the default position of eliminating the flow which was embraced by UWC’s risk assessment and which was attested to by the prosecution and the defence expert.

215    It will suffice to say that if a precaution is practicable it must be taken unless in the circumstances that would be unreasonable. And if men's lives may be at stake, it should not lightly be held that to take a practicable precaution is unreasonable. Here, the consequence of working close to the pipe inlet was either death or serious physical injury to the lives of the divers. Accordingly, I found that by allowing its divers to carry out works in the starboard sea chest without the identified risk control in its own risk assessment being able to be put in place to eliminate the hazard of suction or by using other controls or safe systems of work to minimise or control the risk, UWC had failed in its duty to take measures, so far as is reasonably practicable, to ensure the safety of its divers. I found that UWC had failed to discharge the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that it was not reasonably practicable to eliminate the risk or that there was no better practicable means to do more to eliminate or control the risk. I was satisfied that this particular of the charge was established beyond a reasonable doubt.

216    It is relevant to state at the outset that this was David’s first ever dive into a sea chest. His appointment with no prior experience of a dive into a sea chest was contrary to Michael Gan confidently asserting that there is ‘no possibility’[^25] of a diving supervisor being tasked to lead a team if he has no experience of performing works in a sea chest. To ensure safety of employees, s 12(3)(e) of the WSHA requires adequacy in instruction, information, training and supervision. Having the experience of undertaking works in a sea chest would necessarily have assisted in the formulation of the dive plan, e.g. cleaning the sea chest gratings before opening it, and in appreciating the risks of working within the vicinity of an active intake with Delta P. Having regard to Michael Gan’s evidence, UWC ought not to have appointed David to lead the team of divers to ensure their safety.

217    David was unfortunately unfamiliar with the insidious threat to safety posed by Delta P hazards. In fact, he did not even ensure the starboard sea chest gratings were cleaned first before the grating was opened. The undisputed evidence of Joe was that he had opened grating 1 of the starboard sea chest before he commenced to clean the grating. The importance of cleaning the sea chest gratings first to determine the impact on the flow of water was emphasised by Michael Gan was as follows[^26]:

> The reason is after cleaning the sea chest gratings, we will understand the flow even better. Whether there is differential pressure and so on and so forth because we can assess it better because it’s already cleaned and the gaps are all, without any, uh, impediment or marine growth and we can even feel better.

Darren Brunton had also made the point that there is a potential that an initial low flow of water could be due to build-up of marine growth or a blocked pipe which is subsequently cleared or breaks off causing an increase in suction and flow.

218    David did not ascertain from the vessel if any controls could be put in place to protect the divers, the flow rate of the water or the suction rate, or if the reduced flow was below the safe speed laid down in the ship’s book. Under cross-examination, he initially agreed that there was a possibility of a diver being trapped by suction in reduced flow. However, he subsequently did an about-turn and denied any potential hazard due to the possible suction effect in reduced flow. He was asked[^27]:

> Mr. Ng, you’ve gone one step ahead. My question was simply, if this was---when I say “this”, I’m referring to the divers being sucked by the suction from the sea chest, if this was a potential hazard on the 4th of June 2014, since the starboard sea chest pumps were in reduced flow. Was this a potential hazard?

He answered:

> A    On reduced flow, no, Your Honour.

In contrast, when asked about a no flow situation, he claimed that there would be a potential hazard of someone switching on the pump. The question and answer is reproduced below[^28]:

>

 | 

And if it is completely shut, the sea chest pumps, would this also be a potential hazard?

| 

Court:

 | 

Explain.

 |
| 

Witness:

 |

219    David’s answers showed that he was not being forthright. His approach was simply to proceed with the works within the starboard sea chest by the divers testing the suction and exercising caution and by having three divers enter the sea chest to finish the work quickly. I found that a reasonable and prudent diving supervisor in the shoes of David would not only have foreseen the danger of suction but would have been acutely aware of it especially because the work was in the vicinity of the pipe inlet. He ought to have explored other measures to eliminate or reduce the risk to protect the divers and himself. He in fact did not even ensure that the additional risk control of having ‘one diver to standby outside sea chest box’ was in place before diving commenced. Joe’s evidence was that he only came to the starboard sea chest after the divers entered into it. Further, Joe’s duty was not as a standby diver. He was there doing the cleaning of the gratings of the sea chest.

220    As there were no other measures to counteract the risk of reduced flow, I found that David ought to have aborted the works in the starboard sea chest instead of asking the divers to feel for suction and to proceed with caution, Accordingly, I was satisfied that David was negligent and had endangered the safety of the divers and himself by not exercising the caution incumbent on him. I was satisfied that the charge had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Credibility of Darren Brunton

221    I would at this juncture deal briefly with the challenge to the credibility of Darren Brunton on the ground that he had a ‘hidden personal and business agenda’. Learned counsel criticised him for saying that he was ‘not familiar’ with UWC when he was in the same diving industry. With due respect, learned counsel’s question on being ‘familiar’ with UWC is too broad and vague. In response, Darren Brunton had answered realistically ‘I know the name and I’ve known of them, yes. … I know they exist obviously. I’ve met them before.’ He also tried to put into doubt Darren Brunton’s evidence that he did not know Michael Gan well, and it was contended that they were committee members for five years and ‘knew each other well enough to be seated together in a group photograph’. I found this argument hard to follow. Being committee members does not by itself prove that they knew each other well and sitting next to a committee member in a group photograph may be entirely coincidental.

222    It was submitted that the UK HSE 2009 report did not state that the best way to deal with Delta P is to shut down the vessel’s pumps when underwater works are ongoing, which is what Darren Brunton had alluded to. Darren Brunton’s response pointed out that Delta P can occur without pumps. In fact, the Report in its hierarchy of control states elimination/avoidance as the preferred risk control method which was consistent with the evidence of Darren Brunton and UWC’s risk assessment.

223    Darren Brunton has extensive experience in the diving industry. He has been a safety consultant for about 20 years. His opinion was based on the good and safe practices in the industry. I found him to be an objective witness.

## Were there other safe work procedures that were not adopted by UWC?

224    In the main, the prosecution relied on the evidence of its expert, Darren Brunton, and on the non-observance of the best practices stipulated in the SS511:2010. The SS511:2010 was made an approved code of practice pursuant to s 40B WSHA with effect from 9 December 2013. In this regard, s 40C WSHA states:

> **40C.**—(1)    A person shall not be liable to any criminal proceedings by reason only that he has failed to observe any approved code of practice.

The SS511:2010 ‘provides a set of requirements to promote uniformity of practice in relation to the occupational safety and health in the commercial diving industry’. Whilst these industry standards are not conclusive, they provide an important standard in ascertaining if UWC took reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety of its divers.

225    The prosecution alleged that safe work procedures were not adopted in respect of the following:

> (a)     By carrying out works in the starboard sea chest without the identified risk control in the risk assessment being able to be put in place to eliminate the risk of suction.

> (b)     By allowing the designated diving supervisor to dive when he ought not to have.

> (c)     By failing to have a dive plan with an emergency response plan.

> (d)     By using SCUBA as the diving equipment instead of Surface Supplied Diving Equipment (‘SSDE’).

> (e)     By not having a lifeline for its divers when using SCUBA.

226    The non-implementation of the risk assessment in respect of S/Nos. 2, 5 and 7 has been considered above. The carrying on of works by not adhering to its own standards in the risk assessment was a clear instance of a failure to implement a safe work procedure.

#### Allowing the diving supervisor to dive when he ought not to have

227    Clause 4.3.1 of the SS511:2010 states that the diving supervisor shall be appointed in writing by the company employing the diver and shall be responsible for the safe conduct of the diving operation. David was designated as the diving supervisor in the risk assessment.

228    Clause 4.3.3 states that “_The diving supervisor shall not dive while acting as diving supervisor …”_ The rationale for this was explained by Darren Brunton as follows[^29]:

> The diving supervisor is responsible for the safety of the dive. He cannot do that while he is diving. He needs to be able to communicate with the divers in the water, manage and respond to their needs and requirement for the work task, communicate with clients, other people involved, manage and supervise the surface attendants and in the event of emergency, manage and have direct supervision over that emergency. He cannot do any of those tasks if he’s in the water.

In short, if the diving supervisor were to dive, he will not be able to control the diving operation.

229    It is not in dispute that David had dived to carry out welding in the starboard sea chest. David claimed that he had handed his supervision duty to the stand-in diving supervisor, Saidon, before diving. There is no document to evidence this alleged handover. In the risk assessment, Saidon’s role is stated as diver. Saidon died on 25 January 2015 due to a natural cause. His statement which he gave on 1 July 2014 was admitted into evidence as exhibit P11. In his statement, Saidon did not state that he was the stand-in diving supervisor. In respect of his role, he stated the following:

> After I finished welding at the bow thrusters, I became the standby diver and David became the welder.

Saidon had only referred to an exchange of duty as ‘standby diver’. The duties of a standby diver are distinct from that of a supervisor. There is also no evidence that Saidon had attended a supervisor’s training course. More significantly, David’s assertion is contradicted by the evidence of UWC’s representative, Michael Gan, who stated that Saidon was not at supervisory level.[^30]

230    Accordingly, I found that David did not handover his duties and he therefore ought not to have dived. It should be noted that David had to surface twice to give instructions to switch off the sea chest pumps as there was obviously no one on board the workboat as the appointed diving supervisor who was coordinating and managing the mishap that had occurred. By allowing David to dive without a stand-in diving supervisor, UWC had failed to implement a safe work procedure.

#### Was the correct breathing apparatus to carry out the underwater works SSDE instead of SCUBA?

231    Clause 6.2 of SS511:2010 states the following:

> The decision as to which type of breathing apparatus is appropriate for a given diving operation shall be made after consideration of:

>> (a)    The type of work to be done by the diver;

>> (b)    The equipment required;

>> (c)    The conditions under which the diver will work;

>> (d)    The inherent risks and limitations of each type of breathing apparatus; and

>> (e)    The competence of the diver.

232    Clause 8.2 states the restrictions on the use of SCUBA as follows:

> 8.2.1 General

> No dive shall be undertaken using Scuba where:

>> (a)    Prolonged physical exertion may be required of the diver;

>> (b)    The diving operation requires the use of cranes, surface-powered equipment \[see 8.2.2 (b)\] or surface-controlled equipment;

>> (c)    Direct access to the surface cannot be maintained or there is a risk of entanglement;

>> ...

> 8.2.2 Exceptions

> The use of scuba in occupation diving shall be restricted to activities where the nature of the task to be performed does not significantly increase the level of risk associated with the dive. Such activities may include the following:

>> …

>> (b)    Light work of short duration where any tool(s) or equipment used by the diver do not present hazards or increase the risk to the diver, and are such that they can be manually handled and safely controlled by the diver.

>> Note 1 – The task at hand should be considered carefully. Even tasks such as undoing bolts, which appear simple, can require more physical exertion than is normally the case if it is found that a bolt has seized.

>> Note 2 – Scuba using the open-circuit principle has an inherent limitation, as far as capacity is concerned, for sustained physical exertion at any depth. Planning a Scuba diving operation requires assessment of the likely gas consumption for the operation. This can vary greatly depending on the diver, the physical exertion required to complete the task and the environment. As depth increases, the difficulty in assessing gas consumption and bottom time under varying work conditions increases.

233    It was contended by the defence that the works fell within exception (b) of clause 8.2.2. In this regard, the defence relied on the evidence of David that the cleaning of sea chest gratings was at a level of difficulty of 1 to 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, and the welding of anodes was rated to be 3 to 4. It was also said that the underwater works were evenly divided amongst the various divers.

234    I noted that UWC had the SSDE equipment on its workboats. The choice of equipment was not specifically considered in UWC’s risk assessment. It was also not specifically discussed during the toolbox meeting. Based on the number of divers deployed for the operation, it was plain that UWC had decided on the choice of equipment before the toolbox meeting. In any case, on the evidence of the divers, there appeared to have been a tacit preference for the use of SCUBA.

235    The defence contended that the small and enclosed area of the sea chest with a height of 4.08 metres, length of 2.5 metres and width of 2.3 metres made the use of SCUBA more appropriate compared to the risk of entanglement with the use of SSDE. I did not accept this argument as the use of SCUBA (in accordance with the guidelines) also comes with lifelines. In this regard, Darren Brunton answered[^31]:

> Q    If scuba is used, this risk will be eliminated, agree or disagree?

> A    If scuba is used as in accordance with the guidelines, a lifeline is to going to be there. So, you still have the lifeline entanglement potential with each other and the cable. So, it have to be considered in both scenarios.

Darren Brunton disagreed that the SSDE’s umbilical tied to the diver would restrict ingress and egress. He explained that the umbilical was only 5cm in diameter. As regards entanglement of the umbilical cords of two divers and with the welding cable, he said the likelihood was low, and if it does occur, it could be managed. He stated the welding cable will be placed where the diver is working at. It is part of the divers training to manage the umbilical and the diver’s tender would ensure that there is no entanglement. In addition, the divers are able to communicate with each other and the diving supervisor, and since the diving supervisor will be managing, he will know of any entanglement where the diver requires assistance. I accepted the opinion of Darren Brunton which was logical and well-reasoned.

236    I accepted the opinion of Darren Brunton that the restrictions in the guidelines applied to the present case and that SSDE should therefore have been used for the following reasons:

> (a)     The work inside the sea chest was in a confined space with very poor visibility and with no direct access to the surface (see clause 8.2.1(c)).

> (b)     The work of welding the anodes required the use of a welding machine which is a surface powered machine (see clause 8.2.1(b)).

> (c)     Note 1 to clause 8.2.2(b) states: “_The task at hand should be considered carefully. Even tasks such as undoing bolts, which appear simple, can require more physical exertion than is normally the case if it is found that a bolt has seized._”. On Joe’s evidence, he took 15 to 20 minutes to open up one grating. The work of opening the grating itself thus required prolonged physical exertion. As for the cleaning of the gratings, Joe and the deceased began cleaning the port sea chest gratings at 2.35pm and had not completed the works when diving operations stopped 2 hours and 15 minutes later. When Joe came over to the starboard side, he was still cleaning grating 3 when the mishap occurred. As for the welding of the 1st anode in place, David took approximately 15 minutes. Accordingly, I did not agree that it fell within light work.

237    Darren Brunton agreed that SSDE with its unlimited surface air supply has its potential risks and hazards, in particular, that there may potentially be more air bubbles if the diver were to breathe using the free flow of air and that the build-up together with gas from the welding may potentially result in combustion. However, he stated that the SSDE is a safer equipment to prevent hazards from happening as it allowed for communication between the divers and for the diving supervisor to manage the work activities using the control panel. He explained that communications play a large part in diving and in an emergency. In this regard, it should be noted that because of the lack of communications, no one was aware of the mishap until the deceased’s fin hit the head of David. Also, because of the inability to communicate with the workboat, David had to surface to the water twice to give instructions to shut down the pump.

#### Were there sufficient personnel to carry out the underwater works?

238    Clause 8.3 of SS511:2010 stipulates the minimum number of personnel required. There shall be one standby diver for every two divers in the water. For every diver in the water, a diver’s attendant is required to attend to the lifeline/umbilical.

239    There were four divers working at the sea chest at the material time –David, Mario, Joe and the deceased. However, Michael Gan, Kenneth Gan and David claimed that there were three working divers as Joe was a tender diver (standby diver) stationed outside the starboard sea chest, in addition to Saw and Saidon who were on the workboat. In addition, it was claimed that Mansoor (Chief Engineer) and Captain Wahab were the topside tenders.

240    Mansoor was not called as a witness. None of the other witnesses testified to him having played any role as a topside tender. Captain Wahab stated categorically that he did not know anything about the diving job. He stated that he was stationed in the wheelhouse where the marine radio is located and described his role as follows[^32]:

> Well, Sir, for the job---underwater job, I sure don’t know anything about the diving job at all. What I know, I command my boat. I reach the location. I inform the supervisor that we are here and the rest of it, I don’t know, Sir.

It was plain that Michael Gan and Kenneth Gan were simply ascribing roles to Mansoor and Captain Wahab to try to make up for the shortfall in the number of divers assigned to do the job.

241    The evidence of Joe was that he had not completed cleaning the grating at the portside when diving resumed at 1800 hours. Thereafter when he came to the starboard side, the divers had already began work. He then started to clean grating 3. He was not even aware that the deceased had been sucked into the pipe inlet. It was David who informed him and asked him to assist to pull out the deceased. It is therefore clear that Joe did not perform the role of a standby diver.

242    The two standby divers were Saw and Saidon. Whilst the two standby divers were sufficient for four divers (which includes the accused), the fact remains that the accused ought not to have dived. In addition, the use of either SCUBA or SSDE would have required a diver’s attendant for each diver to attend to the diver’s umbilical/lifeline (see table 1 at pg 30 and table 2 at pg 36 of SS 511:2010). Accordingly, a minimum of 12 diving personnel were required as opposed to half the number that UWC deployed. There were therefore insufficient personnel deployed. In this regard, it is quite plain from the evidence of Michael Gan, that there were concerns that the deployment of more divers would drive up cost and, in his words, ‘ships will just go somewhere else and do the work, period.’[^33]

#### Was there a dive plan and emergency response plan?

243    Clause 6.1.4 of SS 511:2010 states the following:

> A dive plan shall be prepared and agreed upon by all parties involved in the diving operation prior to commencement of the dive. The dive plan should address the following aspects of the diving operation:

> The method of performing the task;

> The duties of each person involved;

> The diving equipment, breathing gases and quantities;

> Specific hazards and the methods used to address them;

> An emergency response plan, with access to key personnel, should be displayed at the dive site or dive control panel;

> Step by step procedures to be used, including the planned bottom time and decompress profiles;

> Safe deployment and recovery of the diver and standby diver;

> Equipment and tools required.

> Consideration should be given to the provision of checklists with the necessary endorsement.

244    It was submitted by the defence that the dive plan was discussed by David together with the rest of the team on board the workboat at Marina South Pier and that there is no legal requirement that a dive plan must be in writing.

245    I accepted that there is no legal requirement for a dive plan to be in writing. A written dive plan would of course be ideal as it would ensure that all tasks and steps to carry out the dive operation would be detailed. However, I took the view that the risk assessment, the Diving Safety Checklist (Annex B of P1) and the toolbox meeting with the divers at Marina South Pier would have sufficed to address the salient aspects of the diving operation.

246    Based on the evidence of all the divers and David, there was no discussion on the emergency response plan. It was submitted by the defence that the divers were experienced and knew what to do in the event of an emergency. However, the evidence of Joe was that he was ‘quite panicked and scared, and a bit lost.’

247    Further, it was submitted that UWC had an emergency response plan which was documented in its Quality Manual (exh D31) in paragraph 11.3. Part of this emergency response plan involved having a STED membership with Dr Kevin Chan who provided a 24-hour emergency telemedicine services for the divers (exh D38). In my view, the emergency response plan must be more than a general plan. A safe work procedure would require an emergency response plan to be specific to the dive and the location. Here, as there was the possibility of entrapment due to active suction, the emergency response plan ought to have been discussed prior to the dive and instructions given on how to deal with the situation. This was clearly not done.

248    In conclusion, I found that UWC ‘failed to ensure adequate safety measures, in respect of safe work procedures, were taken in respect of the process used by the divers’ and this particular of charge against it was also established beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Mitigation

#### Underwater Contractors

249    The defence submitted for a fine of $100,000. It was emphasised that UWC’s failures did not cause a workplace accident.

250    Learned counsel referred to the case of _MW Group Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1300</span> (“_MW Group_”), which reformulated the framework laid down in _PP v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 682</span> (“_GS Engineering_”) for offences under s 12(1) WSHA to a “sentence scale” graph. The “sentence scale” graph was formulated based on the sentencing framework in _Nurun Novi_ which involved a s 15(3A) WSHA offence. Learned counsel accepted that the decision in _MW Group_ must be treated with caution in light of the decision in _Mao Xuezhong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 99</span> (‘_Mao Xuezhong_’) which revised the sentencing framework for offences under s 15(3A). Accordingly, he submitted that the sentencing framework in _GS Engineering_ should be preferred. It was noted that the approach in analysing harm in _GS Engineering_ differed from that in _Mao Xuezhong_ in that _GS Engineering_ considered only the level of potential harm and treated actual harm as a separate aggravating factor to be considered in the second stage of the inquiry. In _Mao Xuezhong_, both potential and actual harm are considered in determining the level of harm.

251    It was submitted that the level of harm and culpability should be categorised as ‘medium’. As for the likelihood of harm arising from diving in reduced flow in the starboard sea chest, reliance was placed on S/Nos. 2, 5 and 7 of the risk assessment which stated it as ‘remote’. In addition, reliance was placed on the evidence of the divers that the likelihood of being trapped by suction from the sea chest was remote. The differential pressure incidents relied on by Darren Brunton were dismissed on the ground that those incidents which occurred in foreign jurisdictions totalled only 66 recorded cases over a span of 100 years giving rise to an extremely low probability. With respect to the safe work procedure breaches, it was submitted the likelihood of harm arising was of low to moderate level.

252    As regards culpability, it was said that the breaches of safe work procedure were not egregious in nature. As regards the non-implementation of the risk assessment, it was said that it arose from the working condition provided by the vessel. It was also claimed that UWC’s actions did not deviate from common industry practice.

253    It was submitted that UWC cooperated with the MOM and gave its full cooperation during the BUS programme.

#### David

254    Learned counsel submitted that a sentence of imprisonment would be inappropriate and suggested a fine of $25,000. In support of this submission, he referred to the lapse of more than three years after the accident to charge David on 11 October 2017. He also emphasised that the charge was amended to remove that the alleged negligent act resulted in the death of the deceased.

255    Learned counsel referred to the framework in _Mao Xuezhong_ and submitted that the level of harm fell within the moderate category. It was said that whilst the harm risked was death or serious injury, the likelihood of such harm occurring was very unlikely. As regards likelihood, reference was made to S/Nos. 2, 5 and 7 of the risk assessment where the likelihood was stated to be remote and the evidence of the other divers who supported the assessment. As for the number of people exposed to the risk, it was said that there were only three divers (including David) working within the sea chest.

256    With respect to culpability, it was submitted that the culpability was low as David was of the view that it was safe to conduct the works within the starboard sea chest running in minimum flow. It was submitted that “_In fact, David was certain enough to put himself in the exact same position as his fellow colleagues. As mentioned, David was one of the divers working in the starboard sea chest and in close proximity to the pipe orifice. Surely an experienced commercial diver would not knowingly put himself in a dangerous position underwater_.” It was also said that the other divers were of the consensus that it was safe and acceptable to dive on minimum flow and that David’s actions were consistent with UWC’s practice and common industry practice.

257    David is 37 years old. He is married with a four-year-old son. He is the sole breadwinner and also supports his parents. He does not have any prior conviction. He cooperated fully in the course of investigations. It was said that David experienced deep regret and remorse over the passing of the deceased as they shared a close relationship and regarded each other as ‘sworn brothers’.

## Sentence

258    The offence under s 12(1) against a body corporate for failing to take reasonably practicable measures to ensure the safety of employees carries a maximum fine of $500,000 (s 50(b)). The offence under s 15(3A) of doing a negligent act which endangers safety carries a maximum fine of $30,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years or both.

#### Should the death be considered in the assessment of sentence?

259    It is not a constituent element of the offences that there must be actual harm. Where a subsequent offence under s 12(1) has resulted in death, s 51 WSHA specifically provides for an enhanced sentence where the earlier contravention had also caused death.

260    It is a settled practice to allege in the charge that the contravention has resulted in death. This is to give the accused an opportunity to dispute causation and for the prosecution to prove this particular of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, the prosecution removed the allegation that the contravention caused the death of the deceased from the charges on 6 July 2018. During the trial, it went onto expressly confirm that the prosecution was not relying on the death. If the prosecution had wanted the death to be considered as part of the circumstances for the purpose of sentencing, it ought not have it removed it from the charge. After having given the confirmation during the trial that it was not relying on it, it is invidious for the prosecution to do an about-turn and to ask for the death to be taken into account for sentencing. Accordingly, I declined to consider the death in the assessment of sentence.

#### Charge against David

261    The prosecution sought a sentence of eight months imprisonment whereas the defence submitted for a fine of $25,000.

262    The sentencing matrix laid down in _Mao Xuezhong_ is as follows:

263    The vastly different sentencing positions taken by the parties was due to the prosecution arguing that David’s culpability is high and the defence submitting that it is low. As for harm, the parties were in agreement that it should fall within the moderate band.

264    I turn now to consider the two parameters for the determination of sentence.

#### Harm

265    Harm includes a consideration of the degree of both potential harm and actual harm caused. Where the actual harm caused is death or serious injury, “the harm would be graded near the top end of the high range” (see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[64(a)(i)\]). In the instant case, as the death does not form part of the assessment, the harm cannot fall within the “top end of the high range”.

266    The harm category therefore turns on the consideration of the degree of potential harm. This assessment requires a consideration of both the seriousness of the harm risked, the likelihood of that harm arising and the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of that harm (see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[64(a)(i)\]).

#### Seriousness of harm risked

267    As regards the seriousness of the harm risked, the risk assessment stated the severity or consequence of the hazard of being trapped by suction to be ‘major’ for S/No. 2 and ‘moderate’ for S/Nos. 5 and 7. According to Darren Brunton, the same severity would apply to S/Nos. 5 and 7. This was accepted by the defence witness, Sarjit. Major severity would necessarily mean that the seriousness of harm risked was death or serious injury. In _Mao Xuezhong_, it was stated that where “the harm was likely to be death or serious injury (such as paralysis or loss of a limb), the harm could be considered to be high even though it did not materialise.”

#### Likelihood of harm

268    Darren Brunton disagreed that the likelihood of the hazard of being trapped by suction happening is ‘remote’ as stated in the risk assessment. He stated that it would fall within ‘occasional’ as such incidents have occurred occasionally. The defence stressed that there were only 66 incidents reported overseas over a span of 100 years based on the HSE UK 2009 Report. The HSE UK 2009 Report states that the 66 differential pressure incidents were of ‘sufficient quality for inclusion in the report’, and that there were ‘continued occurrence of fatal accidents involving differential pressure’ that led it to conduct a systematic review. So, quite clearly this supports Darren Brunton’s evidence that differential pressure hazards in the diving industry are not remote.

269    Based on the risk assessment, the likelihood of ‘occasional’ would translate into ‘high risk’ where the ‘job may not proceed until risk level is reduced to medium or low’. Darren Brunton explained that to make it as low as practicable would require the power source to be turned off.

#### Whether the offence exposed a number of divers to the risk of harm

270    There were at least three divers working in the sea chest who were exposed to harm – the deceased, Mario and the accused himself.

271    Considering the three factors in the round, I agreed with the parties categorisation and placed the harm to be within the moderate category.

#### Culpability

272    Culpability involves a consideration of the “the nature of the unsafe act, the number of unsafe acts committed by the offender and the level of deviation from established procedure involved in the unsafe act. Other relevant factors would include whether the unsafe acts were motivated by the offender’s desire to save on costs.” (see \[64(a)(ii)\] of _Mao Xuezhong_)

273    David’s level of culpability can only be said to be low if he had made significant efforts to address the risk when the best scenario identified in the risk assessment could not be adhered to. Here, all that he did was to inform the divers that the starboard sea chest pump was running at reduced flow and to proceed with caution although some of the works were in the vicinity of the pipe inlet. Accordingly, I disagreed that his culpability was low.

274    I noted that there were no concerns of safety raised by the other divers. Joe and Mario said that they did not feel any suction and were comfortable to proceed with the underwater works. I found this to be insufficient to bring the culpability to the low category. It would have been sufficient only if there was an insignificant risk to safety. This was not the circumstance presented to David. However, this did not demonstrate that David was ‘indifferent’ and ‘callous’ to the safety risks as the prosecution had submitted. I disagreed with the prosecution’s assessment and instead placed his culpability to be in the moderate category.

275    As there was moderate harm and moderate culpability, based on _Mao Xuezhong_, the custodial threshold was crossed. The range is up to a maximum of six months’ imprisonment. I compared the sentences in _Nurun Novi_ and _Public Prosecutor v Tay Tong Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 58</span> where the offenders received 25 weeks’ imprisonment (enhanced from 13 weeks because of 2 deaths) and eight weeks’ imprisonment (with an eight-week consecutive sentence on a s 204A Penal Code charge) respectively. However, the circumstances of these cases are different and are of limited help and both cases were also decided pre-_Mao Xuezhong_ under a different sentencing framework.

276    Although there was a delay of about three years in charging, I noted that a Coroner’s Inquiry was first held, industry standards and practice had to be considered and expert evidence was obtained. All in all, I did not consider it to be an inordinate delay to warrant a reduction in sentence. The other personal mitigating factors raised carried limited weight. As regards David sharing a close relationship with the deceased to the extent of being a ‘sworn brother’, the fact of the matter is that close relationships maybe formed between colleagues at the workplace. The nature of the offence is such that it calls for general deterrence and the interests of the safety of employees at the workplace overrides any minor relevance that evidence of remorse and regret may have.

277    In my assessment, the appropriate imprisonment term on the facts is the mid-point of the moderate category, and David was accordingly sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

#### UWC’s sentence

278    Based on the latest decision in _Mao Xuezhong_, the sentencing frameworks in _MW Group_ and _GSE Engineering_ will require review by the High Court. First, the graph-based mathematical approach adopted in _MW Group_ was rejected in _Mao Xuezhong_. Second, the frameworks in _GSE Engineering_ and _MW Group_ are based on potential harm, with actual harm being treated as a separate aggravating factor. Under the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework, actual harm is considered as part of the assessment of harm. Third, in the two decisions more weight is given to potential harm as opposed to culpability. In contrast, the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework requires equal weight to be given to harm and culpability.

279    Accordingly, the prosecution put forward an alternative sentencing framework which incorporated the two principal differences in approach. I accepted that an upward adjustment was required to the sentencing ranges set out in _GSE Engineering_ due to the change in approach arising from the decision of _Mao Xuezhong_. I therefore did not consider myself constrained by the sentencing ranges in _GSE Engineering_ and _MW Group_.

280    As regards the factor of harm, the assessment was similar to that for David, namely, that it fell within the moderate band.

281    With respect to culpability, I did not agree with the defence that the non-implementation of the risk assessment which required the elimination of the risk of suction should be categorised as ‘not an egregious breach nor an intentional one’ on the ground that the working conditions were provided by the vessel. The inability of the vessel to shut down the starboard sea chest was communicated to UWC before its workboats arrived at Marina South Pier. The responsibility then fell on UWC, as the employer, to ensure the safety of its divers. In this regard, there was no change made to its risk control measures at S/No.2, 5 and 7 of the risk assessment. Instead, the attitude taken was to give it a try as a service provider and to leave it to the divers to manage the situation by approaching with care and keeping a distance from the pipe inlet.

282    In addition, there were other material breaches of safe work procedures which are based on good practices of the industry as set out in the SS511:2010, namely, the diving supervisor shall not dive, the use of SCUBA instead of SSDE, insufficient personnel and no life line for SCUBA, no emergency response plan specific to the dive. It is clear from the evidence of Michael Gan that he disagreed with the recommendations in the SS511:2010 and criticised them to be an ‘overkill’ and which also led to his resignation from the committee. He seemed to think that it was sufficient to rely on a team of experienced divers and was very concerned about the impact on cost if the number of divers deployed were increased as seen from the following evidence he gave:[^34]

> Because for instance if we want to do SSDE diving with 3 divers inside, I need 12 guys to be in the team to do welding of 3 anodes. I’m not saying that we are cutting short workers, compromise on safety. What we are saying that we can do it in another method, also safe enough with the same productivity or better and cheaper. But of course we cannot say everything cheap and we compromise on safety.

283    I noted one specific aggravating factor which is UWC’s prior conviction under s 12(1) WSHA in November 2010 where it was fined $50,000. Some of the safety breaches in the prior conviction related to lack of lifeline, lack of effective communications and rescue arrangements, inadequate risk assessment and effective control measures, and allowing the dive supervisor to dive. The nature of these safety breaches were identical to that in the present case.

284    UWC is a big player in the local commercial diving industry. It failed to adhere to its own risk assessment and put in place measures that are recognised standards in the industry without good reason and failed to make appropriate changes after the 2010 conviction. Accordingly, I determined the culpability to be high. A deterrent message has to be sent to employers to take safety seriously. I accepted the prosecution’s submission for a fine of $300,000, and UWC was fined accordingly.
