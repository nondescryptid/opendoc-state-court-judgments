Civil Procedure – Striking out

6 October 2022 - Judgment reserved

### Deputy Registrar Kim Bum Soo:

1       Mr Paul Jeyasingam Edwards (“**the Tenant**”) has appeared before eleven different judicial officers in approximately fifteen different applications brought in four different suits/writs over the span of two years (see \[37\]). Though these were strictly speaking different proceedings, they were all episodes of the same saga: he had been staying on Ms Loke Wei Sue’s (“**the Landlord**”) property (“**the Property**”) without paying rent. Each of these proceedings tell the same story of a man convinced of his entitlement to stay on a property that he no longer legally owns, based on an alleged agreement that he cannot prove. And so, the Tenant has at every instance (save on one occasion),[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) been refused stays of proceedings, “setting aside” applications, and “injunctions” as he attempted to remain on the property.

2       DC/DC 146/2022 (“**DC 146**”) is one such instalment of this saga. In this suit, the Tenant has gone on the offensive. In DC 146, he sues the Landlord for, among other things, breach of an alleged agreement to let him stay on the Property indefinitely at a fix rental rate. In response, the Landlord has commenced DC/SUM 853/2022 (“**SUM 853**”) to strike out the Tenant’s action. I grant the orders sought in SUM 853 and the reasons for my decision are as follows.

## A preliminary jurisdictional point

3       Two jurisdictions form the potential basis for any striking out application – one stems from the provisions in O. 18 r. 19 of the Rules of Court 2014 (“**ROC 2014**”) and the other, flows from the inherent jurisdiction of the Court: _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 546</span>; <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 46</span> (“_Bunga Melati 5_”) at \[29\] and \[33\]; _Singapore Civil Procedure 2021_ (Cavinder Bull S.C. gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2021) at para 18/19/1 (“_White Book_”). Unfortunately, it was unclear what precisely was the jurisdictional basis for this application. All the summons stated was that this was an application for orders “that \[the Tenant’s\] action herein be struck out”.[^2]

4       It behoves an applicant to specify which of these jurisdictions he/she relies on since there are at least two serious differences between the two jurisdictions:

> (a)     First, the applicable tests. An application under ROC 2014 would be based on one or more of the four grounds stated in O. 18 r. 19(1). The tests for each, though sometimes involving similar factors, are slightly different and “each limb, conceptually speaking, serves a specific purpose apropos the court’s power to summarily dismiss a party’s claim”: _Bunga Melati 5_ at \[31\]. A full exposition of the relevant tests for each of these grounds/limbs was helpfully consolidated in _Tan Swee Wan and another v Lian Tian Yong Johnny_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 206</span> at \[39\] (“_Tan Swee Wan_”). In contrast, there is only one test governing the inherent jurisdiction of the court to strike out a party’s claim – whether an action is plainly or obviously unsustainable: _Bunga Melati 5_ at \[33\].

> (b)     Second, the mode of proof. For striking out applications under O. 18 r. 19(1)(_a_) ROC 2014 (for pleadings that “disclose no reasonable cause of action or defence”) no evidence is admissible on that application: O. 18 r. 19(2) ROC 2014. In contrast, those pursued under the Court’s inherent jurisdiction may be supported with affidavit evidence: _Bank of China Ltd, Singapore Branch v BP Singapore Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 738</span>; <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 120</span> at \[21\]; _White Book_ at para 18/19/5.

5       Since there was no mention of any invocation of the Court’s inherent jurisdiction in the supporting affidavit, the submissions filed, or the summons itself, I proceeded on the basis that this was an application brought under ROC 2014. Specifically, there were references in the affidavit which tracked the language used in O. 18 r. 19(1) ROC 2014 and the matters discussed therein were reasonably referrable to the various grounds stated in O. 18 r. 19(1) ROC 2014. Accordingly, I concluded that the application was brought on the grounds of O. 18 r. 19(1)(_a_)[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3), O. 18 r. 19(1)(_b_),[^4] and O. 18 r. 19(1)(_d_).[^5]

## Issues to be determined

6       This being an application to strike out the Tenant’s action, the natural starting point is the Tenant’s Statement of Claim (“**SOC**”). This can be distilled into three broad claims by the Tenant:

> (a)     The Tenant was the previous owner of the Property. When it was sold to the Landlord’s father, it was verbally agreed that the Tenant could reside on the property indefinitely by paying a fixed rent at $3,800 per month and that the Tenant could repurchase the Property at an agreed price, at a time of his choosing (“**the Verbal Agreement**”).[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The Landlord’s attempts to repossess the property and claim rental arrears are allegedly breaches of those terms (“**the Conditional Sale Claim**”).[^7]

> (b)     There was “wilful mispresent\[ation\]” of the Tenant’s text messages in a bid to “illegally terminate the condition of sale, evict \[him\] from the Property and get higher rentals renting the Property to others.” (“**the Misrepresentation Claim**”).[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (c)     The Landlord’s negligence in DC/OSS 94/2021 and DC/DC 1662/2021 has allegedly cost the Tenant money and loss of productivity. (“**the Negligence Claim**”).[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

7       As such, each of these claims ought to be analysed in the following fashion:

> (a)     Whether each of the claims disclosed a reasonable cause of action, _per_ O.18 r. 19(1)(_a_) ROC 2014;

> (b)     Whether any of the claims were frivolous or vexatious, _per_ O. 18 r. 19(1)(_b_) ROC 2014; and

> (c)     Whether any of the claims amounted to an abuse of process of the Court, _per_ O. 18 r. 19(1)(_d_) ROC 2014.

## Issue 1: Reasonable cause of action

### The applicable principles

8       Traditionally, “reasonable causes of action” have been understood as those which have “some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered”: _Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span>; <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGCA 53</span>. And the metric for whether something has a “chance of success” really depends on the two dimensions of the concept of cause of action. “First, it means the legal basis which entitles the plaintiff to success. Next, it signifies the factual situation which entitles one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person.”: _Phillip Morris Products Inc. v Power Circle Sdn. Bhd. & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 964</span>.

9       So understood, the law suggests that a cause of action has no “chance of success” when (a) the cause of action is just not legally recognised and (b) when the facts pleaded do not sufficiently establish any of the legal elements for that cause of action. Needless to say, where (b) is concerned, the issue is not necessarily a matter of proof. The pleaded facts are presumed to be in favour of the claimant (assuming that the defendant is bringing the striking out application): _Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 844</span>; <span class="citation">\[1991\] SGHC 62</span> at \[29\]. It is really a matter of sufficiency of the pleadings.

### The Conditional Sale Claim

10     What then, is the cause of action in question for the Conditional Sale Claim? It appears to be a simple one – that there was some kind of breach of the Verbal Agreement between the Tenant and the initial purchaser of the Property, allegedly the Landlord’s father. This – a breach of contract – is obviously a legally recognised cause of action. The question then turns to whether the pleaded facts have established the legal elements of that cause of action.

11     Establishing a breach of contract would, at its core, involve establishing the existence of the agreement and establishing the breach of that agreement. Here, the Tenant has not pleaded any facts supporting the existence of the Verbal Agreement. He has simply asserted its existence in his SOC without more. That betrays a woeful lack of material facts. What are the circumstances in which that agreement arose? What was said between the parties at that time? What are the facts which suggest there was a meeting of the minds, establishing that agreement? None of that was canvassed. It follows that the fundamental factual foundation of this cause of action – the existence of the Verbal Agreement – was absent.

12     That said, I decline to strike out the Conditional Sale Claim on this basis for one simple reason. This cause of action was only hobbled by defects in the pleadings. It seems to me that the Tenant has plenty to offer and say about the circumstances under which this alleged agreement came into existence. He is unrepresented and is litigating this case without the benefit of any knowledge of the intricacies of civil procedure. He ought to be given a chance to state those particulars and if necessary, to amend his SOC. It would be disproportionate to strike out this case just on the basis of a failure to plead. Indeed, the whole function of pleadings is to bring notice of the case to meet. The Tenant has alluded to this alleged Verbal Agreement numerous times (most recently in _Loke Wei Sue v Paul Jeyasingham Edwards_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 48</span>). The Landlord cannot possibly be prejudiced or taken by surprise if the Tenant makes an application to amend either his SOC in DC 146 or more appropriately, as I will explain later, his defence in DC/DC 1662/2021.

13     I understand that the Landlord has also taken issue with the Tenant’s _locus standi_ for bringing suit. The Landlord says that even if the Verbal Agreement existed, it would have been between the Property’s purchaser and the _two joint-owners_ of the Property at that time (The Tenant and his wife). Accordingly, if a breach of agreement is being claimed, it should have been brought in the name of both the Tenant and his wife as joint vendors of the Property (rather than the Tenant alone).

14     In my view, issues of standing are not relevant to the question of whether there is a reasonable cause of action. This provision – O. 18 r. 19(1)(_a_) ROC 2014 – deals solely with the evaluation of the pleadings and the pleadings _alone_. I should not have to refer to the sales agreement or any other extrinsic evidence to determine that. Indeed, O. 18 r. 19(2) ROC 2014 forbids the admission of any evidence in an application brought on this ground. It is simply about the legal and factual dimensions of the cause of action – as pleaded, is it legally recognised and as pleaded, have the material facts been canvassed? Questions of standing are more appropriately left to O. 18 r. 19(1)(_b_) which deals with the legal and factual sustainability of the action. It may well be that the pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action, but it could be unsustainable because some kind of evidence dispositively puts the factual contentions to rest (rendering the case factually unsustainable) or some legal requirement such as a limitation period nips it in the bud (rendering the case legally unsustainable). Questions of standing would fall into the latter category, and I choose instead to deal with the Landlord’s argument about _locus standi_ on that basis (see below).

15     In much the same manner, I would imagine that the Landlord’s arguments about s 66 of the Land Titles Act 1993 (“**LTA**”) also go towards the legal sustainability of this cause of action. In short, the Landlord claims that there can be no supplemental condition attached to the initial sale of the Property since “all obligations created by a contract for the sale of registered land are, upon registration of the transfer giving effect to the contract, deemed to have merged in that transfer unless express provision in writing is made to the contrary”: s 66 LTA. The alleged Verbal Agreement between the Tenant and the Landlord’s father, being entirely verbal, cannot create additional conditions/obligations not captured in the instrument of sale. Again, this is really an argument that goes beyond the pleadings. It is about the legal effect/scope of s 66 LTA and should, as a matter of conceptual hygiene, be examined under O. 18 r. 19(1)(_b_) ROC 2014.

16     And finally, as for the Landlord’s arguments about s 6(_d_) of the Civil Law Act (“**CLA**”) 1909, I am reluctant to allow these to be the basis for a striking out application. There was no mention of s 6(d) CLA in the Defence filed by the Landlord. And of course, it goes without saying that a defence based on s 6(d) CLA must be pleaded specifically: _Midlink Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 258</span>; <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 182</span> at \[63\]. Having failed to plead it, I cannot see how the Landlord could have relied on such an argument in the _regular_ course of proceedings, much less in a summary determination of the sort contemplated in striking out proceedings.

17     In conclusion, I find that the Conditional Sale Claim, while not having been pleaded satisfactorily, was something that could be remedied with an appropriate amendment. These defects alone should not extinguish the claim, especially considering that the Tenant is a litigant-in-person without good knowledge of civil procedure.

### The Misrepresentation Claim

18     The Misrepresentation Claim however, discloses no reasonable cause of action. The cause of action in question, seems to be misrepresentation. But it is unclear what was the legal nature of the misrepresentation contemplated. Was its basis in common law or in the Misrepresentation Act 1967? And if it was based in common law, was the Tenant asserting a negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation? And since the particular legal nature of the alleged misrepresentation was never made clear, it followed that I could not ascertain whether the material facts were pleaded. There could be no measure of materiality if it was unclear what legal elements were relevant.

19     This goes beyond a want of particularity in the pleadings. The Tenant appears to be saying that his text messages were “willfully \[_sic_\] misrepresented” to the _Court_.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) But that is not a cause of action between the _Tenant_ and the _Landlord_. If the Tenant truly feels that the Court has been misled, he is welcome to correct the Court’s impression at the hearing or through submissions. Indeed, a considerable amount of time was spent discussing that point at the hearing, and he was given an opportunity to present his case after.[^11] No convincing clarification was forthcoming. In any case, a misrepresentation to the Court, does not, in itself, appear to be a cause of action in law. Accordingly, I strike out paragraph 5 of his SOC.

### The Negligence Claim

20     In much the same way, there is no legally recognised cause of action disclosed by the Negligence Claim. In essence, the Tenant suggests that the Landlord had been negligent in the conduct of her suits (DC/OSS 94/2021 and DC/DC 1662/2021 specifically). This has apparently cost the Tenant time and “loss of productivity”. But the law simply does not recognise this as an actionable form of negligence. Rather, if the counterparty in a suit has conducted himself/herself poorly, the usual measure of compensation is costs. It is not the basis for a cause of action or for that matter, an entirely new lawsuit.

21     I should add that the Negligence Claim was similarly plagued by a want of particularity. The familiar legal elements of any tortious claim in negligence – the establishment of a duty of care, the ascertainment of a relevant standard of care, the proof of a breach of such duty, and the establishment of damage (bearing in mind principles of remoteness/causation) – were never substantiated with any material facts. Though this was not a dispositive point, and though I was prepared to extend a certain amount of charity to the Tenant in view of his status as a litigant-in-person, I took that into consideration when choosing to strike out the Negligence Claim. Accordingly, paragraph 6 of the SOC is struck off as well.

## Issue 2: Whether any of the claims were frivolous or vexatious

### The applicable principles

22     As stated above, O. 18 r. 19(1)(_b_) concerns unsustainable actions. Though the plain language of the provision uses the terms “frivolous or vexatious”, these have long been understood to describe causes of action that are “plainly” or “obviously” unsustainable: _Bunga Melati 5_ at \[32\]. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _Bunga Melati_ 5 at \[39\], a “plainly or obviously” unsustainable action would be one which is either:

> (a)     legally unsustainable: if “it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks”; or

> (b)     factually unsustainable: if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, \[for example, if it is\] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based”.

### The Conditional Sale Claim

23     Legal sustainability wise, the Landlord has made two arguments – one pertaining to standing (see \[13\] above) and another pertaining to the LTA (see \[15\] above).

24     In my view, the Landlord’s arguments about standing are technically correct but should not render this claim legally unsustainable. Technically, the original sale of the Property was between one Chang Ming Sang (and/or his nominee), and the Tenant together with his wife as joint sellers.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) And so if there is any suggestion that the sale included further terms beyond those stated in the contract (_ie. via_ the Verbal Agreement), the _primary_ contract should technically still involve all three original contracting parties: Chang Ming Sang (and/or his nominee), the Tenant, and his wife. Naturally, the enforcement of that alleged additional term should be done by the parties to the transaction – either Chang Ming Sang (and/or his nominee) or the Tenant **and** his wife. In that sense, the fact that the Tenant has brought this action in his own name is legally incorrect. He sues as the vendor in that sale. But he is not, at least by himself, the vendor of that sale. He must sue together with his wife.

25     To this, the Tenant claims that the Verbal Agreement “was between \[the Landlord\] and \[himself\]; it was not a condition in the Sale & Purchase Agreement of 2013 but conditional to the Sale & Purchase Agreement and does not involve my spouse.”[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) There are a couple of problems with this. **First**, this is a factual averment and should really have been canvassed in an affidavit. **Second**, this is a material fact and should really have been put in the pleadings. **Third**, it appears to be a somewhat clever play of words but is in fact gobbledegook. I do not understand what the Tenant means by something not being a condition of the agreement, but nonetheless being conditional to the agreement. **Fourth**, the argument betrays itself. Taking his case at its highest, the Tenant might be suggesting that the matters discussed in the Verbal Agreement may not be _terms_ of the sales contract, but nonetheless modify the primary contract for sale of the Property. But if that were the case, the Verbal Agreement would obviously have no legal effect. The contract for sale of the Property was effected by two joint-sellers. It cannot be that some separate agreement between _one_ of these sellers and the putative buyer effectively modifies that original contract for sale. Put another way, even if I accept everything that the Tenant says, his own version of the facts immediately extinguishes the legal effect of the Verbal Agreement – he cannot, through his own agreement with the buyer, modify the terms of a sale that involves his wife.

26     All this said, I am again reluctant to prematurely end the Tenant’s suit on this basis. It seems to me that this was really chalked up to a misunderstanding about the intricacies of standing in lawsuits. It is a procedural defect that can really be made good with a simple addition of parties. And since the proceedings are still at a fairly nascent stage, there would be little prejudice to the Landlord if such an application were made. It would simply be a procedural correction (that admittedly makes good a substantive defect in the pleadings). Bearing that possibility in mind, it would be disproportionate and too crushing for me to strike out the Conditional Sale Claim on that basis.

27     A similar point – that a less dramatic solution can be adopted rather than a total striking out - can be made about the Landlord’s arguments concerning the LTA. This was, in some sense, the Landlord’s fallback argument. Even if the issues of standing were put aside and even if the Verbal Agreement could actually be established, it would be of little legal effect due to the operation of s 66 LTA. That was the gist of her point.

28     But it is not clear to me what is the precise scope and reach of s 66 LTA. The Court of Appeal discussed it in _Woon Wee Hao v Coastland Realty Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 463</span>; <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGCA 58</span> (“_Woon Wee Hao_”), and there appears to be at least some controversy about how best to interpret s 66 LTA. Specifically, in _Woon Wee Hao_, the issue was whether s 66 LTA’s operation ought to be confined to “those provisions of the contract of sale which deal with estates and interests in the land contracted to be sold and \[…\] all easements rights and powers belonging or appertaining to the land.” Here, the issue is slightly different. It is about whether s 66 LTA is so powerful as to erase a _separate_ verbal agreement that is _collateral_ to the sale of the property. No authorities were cited to me on this point. No arguments were canvassed in submissions (save for a bare reference to s 66 LTA). And the authority of _Woon Wee Hao_ (though concerning different issues from those that arise in the present instance) suggests to me that the true scope of s 66 LTA may not be found in a plain reading of its (wide) statutory language: see _Woon Wee Hao_ at \[7\] – \[8\] and _ACS Computer Pte Ltd v Rubina Watch Co (Pte) Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 1006</span>; <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 129</span> at \[25\].

29     If so, this argument about s 66 LTA should really be the subject of a preliminary hearing on a point of law. Full arguments should be made on both sides. And upon adjudication of that legal point (the scope and extent of s 66 LTA), the Tenant may well find himself without any legal basis to proceed on. A striking out application on the other hand, simply is not the right forum for a ventilation of such legal points. It goes without saying that striking out is only granted in plain and obvious cases. Where some legal controversy exists, that cannot be the case.

30     I am also not prepared to strike out the Conditional Sale Claim for factual unsustainability. The Verbal Agreement is supposedly verbal. Assuming that there are no other legal hurdles (such as issues of standing or s 66 LTA), the Tenant is obviously not at a stage to prove the Verbal Agreement just yet. He would (presumably) administer interrogatories on the relevant parties and ultimately call the relevant parties (_eg._ the Landlord’s Father) to the stand for cross-examination. And none of the documents disclosed by the Landlord in her supporting affidavit dispositively rule out the possibility of the Verbal Agreement. It seems to me that none of the Tenant’s factual averments have been conclusively shut out by the documents or evidence alone.

31     For these reasons, I decline to strike out the Conditional Sale Agreement for legal or factual unsustainability.

### The Misrepresentation Claim and Negligence Claim

32     I have earlier discussed the Misrepresentation and Negligence Claim and found that there was no reasonable cause of action. It follows that such claims would necessarily be legally unsustainable. Adopting the same reasoning above (at \[18\]- \[21\]), I would strike out these claims (and the attendant paragraphs of the SOC discussing these claims) as well.

## Issue 3: Whether any of the claims amounted to an abuse of process of the Court

### The applicable principles

33     An abuse of process refers, among other things, to the improper use of the court machinery by litigants in the system. One such instance would be when a party re-litigates something which has already been decided by the court. In other words, it may be an abuse of process to bring to court matters which are already _res judicata_.

34     “The umbrella doctrine of _res judicata_ encompasses three conceptually distinct though interrelated principles”: _Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 453</span> (“_Goh Nellie_”) at \[17\]. These are cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, and the extended doctrine of res judicata (otherwise known as the doctrine of abuse of process). Neither the prayers in SUM 853 nor the supporting affidavit for the application specify which ground the Landlord relies on. However, it was reasonably clear from the submissions made at the hearing (“the doctrine of _res judicata_ states that you can’t go back to matters you should have pleaded”)[^14] that the Landlord was relying on the extended doctrine of _res judicata_.

35     This refers to situations “where the issue ought to have been raised \[in the earlier proceeding\] and was not, \[and\] it might \[therefore\] amount to an abuse of process subsequently to litigate that same issue”: _Goh Nellie_ at \[41\]. The relevant test was set out in _Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 760</span> (“_Andy Lim_”) and there (at \[38\]), the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legal test is a fact sensitive one, depending on all the circumstances of a case, including:

> (a)     whether the later proceedings are nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision;

> (b)     whether there is fresh evidence that warranted re-litigation;

> (c)     whether there are _bona fide_ reasons why an issue which ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and

> (d)     whether there are other special circumstances that justify allowing the case to proceed.

36     Ultimately, there must be “_some connection_ \[…\] between the party seeking to relitigate the issue and the earlier proceeding where that essential issue was litigated, which would make it unjust to allow that party to reopen the issue” \[emphasis in original\] (_Andy Lim_ at \[44\]). As stated in _Ong Han Nam v Borneo Ventures Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 1248</span> at \[71\], “fairness or oppressiveness, as demonstrated by the facts of the case, is the decisive factor.”

38     The majority of these have been in the nature of stay applications. Sometimes, the Tenant made applications for “injunctions” (_eg._ DC/SUM 849/2022) or applications to “set aside” certain suits until specific dates (_eg._ DC/SUM 3869/2021). Though the language was legally incorrect, the misnamed applications were in substance seeking stays of execution or stays of proceedings and a perusal of the minute sheets in those proceedings suggest that they were largely treated as such.

39     I did not find it appropriate to refer to these stay applications (or to findings made in those proceedings) in determining whether the matters raised in SUM 853 were _res judicata_. SUM 853 is a striking out application. The legal tests for striking out are very different from any kind of stay application. The policy underlying these two procedures, and the mischiefs that they address are also entirely different. One is about promoting the fair and economical disposal of a claim, ensuring that undue expense is not incurred to litigate/raise what is otherwise a hopeless claim/defence. The other is, put loosely, about suspending the enforcement of a judgment when there are “special circumstances” such as when there is no reasonable probability of recovering damages/costs if the appeal succeeds: _Strandore Invest A/S and others v Soh Kim Wat_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 174</span> at \[7\] and \[10\]. Clearly, it would defy sense to refer to matters that were raised and decided in _stay_ applications to determine whether the Conditional Sale Claim in this _striking out_ application is _res judicata_. And needless to say, the findings made at hearings for amendments of the Defence (DC/SUM 3498/2021) or hearings for variations of certain orders (DC/SUM 4382/2021) were not relevant for present purposes.

40     There were only two sets of proceedings where some sort of summary determination was sought (either by the Landlord or the Tenant). Those were the ones which I examined in determining whether the Conditional Sale Claim was _res judicata_. One matter was DC/SUM 3103/2021 and the other was DC/SUM 3736/2021.

41     DC/SUM 3103/2021 was the Tenant’s application to set aside a Writ of Distress (in DC/OSS 94/2021). In those proceedings, the Conditional Sale Claim was not raised at all. The Tenant’s only argument was that there was some sort of agreement that he would have “6 months’ timeline \[…\] to pay the arrears”.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) Notably, he was not suggesting that there was any condition attached to the original sale of the Property. He was not suggesting that there was any verbal agreement between him and the Tenant’s father. He was just discussing some sort of payment plan that had allegedly been agreed between him and the Landlord. The Conditional Sale Claim was never raised in those proceedings.

42     I turn then to DC/SUM 3736/2021. That was the Landlord’s application for summary judgment in DC/DC 1662/2021, where the Landlord sued the Tenant for rental arrears and repossession of the property. District Judge Elaine Lim granted summary judgment,[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) and her honour’s decision was upheld by DJ Lee Lit Cheng on appeal.[^17] The Tenant’s Conditional Sale Claim was discussed by DJ Lee in _Loke Wei Sue v Paul Jeyasingham Edwards_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 48</span> at \[23(c)\]:

> 23    The \[Tenant\] sought to rely on the following grounds in his defence:

>> …

>> Third, in the \[Tenant’s\] written submissions filed on 24 January 2022 for the appeal, the \[Tenant\] raised a further argument that he had sold the Property to the \[Landlord’s\] father in or around the year 2013 **on the condition that the \[Tenant\] could continue to reside in the Property for as long as he wanted by paying the \[Landlord\] $3,800 per month, or that he could buy back the Property from the \[Landlord\] at an agreed price.** This new ground of defence was neither pleaded in the Amended Defence nor mentioned in any of the \[Tenant’s\] affidavits. It was also based only on the bare assertion of the \[Tenant\].

> 24    There were no good reasons for me to consider the defences which were not pleaded by the \[Tenant\]. The matters which the \[Tenant\] sought to rely on in his defence were well within his knowledge and could easily have been stated in his Defence or Amended Defence. This was a separate matter from the \[Tenant’s\] intention to apply for interrogatories and to make further amendments to his Amended Defence. Even though the \[Tenant\] was unrepresented and unfamiliar with civil procedure, there were no good reasons why he did not plead the defences which he already knew of.

> (emphasis mine)

43     However, the _merits_ of the Conditional Sale Claim were not seriously adjudicated. The entire basis of DJ Lee’s decision was the Tenant’s failure to plead the Conditional Sale Claim in DC/DC 1662/2021. This was a decision based entirely on procedural reasons rather than on any substantive determination of the parties’ rights/liabilities. In that sense, it would be difficult to say that the Conditional Sale Claim had already been properly adjudicated _on the merits_. And if so, I cannot see how the Conditional Sale Claim’s feature in DC/SUM 3736/2021 could form the basis for either cause of action or issue estoppel.

44     The real issue is whether the Conditional Sale Claim _ought_ to have been pleaded in earlier proceedings, on an application of the extended doctrine of _res judicata_ (see \[35\] above). In my view, the Conditional Sale Claim was obviously relevant for both DC/SUM 3103/2021 and DC/SUM 3736/2021 and ought to have been raised at the earliest juncture. If there truly had been a legally binding agreement that the Tenant could stay on the Property indefinitely, that would be a sufficient answer to any writ of distress (DC/OSS 94/2021). And if such a legally binding agreement existed, it should have been raised in defence against any attempts to repossess the property (DC/DC 1662/2021). Given its obvious relevance, it was clear to me that the Conditional Sale Claim ought to have been raised (properly) in earlier proceedings, and given a (proper) opportunity to be adjudicated.

45     It was always open to the Tenant to make the appropriate amendments in say, his Defence in DC/DC 1662/2021, to properly articulate the Conditional Sale Claim. Such amendments could have been made at any stage of the proceedings (subject to leave from court), and the Tenant was obviously no greenhorn in making amendments to his pleadings. Indeed, he had successfully applied for and had been granted leave to amend his defence in DC/SUM 3498/2021. He could even have applied to make the relevant amendments _alongside_ his High Court appeal against DJ Lee’s decision in _Loke Wei Sue v Paul Jeyasingham Edwards_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 48</span>. He was represented by counsel at that time, and would have necessarily been apprised of his legal options. Instead, he withdrew his appeal, opted not to amend his defence in DC/DC 1662/2021, and launched an entirely new suit here in DC 146.

46     I stress that I am aware of Lord Bingham’s caution in _Johnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm)_ \[2002\] 2 AC 1 (“Johnson v Gore Wood”) where he observed (in relation to the extended doctrine of _res judicata_) that (at 31):

> “… I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party**. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.** That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.”

> (emphasis mine)

47     To my mind, the Tenant’s conduct in DC 146 falls within the extended doctrine of _res judicata_ not just because he ought to have raised the Conditional Sale Claim in earlier proceedings. It is because he had _every opportunity_ to raise it earlier. It is because he was _clearly and unequivocally_ informed of the deficiency in his pleadings by DJ Lee in her well-reasoned judgment and yet he chose to do nothing. It is because he was _under proper legal advice_ when he chose not to amend his DC 146Defence (alongside his High Court Appeal) and opted instead to initiate fresh proceedings, hoping to take a second bite of the cherry. And most importantly, it is because he seems to have used DC 146 as a springboard for even more stalling tactics (see DC/SUM 849/2022 and \[48\] – \[49\] below). All these, cumulatively, suggest that there was no good reason why the Conditional Sale Claim was not raised at an earlier stage. And allowing this suit to proceed would be unfair or deeply oppressive for the Landlord – fairness and oppressiveness, of course, being the lynchpin of the extended doctrine of _res judicata_. Accordingly, I strike out the parts of the SOC which concern the Conditional Sale Claim (paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the SOC).

48     Before I conclude, I should pen certain observations about the Tenant’s conduct in all these proceedings (DC/OSS 94/2021, DC/DC 1662/2021, DC 146 and DC/OC 311/2022). In my view, the Tenant’s _modus operandi_ can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     the Tenant would, as he is fully entitled to, oppose the Landlord’s move to repossess the Property or to claim rental arrears (_eg._ DC/SUM 3103/2021 or DC/SUM 3736/2021);

> (b)     The Tenant would file multiple stay applications in any of the aforementioned suits, claiming that the adjacent proceedings ought to be adjudicated first (_eg._ DC/SUM 3720/2021 and DC/SUM 3325/2021);

> (c)     Should the Court rule against the Tenant (as was the case in DC/SUM 3736/2021 and DC/RA 1/2022), the Tenant would appeal against the decision;

> (d)     The Tenant would again, file stay applications pending the resolution of the appeal (_eg._ DC/SUM 511/2022);

> (e)     The Tenant would begin a fresh suit (as was the case in DC 146 and DC/OC 311/20220); and

> (f)     The Tenant would, once more, file stay applications pending the resolution of these fresh suits (_eg._ DC/SUM 849/2022).

49     Let me be clear. Every litigant is entitled to run their case as they deem fit. On their face, the multiple stay applications appear to address presumably valid anxieties about being evicted from the Property/paying rental arrears. And taken individually, these appear to be innocuous and otherwise legitimate applications. But taken together, they are a thicket of interlocutory applications, each having to be tediously litigated, and each representing a frustrating obstacle to the Landlord’s rightful enforcement of a fully valid judgment (in DC/DC 1662/2021). Taken together, these form a lattice of interlocking interlocutory applications, no doubt doubly frustrating since many of the stay applications involve recycled arguments (_eg._ DC/SUM 849/2022 and DC/SUM 495/2022). And all this, of course, seems even more oppressive considering that the Tenant has now begun initiating fresh suits, and using those fresh suits as reasons to pursue stays in prior proceedings (_eg._ DC/SUM 849/2022). He has, in other words, begun manufacturing the reasons to justify stay of execution.

50     Given this, I am further fortified in my reasoning above (see \[47\]) and am convinced that the Tenant’s conduct (whether intentional or not) has been oppressive for the Landlord. The Tenant’s filibuster must end.

## Conclusion

51     Having struck out paragraphs 1 to 6 of the SOC (see \[19\], \[21\], and \[47\]), the rest of the SOC naturally falls. The effect of my judgment, therefore, is to strike out the entirety of the SOC and to dismiss the Tenant’s claim in DC 146. I will hear the parties on costs.
