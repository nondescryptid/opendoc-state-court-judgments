18 July 2019

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

It was about noon on 2nd January 2015 when Ms Valerie Wee came upon a major signalised traffic cross-junction in her car. She wanted to make a discretionary right turn across that junction and cut across the path of oncoming traffic on the other side. Ms Wee did not have the right of way when she executed that move as the lights were not in her favour, and she admits that she was negligent in failing to keep a proper look out for oncoming traffic. As a result, her car collided into the side of an oncoming taxi which had the right of way (the “first collision”). This collision was forceful, and both vehicles suffered serious damage. In particular, the taxi’s steering system and traction were compromised. The collision caused the taxi to veer off towards the other side; ultimately colliding into a pedestrian who was waiting to cross that junction at the traffic island a short distance away (the “second collision”). That distance was estimated by the Defence to be about 13 meters away. The pedestrian later passed on from the injuries suffered.

2       Ms Wee was subsequently charged with causing the death of the pedestrian under the negligent limb of section 304A(b) of the Penal Code. Whilst Ms Wee conceded that she was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout when she made the right turn, she was only prepared to accept responsibility for the first collision. She took the position that there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that she was also responsible for the second collision, and pointed out that the Prosecution had failed to probe what they submitted was an obvious area for inquiry: i.e. the relative culpability of the taxi driver for the fatal outcome. It was submitted that there was reason to believe that the second collision would not have taken place if the taxi driver had driven with more care as he approached the junction, and at a slower speed.[^1] In short, the Defence submitted that it could not be safely concluded that the chain of causation (admittedly started by Ms Wee) had not been broken in this case.[^2] After reviewing all the evidence presented at trial, I disagreed with that contention and found that the factual basis for the Defence was actually absent, and that the Defence argument and interpretation of the law of liability in such cases was also flawed. In my judgment, the evidence clearly showed that Ms Wee’s negligence had contributed significantly and substantially to the fatal outcome – that is the applicable legal test. On that basis, I convicted Ms Wee on the Charge. These are the grounds for my decision.

## CHARGE:

3       The Charge against Ms Wee read as follows:

> _You, Valerie Wee Hui Ling, are charged that you, on 2 January 2015, at about 11.55 am, along Lower Delta Road towards the direction of Delta Road, at the signalised cross-junction between Lower Delta Road and Tiong Bahru Road, Singapore, being the driver of the motor car bearing the license plate no. SGJ7933B, did cause the death of a pedestrian, one Habeeb Mohamed Shaik Alawdin (male/79 years old), by doing a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout for other road users whilst making a right turn from Lower Delta Road onto Tiong Bahru Road, thereby causing the front portion of the said vehicle to collide into the right portion of the motor taxi bearing license plate no. SHB9753X that was travelling across the junction in the opposite direction and had right of way, causing the said taxi to veer towards the left and collide into the said pedestrian who was standing on the pedestrian island along Lower Delta Road, thus causing the said pedestrian to suffer multiple injuries which led to his death, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 304A(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## AGREED BACKGROUND FACTS:

4       Ms Wee was represented by learned Counsel for these proceedings. The parties arrived at a set of agreed background facts (marked as AS1). The location, timing and general orientation of all the parties when the two collisions took place were not in dispute (as recounted in the Introduction earlier). Some of the other undisputed facts are set out below in chronological order:

> a.     Ms Wee’s intended right turn manoeuvre would have involved her cutting across up to three lanes of oncoming traffic on the opposite side.[^3] There was a turning pocket marked out at that junction for vehicles like hers to stop and wait until it was safe for the right turn manoeuvre to be executed.

> b.     When Ms Wee executed her right turn manoeuvre, the green arrow in her favour had not yet come on, and the traffic light signals at the junction remained firmly in favour of the Taxi which was coming from the opposite side.

> c.     Ms Wee accepts that she ought to have kept a proper lookout for oncoming traffic under those circumstances. Her execution of the right turn manoeuvre without having kept a proper lookout led to her moving off and colliding into the front right side fender portion of the oncoming Taxi (“the first collision”). The Taxi was then in the middle lane for its direction of travel.

> d.     The impact of this first collision was forceful and caused “significant” and “severe” damage to both vehicles.[^4] The force from the impact led to both front airbags in Ms Wee’s car being activated, and a sizeable portion of the front of her car ended up being variously crushed and ripped off.[^5] The Taxi suffered crush damage to its front right side fender portion, and its front right lower steering arm broke (that controls the front right wheel).[^6] The front right wheel was punctured, dented and grazed. These were just some of the damage sustained by the two vehicles in the first collision.

> e.     The impact of the first collision also caused both vehicles to become dislodged from their original paths and directions of travel. Ms Wee’s car was deflected to its right and came to a stop a few meters away, whilst the Taxi was deflected to its left (towards the traffic island where the pedestrian was standing). The Taxi’s punctured tyre left a black rubber scuff mark on the road measuring 9.7 meters as it headed towards the traffic island.

> f.     Part of the Taxi then mounted the curb at the traffic island and collided into the pedestrian standing there (“the second collision”), before crashing to a stop with a lamppost just behind the pedestrian.

> g.     The pedestrian (Mr Habeeb Mohamed Shaik Alawdin, aged 79 years old) sustained multiple injuries as a result of the second collision, and succumbed to those injuries two days later.[^7]

## THE CORE DISPUTE

5       Before me, two contested versions emerged as to how the accident came to be. In gist, the Defence claims that Ms Wee drove carefully, stopped to check for oncoming traffic, but had her vision obstructed by tall vehicles waiting to turn on the opposite side, and that the Taxi suddenly came trundling into her from behind those vehicles at an entirely excessive speed when she made the turn in those circumstances. Mr Tan denies that there were any visual obstructions at the junction, claimed that he drove at a normal speed, and that it was Ms Wee who had just come out of the turning pocket to make the right turn without warning. Each version potentially had consequences as to where \[the main\] culpability lay for the fatality in this case. That is a statement which I would return to say more about. For the time being, as regards the two factual versions offered up as to what happened that day, it was necessary to first resolve these three contested points:

> ■    Were there visual obstructions at the junction caused by tall vehicles waiting at the turning pockets opposite from Ms Wee?

> ■    Did Ms Wee stop at the edge of her turning pocket before making the right turn?

> ■    Was the Taxi speeding excessively across the junction just prior to the first collision?

6       It was only after this court had arrived at a finding on the facts as to what actually took place at the junction that day, could this court then move on to resolve the core dispute between the two sides: whether Mr Tan could have – notwithstanding the actions of Ms Wee – avoided colliding into the deceased. That phrasing keeps faith with the Defence Submissions. However, I think it would be more accurate to state that the core dispute being advanced by the Defence was **who had contributed more significantly and more substantially to the fatal outcome.** I now turn to set out the evidence offered up by the two sides, before setting out my findings on how the accident came to be.

## EVIDENTIAL REVIEW & FINDINGS:

7       The Prosecution’s version on the accident rested primarily on the evidence of the Taxi Driver: Mr Tan Kee Chong.

## The Evidence of Mr Tan Kee Chong on What Happened:

8       Mr Tan testified in Mandarin, and the material parts of his testimony were as follows:

> ■     **Background:** Mr Tan was 62 years old at the material time, and he had been working as a taxi driver for 29 years prior to the accident.[^8] His driving experience extended beyond that because he was working as a lorry driver for about 5-6 years before becoming a taxi driver. However, after the accident, he changed work and was now helping his son to clean and service air conditioners.

> ■     **Sequence Leading to the Accident:** Mr Tan explained that he had picked up passengers on that day – a couple with their child – from the Mount Elizabeth area, and was sending them to Universal Studios Sentosa.[^9] When he came towards the junction, he saw that the traffic lights were Red against him, and he drove accordingly towards the stop line at the junction. However, when he was about 5-6 car lengths away from the stop line, the traffic light signal changed to Green in his favour. He then drove forward and estimated his speed to have been “50-60 plus kmph”.[^10] He was then in the middle lane, and there were no vehicles ahead of him (in his same direction of travel). When he passed the stop line, he said he saw “a car coming from the opposite direction and it just wanted to make a right turn”.[^11] That car was in the turning pocket and was moving forward towards the edge of the turning pocket when he saw it.[^12] The car then collided into the front right side of his taxi. That sequence happened “very very fast”.[^13] Upon impact, he felt his “body move to the left side”.[^14] He then applied the brakes but his taxi kept moving towards the traffic island; ultimately colliding into the deceased before finally coming to a stop at the lamppost.[^15] When Mr Tan later tried to exit his taxi, he found that his driver’s door could not open; he eventually had to exit his taxi through the front left passenger door.[^16] Mr Tan said he wanted to render assistance to the deceased, but found that others were already attending to him.

9       Under cross-examination, the following points arose:

> a.      **Prior Driving Record:** Mr Tan readily disclosed that in his entire driving history, he had been involved in about 7-8 other traffic accidents prior to the present case. All involved situations where he was rear-ended by another vehicle.[^17] No injuries arose in any of those incidents though, and he was never suspended from driving.[^18] Mr Tan also readily admitted that he had clocked up two traffic violations (beating a red light in 2005, and stopping at a no stopping zone in 2013 – both were compounded). Mr Tan confirmed that he had no record for speeding. A copy of Mr Tan’s driving record confirming all this was later tendered by the learned DPP and this was admitted and marked as Exhibit P71.[^19] Mr Tan emphatically disagreed with the Defence suggestion that the reason he stopped driving the taxi after the accident was because of his ‘guilty conscience’ for being at fault for the pedestrian being killed.[^20]

> b.      **Speed Just Prior to the First Collision:** Whilst Mr Tan conceded that he did “speed up a bit” when the lights turned Green in his favour as he approached the junction, he maintained that he was travelling at about 50-60 plus kmph when he entered the junction, and that this estimate was based on his years of driving experience. He conceded that he did not look at his speedometer though.[^21] He however disagreed with the Defence suggestion that his speed was close to or exceeding 70 kmph as he entered the junction, and was about 76 kmph at the point of the first collision.[^22] Mr Tan readily conceded that the textbook on the Highway Code stipulates that drivers ‘should reduce their speed when approaching a junction to look out for dangers’.[^23]

> c.      **Details as to When He Noticed Ms Wee’s Car:** Mr Tan clarified that he actually saw Ms Wee’s car at two points: the first was when he was approaching the junction, and the other was when he had entered the junction. He confirmed that he first saw Ms Wee’s car when he was approaching the junction, and that Ms Wee’s car had just entered the turning pocket (he marked it out on the photograph Exhibit P54). He confirmed that Ms Wee’s car was then moving at “a normal speed”, “not very fast” when he first saw it there.[^24] He then looked forward in his direction of travel, and when he had entered the junction, he then saw Ms Wee’s car just coming out from the turning pocket and wanting to make the right turn – this second instance was the sequence which he described earlier in his evidence-in-chief. Mr Tan therefore disagreed with the Defence position that he was not keeping a proper lookout for cars which were intending to turn right across his path at the junction.[^25]

> d.      **Whether There Were Obstructing Vehicles:** Mr Tan reiterated that there no vehicles ahead of him as he approached the junction, and that this included the two turning lanes ahead of him on his right. Mr Tan disagreed with the Defence position that there was ‘a queue of tall and large vehicles, buses and maybe even lorries’, waiting side-by-side in those _two_ turn pockets’ and which caused a visual obstruction at the junction. He maintained this position consistently.[^26]

> e.      **Details as to His Reaction Just Prior to the First Collision:** Mr Tan explained that he did not apply his brakes as he entered the junction because he ‘didn’t expect \[at that point\] that a collision would occur’.[^27] He explained that he did not swerve either because when he saw Ms Wee’s car coming towards him during the second instance, it was “already too late”.[^28] Mr Tan readily agreed to learned Counsel’s hypothetical in cross-examination: that the collision with Ms Wee’s car would not have occurred if he managed to apply the brake or managed to swerve to avoid it.[^29] He however disagreed that he did not manage to do either because he had failed to keep a proper lookout and had been speeding.[^30]

> f.      **Details as to His Reaction Immediately After the First Collision:** Mr Tan disagreed with the Defence position that he did not apply the brakes after the first collision because there were no visible brake marks left on the road by his taxi.[^31] Mr Tan also disagreed with the Defence position that he was speeding, and that was the reason why he was not able to come to a stop in time; Mr Tan also disagreed that the second collision would not have taken place if he were indeed travelling within the speed limit.[^32]

10     An objective review of Mr Tan’s account would show that it was clear, coherent and complete. The testimony covered what happened as he approached the junction, and how the first and second collisions came to be. It also covered the things he had observed and the actions which he took at the various points. The cross-examination by learned Counsel was robust and searching. Despite that, Mr Tan’s account remained entirely consistent, with depth being displayed as coherent details were offered up at the various points; there were also no unexplained gaps left over. Mr Tan’s account appeared credible as a result.

## The Fault in the Defence Criticisms of Mr Tan Kee Chong’s Account:

11     The Defence levelled three criticisms about Mr Tan’s account. All of them related to the material point as to his alleged speed just prior to the first collision. The Defence submitted that Mr Tan’s evidence of his speed at about 50-60 plus kmph was unreliable because (1) this answer was provided when he said he did not check his speedometer, and he was subsequently evasive during cross-examination on the instances when he would check his speedometer[^33]; (2) that it was more likely that he was speeding as he did not have to drive slow to look for passengers as he was already carrying a fare then[^34], and (3) that it was more likely that he was speeding to cross the junction as there were no vehicles ahead of him then[^35].

12     I considered these submissions carefully. The Defence’s implicit position was that Mr Tan was being less than accurate about his speed because he was trying to downplay his culpability for the fatality. I recognised that this was a real possibility, and scrutinised Mr Tan’s testimony for signs that he was indeed acting under such motivations. My review found none. The fact that Mr Tan had stopped driving as a taxi driver after the event was really neither here nor there. The Defence position that he had stopped due to his “guilty conscience” was emphatically refuted by Mr Tan, and that answer was not challenged or probed further by the Defence. Involvement in a fatal traffic accident case can be traumatic even if one were morally blameless. There could also have been other reasons as to why Mr Tan stopped working as a taxi driver. Without more, it was not possible to say that his stopping work as a taxi driver was indicative of something sinister.

13     In fact, after observing Mr Tan as he was questioned, I formed the impression that this witness was instead adopting an open and candid posture with his ready responses. The seemingly comfortable and consistent hold he had over the details as to what happened that day appeared to be born of a recount from a lived event, as opposed to a contrived narrative reasoned out after the event to avoid culpability. Turning to the criticisms levelled by the Defence about Mr Tan’s testimony, I found those arguments to be lacking in substance:

> a.     An objective review of Mr Tan’s evidence in context will show that he was not being evasive in his answers that he did occasionally rely on his speedometer to check on his speed. In fact, Mr Tan readily admitted this during the cross-examination. In context, I actually found this to be a fairly unremarkable admission: i.e. that he would occasionally check his speedometer. What was instead remarkable was the fact that Mr Tan made no attempt to say that he did just prior to the first collision.

> b.     Mr Tan’s position from the onset was that his speed just prior to the first collision was merely an _estimate_, one which he arrived at based on his years’ of driving experience. He maintained that position consistently during his time in the witness box. There was no reason for Mr Tan to adopt such a seemingly tentative position – that his speed was based on an estimate – on such a material point as to his speed if he was indeed trying to downplay his culpability over what happened. If Mr Tan was indeed minded to embellish his testimony, he could have said that his speed just prior to the first collision was based on a check of his speedometer; that would have made his position appear more certain and better grounded, but Mr Tan made no such attempt. It appeared to me that Mr Tan was just content to state it as it was.

> c.     As it turned out, Mr Tan’s answer (i.e. that his speed was about 50-60 plus kmph just prior to the first collision) appeared to be credibly reliable. Under cross-examination, details of his considerable driving experience emerged, with nothing to indicate that he had a bent for speed. Before me was a driver with over 30 years of driving experience, and he had no speeding transgressions whatsoever.[^36] It appeared that Mr Tan’s style of driving had managed to keep him out of trouble with speed limits all that while. Even Mr Tan’s traffic accident history (where he was only ever rear-ended by others) did not appear to indicate a driver with a need for speed; if anything, they indicated the reverse. Whilst I think it would be entirely reaching to conclude that Mr Tan was a safe driver, I think that there was some basis to indicate instead that Mr Tan was an experienced driver, one who was entirely competent at estimating his speed and keeping to the speed limits, and one who had, for an extended period, managed to avoid colliding into anything and anyone.

> d.     Finally, I think that the Defence’s reliance on the other two points really did not advance its Case. The fact that Mr Tan was already carrying a fare did not necessarily mean that he was more likely to have been speeding. The fact that there were no vehicles ahead of him (in his same direction of travel) also did not necessarily indicate that he was more likely to have been speeding. Taken together, these two points also did not necessarily make the Defence contention any more likely. In fact, when one takes into account the objective context in which Mr Tan approached that junction, the submission that he had excessively accelerated to speed across a blind junction becomes distinctly unlikely. The uncontested context was that (1) Mr Tan was already carrying a fare at that time: a couple with their child, and (2) that the traffic lights were actually Red against him as he approached the junction, and had only just turned Green in his favour when he reached about 5-6 car lengths away from the stop line. These two contextual facts were unchallenged by the Defence in cross-examination. This context indicated minimally that Mr Tan was _slowing down_ as he approached the junction, and had _resumed_ his speed to cross the junction only when he got to about 5-6 car lengths away from the stop line – points which were confirmed by Mr Tan himself. The issue is whether a driver like Mr Tan, knowing that he was approaching a major signalised cross-junction like that, and knowing that the lights had only just changed over to his favour, and seeing that Ms Wee’s car had just entered the turning pocket on the other side, would have then risked his life and the lives of his three passengers to excessively accelerate across that traffic junction as claimed by the Defence. When seen in that context, the Defence Case appeared distinctly unlikely in and of itself. It became even more so when one takes into account Mr Tan’s unchallenged driving experience and history.

14     After reviewing the Defence’s criticisms about Mr Tan’s testimony, I did not find them to be persuasive. I found Mr Tan’s testimony to be coherent, and there was no reason before the court to doubt any aspect of it as to what happened that day. Mr Tan could have easily embellished his testimony on his speed estimate, but he did not do so. Mr Tan could have also easily stated that he saw Ms Wee’s car fail to stop at the end of her turning pocket, but he also did not explicitly do so. Mr Tan appeared to me to be a straight forward and matter of fact witness. There was no reliable basis to believe that Mr Tan was speeding, and there was nothing in either his driving history and experience to believe that either. Mr Tan’s claim that there were no visual obstructions at the junction, and that his speed was about 50-60 plus kmph, remained consistent and was entirely coherent and credible within the context.

15     There were two other grounds upon which the Defence sought to raise a reasonable doubt: these were the opposing evidence from Ms Wee herself, and the opinion offered up by her expert. I now turn to deal with them in sequence.

## The Evidence of Ms Wee on What Happened:

16     Ms Wee said that there were “a few cars in front” of her as she approached the junction, and she “followed the car in front” until she came to the right turn pocket. She said that she stopped her car, looked up and saw that the traffic light was Green, and checked for oncoming traffic. She recalls that there were ‘tall vehicles on the _two_ right-turning lanes’ on the opposite side of the road, but that there was no other oncoming traffic in the other lanes ‘as far as her eyes could see’. As such, she thought it was safe to make the right turn. She then slowly “inched forward” but suddenly the Taxi appeared and “was travelling very fast” and it banged into the front of her car. The airbags in her car were deployed as a result of the first collision, and her car ended up being shifted to its right. She later made a Police Report on the accident (Exhibit D3), where she simply stated that the Taxi “suddenly appeared out of nowhere in a fast speed and crashed into my car”.

17     When asked by learned Counsel whether she thought she did anything wrong, Ms Wee said that she concedes that she did “not do a proper lookout at the time when I made the turn” and that if she did, she “would have seen the Taxi coming from the opposite side”. Ms Wee also said that she “ought to have waited for the green arrow to come on” in that situation, and that she accepts responsibility for the first collision as it was due to her “carelessness and poor sense of judgment”.[^37] When asked why she did not accept responsibility for the pedestrian’s death in the second collision, Ms Wee said that it was because ‘the Taxi had been speeding above the speed limit’ for that stretch, and that ‘the second collision would have been completely avoidable if the Taxi had not been speeding’ as it would have been able to stop in time – matters which were confirmed by the calculations of her expert. With that, Ms Wee completed her account as to what happened that day.

### \-   An Unclear Account:

18     An objective review of Ms Wee’s account in evidence-in-chief will find that it was actually incomplete, unclear at certain parts, and contradictory at others.

> ■    Although it was hinted at, Ms Wee actually did not make clear whether the “few cars in front” of her had also made the same right turn before her at the junction. If other cars had actually made that same right turn before her, that would have been at odds with Mr Tan’s account ‘that the lights had just turned in his favour’ and that there were no cars in front of him, and that he saw _only_ Ms Wee’s car entering the turning pocket on the opposite side. This new detail was therefore potentially material in context, and should have been clearly explained if it was indeed part of the Defence’s Case.

> ■    Next, when Ms Wee said that she had “followed the car in front” until she came into the turning pocket, and had stopped her car ‘to check the traffic light signals and to check for oncoming vehicles’ and had actually seen none, it was actually unclear whether she was referring to doing those checks from behind the lead car in front of her in the turning pocket, or that she was referring to having done so only when she had reached the end of the turning pocket herself. This basic point in her account really ought not to have been left hanging like that in evidence-in-chief.

> ■    Next, there appeared to be some coherence issues in Ms Wee’s description of having only “inched forward” when the Taxi came and banged into the front of her car. Firstly, the claim that it was the Taxi which banged into her was plainly at odds with the objective evidence of the damage suffered by the two vehicles. Secondly, it was also not apparent why she could not stop in time if she was indeed just inching forward.

> ■    Lastly, Ms Wee’s concession at the end that she had ‘failed to keep a proper lookout’ because if she did she ‘would have seen the Taxi coming’ appeared to contradict her earlier claim that she had stopped and had actually kept a proper lookout for oncoming traffic but saw that there was none. Either she did keep a proper lookout, or she did not. It was thus unclear exactly what her position was as to what happened at the junction, the actions she took, and what she was prepared to concede responsibility for.

19     Objectively, offering up an account with those gaps in evidence-in-chief is not ideal. They give off the impression that the account was tentative and uncertain: exactly what was not needed given the clear, coherent and complete account from Mr Tan earlier, and which this account was meant to challenge. I recognised that there could have been completely innocent reasons for the state of Ms Wee’s evidence-in-chief appearing like that, but I had to discount them all when cross-examination was completed.

### \-   The Additional Flaws Revealed in Cross-Examination:

20     When cross-examination started, Ms Wee attempted to clarify her evidence. The main points which arose were as follows:

> a.      **A New Detail: That There Was Another Car -** Ms Wee clarified that of all the cars which had been in front of her, only **one** had made the same right turn before her at the junction. She clarified that after that car had moved off from the turning pocket, she had moved forward and had stopped at the edge of the turning pocket to look out for oncoming traffic.[^38] I accepted that this was a clarification, but it was a curiosity why this point was not put forward to Mr Tan earlier, i.e. that he would have seen the other car cutting across his path, and ought to have been put on notice to drive even more carefully into the junction.[^39]

> b.      **A Changing Position of the Visual Obstruction -** Ms Wee clarified that she remembers there were tall vehicles, not merely passenger cars, which were waiting in the opposite turning pocket and which obstructed her view of oncoming traffic in the other two lanes. She clarified that these tall vehicles were in the turning pocket adjacent to the lane which the Taxi later arrived on. As for the other turning pocket (one lane away from the Taxi to its extreme right), she confirmed that she actually “_cannot remember_” whether there were vehicles waiting there to turn.[^40] This plainly contradicted her earlier evidence-in-chief where she stated that she recalls there being tall vehicles in the _two_ turning pockets on the opposite side. It also contradicted the clear position which the Defence had put to Mr Tan earlier.[^41] Ms Wee’s changed position as to the extent and location of the alleged visual obstructions was of concern, because whether there were visual obstructions at all was a fundamental factual dispute in the case. The ability to state clearly, accurately and consistently one’s position on this matter was therefore important, and Ms Wee’s plainly wavering position on the details of this area did not inspire confidence. As it turns out, Ms Wee’s inconsistency in this area actually extended well beyond her position in cross-examination: when she first reported her version of the accident that same day, she made absolutely no mention of any visual obstruction (Police Report Exhibit D3); then 27 days later, this allegation that there was a visual obstruction arose for the first time in her long statement (Exhibit P74), but that first iteration involved only “**_cars_** on both turning pockets”; and by the time of the trial, these “cars” grew to be indistinct “tall vehicles”. The prior absence, subsequent appearance, and later changes in details on this area were all troubling, and raised serious concerns as to the veracity of Ms Wee’s account that there were vehicles there, and that they were causing a visual obstruction.

> c.      **A Doubtfully Extreme Answer on the Extent of Her View of Oncoming Traffic -** When asked to estimate how far into the Taxi’s lane she could see after the obstructions from the tall vehicles, Ms Wee haltingly stated it to be just “one car length”, and for the furthest lane away from her (i.e. the lane to the Taxi’s left), just “1½ car lengths”.[^42] It was evident that Ms Wee was saying that her vision of oncoming traffic in those two lanes was extremely limited. There was good reason to doubt Ms Wee’s testimony here though. This can be seen in the photographs P61 and P62 of the junction. Both of those photographs were taken from the perspective of the lane which Ms Wee was in as she approached the turning pocket. Those photographs show a stationary police car within the “1 or 1½ car lengths” zone of those two oncoming lanes, and a line of obstructing vehicles in the opposite turning pocket. Those photographs also show that even from that position (which was further back and to the left), a driver would have been able to see quite far into those two oncoming lanes – much further than the limited “1 or 1½ car lengths” which Ms Wee would have this court believe. It ought to be beyond serious argument that the vision of oncoming traffic in those two oncoming lanes would improve further when one reaches the _end_ of the turning pocket which curves significantly towards the right. I noted that all this was also evident from Ms Wee’s own experts’ report.[^43] Ms Wee’s answers here raised further concerns as to her reliability as a witness. At best, her estimation skills were suspect. At worst, this was a witness who was disregarding her obligation to fidelity in terms of only accurately stating as evidence what happened that day.

> d.      **A New Account that the Traffic Lights could have been in Her Favour -** When asked to confirm that the Green Arrow in her favour had not come on throughout the period, Ms Wee said in cross-examination that she _‘could not confirm’_.[^44] This was a curious and remarkable shift from her earlier position that she did check the traffic light signals, saw that it was only Green, moved off, and that the first collision took place a split-second later. In that claimed short period between checking and the collision, Ms Wee was now stating that she ‘could not confirm’ whether the traffic lights had changed to her favour. I did not think Ms Wee was simply being pithy in her response. This shift during cross-examination to open the possibility that the Green Arrow had come on appeared to be an attempt to broaden her defence. I did not think this attempt by Ms Wee to open this new area was at all credible though. First, if this were the case, it would have been a material point for the Defence. However, there was no attempt by learned Counsel to rely on this point whatsoever. It was not raised in the final Defence Submissions, and it was also not covered in the cross-examination of Mr Tan, i.e. that he may have beaten the Red light. It bears repeating as well that the unchallenged account from Mr Tan was that the traffic lights had just changed to Green in his favour when he was about 5-6 car lengths from the junction. That fact was even relied upon by learned Counsel in building the Defence Case (that Mr Tan had accelerated and was speeding). Therefore, the clear undisputed position was that the traffic lights had just turned Green in Mr Tan’s favour when he was about 5-6 car lengths away from the junction. At that distance, there was no realistic possibility that they could have changed back to Red so soon after (such that the Green arrow had possibly come on in Ms Wee’s favour). Second, I observed that Ms Wee’s shift to open this possibility in cross-examination was almost opportunistic as she tried to rationalise her answers in her favour. In my judgment, having observed her as she testified, and considering the hitherto uncontested context as regards the traffic lights’ situation, I found no credibility in her attempt to broaden the potential scope for her defence. This again raised concerns over Ms Wee’s reliability as a witness because it betrayed a willingness by her to venture in her evidence.

> e.      **That a Doubtfully Extended Period was Spent Checking for Oncoming Traffic -** When Ms Wee was next asked to estimate the length of time for which she stopped at the turning pocket to check for oncoming traffic, she answered “5 seconds”.[^45] By any measure, in the context of just checking for oncoming traffic and continuously seeing none, 5 seconds is quite a long time. If Ms Wee had indeed stopped at the end of the turning pocket and then spent 5 seconds checking for oncoming traffic before slowly moving off, then it was curious why this was again not part of the Defence Case which was put to Mr Tan earlier, i.e. that he had seen Ms Wee’s car stationary at the end of the turning pocket for that extended period as she was checking for oncoming traffic. I think this could be due to the fact that Ms Wee’s answer here actually sits awkwardly in the undisputed context. In that regard, it bears repeating that Mr Tan’s unchallenged account was that he saw Ms Wee’s car _twice_: once when he was about to enter the junction when it was moving slowly at the start of the turning pocket, and again after refocusing on the front, he next saw it when he was in the junction as it came out of the turning pocket and banged into him. If Ms Wee had indeed stopped at the end of the turning pocket and spent that much time stationary there to check for oncoming traffic, the undisputed context would have meant that the Taxi would have already driven well past her and on to safety. Separately, if Ms Wee had indeed spent that much time looking and checking, then it was also curious why her memory of the visual obstructions on the opposite side remained so uncertain, i.e. that they were just ‘unspecific tall vehicles’. In the end, Ms Wee’s awkward answer here appeared to be a bald attempt by her to portray how carefully she drove on that day. This turned out to be yet another instance of Ms Wee clearly venturing in her evidence, rather than strictly stating accurately what really happened on that day as evidence.

> f.      **Denying the Obvious as to Who Collided into Who -** When Ms Wee was asked about the first collision, she stridently reasserted that it was the Taxi which collided into her.[^46] This was a curious thing since the objective evidence of the damage suffered by both vehicles clearly shows that it was Ms Wee who collided into the right side fender of the Taxi. When these were pointed out to her by the learned DPP, Ms Wee refused to concede the point and obstinately stated that “I cannot tell because I’m not an expert in this”.[^47] That answer was doubly curious because her own expert had already confirmed that it was Ms Wee who had ‘impacted into the Taxi’.[^48] Objectively, it actually does not take an expert to tell: the photographs P7 and P9 show no damage at the front of the Taxi, instead the crush damage starts at its right side fender portion (P11). This clearly shows that the Taxi did not bang into anything, but was instead impacted into by Ms Wee. A few questions later on this same point, Ms Wee then abandoned the untenable position completely and conceded that the Taxi was ahead of her, and that it was her car that collided into the right side fender of the Taxi.[^49] In my judgment, this was another instance of Ms Wee being quite purposive in her interpretation and recount of what happened that day.

> g.      **A Contradicted Account that She Saw the Oncoming Taxi -** When Ms Wee was next asked to confirm when did she first notice the oncoming Taxi, Ms Wee stated that she was not able to estimate where it was, just that it “suddenly came in front” and “a split second later” the first collision took place. As such, there was no time for her to take evasive action.[^50] This was a critical aspect of Ms Wee’s evidence: that she witnessed the Taxi moving very fast. Her testimony on this would have been the only primary evidence before the court that the Taxi was speeding that day. When confronted with her long statement (Exhibit P74) which was recorded from her 27 days after the accident, and asked whether her memory of the events was better then compared to what it was now at trial 2 ½ years later, it took Ms Wee 19 questions to concede that simple point.[^51] In that long statement, Ms Wee confirmed **twice** that she actually _did not notice the taxi approaching at all_ and she _just suddenly felt the impact_.[^52] This stood in stark contrast to her new position at trial that she _saw the taxi before_ the impact, and that is why she could tell that it was moving very fast. When asked to explain the inconsistency in the two recounts, Ms Wee said that both versions were correct as they were based on her memory of the events at those two points in time, i.e. that now after more than 2 ½ years, she remembers “on hindsight” seeing the taxi moving very fast before the first collision took place.[^53] When the learned DPP pressed her to explain what that meant, it became apparent to me from the halting nature in which she responded that Ms Wee was – at best – rationalising in her oral evidence earlier, i.e. that she saw the taxi before the first collision.[^54] The alternative was that Ms Wee was again being less than accurate in painting the picture as to what happened that day.

> h.      **A Vital Concession -** Another instance when Ms Wee displayed how purposive she was in her chosen stance at trial was when she was questioned by the learned DPP on whether there was anything to put Mr Tan on notice that she would have just cut out of the turning pocket to make the right turn. This area was innocuous enough: the learned DPP asking a clear rhetorical question that based on the evidence provided by Mr Tan, i.e. that he first saw her car just as it had entered the turning pocket and was then moving slowly, and with the traffic lights firmly then in his favour, that there was nothing in those circumstances to put him on notice that her car would just cut out and make the right turn. It was a simple point of confirmation, one which could have been easily conceded without consequence, but it took Ms Wee 42 questions and two separate interruptions by her Counsel before she conceded the point.[^55] Another similar display of purposive and unnecessary guardedness as a witness was provided by Ms Wee when the learned DPP next questioned her on whether she agreed that Mr Tan, based on her account as to how she drove, i.e. that she had stopped at the end of the turning pocket, checked for oncoming traffic and saw that there was none, before moving off and that the first collision took place variously either 1-2 seconds later (as in her earlier long statement P74) or a split second later (as in her oral evidence at trial), would not have had sufficient time to react to her car coming out from the turning pocket to make the turn. This took multiple questions as Ms Wee resisted the logic in the questions before she finally conceded the point.[^56] The work undertaken by the learned DPP in these areas paid dividends though when the next material area was probed: when asked whether she agreed that the second collision would not have taken place if the first collision did not take place, Ms Wee agreed without reservation.[^57] I shall return to this important point later in these grounds when I cover the aspect of legal liability in this area.

> i.      **That She had Moved at a Doubtfully Slow Speed -** Finally, when Ms Wee was asked to estimate her speed just prior to the first collision, she answered that it was just “5-10 kmph”, reasoning that it was low because she was ‘just starting to move off from stationary’.[^58] Apart from it being now apparent that Ms Wee was not quite “inching forward” as she claimed earlier, her new slightly faster position of 5-10 kmph was still quite low for a car; roughly equivalent to walking speed if at 5 kmph, and jogging speed if at 10 kmph. This claim sits awkwardly with the objective evidence of the extensive damage sustained by both vehicles. In my judgment, it is simply improbable that a car with the kinetic energy of such low speeds, would have been able to (1) cause so much crush damage to the Taxi (crushing its fender, puncturing its front right tyre, snapping its steering arm, crushing the driver’s door and rendering it inoperable), (2) push the Taxi off from its original path and direction of travel, and (3) have so much of its own front portion variously being crushed and/or being ripped off like that. When Ms Wee was questioned on how improbable her claim was, and that she really ought to have been able to brake in time if she was indeed moving that slowly, Ms Wee instead said that she “could not comment on that”.[^59] This was most unconvincing. In the end, it was apparent to me that Ms Wee’s answer here was yet another instance where she was rationalising her evidence, to portray how carefully and slowly she drove on that day at the junction, rather than strictly stating accurately what she knew/remembers to have actually happened.

### \-   Findings Upon Ms Wee’s Evidence:

21     Ms Wee did not perform well under cross-examination, and there were flaws left over in her account; and all of them related to material areas. Nonetheless, I considered whether there could have been innocuous reasons for her poor performance in court. For that exercise, one will have to first examine what was the substance of the Defence being put forward by her, and it was as follows:

> I.     That when she arrived at the turning pocket, there was another car in front of hers also making the same right turn at the junction.

> II.     That after the lead car had successfully moved off, she went forward and stopped at the end of the turning pocket.

> III.     That she had then spent 5 seconds checking for oncoming traffic. During that time, she observed that her vision into the oncoming traffic lanes was restricted to just 1 and 1 ½ vehicle lengths due to tall vehicles waiting in the opposite turning lane.

> IV.     Seeing that there were no oncoming vehicles in that gap, and that the traffic lights were still Green, Ms Wee then moved off slowly at 5-10 kmph to make the turn. As she did so, the Taxi suddenly appeared, and she saw it coming at a fast speed in front of her, and the first collision took place a split second later. She could not confirm whether the traffic lights had changed over to Green Arrow in her favour in that span of time.

22     That core account is undeniably simple and uncomplicated. If those were indeed the facts, then it was surprising that Ms Wee had so much difficulty offering up those details under cross-examination, and staying consistent and coherent on them. After observing her as she testified – where she was careful, composed and unrushed in her responses – I did not think Ms Wee’s difficulties had anything to do with nerves in the witness box, nor was it due to a misguided zeal to impress. Rather, it was apparent to me that this Accused was presenting a ventured, rationalised, and purposively misleading account, and was simply having difficulties with that curated narrative as she was being caught out on the details.

23     Confirmation of this came when one considers that Ms Wee’s account on the accident had actually been changing over time: from a simple straightforward and uncontested account, it grew to have more and more details being added. For instance, at the scene of the accident that day, the initial Traffic Police Investigator had asked Ms Wee how the accident took place, and her unchallenged response was that she had simply answered that she ‘_was making a right turn when she collided into the taxi which was coming from the opposite side_’.[^60] That simple account, which was remarkably consistent with Mr Tan’s account, remained substantially unchanged when Ms Wee went _on her own accord_ to lodge her official Police Report about the accident several hours later. Ms Wee’s account in her Police Report made no mention of any possible excuse or defence whatsoever. There was nothing about any visual obstructions, nor of there having been another car(s) ahead of her at the turn, nor of her having stopped, nor of her having checked for oncoming traffic, nor of her having moved off slowly, nor of her having seen the Taxi speeding excessively into her. If these were really the case, there was no reason why they were not mentioned. After all, whilst Ms Wee was injured, they were minor bruises and cuts, and there was nothing to indicate that she had suffered any mental deficit or psychological trauma from the incident. Indeed, Ms Wee herself made no such claims. There was therefore nothing to doubt the integrity or accuracy of Ms Wee’s own initial uncontested account which she offered up on her own that day. It was only later when the pedestrian passed on from the injuries suffered that Ms Wee’s account grew to include new details of various excuses and developed a defence. All of the new defence details came to be subsequently added variously in her long statement (Exhibit P74), in her evidence-in-chief, and finally in her cross-examination – details which she did not ultimately stay consistent on anyway. Even her central claim that she actually _saw_ the Taxi moving very fast was also contradicted by her stance in her long statement that she actually _did not even notice_ it before the impact. I found Ms Wee’s credibility was impeached with her unconvincing explanation that her new memory in court was based on “hindsight”. In the end, there were three different recounts from this Accused: the uncontested short version from that day, a new contested version in her long statement, and a final different contested version in her court testimony. In my judgment, this Accused, whose account of the accident had grown and changed like that, was having problems with having a firm grip on her new contested account as it was simply not grounded on fact.

24     It was also troubling that so much of Ms Wee’s core account was only surfacing during cross-examination and being put into issue for the first time. After all, these were all material points in the Defence. They were clearly at odds with Mr Tan’s account, and as such, they really ought to have been raised by the Defence earlier when Mr Tan was being questioned and challenged on his account. That omission, plus the fact that a different case had instead been put forward to Mr Tan, all affected Ms Wee’s credibility and the credibility of her account. Even if one were to disregard the “rule” in _Browne v Dunn_ and just focus on the details of Ms Wee’s final core account, serious concerns remained as to its credibility because the account was objectively doubtful in context for the reasons which I had alluded to earlier.

25     Two final observations need to be made. First, the central factual basis upon which Ms Wee was prepared to concede responsibility for the first collision had itself changed whilst she was in the witness box. This case started with a concession in evidence-in-chief that Ms Wee _did not do a proper lookout for oncoming traffic_.[^61] After cross-examination, the final account from Ms Wee completely contradicts that: she was now claiming that she was cautious, drove slowly, and _had stopped and kept an extended proper lookout_ but saw nothing coming from the opposite side. It was troubling that even this fundamental factual aspect in her account had changed, and it indicated serious credibility issues. Second, if Ms Wee really made the turn in the manner that she claims, then some rather grim culpability implications arise – implications which are entirely unfavourable to the Defence. I will expand on this later, but at this stage, it will suffice to say that it was apparent that Ms Wee had not considered those implications when she chose to offer up that new and final version in cross-examination.

26     In the end, the issue before the court was whether Ms Wee’s account was credible and worthy of reliance. I found that it was not. For all the reasons given earlier, I found Ms Wee’s testimony consisted of a series of curated rationalisations rather than one being grounded on fact. The positions put forth were artificial and were contradicted by the context. I found that Ms Wee was taking on a purposive stance in her testimony as she tried to reinterpret what happened that day. Her court testimony about the accident therefore could not be relied upon. In the circumstances, I found that there was no primary evidence left over before the court to challenge the clear, coherent and complete account offered up by Mr Tan Kee Chong as to how the accident came to be. What remained was instead the secondary evidence from Ms Wee’s Defence Expert, and that is where I turn to next.

## The Defence Expert’s Opinion:

27     The Defence Expert was one Mr Jayson Liaw Leong San (DW1).[^62] He produced an Accident Reconstruction Report (Exhibit D4) which stated its objective as ‘to evaluate the speed of the motor taxi before the first collision, and the probable cause(s) for the first collision’. In gist, Mr Liaw made 4 material conclusions:

> i.     That there was a visual obstruction at the junction;

> ii.     That as a result, the taxi driver ought to have slowed down and kept a proper lookout when approaching the junction;

> iii.     That the fatality was caused by the taxi travelling at an altogether excessive speed which was estimated to be about 76 kmph; and

> iv.     That the accident could also have been avoided if Ms Wee had just waited for the lights to turn Green Arrow in her favour.

The last conclusion at (iv) was self-evident and beyond dispute, and none of the parties had any problems with it. The other three conclusions at (i) to (iii) were all disputed. I now explain why I could not accept the expert’s conclusions on those areas.

### \-   A Flawed Starting Point:

28     Mr Liaw confirmed that his analysis relied upon, amongst others, the account from Ms Wee as to what happened that day. That account was recited at page 6 of his report, and it notably differed from Ms Wee’s final court testimony version: (1) there was no mention that there was a lead car in front of hers which had apparently made the same right turn just before her; and (2) she had claimed that there were tall vehicles in _both_ turning pockets on the opposite side which obstructed her view of oncoming traffic. Those differences reinforced the concerns as regards the reliability of Ms Wee and the veracity of her account since it was plainly wavering with each recount from her. More pertinently for this part, Mr Liaw’s unquestioning acceptance and reliance on Ms Wee’s account was problematic. After all, whether there was (1) a visual obstruction at the junction, (2) whether Ms Wee had stopped at the end of the turning pocket, (3) whether she was only moving at a slow speed, and (4) whether she had even seen the taxi moving at a very fast speed towards her, were all points of factual dispute, and there was really no good reason for Mr Liaw to start his analysis on such a partisan footing by only adopting Ms Wee’s version. If Mr Liaw really wanted to reconstruct what happened, then he ought not to have closed his mind to the other possibilities as to how Ms Wee actually drove that day. Mr Liaw should have instead only used the objective evidence from the scene and the undisputed facts to form his analysis.

29     In the circumstances, given that Ms Wee’s account was found to be discredited and unworthy of reliance, I therefore could not accept Mr Liaw’s corresponding mirrored conclusion that there was a visual obstruction at the junction that day. Mr Liaw really had no basis for offering that to the court as his _expert factual_ conclusion, much less to do so by just uncritically parroting Ms Wee’s version. The integrity of Mr Liaw’s next connected conclusion was also impugned as a result as it relied on the first for its basis.

### \-   A Flawed Analysis:

30     I now turn to the third conclusion made by Mr Liaw, i.e. that the fatality was caused by the Taxi speeding at about 76 kmph. Mr Liaw arrived at this figure by working backwards. He attempted to explain his analysis at paragraphs 10.1 to 10.8, and at Annexes 4 & 5 of his report. Mr Liaw’s description of his analysis was not entirely coherent. What follows is a summary:

> a.     Looking at the photos, Mr Liaw estimated that the Taxi’s crush depth caused by the lamppost was about 1 foot or 30.5 cm, i.e. that the lamppost had intruded that depth into the taxi. Using the Craig’s Rule of Thumb Equation for Maximum Crush Technique, he then calculated that the Taxi’s speed was about 16.87 kmph when it hit the lamppost. Mr Liaw could not however confirm whether the Craig’s Rule of Thumb Equation, developed decades ago, was still an appropriate measure since the construction of cars had materially changed in more recent times to deliberately include front crumple zones.

> b.     Next, Mr Liaw estimated the first collision’s point of impact. He did so by assuming that both vehicles were in the middle of their respective lanes when the first collision took place. From that estimated point of impact, Mr Liaw then estimated that the Taxi had travelled about 13.9 meters to the lamppost.[^63] He also estimated that the deceased was standing about 13 meters away from the first collision’s point of impact. Using another equation for Linear Motion, which was designed for deceleration scenarios, Mr Liaw then estimated that the Taxi’s speed immediately after the first collision at the start of that 13.9-meter distance was about 52.53 kmph. Mr Liaw could not however explain the logic behind this equation and whether it took into account the Taxi’s severely impaired traction and ability to stop due to one of its front wheels being punctured in the first collision. Even if the 52.53 kmph estimate was taken to be accurate, then it was puzzling how the Taxi could have been expected to come to a stop in 13 meters when the widely accepted Total Braking Distance (“TBD”) calculation for an emergency stop situation in a fully functional vehicle was actually _more than_ 35 meters.[^64]

> c.     Nonetheless, using the uppermost range of Ms Wee’s self-declared speed, i.e. 10 kmph, Mr Liaw then estimated that the Taxi would have lost about 20% to 30% of its speed as a result of the first collision. No scientific basis was however provided to justify how a side-on collision at 10 kmph would translate to a “20% to 30%” speed loss by the Taxi, and it was apparent that this speed loss estimate was purely Mr Liaw’s own guesswork. Nonetheless, with that estimate, Mr Liaw ought to have been able to take the next step to estimate the Taxi’s speed just before the first collision, but Mr Liaw inexplicably did not so estimate. Instead, Mr Liaw chose to skip that and go further back to cater instead for a run-up distance by the Taxi. Mr Liaw estimated the point at which the Taxi Driver was first able to spot Ms Wee’s car at the turning pocket given the assumed visual obstructions at the junction, and found that to be about 16.88 meters away from the first collision’s point of impact. With that estimated run-up distance, Mr Liaw then assumed that the Taxi was still speeding towards the impact point (as that was Ms Wee’s version), and inexplicably used the same Linear Motion Equation – inexplicably because this was now an assumed _acceleration_ scenario. Mr Liaw nonetheless managed to get a result of 75.92 kmph from his calculations, and this was the Taxi’s estimated speed when it passed that first spot of being able to see Ms Wee’s car at the turning pocket. Since the Taxi was assumed to be still accelerating towards the first collision impact point, it was therefore likely to have been travelling at least at 76 kmph just before the first collision.

> d.     On that basis, Mr Liaw then concluded that the fatality was the Taxi’s fault as it had failed to keep a proper lookout for Ms Wee’s car and was travelling at that excessive speed. Mr Liaw reasoned that if the Taxi had instead been travelling at the legal speed limit of 60 kmph, then the Taxi would have only needed between 9.9 m to 12.96 m to come to a complete stop – those distances were arrived at using an unidentified equation set out at Annex 5 of his report, an equation the logic of which Mr Liaw could not explain, and could not justify as to why it was to be preferred over the TBD calculations which indicated that a much longer stopping distance was required. Mr Liaw also could not explain whether the Taxi’s severely compromised ability to stop (with its front tyre punctured in the first collision) had been taken into account in that equation, or whether the fact of the Taxi hitting the curb at the traffic island had any effect on its stopping ability. Nonetheless, on the basis of his equation’s result, Mr Liaw pointed out that Taxi could have stopped about 40 centimetres short of the deceased. Mr Liaw said that the 40 centimetre safety margin would grow if the Taxi was travelling at an even slower speed. Mr Liaw therefore concluded that the second collision was avoidable but for the fact that the Taxi had been speeding above the legal speed limit.

31     The flaws and weaknesses in that analysis ought to be plain to see. It involved baseless assumptions, questionable estimations, leaps in logic, and incomprehensible calculations. During cross-examination, the entire analysis was systematically dismantled by the learned DPP. The Notes of Evidence capture that exercise in detail, and I do not propose to refer to Mr Liaw any further than is necessary. In the end, it was evident that:

> ■    Mr Liaw could not justify the start-state assumptions which he simply adopted from Ms Wee as to what happened at the junction that day;

> ■    Mr Liaw could not explain the rationale for the inexplicable analysis steps which he took at part c. above; and

> ■    Mr Liaw could not even understand nor explain the logic behind the various equations which he used, and why his calculations from those equations were preferable to and more reliable than the widely accepted emergency TBD calculations.

All this raised serious concerns over the integrity, objectivity, and reliability of Mr Liaw’s ultimate conclusion that the second collision was avoidable, and that the fatality happened only because Mr Tan had been above the speed limit. It mattered little that the Prosecution’s own expert had offered little meaningful objection to Mr Liaw’s analysis – that was more a reflection of him than anything else.

## Could the Taxi Stop in Time?

32     The exercise of reviewing Mr Liaw’s analysis was not a total loss though. His estimations of the distances at the scene, and his confirmation of the emergency TBD scale was useful. These points were useful to resolving the basic point which the Defence was pursuing: that the taxi could have stopped in time to avoid the second collision if it was travelling within the speed limit before the first collision. That submission can be tested.

33     Mr Liaw estimated that the deceased was standing about 13 meters away from the first collision’s point of impact. That estimate was consistent with the measurements from the scene. That estimation fairly assumed that both the taxi and Ms Wee’s car were in the middle of their respective lanes when the first collision took place. The first collision’s point of impact was thus established. The area of the traffic island before the lamppost was not big, and the estimated position of the deceased within that area also appeared to have been fairly estimated. As a result, the distance between those two points was found by Mr Liaw to have been about 13 meters. The Prosecution offered nothing to contest that estimate. I recognised that it was nonetheless an estimate, and that depending on the actual positions of the two vehicles in their respective lanes, and the deceased on the traffic island, that distance could have been a little more or a little less. Even if one were to adopt a generous 3-meter margin of error (generously favourable to the Defence), the maximum distance between the first and second collisions would only have been about 16 meters.

34      **The issue then is whether a driver travelling within the speed limit of 60 kmph, and who had been collided into, and whose vehicle had now been severely compromised in terms of its traction and steering ability, could have brought his vehicle to a stop in that 13-16 meter distance to avoid colliding into the deceased.** This was the crucial finding which this court had to make.

35     This was obviously an emergency braking situation since Ms Wee was cutting into the Taxi’s path. In a normal situation, a driver travelling at 60 kmph would need _a clear and uninterrupted stretch of_ **_45.27 meters_** _as the TBD_ to safely come to an emergency stop. That figure is widely accepted, and even Mr Liaw himself had stated it to be so.[^65] In this case, the Taxi Driver only had 13-16 meters to avoid colliding into the deceased – that was about _a quarter_ of the TBD required. Even if one were to move the Taxi Driver further back from the first collision impact point, and submit that the Taxi Driver ought to have taken steps to come to an emergency stop from that earlier point, the conclusion remained the same. The _earliest_ which the Defence submitted that the Taxi Driver could have embarked on his emergency stop was 16.88 meters away from the first collision impact point (that was as estimated by Mr Liaw). Even if one were to add that distance into the buffer for the Defence (i.e. 16.88 m + 16 m = 32.88 m), there was still a shortfall of about 12.39 meters (45.27 m – 32.88 m). When seen in this light, there were serious doubts that it was at all possible for the Taxi Driver to have stopped in time to avoid colliding into the deceased even if the Taxi was within the speed limit of 60 kmph. This was not the only basis to doubt the Defence’s submission.

36     The other area of concern was this: if a driver needs a clear and uninterrupted stretch of 45.27 meters to safely come to an emergency stop from 60 kmph, then what would that distance be if there was an _interruption_? In this case, there were actually two interruptions. The first interruption was Ms Wee’s side on collision into the Taxi. The most favourable case scenario for the Defence was for this court to find that the Taxi Driver ought to have embarked on his emergency stop from 16.88 meters away from the first collision impact point. If one assumes that the Taxi Driver had so embarked, then what was the effect of Ms Wee coming along to interrupt his efforts to stop by puncturing his front tyre, snapping his steering arm, and violently jolting him out of his direction of travel? In other words, would Ms Wee’s interruption of the Taxi Driver’s emergency stop in that manner increase or decrease the TBD as a result? In my judgment, it ought to be beyond serious argument that the TBD would be increased considerably as a result of Ms Wee’s interruption. The objective evidence of the physical damage suffered by the two vehicles shows that her side on collision was forceful. The Taxi Driver also testified that the force from her collision had caused his ‘whole body to be shifted to the left’ – testimony which was unchallenged by the Defence. This violent interruption by Ms Wee was undoubtedly shocking and would impair the Taxi Driver’s ability to regain control of his vehicle, and thus increase the TBD as a result. Also, Ms Wee’s interruption in puncturing the Taxi’s front tyre would severely compromise its traction and thus also considerably increase the distance which the hobbled Taxi would need to come to a stop. These were all Ms Wee’s doing, i.e. that Ms Wee had not only caused the Taxi to veer towards the deceased, she had also impaired its ability to stop as it went in that direction. The only possible counterbalancing argument which the Defence could raise was that Ms Wee’s interruption had slowed the Taxi down. In that regard, the Defence relied upon the bald guesstimate by Mr Liaw, and there were grounds to be concerned as to whether that 20% to 30% speed loss estimate was at all reliable. This was after all a side on collision, and not a head on collision. Even if one were to accept the most optimistic guesstimate that the Taxi had indeed lost 30% of its 60 kmph speed from that side on collision, that would mean that its speed after the first collision would have been 42 kmph.[^66] At such a speed, a fully functional vehicle with a normal driver who was facing none of the issues caused by Ms Wee, would need a TBD of _more than 20 meters_ to come to a stop – 7 meters more than was available to the deceased at the scene.[^67] That distance grows when one considers that the Taxi and its driver had both been hobbled by Ms Wee. I therefore did not think the speed loss, if any, which Ms Wee contributed through her interruption had materially changed the conclusion that it was not at all possible for the Taxi to have stopped in time to avoid colliding into the deceased even if it was travelling within the speed limit. In fact, the evidence here showed the reverse, i.e. that Ms Wee had made the second collision all the more likely and had sealed the deceased’s fate by her interruption.

37     The second interruption came in the form of the traffic island curb. The objective evidence from the scene shows that the Taxi had hit the curb before hitting the deceased. Any impact with an object that size would cause the Taxi to bounce up and disrupt its traction. Indeed, the evidence before the court (from the photos and damage reports) was that the Taxi’s front left tyre was dented as a result of that impact with the curb and its tyre had also lost effective pressure. There was no evidence before the court to safely estimate what degree of speed loss, if any, would occur with such an impact into the curb. In my judgment, I think this second interruption would have further increased the Taxi’s TBD, but not anywhere near to the same extent as that caused by Ms Wee’s interruption.

38     Given these two interruptions, one originating from Ms Wee and the other from the scene, I found there was more than enough to conclude that there was no basis to accept the Defence submission, and that the defence put forth was really no defence at all. After all, even if one were to accept Ms Wee’s version as to what happened at the junction that day (i.e. that there was a visual obstruction at the junction, and that she had stopped at the end of the turning pocket before making the turn), the objective evidence before the court was sufficient to conclude that it was actually impossible for the Taxi Driver to have stopped in time to avoid colliding into the deceased who was just a short distance away, this was so even if the Taxi Driver was travelling within the speed limit of 60 kmph. In fact, both interruptions – especially the one caused by Ms Wee – made the second collision a certainty.

## SUMMARY OF FACTUAL FINDINGS & GUILT:

39     In summary, after reviewing all the evidence, my findings on the contested issues are set out below. These findings must be read in the context of the agreed background facts which I had set out earlier.

> a.     I found Ms Wee was not a credible witness, and that her final (new) account offered up in court as to how she drove, and what she observed at the junction could not be relied upon. I also found her expert witness to be inadequate, and his conclusions to be entirely questionable and suspect.

> b.     I found Mr Tan was a credible and reliable witness of truth. I accepted his account that there were no cars ahead of him as he approached the junction, and that there were no visual obstructions at the junction. Further, that he was slowing down as he approached the junction, but had resumed speed to about 50-60 plus kmph after the traffic lights turned Green in his favour when he was about 5-6 car lengths from the stop line. I accepted that Mr Tan saw Ms Wee’s car just entering the turning pocket as he approached the junction, and that he saw it moving at a normal speed at that point. After refocussing on the front, he next saw Ms Wee’s car when he was already in the junction just as it came out of the turning pocket before colliding into him. I found that Mr Tan had the right of way throughout, and that Ms Wee ought to have stopped to give way as a result.

> c.     I rejected Ms Wee’s new and changing account of the supposed visual obstructions at the junction, and found that there was actually nothing which obscured her view of the oncoming Taxi if she had only bothered to keep a proper lookout. I found that Ms Wee had negligently failed to keep a proper lookout for oncoming traffic as she made the right turn. I digress to make the following observation: the finding here was the kindest possible. There was no evidential basis before the court to pitch her culpability any higher, e.g. (1) that Ms Wee had rashly risked the move when she made the wholly unsafe decision to cross even though she only had an extremely limited “1 or 1½ car lengths” view of oncoming traffic, or (2) that she had actually seen the Taxi coming but nonetheless still made the rash and ill-fated decision to cross. I had rejected the evidence in the former, and there was no evidence before me to support the latter. The case therefore took on the mildest possible complexion: that Ms Wee could have seen, but had negligently failed to keep a proper lookout. To some, this finding may come across as being incomprehensible. After all, the circumstances were so clear that any motorist making a discretionary right turn at a signalised cross junction must keep a proper lookout. That struggle to comprehend how a motorist can fail so abjectly must be tempered though against the temptation to speculate that there was something more. Before me, there was only Ms Wee’s admission that she had simply failed to keep a proper lookout. The investigations provided no basis to go beyond that. All this had implications on sentencing.

> d.     Finally, I found that the first collision was caused by Ms Wee’s negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout when she made the right turn and collided into the right side fender of the oncoming Taxi. I found that the first collision was forceful and it made Mr Tan’s taxi veer off towards its left in the direction of the deceased who was just 13-16 meters away. I found that it was objectively impossible for Mr Tan to have stopped his vehicle in time given that short distance, and given the collision and damage caused by Ms Wee to his vehicle. I found that Ms Wee’s actions in colliding into the Taxi had contributed significantly and substantially to the fatal outcome. As a result, I found that the chain of causation started by Ms Wee had extended unbroken to include the fatality in this case.

40     These findings resolved the main contested issues save for one: whether Ms Wee had stopped her vehicle at the end of the turning pocket. In the final analysis, an outright finding on this was actually not required. It was possible that she could have slowed down or even stopped momentarily, before resuming speed to crash into the Taxi, or she could have just driven through without having done either. The former scenarios were distinctly unlikely given the time and space considerations, and the latter was much more probable to have been the case. It was not something which required a definitive finding though. The essential findings were instead that she had driven at speed to crash into the Taxi and that she made the turn without keeping a proper lookout.

41     Having resolved the contested factual matters, the next step was to consider whether, based on those factual findings, Ms Wee was guilty of the Charge of having caused the death of the deceased through her negligence. In my judgment, the answer was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms Wee’s negligence had contributed significantly and substantially to the fatal outcome in this case. The first collision was clearly caused by Ms Wee, and that set in motion the series of events which led to the second collision – a collision which Mr Tan could have done nothing to avoid. In fact, Ms Wee’s actions in hobbling car and driver, and sending both in the direction of the deceased, sealed the latter’s fate. I reiterate my findings on the evidence: that the chain of causation started by Ms Wee had clearly extended unbroken to include the fatal outcome. On that basis, I found Ms Wee guilty on the Charge and convicted her thereon.

42     In arriving at that finding of guilt, I did so based on the law of causation as set out in the case of _Ng Keng Yong v PP and another appeal_ \[2004\]4 SLR(R) 89 at \[66\]. The parties were agreed that this remained the binding authority on when legal liability attaches when the test of causation in the criminal negligence context is fulfilled, i.e. that guilt attaches to those whose negligence had contributed significantly or substantially, and not merely peripherally, to the fatal outcome. Even though the present case turned primarily on my findings of fact, I propose to go one step further.

## LEGAL LIABILITY

43     The point being addressed in this next section is related to my earlier statement about finding where the main culpability lay for the fatality in this case. Assuming for the moment that all my findings of fact were wrong, and that we ought to have disregarded the coherence issues and just accepted the Defence Case at its highest, there was still reason to believe that Ms Wee would nonetheless still be guilty under the Charge. To establish this point, a brief review of the case authority would be required.

44     The case of _Ng Keng Yong & Anor_ involved the tragic collision between the _RSS Courageous_ and a merchant vessel _ANL_, and which led to the death of 4 RSN personnel. The court there had to review the actions of the two appellants who were navigating the _Courageous_, and their argument that the chain of causation had been broken by the negligent subsequent actions of the _ANL_ crew. On the facts, the court found that the _ANL_ crew were indeed negligent in their response to the hazardous approach of the _Courageous_, and that this had contributed to the fatal collision. The court even “_accepted the appellants’ point that the vessels would not have collided if the ANL had not been negligent_”.[^68] Faced with the negligent actions of the two parties, the court had to determine the ‘extent to which each had contributed to the deaths’, and ultimately ‘direct its mind as to whether the negligence of the appellants still contributed significantly or substantially to the result’.[^69] The court “_emphasised that the appellants were the ones who created the situation of danger to begin with_”, and that their ‘negligence clearly remained a substantial cause of the collision’.[^70] The court then cited with approval the following passage from Lord Pearce in _The “Miraflores” and the “Abadesa”_ \[1967\]1 Lloyd’s Rep 191 at 200 (_sub nom Miraflores (Owners) v George Livanos (Owners)_ \[1967\]1 AC 826 at 847-848):

> _“… It is axiomatic that a person who embarks on a deliberate act of negligence should, in general, bear a greater degree of fault than one who fails to cope adequately with the resulting crisis which is thus thrust upon him ... For all humans can refrain from deliberately breaking well-known safety rules; but ‘tis not in mortals to command \[in others\] the perfect reaction to a crisis …”_

45     The court then found that “_the ANL crew were forced to react in response to a risk of collision created by the appellants’ own negligent actions_”, and the court “_could not see how the appellants could seriously argue that their negligence had not contributed significantly to the collision and the consequent deaths of the four servicewomen_”.[^71] Their appeals against the convictions were thus dismissed.

46     In summary, the authority _Ng Keng Yong and Anor_ makes clear the following: in the context of a case involving a charge of causing death by a negligent act, and where the court is faced with a sequence of negligent actions by a number of actors who have all contributed to the fatality, criminal liability attaches to those who contributed significantly or substantially, and not merely peripherally, to that result.[^72] Additionally, the originator whose negligence created that hazard does not automatically become relieved of liability by the contributing negligence of another if the originator’s actions remain a significant or substantial cause for that fatality.

47     I would go further to make this observation: based on the test of causation, it is theoretically possible for more than one party to be found to have contributed significantly or substantially to a fatal outcome. Having reviewed the authority, I do not think it stands at all for the proposition that there can only ever be one party who contributed significantly or substantially to a fatal outcome, _and_ that the contributions of all others will accordingly by default become trivial or peripheral as a result. The test properties (i.e. of being “significant or substantial”) do not necessarily evoke mathematical imagery or precision, and the authority itself makes no such attempt in that direction. I think it would in fact be misleading to view life events that way: i.e. as if they were somehow all reducible to a mathematical formula, where (1) all the contributing factors up to that point can be neatly identified; (2) that each factor can be assigned an accurate and distinct contributing percentage; (3) that they all aggregated to a neat whole; and (4) that you can then take to task only those which have crossed a certain threshold percentage contribution, or was the largest in proportion when compared to the rest. Life isn’t quite like that (yet); and a degree of judgment is still required to find where the blame lies. What the authority makes clear instead is that blameworthiness lies with all those whose negligent actions had contributed significantly or substantially to that outcome. This same observation and interpretation of the test of causation was made in the case of _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 94</span>_._[^73] The obvious proviso is that there first needs to be a Charge.

48     Returning to the present case, the only Charge before the court was against Ms Wee. Regardless of whether Mr Tan was also negligent, if one were to focus on Ms Wee’s actions and objectively apply the legal test to the best Defence Case possible, coupled with the clear objective evidence as to the damage caused to the Taxi, the outcome was clear.[^74] To begin with, it was Ms Wee’s negligence which had created the situation of danger. It was therefore not in her mouth to command that Mr Tan should also be prosecuted / should be prosecuted instead for his less than perfect reaction to the crisis which she thrust upon him. The focus is on her actions, and her actions of having created this hazard in the first place; for that, she bears the greater degree of fault. The simple fact of the matter was that the second collision would not have taken place if the first collision did not take place. This was something which Ms Wee herself conceded. Ms Wee’s collision into the Taxi through her negligence therefore remained a significant and substantial cause for the fatal outcome. There was no basis to think that there was any doubt whatsoever that Ms Wee remained guilty for what happened. If anything were to be affected, it would only be sentence, but not liability.

49     In the next part, I move to the issue of sentence. To be clear though, sentencing was done based on the findings of fact which I had set out at paragraphs 39 to 41 earlier, and not on the basis of the discredited Defence Case. Nothing in paragraphs 43 to 48 should be taken as support that I found Mr Tan was negligent as well; I did no such thing.

## SENTENCE:

50     The offence of causing death by a negligent act under section 304A(b) of the Penal Code is punishable with an imprisonment term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.

### Antecedents:

51     After Ms Wee was found guilty and convicted on the Charge, the Prosecution cited her antecedents; which were all admitted to. Ms Wee had a less than stellar driving record. In the 8 years prior to the present fatal traffic accident case, she was caught running two red lights, and was also caught speeding. In the broad spectrum of offences, I considered that these were all fairly serious traffic violations, with the last offence (speeding) taking place just a few months before the present case. These were hardly trifling infractions, and they indicated a troubling record on her part in complying with rules meant to keep all road users safe. The details of her three antecedents were as follows:

### The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence:

52     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 years of disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles. The Prosecution highlighted the absence of remorse, and the high culpability displayed. In that regard, the Prosecution submitted that Ms Wee’s failure to keep a proper lookout was particularly grievous because the circumstances obviously required her to have done so, and that there was nothing which prevented her from doing so before she executed the right turn at that junction. The Prosecution highlighted that this was a major traffic intersection, where Ms Wee was attempting to cut across three lanes of oncoming traffic when she did not have the right of way. Ms Wee’s failure to keep a proper lookout in such circumstances therefore also amounted to a breach of rule 11(k)(iii) of the Road Traffic (Traffic Signs) Rules (R.33, 1999 Ed), which obligates motorists in Ms Wee’s position to give “due regard to the safety of other users of the road and precedence to … oncoming traffic”. The Prosecution submitted that Ms Wee had displayed “a wanton disregard for other road users” in having made the right turn under those circumstances without having kept a proper lookout.[^75] After taking into account precedents in _PP v Hue An Li_ \[2014\]4 SLR 661, and _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP_ \[2016\]3 SLR 1079, the Prosecution submitted that at least 6 weeks imprisonment ought to be imposed in this case since Ms Wee did not plead guilty and was being convicted after having her defence rejected at trial.

### The Defence’s Plea in Mitigation:

53     The Defence did not contest the DQ order sought but submitted that a non-custodial sentence was justified in this case. Learned Counsel recounted Ms Wee’s personal circumstances: she was 44 years old, married and had two children from that marriage – one child (16 years old) was Autistic and had special needs. Ms Wee was the primary caregiver for the children, and was also supporting two elderly parents, two elderly parents-in-law, and a single older sister who had a chronic mental illness. The family was dependent on her, and would suffer from any separation arising from an imprisonment term; particularly the child with special needs. Ms Wee was working at the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") of Singapore as the Deputy Director of the Service Management and Industry Development Office, and was member of good standing with the Singapore Pharmacy Board, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore. Various testimonials were also attached to attest to Ms Wee’s positive contributions to society in terms of her public health and safety work as a community pharmacist, and as a public service officer at the HSA.[^76] Additionally, Ms Wee was also actively contributing to society as a volunteer with several initiatives and organisations.[^77]

#### \-   Low Degree of Culpability

54     Learned Counsel then submitted that a non-custodial sentence was justified because of the “relatively low degree of culpability” of Ms Wee, submitting that Mr Tan’s actions had intervened to reduce her moral culpability.[^78] Learned Counsel submitted that Mr Tan was “clearly negligent in not keeping a proper lookout going straight on an allegedly clear road when the accused’s car was turning slowly, and this must substantively reduce Ms Wee’s culpability”.[^79] Further, that “were it not for the fact that \[the taxi-driver\] was speeding and/or not keeping a proper lookout at the material time, Ms Wee would have had more time to react and may have been able to take evasive action, despite not having kept a proper lookout herself”.[^80] Pursuing a point made earlier at trial, Learned Counsel continued that the Prosecution had failed to investigate, and thus failed to prove, that the second collision would still have taken place even if the taxi was travelling within the speed limit.[^81] It was emphasised that the “second collision may not have happened if the Taxi was travelling within the speed limit”.[^82] Learned Counsel submitted that there was ‘a possibility that the Taxi was speeding, and that the Taxi-driver’s driving had thereby significantly increased the likelihood of the accident’.[^83] Learned Counsel then cited the case of _PP v Maung Ye Lin Aung_ \[2012\] SGDCC 391 in support of the submission that the degree of negligence in this case was not high. In that case, the offender had made a right turn across an intersection even though his view was partially blocked; colliding into an oncoming vehicle which had the right of way. The court there found that it was ‘more an error of judgment in failing to keep a proper lookout and to ensure that it was safe to proceed across the intersection when his vision was partially blocked by the bus that was waiting in the turning lane on the opposite side’. In those circumstances, the court there concluded that ‘the degree of negligence was not high but moderate’. Though that case was pre _PP v Hue An Li_, learned Counsel submitted that the reasoning was still sound and that it offered guidance for the present case. Learned Counsel submitted that Ms Wee had “taken the precaution of stopping at the cross-junction and had waited at the right turn pocket for the lights to turn in her favour. It was only a momentary lapse of judgment on the part of Ms Wee that she therefore made the right turn, causing the collision with Tan’s taxi”.[^84] Learned Counsel said Ms Wee had “tried to keep a proper lookout (although failing in the end) and had turned slowly”.[^85]

55     Learned Counsel then cited two cases where fines were imposed for similar offences: _PP v Ng Chye Joo_ (unreported) and _PP v Indira Malinda_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 37</span>, and urged this court to do the same. It was explained that whilst Ms Wee had good grounds for claiming trial, she was nonetheless “extremely regretful” that an accident took place, and that given her circumstances, there was no need for a deterrent custodial sentence to be imposed.

### Reasons for Sentence:

56     I turn first to address the point about Ms Wee’s degree of culpability. Learned Counsel’s submissions on this aspect could not be accepted because they were based upon wholly discredited claims. To reiterate, the factual findings as to what actually happened are set out in paragraphs 39 to 41. Turning right at a signalised cross junction clearly involves heightened danger when the lights are not in one’s favour. Ms Wee clearly ought to have kept a proper lookout for oncoming traffic, and in my judgment, her negligence in failing to do so was grievous. The accident and the fatality were avoidable. The evidential findings clearly show that Ms Wee could have seen the Taxi if she had only bothered to keep a proper lookout. At best, Ms Wee showed an utter failure to consider the safety and rights of others, and an utter failure to comply with the clear traffic obligations. The custodial threshold was clearly crossed in this case since Ms Wee’s culpability was not anywhere near as minimal as that portrayed. This was consistent with the binding authorities in this area as highlighted by the learned DPP, authorities which were all on point, as opposed to those cited by the Defence.

57     Turning next to Ms Wee’s personal circumstances, there was nothing there which could justify a departure from the usual sentencing approach. Whilst I sympathised with the plight which her family and children would face with her incarceration, these hardships were not so exceptional as to outweigh the clear public interest to be served in protecting the road safety for all through an appropriately robust penal framework. It was also apparent that Ms Wee had gained no insight on her fault, and there was nothing to give credit for in that regard either. This was a conviction arrived at after trial, and I determined that the sentence ought to reflect that.

58     I also considered Ms Wee’s antecedents to be relevant. Ms Wee was not a first offender, and given her poor road safety record and compliance with the rules, a custodial term was entirely appropriate given the continuing escalation. I would have imposed the sentence sought by the Prosecution, but for the fact that it had relied in part on a finding that Ms Wee’s actions were essentially rash. I had explained at paragraph 39 why that was rejected. In the circumstances, it was right to temper it down. All considered, I determined that a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment was justified and so imposed. I also ordered a term of disqualification for 5 years from all classes upon her release from prison. These have been stayed, and Ms Wee is currently on bail pending her appeal.

[^1]: Before me, the Defence explicitly took the position that they were not taking issue with the manner in which Mr Tan steered his taxi after the first collision. The Defence confirmed that they were “primarily focused on \[Mr Tan’s\] actions **prior: ** to the first collision”, i.e. in whether he kept a proper look out, and drove at an appropriate speed – NE 29 August 2017, page 75.

[^2]: See paragraph 4 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions, where the main “Issues in Dispute” were set out.

[^36]: Mr Tan had a traffic violation in 2005 for beating a red light (which was ultimately compounded). Though this was not the subject matter of the Defence’s Submissions, I shall set out my thoughts on it here in the footnotes for completeness. In short, this traffic violation does not necessarily indicate that Mr Tan was speeding. One can clock up such a violation while travelling well within the speed limits, or even at slow speeds. These violations, by definition, just indicate a failure to conform to the traffic light signal. This point appeared to be beyond serious argument as well when learned Counsel made no attempt to question Mr Tan further on this.

If one were to take a ruler to this sketch plan and approximate the position which Ms Wee says she stopped at (i.e. at the end of the turning pocket), it would show that she would have enjoyed at least double the distance into those two lanes than what she claimed to have had in court.

[^60]: The initial TP IO at the scene was one SGT Kevin Koh. His evidence at trial about Ms Wee’s account at the scene was unchallenged by the Defence: NE, 28 August 2017, page 5.

[^62]: Mr Liaw’s Curriculum Vitae was admitted and marked as Exhibit D5.

[^63]: Page 24 of D4.

[^64]: See paragraphs 11.5 and 11.6 of Mr Liaw’s own report at Exhibit D4. The TBD distance for a vehicle travelling **at 50 kmph: ** was **35 meters: **. The TBD would increase beyond that if the vehicle was instead travelling faster at 52.53 kmph.

[^65]: See paragraphs 11.5 and 11.6 of Mr Liaw’s own report at Exhibit D4.

[^66]: At 60 kmph, the Perception Reaction Distance (PRD) would be about 25 meters. This meant that, even on the best case scenario for the Defence, the Taxi would not have had enough time to react to Ms Wee who was just 16.88 meters away. This meant that the Taxi’s speed was likely still to have been 60 kmph just prior to the first collision. The 30% speed loss calculation was therefore based on that speed.

[^67]: See paragraphs 11.5 and 11.6 of Mr Liaw’s own report at Exhibit D4. A driver travelling at 40 kmph would need a TBD of about 20 meters to come to an emergency stop. The TBD increases if the speed was 42 kmph.

[^68]: At \[71\].

[^69]: At \[66\].

[^70]: At \[71\].

[^71]: At \[74\].

[^72]: The qualifier in that test: “_and not merely peripherally_” is technically superfluous. So too are the references to the requirement for “proximity”. For that reason, in the rest of these Grounds, I shall make reference to the test of causation in its concise form.

[^74]: If the Defence Case were taken at its highest, it would obligate drivers to approach a cross junction at such low speeds that it would make a farce of the traffic lights being in their favour. Based on the TBD scale, and an \[admittedly rough\] estimation of the effects from Ms Wee’s interruption, the speed would need to be about 20-30 kmph in order for the second collision have been avoided. Such a standard renders traffic rights and rules moot, and would encourage all manner of adventurism by some on the roads.

[^76]: Testimonials were attached as Annex F to the Plea in Mitigation dated 7th December 2018.

[^77]: Details of Ms Wee’s volunteer work were set out at paragraph 7 of the Plea in Mitigation.

[^82]: Paragraph 33 of the Plea in Mitigation.

[^83]: Paragraph 36 of the Plea in Mitigation. What “accident” was being referred to was left unexplained. This imprecision in language was entirely regrettable because the preamble gave the distinct impression that Ms Wee was now even challenging her liability in causing the first collision. This was especially apparent from paragraph 35 of the Plea in Mitigation, which stated that Ms Wee was not able to take evasive action and react in time because the taxi had suddenly appeared from behind the tall vehicles on the opposite side and was speeding.
