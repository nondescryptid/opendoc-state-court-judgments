### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Lim Leong Sze (“Lim”) put the penis of a young male aged 14 (“V”) into his (Lim’s) mouth. Lim sucked V’s penis. This occurred on 24 September 2005 and constituted an offence of voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature, and was punishable pursuant to (then) section 377 of the Penal Code. The prescribed punishment was imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and the section also provided that the offender “shall also be liable to fine”. At the time of the offence, Lim was 41 years of age, and V, as stated above, was only 14 years of age. The age gap between Lim and V was 27 years.

2       Lim pleaded guilty before me for the offence set out in \[1\]. Lim also admitted and consented to having six other charges being taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing (the “TIC charges” or “TIC charge” when reference is made to any particular charge that was to be taken into consideration). Five of these six TIC charges were for offences committed against V, all on the same day, 24 September 2005. On that day, Lim had committed criminal intimidation against V. Lim had on two separate occasions, exhibited an obscene film to V. Lim had outraged the modesty of V by using his hands to touch and press the groin area of V (skin to skin). Lim had also made V masturbate his (Lim’s) penis. These vile acts committed against V will be described in further detail, below. The last of the TIC charges was for the possession of an obscene film in Lim’s computer.

3       The Prosecution relied largely on the Court of Appeal case of _Adam bin Darsin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 709</span> (“_Adam Bin Darsin_”) in submitting that an imprisonment sentence of at least six years would be appropriate. The Defence relied mainly on the High Court case of _Annis bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 93</span> (“_Annis Bin Abdullah_”) and submitted that an imprisonment sentence of two years would be appropriate. After considering all the submissions, I sentenced Lim to imprisonment for a term of 66 months (with effect from 14 February 2020, the date he was first ordered to be remanded by the Court). Lim appealed against the sentence imposed and is currently serving sentence.

4       The ordeal that V suffered on 24 September 2005 is described in clear detail in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”). Lim admitted to the SOF without any qualification. Where necessary, portions of the SOF will be quoted _verbatim_. As stated in \[1\], Lim was 41 years of age and V was 14 years of age at the time of the offences. V was a Secondary Two pupil.

5       On the afternoon of 24 September 2005, Lim initiated a chat with V on the online chat platform MIRC. Lim used a moniker “Angel16” and told V that he (Lim) was a Chinese woman in her twenties. V told Lim that he was 14 years old. Lim asked V for his height and weight. V told Lim. Lim then told V that he was interested and gave V his email address.

6       Lim and V then moved to the MSN platform to chat further. Lim asked V to show his face through the webcam. V did so. Lim then asked V to strip naked so that he could see V’s body. V refused, saying that his father was at home. V said he would show his naked body later.

7       After V’s father went out, V went back to chatting with Lim. Lim again asked V whether he could show his naked body. Lim requested that V masturbate as he wanted to see the size of V’s penis. Lim also asked for V’s mobile and home telephone numbers. V complied with all of Lim’s requests, still thinking that Lim was a woman.

8       V masturbated as requested by Lim. Using his mobile telephone, Lim filmed V’s act of masturbation. V was not aware that Lim was filming V’s act of masturbation.

9       V only suspected that “something was amiss” when he received a call on his home telephone from an unidentified caller. V asked Lim whether he was male or female, but Lim did not answer. As he received no reply, V blocked Lim on MSN.

10     Lim then called V’s home telephone again and told V that he had filmed V masturbating and that he would send V the video as proof. Lim told V to masturbate for him over the webcam again. If V did not do so, Lim said that he would post the video of V masturbating on the Internet or tell V’s father about the incident. V acceded to Lim’s demands and masturbated for Lim once more for Lim’s viewing through the webcam. This constituted the TIC charge relating to Lim having committed criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication.

11     Lim then asked V to be his “brother” and to go out with him. V agreed as he still feared that Lim would upload the video of him masturbating, on the Internet. That evening, Lim picked V up from the bus stop outside V’s residence. Lim introduced himself to V as “Kenny”.

12     Lim brought V for a drink of soya bean, somewhere in the east of Singapore. It was at this establishment that Lim showed V the video recording he had made of V masturbating. After showing this video to V, Lim did not delete this video. One of the TIC charges relates that at the soya bean establishment, Lim showed V an obscene video of a boy having sex with four men, with the boy crying out.

13     After finishing the soya bean drinks, Lim brought V to his office somewhere in the east of Singapore. At the office, Lim removed his jeans and turned on his computer. Lim asked V if V wanted “to prey on other boys”. V kept quiet. Lim continued to surf the MIRC platform.

14     At some point at the office, Lim showed V more obscene videos, of boys masturbating (this formed the basis of another TIC charge).

15     Lim explained to V how to massage private parts and showed V a book on this topic. Lim asked V to massage him. Lim removed his T-shirt, leaving on only his boxer shorts. Lim proceeded to lay down. V massaged Lim’s back.

16     Later, Lim told V to lie down so that Lim could demonstrate how to give a massage. V lay down as instructed. Lim then pushed up V’s T-shirt, and pulled V’s jeans and underwear down to his ankles.

17     Lim put V’s penis into his mouth and sucked V’s penis. This formed the charge to which Lim pleaded guilty to. When Lim put V’s penis into his mouth and sucked V’s penis, V was shocked and immediately moved his lower body away from Lim. V told Lim that he was uncomfortable. It does not appear that Lim had asked V for permission to touch V’s penis, or to take V’s penis into his mouth, or to suck V’s penis. It was clear from V’s reaction of shock and an immediate movement of his lower body away from Lim, that V had not consented to Lim’s acts of taking hold of V’s penis, the placing of V’s penis into the mouth of Lim and of Lim sucking V’s penis. It can also be inferred that V was taken by surprise by Lim’s acts, from V’s immediate reaction of shock.

18     Two other offences were committed by Lim on V the night of 24 September 2005 at Lim’s office. Lim used criminal force on V, intending to outrage the modesty of V, by using his (Lim’s) hands to touch and press V’s groin area (skin-to-skin) and had kissed and licked V’s nipples. This formed one of the TIC charges. Lim had also committed an indecent act with V, a young person, by making V masturbate his (Lim’s) penis. This formed the basis of another of the TIC charges.

19     After the ordeal suffered at Lim’s office (involving four separate offences of a sexual nature committed against V, a 14-year-old), Lim and V got dressed. Lim then brought V to a pub. Later, Lim sent V home. On the way home, Lim offered V a mobile telephone and money and said that he would contact V again to give V the mobile telephone and money.

20     The very next day, 25 September 2005, Lim met V online. Lim again asked V to masturbate in front of the webcam. V refused. Lim got angry and scolded vulgarities at V. V then logged off.

21     V reported the matter to the police, on 27 September 2005. Lim was traced and arrested on 29 September 2005. Investigations were carried out. Lim left Singapore in 2010, with the SOF stating that this was “shortly before he was to be charged”. On 13 February 2020, Lim was repatriated to Singapore by the Malaysian authorities. Lim was arrested.

22     As stated in \[3\], in their submissions on sentence, the Prosecution relied primarily on the Court of Appeal case of _Adam Bin Darsin_. In their submissions on sentence, the Defence relied primarily on the High Court decision in _Annis Bin Abdullah_. In summary, the reliance on _Annis Bin Abdullah_ by the Defence in their submission for an imprisonment term of two years was misconceived. I found the Prosecution’s submission on sentence to be persuasive and found that the Court of Appeal case of _Adam Bin Darsin_ provided the clear starting point in the consideration of the appropriate sentence in this case. There was much strength in the Prosecution’s submission of an imprisonment sentence of at least six years.

23     I took into account the aggravating factors and considered that they far outweighed the mitigating factors (of which the most substantial was the plea of guilt that Lim entered). Whilst Lim’s plea of guilt did demonstrate a certain degree of remorse, I found that Lim, in his Mitigation Plea, had sought to downplay certain aspects of his criminality. This had served to attenuate the actual degree of remorse demonstrated by Lim.

24     The Prosecution had summarised their call for an imprisonment sentence of six years (being an uplift from the starting point of five years as indicated by the Court of Appeal in _Adam Bin Darsin_), citing Lim’s “predatory conduct”, his “misuse of the Internet” and his “long period of absconding” as aggravating factors.

25     The SOF had indicated that Lim had been arrested on 29 September 2005, after V had made the police report. The SOF went on to state that Lim “fled Singapore in 2010, shortly before he was to be charged”. Lim was subsequently repatriated from Malaysia only in February 2020. The Defence explained the events surrounding Lim’s leaving the jurisdiction in written further submissions. Though, strictly speaking, this amounted to evidence from the Bar, I gave Lim the benefit of the doubt. I disregarded Lim’s long absence from Singapore as being indicative of an intention to evade justice. I therefore treated this long absence from Singapore as a neutral factor. Whilst the Prosecution’s submission of six years’ imprisonment would have been appropriate (if it had indeed been the case that Lim had deliberately stayed out of jurisdiction in order to evade justice), a “discount” ought then to be applied to the otherwise correct submission of six years’ imprisonment. I agreed with the Prosecution as to the presence of other aggravating factors. I hence arrived at a sentence of 66 months’ imprisonment and sentenced Lim accordingly.

26     In _Adam Bin Darsin_, the accused in that case had pleaded guilty to having performed fellatio on eight young boys. There were 15 other charges that had been taken into consideration. In the High Court, the accused was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment on each of the eight proceeded charges: four of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively. On appeal, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentences for each of the eight charges to a term of five years’ imprisonment per charge. Four sentences were ordered to run consecutively, giving an aggregate sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment.

27     The Court of Appeal set out the starting point for an offence of fellatio (where it was the accused person performing fellatio on the victims) punishable under the then section 377 of the Penal Code: in _Adam Bin Darsin_ the eight boys were in the age range of between 12 to 15 years.

28     In \[23\] of _Adam Bin Darsin_, the Court of Appeal stated, “In our judgment, an appropriate sentence for an offence of unnatural carnal intercourse such as that committed by the appellant in this case would be in the region of five years, subject to any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may be present.”

29     The Court of Appeal went on to state that “the appellant had no previous conviction of similar offence and no harm or injury had been inflicted on the victims. Nor are there any significant mitigating or aggravating factors.”

30     The circumstances in _Adam Bin Darsin_ have several crucial similarities to the present case. The victims were boys between the ages of 12 to 15. In the present case, V was 14 years of age at the material time. The accused in _Adam Bin Darsin_ had “forced himself on his victim and performed the act of fellatio”; the victims had not consented to the act of fellatio performed on them. V had not consented to the act of fellatio being performed on him and was shocked that Lim had carried out such an act on him.

31     In _PP v Wong Siu Fai_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 1161</span>, the accused person had, _inter alia_, performed fellatio on a five-year-old boy. The accused person had a previous conviction for outraging modesty. Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) sentenced the accused person to six years’ imprisonment for the charge relating to fellatio and ordered the sentence to commence on the date of sentencing (and ran that sentence concurrently with another sentence). What is noteworthy was that effectively the sentence for the (then) section 377 of the Penal Code charge was six years and five months: Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) said in \[7\], “I am not backdating the sentence in this case because I am of the opinion that the five months’ imprisonment already served should be part of the punishment given the circumstances of this case.”

32     In _PP v Lim Beng Cheok_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 54</span>, the accused person faced several charges including charges under the (then) s 377 of the Penal Code. Some of these charges were in relation to the accused person performing fellatio on a victim and some were for episodes where the accused person “told the victim to perform fellatio on him”. The victims were between 13 to 15 years of age. In arriving at the sentences to be meted out in that case, Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) did not differentiate between whether the accused person had performed the fellatio or whether the victim had performed the fellatio and stated, “… in the circumstances of the case, the totality of the charges on which (the accused person) was convicted as well as the remaining charges being taken into consideration, I did not think any useful purpose would be served in ordering different sentences for offences of fellatio upon the victim and offences for instructing the victim to perform fellatio on him.” The accused person was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded section 377 charges.

33     As stated earlier, the reliance on _Annis Bin Abdullah_ by the Defence was misconceived. The victim there was a female and she was 15 years old. The crucial difference between the fact scenario in _Annis Bin Abdullah_ and the present case is that the female victim had _agreed_ to fellate the accused person when he asked her to do so. No “trickery or force to coerce the victim into performing the act of fellatio” was involved. In \[50\] of _Annis Bin Abdullah_, Yong Pung How CJ pointed out that for section 377 offences, “where the victim is under the age of 16 years, his or her consent is irrelevant for the purposes of sentencing. The underlying principle in this regard is that young girls under the age of 16 may not have the experience or the maturity to make decisions in their own best interests about their own sexuality and that the law must step in to prevent their exposure to sexual activity regardless of their purported consent.”

34     Further, in \[51\] of _Annis Bin Abdullah_, Yong Pung How CJ stated that the case before him “would fall under this category of cases and the fact that the victim had agreed to the act of fellatio should not be accorded mitigating weight.” It would be clear that where (as in the present situation between Lim and V) there had been _no consent_ to the act of fellatio, there would be, instead, the presence of _aggravating factors_. Hence, the reliance by the Defence on _Annis Bin Abdullah_ was misconceived. Quite clearly, the Court of Appeal case of _Adam Bin Darsin_ must fall to be considered as setting the starting sentencing point for the present case involving V, a 14-year-old victim, who did not consent to the act of fellatio.

35     The aggravating factors in the present case are clear to see. Lim appeared to have a practice of “preying” on boys (he had tried to get V so involved as well), and had initiated contact with V via the Internet. As Lim had misused the Internet to “(facilitate) the offence” using the Internet as “an avenue … to get acquainted with” V, evincing “a clear nexus between the initial Internet contact and the commission of the offence”, this was a ground for imposing a deterrent sentence (see \[68\] and \[70\] of _Annis Bin Abdullah_).

36     Lim performed an act of “trickery” against V when he pretended to be a Chinese woman in her twenties. Lim, after the initial contact, asked V to strip naked so that he could see V’s body. V initially refused, citing the presence of his (V’s) father. After V’s father went out, Lim persisted with his perverted request. Lim asked again to see V’s naked body and asked V to masturbate as he wanted to see the size of V’s penis. Lim also asked for V’s home and mobile telephone numbers. V complied with all of Lim’s requests, thinking that Lim was a woman. Lim was secretly filming V in the act of masturbation.

37     Subsequently, after V had blocked Lim on MSN, Lim then called V again and told V that he had filmed the act of masturbation. Lim then told V to masturbate over the webcam again and threatened to post the video of the masturbation on the Internet, or that V’s father would be informed of the incident, if V did not masturbate again for Lim’s viewing.

38     Later, at the soya bean establishment, Lim showed V the obscene videos. Lim did not delete the video of V masturbating.

39     V’s ordeal continued at Lim’s office and the severity of the offences escalated significantly. Lim asked V whether he wanted to “prey on other boys”. Lim explained to V how to massage private parts and showed V a book on this subject. Lim asked V to massage him. Lim later told V to lie down so that Lim could demonstrate to V how to give a massage. Lim pushed up V’s T-shirt and pulled V’s jeans and underwear down to his ankles. Lim then performed the unexpected and unwelcome act of fellatio on V.

40     That evening at Lim’s office, Lim had also showed V more obscene videos, and had outraged V’s modesty by using his (Lim’s) hands to touch and press V’s groin area (skin to skin) and kissed and licked V’s nipples. Lim had also made V masturbate his (Lim’s) penis.

41     Later, Lim brought V to a pub. On the way home, Lim offered V a mobile telephone and money. The very next day, Lim met V online and had the audacity to again ask V to masturbate in front of the webcam again. When V refused, Lim got angry and scolded vulgarities at V.

42     I agreed with the Prosecution that the “overriding sentencing considerations” in this case were retribution and deterrence. Save for the assertion of a “long period of abscondment” (for which I disagreed at \[25\] above), I agreed with the Prosecution’s characterisation of the aggravating factors present in this case.

43     There had clearly been a degree of premeditation and deceit on Lim’s part. Lim had clearly planned his intrusion into V’s Internet presence and experience and had pretended to be a woman. There had been a threat and disturbing degrees of coercion practised upon V to obtain the perverted results Lim sought.

44     There had been elements of sexual grooming and exploitation of V in achieving the evil ends planned by Lim. Lim had used the Internet for nefarious purposes (see \[35\] above). Lim had clearly and thoroughly preyed on the vulnerability of V.

45     Lim had chosen to plead guilty and this was taken into account in Lim’s favour. Whilst Lim was traced, he did not have similar antecedents of a similar nature. This was also considered in Lim’s favour.

46     In further submissions tendered by the Defence, the Defence stated that “not a great deal of sophistication was put into the offence; all he was to (V) was a stranger who had simply told him he was a female whilst using a feminine moniker. This was a one-off instance involving an offender with no similar criminal antecedents.”

47     Considering that the Defence had asserted in the Mitigation Plea that Lim was “thoroughly remorseful for all his wrong doing”, what was stated (as quoted in \[46\] above) does call into question the degree of remorse Lim truly demonstrates.

48     Lim’s attempt to downplay his culpability does not speak well for him. Lim had been persistent in his attempts to morally corrupt V and had practised deceit and coercion in attaining his intended results of his criminal acts. Lim had committed a series of six direct offences with V as the victim. Of these six offences, Lim would be sentenced for only the proceeded charge. However, in the present case, it was clear that the TIC charges had to be taken into account to measure the total criminality that Lim displayed.

49     For all these reasons, I agreed that the Prosecution had correctly pitched an appropriate indicative starting sentence of six years’ imprisonment: the uplift was warranted to account for all the aggravating factors present. For the reasons I have stated, I adjusted this indicative sentence downwards to take into account the giving of the benefit of the doubt to Lim in relation to the period of absence from Singapore.

50     All considered, a sentence of imprisonment for a term of 66 months was appropriate. Lim was sentenced accordingly. In view of the several aggravating factors present, and the lack of substantial mitigating factors warranting a further discount in sentence, the sentence of 66 months’ imprisonment could not be said to be “crushing” in all the circumstances of the case. I had carefully considered Lim’s Mitigation Plea and the Further Submissions tendered by the Defence. Save for the plea of guilt, there was very little material to rely on to support any further downward calibration in sentence. In contrast, it was clear that Lim had committed several offences of an egregious nature against a 14-year-old victim.

51     A sentence of two years’ imprisonment, as urged by the Defence, would have been manifestly inadequate in all the circumstances of the case. The fact scenario clearly indicated that the Defence could not rely on _Annis Bin Abdullah_. The Prosecution was correct in their reliance on _Adam Bin Darsin_. As stated above, Lim appealed against sentence and is currently serving sentence.
