Civil procedure – Mandatory injunction – No order against nominal defendant

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/RAS 12/2022.\]

18 May 2022

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       The first and second plaintiffs are two subsidiary proprietors of North Spring Bizhub[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). This is a strata-titled industrial development located at 7 Yishun Industrial Street 1, Singapore 768162.

2       The first defendant (“1st Defendant”) is the chairman, the second defendant (“2nd Defendant”) is the treasurer and the third defendant (“3rd Defendant”) is the secretary respectively of the sixth council of the management corporation of the development (“MCST”). The fourth defendant (“4th Defendant”) is the MCST which, according to the plaintiffs, was joined in these proceedings as a nominal defendant only[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

3       The plaintiffs had applied in this originating summons (“OSS”) for the following orders:

> (a)     The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants, whether acting by themselves, their servants or agents or anyone over whom they exert authority or control howsoever, be restrained from preventing, obstructing, denying or opposing the performance of the 4thDefendant’s Agreement and obligation to permit the Plaintiffs, their servants, agents, representatives or nominees from inspecting the documents listed in Annex A of the OSS (“the Documents”);

> (b)     The 3rd Defendant, being the Secretary of the 4th Defendant, be compelled to enable the Plaintiffs, their servants, agents, representatives or nominees to inspect and make copies of the Documents;

> (c)     The 4th Defendant make available to the Plaintiffs, their servants, agents, representatives or nominees, the Documents for inspection and to make copies thereof; and

> (d)     The Plaintiffs’ costs of these proceedings as well as the costs of the 4th Defendant be borne by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants personally.

4       The documents which formed the subject of the plaintiffs’ application for inspection (“the Documents”) were described in Annex A to the OSS as follows:

> (a)     All source documents, including invoices and receipts, substantiating the following items listed in the Financial Statements for the years 2016 to 2020: (a) AGM expenses, (b) Festival expenses (c) General expenses and (d) Postage, printing and stationery.

> (b)     The source documents including salary slips or IR8A, CPF statements and foreign levy contribution statements, appointment (_sic_) letters of appointment of each payroll staff, employment history of each payroll staff, photo of each payroll staff and attendance record of each payroll staffs (_sic_) for the years 2016 to 2020.

> (c)     All the source documents including quotations, certificates, payment details, invoices and receipts substantiating an expense for the domestic system maintenance set out in the Financial Statements for the years 2016 and 2020.

> (d)     The Letters of Authority and Proxy forms submitted for the AGMs held in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 as well as the Strata Roll as at the time when the Notices of each AGM from 2016 to the 2020 (_sic_) were sent.

5       After considering the parties’ arguments, I had dismissed the plaintiffs’ application against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants with costs. As against the 4th Defendant, I made no order and also ordered costs to be paid by the plaintiffs to the 4th Defendant. The plaintiffs have since appealed to the General Division of the High Court against the orders made in relation to the 4th Defendant only[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). These are my grounds for the orders made.

## Background to the plaintiffs’ application

6       According to the affidavit filed by the plaintiffs’ representatives, Teo Kian Soon Peter and Ang Tin Yong on 21 September 2021, they had noticed the following expenditure items in the MCST’s financial statements for the year ending June 2020:

7       The plaintiffs alleged that they had noticed anomalies with the way the MCST was run, purportedly because it was not being managed by a professional managing agent. The day-to-day affairs of the MCST were managed by the 1st Defendant with the assistance of two staff employed by the MCST. The appointed managing agent handled only matters such as accounting, invoicing and arranging the annual general meetings (“AGM”). At the material time, the managing agent was Dickson Property Consultants Pte Ltd.

8       In April 2021, the plaintiffs had made a request to the MCST to inspect various documents pursuant to s 47 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C) (“BMSMA”). When the MCST failed to accede to their request, the plaintiffs applied to the Strata Titles Board (“STB”) in STB 61 of 2021 for an order that the MCST make available for their inspection and for copies to be made of the following four categories of documents for the period from June 2016 to March 2021[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4):

> (a)     All records of expenses incurred in relation to any festive events, AGMs, and general operation of the MCST (including but limited to postages, printing and stationery expenses);

> (b)     All records of payroll expenses incurred and supporting documents (_ie_ CPF contribution statements, foreign workers’ levy contribution statements and other payroll-related documents);

> (c)     All quotations, warranty certificates, payment details and records of the scope of supply in relation to the domestic system maintenance; and

> (d)     All Letters of Authority (“LOA”), Proxy forms and all related documents (including records of Strata Roll for the AGMs.)

9       After a mediation at the Strata Titles Board, it was agreed that the MCST would make available the documents for the years 2019 and 2020 for inspection by the plaintiffs’ representatives on 11 August 2021 from 8.30am to 5.30pm. The agreed documents were duly prepared and the representative of the managing agent as well as an employee of the MCST were present at the management office to attend to the inspection[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

10     On the appointed date for the inspection, the plaintiffs’ representatives, Ang Tin Yong and one Danny Teo, attended at the MCST’s premises. They were asked to sign a document referred to by the MCST’s representatives as a letter of undertaking entitled “TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR DOCUMENTS INSPECTION ON 11TH AUGUST 2021”[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) which stated the following:

> (a)     No taking of pictures using handphone or any devices.

> (b)     No video or voice recordings using handphone or any devices.

> (c)     Only the 2 undersigned persons allowed for the inspection.

> (d)     No taking of document out of the Management Office / Meeting Room.

> (e)     No question will be entertained. All communications to be made through the respective lawyers.

> (f)     Photocopy of selected documents will be charged at $0.30 per page per A4 size.

11     Mr Ang and Mr Teo had refused to sign the document. They contacted the managing agent’s director, one Richard Tang, and were informed that the undertaking was required by the MCST’s management council (“the Council”). Since they did not wish to sign the undertaking, the inspection did not proceed. Instead, Mr Ang had called the police and they were advised to lodge police reports[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7).

12     The parties returned to the STB for a further mediation on 20 August 2021. The MCST’s representatives, namely the 1st Defendant as chairman and another Council member, one James Tan Kok Eng, informed the STB that they were concerned that the plaintiffs would misuse the confidential information such as from the strata roll and insisted that the plaintiffs not disclose the information to third parties as there had been complaints to government authorities on matters concerning the MCST. An agreement was eventually recorded between the parties’ solicitors and a second inspection was subsequently arranged for 30 August 2021[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8).

13     When the plaintiffs’ representatives attended on the appointed date, they were then told that they could inspect the documents but would not be allowed to take copies. They were informed by the managing agent that this was a decision that had been voted on by the Council[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9).

14     It was the plaintiffs’ case that the Council members had breached their duties under the BMSMA. They alleged in their supporting affidavit the following particulars:

(a)

the 1st Defendant as chairman should not have permitted the Council to vote on the plaintiffs’ rights to take copies of the documents[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10);

(b)

the 2nd Defendant as treasurer whose duty it was to keep the accounting records were deliberately hiding something and trying their hardest to avoid allowing the plaintiffs to inspect the MCST’s documents for fear that the plaintiffs would uncover their wrongdoing[^11];

(c)

the 2nd Defendant and 3rd Defendant had switched roles at the last AGM and the two of them together with the 1st Defendant had been office bearers for several years.

15     According to the plaintiffs, they had to take out the OSS to compel the MCST’s office bearers to facilitate them to inspect and take copies of the Documents[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). The application was directed at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants in their personal capacity[^13].

## Nature of the reliefs sought in the OSS

16     The plaintiffs were seeking in prayer 1 of the OSS a prohibitory injunction against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants to restrain each of them from preventing the 4th Defendant from performing its obligation and agreement made with the plaintiffs to permit the plaintiffs’ nominees or representatives from inspecting and taking copies of the Documents.

17     As against the 3rd Defendant specifically, the plaintiffs were seeking in prayer 2 of the OSS a mandatory injunction to compel him as the secretary of the 4th Defendant to enable the inspection of the Documents and making of copies.

18     In prayer 3 of the OSS, the plaintiffs were seeking a mandatory injunction to compel the 4th Defendant to make available the Documents for inspection and to make copies thereof. However, the plaintiffs had made it clear that they regarded the 4th Defendant as a nominal defendant only[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14).

## Dismissal of the OSS against the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd Defendants

### Preliminary observation: Plaintiffs entitled to the Documents pursuant to s 47(1) BMSMA

19     In their affidavit opposing the OSS, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants had disclosed a history of unpleasant incidents between the MCST and the plaintiffs’ representatives[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15), Mr Ang Tin Yong and Mr Peter Teo, who were the joint deponents of the plaintiffs’ supporting affidavit in the OSS.

20     In relation to Mr Ang Tin Yong[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16), he had previously been a Council member but was removed due to his disruptive behaviour at Council meetings. The Council had not agreed to Mr Ang’s proposal to construct a side gate which appeared to be for the sole purpose of enhancing the patronage for the second plaintiff’s coffeeshop using the MCST’s sinking funds. Mr Ang had also raised issues with the MCST on wheel-clamping incidents which involved his brother, his customers and suppliers. He had alleged mishandling of fees collected from owners of vehicles which had their wheels clamped, even though these were matters within the purview of the carpark operator.

21     In relation to Mr Peter Teo, there had been complaints of illegal modifications that he/his company had surreptitiously carried out to their units without the necessary approval which had resulted in a stop work order by the MCST[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

22     Due to the acrimonious history between the parties, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants believed that the purpose of the plaintiffs’ application was not a genuine desire for the Documents but to harass them. They had in fact invited both Mr Ang and Mr Peter Teo to attend the Council meetings in order to resolve whatever concerns or grievances that they might have but the invitations had been rejected. The 1st to the 3rd Defendants asserted that they were merely carrying out their duty as Council members and protecting the interests of the MCST and the subsidiary proprietors.

23     As I had remarked in my oral judgment, I accept that the MCST has a mandatory obligation to allow inspection of the Documents pursuant to s 47(1) BMSMA as held by the STB in _Timothy Siah Yang Teck v 28th Management Council to MCST 1420_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGSTB 1</span>. There is in fact no requirement on the part of a subsidiary proprietor to furnish any reasons for requesting inspection of the documents as specified in that section.

24     Hence, while the affidavit of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants had outlined allegations of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the plaintiffs’ representatives, those allegations were in my view, irrelevant for the purposes of an application under s 47 BMSMA. Whatever motives the plaintiffs might have had, they were nonetheless entitled as subsidiary proprietors to inspect the documents under the custody or control of the MCST pursuant to an application made under s 47 BMSMA.

25     As for the taking of copies, this would be subject to the conditions set out in s 47(4) BMSMA:

> A person entitled to inspect a document made available under subsection (1)(b) may take extracts from, or make a copy of, the document upon payment of a fee (if prescribed) but may not, without the consent of the management corporation, remove the document from the custody of the management corporation for the purpose of inspecting the document, taking extracts therefrom or making a copy thereof.

26     The imposition of the undertaking by the MCST before the inspection could proceed on 11 August 2021 was effectively to secure compliance with s 47(4) BMSMA.

27     In regard to concerns of confidentiality expressed by the Defendants, I also accept that s 47 BMSMA overrides any confidentiality issues under s 21 Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) as was held in the Data Protection Commission’s decision in _MCST 4436_ \[2018\] SGDPC 18. In any case, the 4th Defendant had, through the parties’ respective solicitors, obtained the undertaking of the plaintiffs “not to abuse misuse any of the Documents such that it is against the law.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)”

### No direct and cogent evidence given by plaintiffs as to acts of prevention by the 1st to 3rd Defendants

28     While the MCST was obliged under s 47 of the BMSMA to allow the inspection and copying of the Documents, and had in fact agreed to do so, the main issue in the OSS was whether the MCST had been prevented by the 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd Defendants from performing its obligation under s 47 and its agreement with the plaintiffs.

29     As noted from paragraph 22 of the plaintiffs’ supporting affidavit, what they were asking for were orders to _compel_ the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants to allow and facilitate the plaintiffs to inspect and take copies of the Documents. These were orders sought against the 1st to 3rd defendants in their personal capacities. As these were final orders for which non-compliance could attract penal consequences of committal, the Court had to be satisfied that each of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants had in fact personally prevented the MCST from performing the terms of the agreement reached at the STB between the parties to allow inspection of the Documents and the making of copies (“the Agreement”).

30     In the plaintiffs’ supporting affidavit, however, there was no specific allegation made against each of the 1st to 3rd defendants as to how each of them had prevented the 4th Defendant from carrying out the Agreement.

31     At paragraph 19 of the plaintiffs’ supporting affidavit, all that was stated was that the plaintiffs’ representatives were told by the managing agent’s representative that the Management Council had voted not to allow them to take copies of any document but they were allowed to inspect only. It was not disputed that the Council comprises nine council members in all[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19). No minutes of the Council meeting were adduced by the plaintiffs to show that the 1st to the 3rd Defendants had voted to prevent the 4th Defendant from performing the Agreement to inspect. As such, it was not known whether the decision had been unanimous, or even whether the 1st to 3rd defendants had abstained from the vote or voted against the resolution.

32     There was also no direct evidence adduced against the 3rd Defendant that he had prevented the performance of the Agreement. What was clear was the fact that an appointment was made for the inspection on 11 August 2021 but the plaintiffs’ representatives had chosen not to proceed that day as they did not want to sign the undertaking which was requested in compliance with 47(4) BMSMA. As for the appointment on 30 August 2021, the plaintiffs’ representatives could still have proceeded with inspection of the Documents even if they could not take copies.

33     The inference that the plaintiffs had sought to draw in paragraph 21 of their supporting affidavit that the Council members were deliberately hiding something for fear that the plaintiffs would uncover their wrongdoing was, in my view, a mere assertion made by plaintiffs without any evidence in support.

34     All considered, there was simply insufficient evidence adduced by the plaintiffs of any specific breaches by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants of their duties under the BMSMA such that the prohibitory and mandatory injunction orders should be made against them in their personal capacities.

35     Whatever decision had been taken was one made by the Council as a whole and not one made by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants individually or acting in unison. In this regard, it is pertinent to note the provision in s 58(1) BMSMA which states thus:

> 58.—(1)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, _the decision of a council on any matter_, other than a restricted matter, _is the decision of the management corporation_.

(emphasis in italics mine)

36     Accordingly, I had dismissed the plaintiffs’ application against the 1st to 3rd Defendants.

## No order made against the 4th Defendant

37     Following the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ application against the 1st to 3rd Defendants, counsel for the plaintiffs had urged the court to nonetheless make an order against the 4th Defendant as prayed for in the OSS. Counsel for the 4th Defendant, however, disagreed and submitted that the application against his client ought to be dismissed.

38     I declined to do either. Instead, I thought that it was more appropriate to make no order on the application as against the 4th Defendant. This was because from the very outset, the plaintiffs had made it clear that they had joined the 4th Defendant as a nominal defendant only. The order that was sought against the 4th Defendant was, in my understanding, corollary to the prayers for injunctions sought against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants. As such, the order that could be made against the 4th Defendant would be effective only if the plaintiffs had succeeded in obtaining the injunctions against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants as it was the 4th Defendant that would have to perform the orders for the inspection and copying of the Documents by the plaintiffs’ representatives.

39     Since the main prayers in the OSS had been dismissed, there was nothing for the 4th Defendant to carry out as far as the reliefs in the OSS were concerned. Hence, I made no order against the 4th Defendant.

40     Had the 4th Defendant not been regarded as merely a nominal defendant, the plaintiffs’ application for a mandatory injunction against it would also have been dismissed since the evidence adduced did not show how the 4th Defendant had breached its obligations under s 47 BMSMA. It had prepared the Documents (albeit for the later two years only as agreed between the parties) in readiness for the plaintiffs’ inspection. It was the plaintiffs’ representatives who had chosen not to proceed with the inspection on account of the terms and conditions of the undertaking. The imposition of the undertaking could not be regarded as unreasonable as the terms were largely in line with s 47(4) of the BMSMA.

### Should the 4th Defendant be entitled to costs?

41     Counsel for the plaintiffs had submitted that no order for costs be made in the 4th Defendant’s favour which was strenuously objected to by counsel for the 4th Defendant. I agreed that the 4th Defendant was entitled to costs.

42     The 4th Defendant had been served with the OSS and had appointed solicitors to represent them at the hearing. It had filed an affidavit in response to the plaintiffs’ affidavit to set out the events that had transpired as it was entitled to under the Rules of Court.

43     As the 4th Defendant had incurred legal fees by having been included in this OSS, it was only right that its costs be borne by the plaintiffs. Otherwise, the other subsidiary proprietors in the development would also be bearing the costs of the plaintiffs’ failed action in this OSS. It was not improper for the 4th Defendant to have sought separate representation from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants as it was a neutral party to the action taken out by the plaintiffs against the three defendants in their personal capacity.

44     In terms of the work done, I thought the sum of $2,000 was reasonable as party and party costs and fixed this sum to be paid by the plaintiffs to the 4th Defendant inclusive of disbursements.

## Conclusion

45     For the foregoing reasons, the OSS was dismissed as against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants with costs, no order was made against the 4th Defendant but the plaintiffs were ordered to pay the 4th Defendant’s costs.
