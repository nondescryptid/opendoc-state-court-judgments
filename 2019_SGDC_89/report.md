8 May 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused pleaded guilty to four charges of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, and one charge of forgery for the purposes of cheating under section 468 of the same Code.

2       Between May 2009 to December 2011, he was a Senior Personal Banker at the United Overseas Branch (“UOB”) branch in Hougang (“UOB Hougang”). In January 2011, he was promoted to Relationship Manager and was transferred to the UOB branch in Tampines (“UOB Tampines”). As a Senior Personal Banker and Relationship Manager, his duties were to source for clients for UOB’s retail products and manage the clients’ relationship thereafter. This included servicing the clients’ accounts with UOB.

## THE FACTS

3       The Accused committed offences against two victims. The first was Ng Hock Seng (“Ng”), a 68 years old male Singaporean. The second victim was Pui Tai Betty (“Betty”), a 38 years old female Hong Kong national residing in Hong Kong.

### Facts relating to offences against Ng Hock Seng (DAC 919090/17, DAC 919092/17, DAC 919095/17 & DAC 919096/17)

4       Ng had only primary school education in Singapore and he did not read, write or understand English. Since September 2011, he had been residing and working in Malaysia. During this period, he entered Singapore once every two to three weeks, staying for one night before returning to Malaysia the next day. Prior to September 2011, he ran a mini-mart in Hougang.

5       Sometime in 2010, Ng decided to invest his savings. He went into UOB Hougang where he was attended to by the Accused. Ng enquired about how he could invest his money in low-risk investments. The Accused suggested that he invested in a unit trust. Following this advice, with the Accused’s help, Ng opened a unit trust account bearing number XXX with UOB on 10 Mar 10 (“the Unit Trust Account”). A unit trust is a fund composed of the investor’s money which is invested in various financial assets by a fund manager to generate returns. The investor would purchase units in the fund, which would determine how much returns he would receive in the event there are profits.

6       Between 10 Mar 10 and 5 Jul 11, there were seven subscriptions to and redemption of units in funds made through the Unit Trust Account. For these seven transactions, the Accused had the relevant forms pre-signed by Ng. Ng did not understand the contents of these forms when he signed them. He signed whatever the Accused had told him to sign. The Accused then filled in the contents in these forms. Ng had placed his absolute trust on the Accused and relied on him to fill up the forms on his behalf.

7       Sometime around September 2011, Ng relocated to Malaysia to work at his friend’s durian plantation. At the time, he had about $150,000/- in savings which he planned to use to purchase a house in Singapore in the future. In the meantime, Ng wanted to invest the money while he worked in Malaysia. Ng informed the Accused about his plan. Again, he also told Ng that he wanted to invest in a low risk investment.

8       At around this time, the Accused was facing financial difficulties. When Ng approached him about investing the $150,000/-, he hatched a plan to misappropriate the money for himself. The plan involved the following –

> (i)     Getting Ng to pre-sign blank investment application forms which he would then use to redeem units in the fund;

> (ii)     Getting Ng to open a UOB current account to receive the redemption proceeds;

> (iii)     Applying for a UOB debit card linked to the current account and having the debit card delivered to his own address without Ng’s knowledge;

> (iv)     Redeeming the investment using the pre-signed forms without Ng’s knowledge; and

> (v)     Misappropriating the redemption proceeds deposited into the current account by using the debit card.

9       On or around 1 Sep 11, Ng signed the form to invest $150,000/- in a unit trust called “Pru Monthly Income Plan M Fund” (“the Fund”). The Accused completed the rest of the form for him. On the same day, the Accused had Ng pre-signed several additional blank forms. Ng was not told what they were for. Ng did not question the Accused and he pre-signed the forms as requested. The Accused subsequently filled in the rest of the forms.

10     The Accused then submitted the application form to open a current account to UOB for processing. He furnished his own residential address as Ng’s mailing address. This was done without Ng’s knowledge. The form was processed by the Accused’s colleague, one Hanny Christiani. The Accused lied to Christiani saying that the mailing address was the address of Ng’s shop, and that Ng wished to change his current mailing address in the bank’s records to this address. Relying on this false representation, Ng’s mailing address was changed to the Accused’s residential address. On 5 Sep 11, the application was approved and a UOB current account in Ng’s name bearing account numbers XXX (“the Current Accout”) was opened. The mailing address of the Current Account was the Accused’s residential address. All bank statements in relation to the Current Account was mailed to this address.

11     The blank forms which Ng pre-signed in \[9\] above included an application form for a UOB debit visa card. This card was linked to the Current Account. The Accused had dishonestly concealed from Ng the fact that he had filled in his own residential address as the place where the debit card was to be delivered. The Accused had intended that the debit card application form to be used for the purpose of cheating UOB into believing that Ng had authorised the delivery of the debit card to the Accused’s residential address. This was the subject-matter of the section 468 forgery charge. The application form was submitted on 5 Sep 11, and approved on 8 Sep 11. The debit card was mailed to the Accused’s residential address on 13 Sep 11. The Accused used the debit card for his own use without Ng’s knowledge.

12     UOB approved Ng’s application to invest in the Fund on 5 Oct 11. $150,000/- was transferred to the Unit Trust Account by way of direct debit from the Savings Account. The sum was used to pay for the purchase of the units in the Fund.

13     Between 24 Nov 11 and 5 Mar 12, the Accused made a total of seven unauthorised redemptions of units in the Fund. The Accused did this by filling up a pre-signed blank investment application form and submitting it to UOB. These seven redemptions were made without Ng’s knowledge and authorisation. By submitting the form, the Accused had deceived UOB into believing that Ng had authorised these redemptions. By that deception, the Accused had dishonestly deceived UOB into disbursing a total of $142,278.35 in redemption proceeds. A total of $132,217.21 was credited into the Current Account. A sum of $10,061.14 was disbursed in the form of a cheque made out to Ng as the Accused had mistakenly indicated that the preferred mode of payment was by way of cheque in one of the investment forms. However, on 7 Feb 12, this amount as also deposited into the Current Account.

14     The transactions in relation to the three proceeded section 420 charges are set out below -

15     A total of $223,620.82 was deposited into the Current Account from the date it was opened on 5 Sep 11 to the date it was closed on 22 Jun 12. These included –

> (i)     Seven unauthorised redemptions of units in the Fund totalling $142,278.35;

> (ii)     One redemption of units in another fund amounting to $842.61;

> (iii)     One fund transfer from Ng’s Savings Account amounting to $24,800/-;

> (iv)     Two premature redemptions from Ng’s UOB structured deposit account number XXX amounting to $55,620/-;

> (v)     One cash deposit of $50/-; and

> (vi)     Interest credits amounting to $29.86.

16     Between 3 Oct 11 and 20 Mar 12, the Accused misappropriated a total of $218,100/- from the Current Account using the debit card. He withdrew $97,350/- in cash. He also made ATM fund transfers totalling $120,750/- to his personal UOB current account number XXX. As of 1 Sep 11, prior to these transactions, his personal UOB current account had a balance of $1.47.

17     Between 3 Oct 11 and 9 Apr 12, a total of $144,357.20 was withdrawn from the Accused’s personal UOB account, as follows –

> (i)     $40,756.55 was withdrawn in cash;

> (ii)     $32,000/- was transferred to one Yap Lay Chu in relation to the purchase of a business called Queens Nails LLP by the Accused and his wife;

> (iii)     $5,200/- was transferred to one Kim Wah Boon for the rental of the shop premises of Queen Nails LLP;

> (iv)     $11,660.30 was purportedly paid to the Accused’s friends and family members, as repayment of loans which he had taken from them;

> (v)     $6,402.58 was used to pay the Accused’s bills and miscellaneous expenses;

> (vi)     $3,261.62 was withdrawn in cheques made out to unknown parties;

> (vii)     $15,606.15 was transferred to unknown parties in transactions of below $1000 each;

> (viii)    $12,350/- was transferred to the Accused’s other personal UOB current account number XXX. The money was then paid to unknown parties, either in cash or by transfer;

> (ix)     $17,120/- was transferred to unknown parties, which investigations revealed to be linked to unlicensed moneylending activities.

18     On 18 Oct 12, the Accused also purchased a condominium unit at 523 Serangoon North Avenue 4 #XXX for $1,350,000/-. The property was held by him and his brother as tenants-in-common with the Accused holding a 99% share.

19     On 22 Jun 12, the Accused closed the Current Account by submitting an account closure form which Ng had pre-signed. The balance amount of $520.82 in the Current Account was transferred to the Savings Account. On 16 May 13, shortly before the Accused left his employment at UOB, he changed Ng’s mailing address in the UOB’s records back to Ng’s actual address. He used a change of address form which had been pre-signed by Ng in 2011. Ng’s mailing address in the UOB’s records was changed for all of Ng’s accounts. These steps were taken in order to cover up the offences that the Accused had committed.

20     The offences only came to light on 24 Feb 16 when Ng went to UOB to check on the status of his investments. To his rude surprise, he was informed that the units in the Fund had been fully redeemed. He lodged a police report on 29 Feb 16. UOB conducted its own internal investigations and when the Accused’s fraud was discovered, it repaid Ng a total of $223,522.61 on 25 Jul 16 and 13 Oct 16 for the loss suffered.

21     In his first statement to the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”), the Accused had insisted that the transactions were done at Ng’s behest. He also lied that all the proceeds had been passed to Ng. In his second statement to CAD, the Accused confessed that he had misappropriated the proceeds. He explained that he had lied in his first statement because his instinct was to deny first, then consult a lawyer before deciding what to say. He also intimated his intention to make restitution. He eventually paid $223,522.61 to UOB in two payments; one on 19 Aug 16 and the other on 3 Sep 16. He claimed that he had borrowed the amount from the second victim, Betty.

### Facts relating to offences against Betty (DAC 900455/17)

22     Betty and the Accused had become acquainted on an online dating application sometime in October 2015. The Accused was working at the Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) at the time. Between October 2015 and June 2017, they were in a relationship. The Accused had claimed to Betty that he was single when he was in fact married and has three young children. He also professed on numerous occasions his intention to marry her. Their relationship soured sometime in May 2017 when Betty discovered the truth about him. The Accused then admitted that he was married but that he and his wife were separated. Again this was a lie. During their relationship, the Accused had borrowed various sums of money from Betty, totalling $468,000/-. The Accused had not repaid the amount to her.

23     Sometime in June 2016, the Accused told Betty that he was involved in a criminal case involving the misappropriation of funds belonging to a client (Ng) at UOB. He asked Betty for a loan of $224,000/- in order to make restitution to UOB and to obtain a medical report which he intended to use to get a lower sentence. As Betty regarded him as her boyfriend, she agreed. The Accused used the said money to make restitution to UOB. He had not repaid the money to Betty.

24     On 4 Dec 16, the Accused told Betty via Facebook messenger that he was going to be sent to remand prison on 5 Dec 16, and that he needed $20,000/- to bail himself out. This was a lie. His intention was to deceive her into believing this so that she would give him the $20,000/-. The Accused also claimed that his mobile phone would be taken away from him when he was in remand prison. So he gave her another mobile number which he claimed belonged to his brother, Casper. He instructed her to contact Casper via Whatsapp for updates on him. This mobile number actually belonged to the Accused. By impersonating as Casper, the Accused falsely represented to Betty via Whatsapp that –

> (i)     The Accused was in remand prison;

> (ii)     Casper was finding it hard to obtain the bail money, He had obtained $30,000/- and needed $20,000/- more to post bail for the Accused;

> (iii)     The Accused has a bad back which was aggravated as there was no bed in remand prison;

> (iv)     Betty was the best girlfriend the Accused ever had, and that Casper was very happy to have her as a sister-in-law;

> (v)     The Accused wanted to marry Betty but was ashamed of himself at that time.

25     Believing that she was communicating with Casper and that the Accused was in remand, and concerned for his welfare, Betty transferred HKD54,600/- and HKD54,800/- (approximately $20,000/-) to the Accused’s SCB account on 5 and 6 Dec 16. This was the subject matter of the section 420 charge against the Accused in relation to Betty.

26     No restitution was made by the Accused to Betty for this amount.

27     The Accused was a first offender.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

28     DPP Kenneth Chin highlighted the aggravating factors present in relation to the two sets of charges. In relation to the charges involving Ng, DPP Chin highlighted the following –

> (i)     Ng was a vulnerable victim because of his age, low educational level and inability to understand the forms which he had been asked to pre-sign. Because of these disadvantages, Ng had placed his implicit trust on the Accused for advice and to complete the relevant banking forms.

> (ii)     The Accused was placed in a special position of trust given his position and Ng’s vulnerability.

> (iii)     The Accused had systematically abused the trust reposed in him, and egregiously exploited Ng’s vulnerability.

> (iv)     The Accused had made use of UOB’s banking facilities to cloak the illegal transactions with a sheen of legitimacy.

> (v)     A high level of planning and premeditation was involved. He had Ng pre-signed all the relevant forms essential towards making his deception successful and after that to cover up his tracks.

> (vi)     The amount which he had misappropriated was substantial ($218,100/-). In a short period of 6 months, the Accused had wiped clean the funds in Ng’s current account.

> (vii)     He took active steps to cover up his tracks in an effort to conceal his crimes.

> (viii)    He had lied to the CAD in his first statement and had only come clean after receiving legal advice. This showed a lack of genuine remorse. He had come clean because he knew the game was up.

29     In relation to the charges involving Betty –

> (i)     He committed these offences whilst he was under investigations for the offences involving Ng.

> (ii)     He exploited his relationship with Betty and her genuine concern for his welfare.

> (iii)     The degree of deception perpetrated against Betty was high. He went into great length to manipulate her emotions, even to the extent of impersonating his brother, Casper.

> (iv)     The amount involved was not small ($20,000/-).

30     DPP Chin submitted that retribution and deterrence - general and specific - were the relevant considerations in sentencing the Accused. Retribution was relevant because the sentence must be commensurate to the seriousness of the offences in terms of the harm caused and his culpability. General deterrence was relevant because the Accused committed the offences in relation to Ng in his professional capacity, Ng was a vulnerable victim, and there was the abuse of banking facilities which could seriously undermine public confidence on our financial institutions. Specific deterrence was relevant because the offences involved a high degree of planning and pre-meditation. In addition, committing the offence against Betty whilst he was under investigation, showed lack of remorse.

31     DPP Chin also argued that little, if any, mitigating weight should be given to the restitution made to UOB. This was primarily because he had obtained the amount to make the restitution through dishonest and reprehensible means. He had lied to Betty about his marital status, and exploited her concern and sympathy for him. Further, to date, he had not made any repayment of the amount. This suggested that there was no such intention to repay her.

32     DPP Chin admitted that there was no case-law on this point. Be that as it may, he argued that the weight to be placed on restitution as a mitigating factor should be fact-sensitive, and that the fact that restitution was made should not lead to an automatic discount in sentence.

33     All considered, DPP Chin sought for the following sentences –

>   
| 

(i)

 | 

DAC 919089/17

 | 

\-

 | 

24 months’ imprisonment.

 |
| 

(ii)

 | 

DAC 919092/17

 | 

\-

 | 

18 months’ imprisonment.

 |
| 

(iii)

 | 

DAC 919095/17

 | 

\-

 | 

18 months’ imprisonment.

 |
| 

(iv)

 | 

DAC 919096/17

 | 

\-

 | 

36 months’ imprisonment.

 |
| 

(v)

 | 

DAC 900455/17

 | 

\-

 | 

12 months’ imprisonment.

 |

  
  

34     DPP Chin submitted that the sentences in DAC 919096/17 and DAC 900455/17 be ordered to run consecutively making the total sentence 48 months’ imprisonment. This global sentence, DPP Chin argued, was appropriate given the Accused’s culpability.

## PLEA IN MITIGATION

35     Mr Sunil revealed that the Accused suffered from dysthymia and pathological gambling. Although there was no causal link to the offences, these were indirect causes for his actions. He had sought help from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for his pathological gambling as far back as 2008. He had stopped his treatment only because of the adverse side effects of his medication.

36     According to Mr Sunil the Accused had committed the offences involving Ng because he was desperate for funds to repay illegal moneylenders who had been harassing him for payment. He highlighted that after these offences, he had worked for two other banks without any repeat incidents. This showed that his crimes in relation to Ng was a one-off event.

37     Mr Sunil emphasised the Accused’s importance to the well-being of his family comprising his wife and three young children. They were dependent on him both financially and emotionally.

38     Mr Sunil highlighted that full restitution had been made to UOB. The monies were obtained from Betty. As regards the circumstances that led to his relationship with Betty, Mr Sunil stressed that although some might argue that what he had done was morally reprehensible, it was nonetheless not illegal or a crime. As such, the full mitigating weight should be given to the restitution.

39     Mr Sunil submitted for a global sentence of less than 30 months’ imprisonment. He countered that the prosecution’s sentencing position was crushing and was not supported by the case precedents.

## COURT’S FINDINGS

40     I agreed with the submission by DPP Chin on the aggravating factors that featured in this case. The fact that Ng was lowly educated, was ignorant on the subject of finances and investments, and was illiterate in English, made him extremely vulnerable to predators like the Accused. In exploiting Ng’s extreme vulnerability, the Accused had committed an especially egregious abuse of trust given his position at UOB. The probity of financial professionals formed an integral component of our financial sector. Any weak link in the chain would undermine its integrity and hard earned reputation. What made the Accused’s conduct especially abhorrent was the fact that within a short period of time, he had wiped out a big chunk of Ng’s hard earned savings; savings which had probably taken years to accumulate.

41     In relation to the offence against Betty, I noted that there was a relationship between the two. Betty was genuinely fond of the Accused. However, the same could not be said of the Accused. His conduct towards Betty suggested that his intention all along was to cultivate her feelings for him. IN reality, he viewed her as his cash cow. Through Betty, he was able to make full restitution to UOB. He then used emotional blackmail, lies and deception by pretending to be his brother, to further induce her into giving $20,000/- to him.

42     On the facts, I found that the Accused’s culpability and the harm caused as a result of his actions, were both high indeed. These factors warranted a significant period of imprisonment to adequately addressed the principles of retribution and specific and general deterrence.

43     On restitution, I noted that Ng had been fully compensated by UOB. In turn, the Accused had compensated UOB in full. The question was whether the restitution made should be accorded its full mitigating weight. DPP Chin said no. Mr Sunil said yes. It is trite law that the weight to be placed on restitution was fact-sensitive. The fact that restitution was made does not lead to an automatic discount in sentence. The circumstances in which it was made had to be taken into account. Restitution was a significant mitigating factor because it signified the Accused’s intention to come clean and make amends for his crime. It was a strong indication of his genuine remorse. In this case, my observations at \[41\], I was not convinced that the restitution made by the Accused represented a strong indication of genuine remorse. As such, I would place very little weight on the fact that he had made restitution. An analogy could be made with the plea of guilty. Although in normal circumstances, a plea of guilty carried significant weight as a mitigating factor, but there are circumstances where a guilty plea has no weight, for example, where the evidence was so overwhelming.

### Case Precedents Cited by Parties

44     On quantum of imprisonment for the forgery charge, DPP Chin tendered a table of case precedents, especially highlighting the cases of _PP v Goh Keng Huang_ (DAC 800683/13 & Ors), _PP v Goh Siew Buay_ (MA 54/99/01) and _PP v Ku Yann Peng_ (MA 11/06/01) to show that where the total amount cheated was around $200,000/-, sentences upwards of 24 months’ imprisonment was appropriate. In _Goh Keng Huang_, the sentence was 30 months’ imprisonment, in _Goh Siew Buay_, the sentence was 28 months’ imprisonment and in _Ku Yann Peng_, the sentence was 24 months’ imprisonment.

45     For the cheating charges, DPP Chin highlighted three cases namely, _PP v Peter Aw Boo Cheong_ (DAC 596/12 & Ors), _PP v Goh Hwee Lay_ (DAC 500304/13 & Ors) and _PP v Yusri Bin Kamarudin_ (DAC 916703/15) to support his submission for a sentence of at least 12 months’ imprisonment where the amount involved was $20,000/-. In _Peter Aw Boo Cheong_, 8 months’ imprisonment was meted out where the amount cheated was $15,000/-. In _Goh Hwee Lay_, the sentence was 12 months’ imprisonment for the amount $21,000/-. In _Yusri Bin Kamarudin_, 9 months’ imprisonment was imposed for $16,480/-. He also cited the case of _PP v Tan Peng Khoon_ (MA 23/2015/02; DAC 9185/13 & Ors)) where the facts were remarkably similar in that it involved an insurance agent cheating a 61 years old female client who was illiterate. She had also been asked to sign blank forms which she did without knowing what these were as had trusted the accused person. The total sentence imposed was 18 months’ imprisonment. The sum cheated was about $8,500/-.

46     After factoring the aggravated features present in the present case, DPP Chin submitted for the following individual sentences to be imposed, with the sentences in DAC 919096/17 and DAC 900455/17 to run consecutively –

47     On the other hand, Mr Sunil argued that the case precedents did not support the prosecution’s sentencing position. The cases which Mr Sunil cited showed that sentences similar to what the prosecution was seeking were imposed in far more egregious cases, where there were multiple victims (_PP v Eng Sze Keat_ \[2016, unreported\], _PP v Chiang Zhao Xiang_ \[2017, unreported\]), or where the amounts cheated were far higher (_Eng Sze Keat_, _PP v Ng Shu Jun_ \[2018, unreported\], _PP v Stephen Tay Thian Boon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 332</span>). He also cited two cases involving bank relationship managers which supported his submission for lower global sentence of not more than 30 months’ imprisonment. In _PP v Sim Wei Min Pauline_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 273</span>, the accused person was sentenced to a global sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment for the amount $210,000/-. In _PP v Alvin Lim Yuh Haw_ (DAC 20731/10), where the amount involved was $454,162.44, a sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment was imposed. Further buttressing his submission, Mr Sunil cited the case of _PP v Ng Wei Ling_ (ST Article dated 1 Apr 19). In that case, the Accused who was a senior banker with UOB was sentenced to 1 year 8 months’ imprisonment for cheating her clients of $200,000/-. Restitution of $150,00/- was made.

### Analysis of the Case Precedents

48     I would first deal with the cases _Sim Wei Min Pauline_ and _Alvin Lim Yuh Haw_. I agreed with DPP Chin’s submission that _Sim Wei Min Pauline_ could be distinguished for the following reasons – (i) charges were under the old provisions of the Penal Code where the maximum sentences for offences under s 420 and s 465 were lower, (ii) no vulnerable victim, (iii) substantial restitution of $150,000 was made, and (iv) no direct impact on Singapore’s banking system. I also took into account the observation made by the Senior District Judge in that case that the sentence was one that leaned on the side of leniency. Further, there was also no need for specific deterrence as compared to the present case, where the Accused had committed the offence against Betty whilst he was under investigation for the offences against Ng.

49     As for _Alvin Lim Yuh Haw_, when juxtaposed to the other case precedents, I agreed with DPP Chin that the sentence imposed in that case was clearly an outlier when one took into account the amount involved and the severity of the offence.

50     Having regard to the case precedents, I was of the opinion that in this case, as the amount involved was $218,100/-, the indicative sentence should be around 24 months. This is supported by the cases _Goh Siew Buay_ and _Ku Yann Peng_. Also where the amount involved was $20,000/-, the sentences imposed had ranged from 8 to 12 months (_Peter Aw Boo Cheong_, _Goh Hwee Lay_ and _Yusri Bin Kamarudin_), and in _Tan Peng Khoon_, the sentence of 18 months was imposed for the amount $8,500/-. Of course, _Tan Peng Khoon_ was a claim trial case. Even if this was factored in, the lowest the sentence could go would probably be around 12 months. Therefore all considered, 24 months for $218,100/- was not excessive. I would also point out that the sentence in _Tan Peng Khoon_ was doubled on appeal ie, from a total sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment to 18 months’ imprisonment. This demonstrated the severity with which the Appellate Court had consistently treated such offences.

### Sentence for the Forgery Charge Against Ng (DAC 919096/17)

51     Starting with the indicative sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment, I have to give appropriate weight to the two aggravating factors present in this case. These were (i) the egregious breach of trust and (ii) exploitation of a vulnerable victim. An uplift from the indicative sentence was therefore warranted. In my opinion, the appropriate uplift should be 6 months. As such, I imposed a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment for the forgery charge.

### Sentences for the 3 Cheating Charges Against Ng (DAC 919090/17 & DAC 919092/17 & DAC 919095/17)

52     For DAC 919092/17 & DAC 919095/17, the amounts involved were $20.040.70 and $22,405.36. As shown in \[44\], the sentence where the amount involved was $20,000/- was 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment. An uplift was warranted on account of the additional aggravating factors of a vulnerable victim and egregious abuse of trust. As such, I imposed a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment for these two charges.

53     For DAC 919090/17, the amount cheated was $59,875.49. As the amount is higher, I was of the opinion that an uplift of about 6 months was appropriate. As such, I imposed a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for this charge.

### Sentence for the Cheating Charge Against Betty (DAC 900455/17)

54     In this case, the starting point was 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment as the amount cheated was $20,000/- (see \[44\]). There was one additional aggravating factor present in relation to this charge; the Accused committed this offence whilst he was under investigation for the offences against Ng. As such, the appropriate sentence should fall on the higher end of the range. I therefore imposed 12 months’ imprisonment for this charge.

55     I ordered the imprisonment sentences in DAC 919096/17 and DAC 900455/17 to run consecutively, making the global sentence 42 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the global sentence was in line with the case precedents cited.

56     The Accused has appealed against the sentence imposed. He is currently serving his imprisonment sentence.
