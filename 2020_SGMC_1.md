\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9239/2019/01 .\]

6 January 2020

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was tried on 25 charges of making an offer of securities without a prospectus that has been lodged and registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (‘MAS’), which is an offence under s 240(1) and punishable under s 240(7) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289) (‘SFA’).

2       Each charge relates to a convertible loan agreement (‘CL Agreement’) signed between the accused, Brandz Group Pte Ltd (before the name change)/Brandz Group Ltd (after the name change) (“Brandz Group’) and the lender. There were 25 CL Agreements: 12 agreements were termed Vendor Shares CL Agreements and 13 agreements were termed New Shares CL Agreements. The charges in respect of the Vendor Shares CL agreements alleged that the accused made an offer of securities to the lenders. The charges in respect of the New Shares CL agreements alleged that the Brandz Group made the offer of securities to the lenders with the consent of the accused, as director of Brandz Group.

3       There were a total of 17 lenders for the 25 charges. In total, the 17 lenders extended $2,825,000 worth of convertible loans to Brandz Group between April 2006 and July 2006.

4       I was satisfied that the prosecution had established the 25 charges beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused was found guilty and convicted. The remaining nine charges which were stood down were taken into consideration (‘TIC’) for the purpose of sentence on the application of the prosecution and with the consent of the accused. The accused was sentenced to a total term of 15 months’ imprisonment. He has brought this appeal against the conviction and sentence.

## Established Facts

5       Prior to 3 July 2006, Brandz Group Ltd was known as Brandz Group Pte Ltd. The accused was the chairman, group managing director and majority shareholder of Brandz Group Ltd. The only other shareholder of Brandz Group was the accused’s wife, Jilline Chang Kar Peck. She was the deputy group managing director.

6       Brandz Group and its nine subsidiaries were in the business of brand communication and strategy, design and advertising in Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and China.

7       In 2004 to 2005, the accused attempted to list Brandz Group Pte Ltd on the Singapore Stock Exchange (“SGX”). However, he failed to do so. When the attempt to list on SGX failed, he tried in 2006 to list Brandz Group on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”). In order to list Brandz Group on the ASX, Brandz Group and/or the accused entered into the CL Agreements with the 17 lenders for the purposes of raising capital in what was termed as the ‘Pre-IPO Fund Raising Process’ (see exhibit P3).

8       The loans were called “convertible loans” because they were convertible to shares of Brandz Group if Brandz Group became eligible to list on the ASX. As each convertible loan was akin to an investment in Brandz Group before it was listed on the ASX, the accused marketed the convertible loans as a “Pre-IPO investment” in Brandz Group. It was represented to investors that their investment would support the ASX IPO of Brandz Group, and that the IPO would take place within a short period of time after their investment.

9       If the IPO was successful, investors would reap a profit from the rise in share price. If the IPO did not take place, investors would be repaid their investment (i.e., their loan) with interest of one per cent per month for the period the sum was invested. Therefore, the convertible loans were understood by the investors as a no-risk investment.

10     Brandz Group did not succeed in listing on the ASX. To-date, none of the lenders have been repaid their convertible loans.

11     In his police statement (exhibit P38), which the accused made on 10 July 2010, at answer 9, the accused estimated that $8million was raised by way of the convertible loans. He estimated the money was used in the following manner: (a) $1.5 million to pay off the bank loans of Brandz Group, (b) $0.5 million to pay commission to brokers who assisted to raise the convertible loans, (c) $2.5 million for listing expenses, (d) $3.5 million for operational and expansion expenses of Brandz Group.

12     From the Statement of Agreed Facts (P1), the accused admitted that from April 2006 to July 2006, Brandz Group and himself entered into 33 CL agreements with 25 different lenders for the purpose of raising debt capital for Brandz Group. The accused raised some $3.05 million via the 33 CL agreements.

13     The two versions of the CL Agreements generally shared the same terms and conditions save for a few differences. For the Vendor Shares CL Agreements, the loans were extended by lenders to the accused who was named as the borrower. If Brandz Group became eligible to list on the ASX, the loans were convertible into existing shares of Brandz Group held by the accused, which the accused would transfer to the lenders. If the loans were not converted into shares, the borrower (i.e., the accused) was obligated to repay the loans with interest.

14     For the New Shares CL agreements, the convertible loans were extended directly by lenders to Brandz Group. The parties to the agreements were Brandz Group (named as the borrower), the accused (named as founder of Brandz), and the lender. Like the Vendor Shares CL agreements, if Brandz Group became eligible to list on the ASX, the loans were convertible into shares of Brandz Group. Upon conversion, the lenders would receive New Shares issued by Brandz Group in addition to existing shares in Brandz Group held by the accused, which the accused would transfer to the lenders. If the loans were not converted into shares, the borrower (i.e., Brandz Group) was obligated to repay the loans and the accused was obligated to pay the interest on the loans.

15     The key terms and conditions in both versions of the CL Agreements can be summarised as follows:

> a)     Brandz Group is a private limited company incorporated in Singapore and has, at the date of the agreement, an ordinary share capital of $500,003 divided into 500,003 shares of $1 each.

> b)     The accused is the legal and majority owner of the entire issued and paid up share cap of Brandz Group.

> c)     Both the accused and Brandz Group shall use its ‘best endeavours’ to procure the listing of Brandz Group on the ASX. If the company is eligible for a listing and the board of directors decide to pursue the listing, all parties shall take all steps to procure the listing.

> d)     In some versions of the convertible loan agreement, the listing date was stated to be by 30 June 2006. In later versions of the convertible loan agreements, the listing date was stated to be by 31 August 2006.

> e)     On the Conversion Date, the lender had the right to convert the loan into Conversion Shares in Brandz Group according to a Conversion Formula.

>> (i)       The Conversion Date is defined in the CL Agreements as the third working day after the Eligibility to List (“ETL”) date, and the ETL date is the date on which the accused or Brandz Group receives a letter from ASX or any other recognised stock exchange that Brandz Group is eligible for listing.

>> (ii)       “Listing” is defined in the CL Agreements to mean that the shares of Brandz Group are listed and quoted on the ASX or any other recognised exchange. A “recognised exchange” is not defined in the CL Agreements.

>> (iii)       Conversion Shares is defined in the CL Agreements to mean “the ordinary shares of Brandz Group on a fully diluted basis after taking into account any capital restructuring, capitalisation, issuance of new shares and/or splitting of shares in the capital of \[Brandz Group\] _immediately prior to the Listing_, to be issued and transferred to the Lender upon the conversion of the Convertible Loan” \[emphasis added\]. In other words, the Conversion Shares are private shares of Brandz Group prior to the company being listed on a public exchange.

>> (iv)       Conversion Formula is defined in the convertible loan agreement as the formula for calculating the number of Conversion Shares to be transferred by either the accused or Brandz Group to the lender. The Conversion Formula includes the listing issue price per ordinary share of Brandz Group, which is not known.

>> (v)    The Conversion Formula for most convertible loan agreements is described as: “Number of Conversion Shares = (A÷ 0.7)/M where ‘A’ is the principal amount of the Convertible Loan; and ‘M’ is the listing issue price (its equivalent in Singapore Dollars) per ordinary share of the Company \[Brandz Group\]”

>> (vi)   If the listing issue price per ordinary share of Brandz Group was $1, the number of Conversion Shares which a lender would receive was to be approximately 42% more than what his loan could have purchased based on the same listing issue price.

> f)    In the New Shares CL agreement, the shares were to be transferred from both Brandz Group and the accused to the lender. In the Vendor Shares CL agreement, the shares were to be transferred entirely from the accused.

> g)    If Brandz Group is not listed on the ASX or any recognised stock exchange by the given date of the CL Agreement (either 30 June 2006 or 31 August 2006), the accused and/or Brandz Group is required to pay the lender a Repayment Amount within 45 business days. The Repayment Amount is calculated in the CL Agreement as the aggregate of the principal amount of the Convertible Loan plus interest at a compounded rate of 1% per month from the time the Convertible Loan was disbursed to the accused or Brandz Group, plus any accrued default interest.

> h)    If the lender has received Conversion Shares and Brandz Group does not proceed with the listing, the lender is entitled to give notice to the borrower (either Brandz Group or the accused) to require the borrower to purchase all of the Conversion Shares at an aggregate purchase price equivalent to the principal amount of the Convertible Loan plus interest on such amount calculated at a compounded rate of 1% per month from the date of the convertible loan agreement to the date of the notice.

> i)    If the lender has received Conversion Shares and Brandz Group proceeds with the listing, the borrower has the option to issue a written offer to the lender to purchase all of the Conversion Shares held by the lender at an aggregate purchase price equal to the IPO price per share of the Conversion Shares on the date of listing times the number of Conversion Shares held by the lender. The lender can choose to accept the offer or hold on to the Conversion Shares.

16     In summary, the CL Agreements promised to convert the convertible loans into shares in Brandz Group, held by Brandz Group and/or the accused, if Brandz Group was eligible to list on the ASX. If the listing did not take place, there would be no conversion of the loans into shares, but the lender was entitled to receive his principal plus interest.

17     Although the accused was named as the borrower in the Vendor Shares CL Agreements, it is undisputed by the accused and evidenced in the general ledger and financial statements of Brandz Group that he passed on the Vendor Shares convertible loans to Brandz Group. In other words, Brandz Group recorded all the convertible loans (both Vendor Shares convertible loans and New Shares convertible loans) in its financial statements and paid the accused for the sum owing on the Vendor Shares convertible loans.

18     In the general ledger of Brandz Group for FY2006 (P23), it was recorded that the accused credited S$1,393,500.00 worth of Vendor Shares convertible loans to the account of Brandz Group and Brandz Group repaid the accused the same amount. (See exhibit P23 at page 105 at ref JV06/0028 where convertible loans from Vendor Shares investors amounting to $1,393,500 were credited to Brandz Group’s account from the accused and correspondingly the same sum was paid by Brandz Group to the accused at exhibit P23 at page 46 on 31/08/2006 (ref JV 06/0028).

## Evidence of the brokers and lenders of the convertible loans

19     The 17 lenders named in the proceeded charges were called as prosecution witnesses. Ang Boon Teck (PW1) (“Ang”), Goh Seow Mooi (PW2) (“Goh”) and Vincent Ting (PW4) (“Vincent”) testified that they were brokers of the offer of convertible loans.

20     Sometime in May 2006, Ang came to know the accused through his friend, Jospeh Teo, who was a business partner of the accused. He gave evidence that Brandz was raising funds for a Pre-IPO investment. He understood that the funds were required for the listing expenses and working capital. The accused requested him to share the Pre-IPO investment with his friends. He was promised an introductory fee of three to five per cent for every investment made through his introduction. Ang invested $100,000. He confirmed that a sum of $30,000 was paid as commission to Goh through him by the accused. He said that Goh had brought in many of her ‘network friends’ to invest and she wanted her introductory fees to be settled.

21     Goh testified that she was introduced to the accused by Ang at a presentation conducted by the accused. She said the accused told the attendees that it was a Pre-IPO investment. She also gave evidence that the accused informed the attendees that they could refer their friends who were interested to invest and were promised a referral fee. The referral fee was a percentage of the amount invested. She was unable to remember the percentage. In June 2006, Goh received a commission of $30,000 through Ang.

22     Vincent testified that he was a full-time middleman who earned commission by selling investments. He was introduced to the accused by a friend who told him about the investment opportunity. He said the investors made the investments in his name but he was a trustee for the investors. He entered into eight separate CL Agreements totalling $2,415,000. In return for introducing his contacts, he initially shared the commission with Ang. However, he subsequently received 3% commission on the loan amount for every successful introduction.

23     The lenders who entered into the convertible loan agreements through the introduction of Goh and without having met the accused were Lee Li Hiang (PW7), Loh Kwai Peng (PW8), Seah Chiew Hong (PW9), Khoo Beng San (PW10), Ng Choon Young (PW11), Chia Ah Noh (PW12), Mary Lam Gui Qing (PW13), Yap Khoon Wah (PW14), and Tan Boon Hwee Desmond (PW15). The lenders who entered into the convertible loan agreements through the introduction of Ang without having met the accused were Gui Gek Hwee (PW16), Koh Chin Kion (PW6) and Boo Lee Chin (PW22).

24     Michael Boey Sheong Ghee (PW18) was introduced to the accused by a friend, Teo Swee Joo (PW19). Michael Boey Sheong Ghee and Foo Yong Cheong (PW21), who was introduced by Ang, attended presentations about the convertible loan investment given by the accused at the office premises of Brandz Group. In general, the accused used marketing materials similar to those found in exhibits P3 and P7 to market the convertible loans investment and the business of Brandz Group.

25     All the lenders were told that the loans would be used for listing expenses and some were told the loans would be used as part of Brandz Group’s working capital. According to the lenders, they were not informed that their loans would be used to pay the debts of Brandz Group.

26     The lenders testified that were not given or informed of exhibit P6, which is a notice dated 10 February 2006 signed by the accused and addressed to all investors informing them that the offer of the convertible loan is made in reliance on the exemption under s 272A(1) of the SFA; i.e. the offer is not made in or accompanied by a prospectus registered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”).

27     When it appeared that the ASX IPO would not take place and the lenders were asking for their loans back with interest, the accused issued post-dated cheques to a few lenders but informed them not to encash the cheques until he told them to do so. After a few months (just before the cheques expired), several lenders ignored the instructions of the accused and attempted to encash the cheques but were informed that the cheques had bounced.

#### Evidence of PW5 – Tan Kian Meng Mike (‘Mike Tan’)

28     Mike Tan was the financial controller of the Brandz Group from November 2005 to November 2006. Thereafter, his portfolio was changed and he stopped working for Brandz Group in May 2007. He was hired to assist Brandz Group to list on the ASX.

29     He testified that the company’s accounts for 2004 were still being audited when he joined. He did not find any irregularities in the accounts. As regards bringing the Brandz Group to list on ASX, he worked with the company’s secretary, a local auditing firm, Chio Lim & Partners, the Australian accounting firm, Grant Thornton, and the Australian law firm, Piper Alderman. He stated that a local law firm, Aptus Law Corporation, was engaged to carry out specific tasks which were required by Piper Alderman and Grant Thornton, such as reviewing the documents that were submitted to them.

30     In June or July 2006, Mike Tan went to Australia and presented the Brandz Group’s accounts. Grant Thornton highlighted that the receivables due from the companies in China were overdue by 150 days. He was told that all receivables overdue by 150 days must be classified as doubtful debts. He stated that no payment was received by October 2006 for the outstanding receivables. As a result of the provision, the revenue figure was reduced substantially and correspondingly there was a reduction in net assets. Mike Tan was therefore very doubtful that Brandz would be successful in listing.

31     He stated that the Brandz Group also had a very tight cash flow. It had an overdraft of $23,160 at the end of 2005. It was owing UOB Bank $3.9m and about $400,000 to $500,000 to International Factoring Services.

32     With respect to the convertible loans, the total amount was $3.1m in 2004. In 2005, the amount increased to $4.6m and to $4.873m at the end of 2006. He stated that these monies were utilised for the operations of the company and to pay its debts.

33     On 13 November 2006, the accused wrote a letter stating that the listing on ASX will be deferred to the first half of 2007 (see exhibit P8).

34     Under cross-examination, Mike Tan stated that the listing was a serious undertaking and a lot of work was done leading to the preparation of the prospectus which was nearing completion. However, he said that the attempt to list failed because Grant Thornton did not want to sign off the accounts.

**Prima facie case**

35     There was no submission of ‘no case’ made by the defence at the close of the prosecution’s case. The two courses were explained to the accused and he elected to give evidence. He did not call any other witness in his defence.

**Defence case**

36     The accused testified that he had started obtaining convertible loans as investments from members of the public while trying to list Brandz Group on the SGX in 2005. He claimed he was unable to list the Brandz Group due to “regulatory resistance” because SGX had not listed a similar service-based company, and not because Brandz Group suffered a loss and was in a negative net cash flow position for the 2005 financial year.

37     In the first quarter of 2006, Brandz Group decided to pursue a listing on the ASX. Its internal committee in charge of the listing comprised the accused, his wife, his personal assistant, Susan Chan, the Group General Manager, Sanny Wu, the Group Financial Controller, Mike Tan, and the head of the Communications Division, Shen Chang.

38     He asserted that Brandz Group was seeking to list on the ASX by satisfying the assets test and not the profit test. It engaged an Australian law firm, Piper Alderman, and Australian auditors, Grant Thornton for the listing process. The accused stated that Piper Alderman requested a local law firm to be engaged. As a result, Aptus Law Corporation was then appointed. Susan Chan was in charge of liaising with Piper Alderman and Mike Tan liaised with Grant Thornton.

39     When Grant Thornton refused to sign the accounts, he engaged a local accounting firm, MGI Ma & Mah, which was willing to sign the accounts. However, he was then sued by one Wendy Foo and made a bankrupt.

40     He produced a CL Agreement dated 25 March 2004 in which the lenders, Artha Asset Management Limited and two individuals agreed to advance collectively a total of $2,100,000 with an option to convert the loans to conversion shares. He stated that Wong Partnership, who acted for the lenders and prepared the CL Agreement, did not advise that a prospectus was required. He also stated that there were similar agreements with Five Ca and Arvind Khattar where the CL Agreements were drafted for the lenders by Colin Ng & Partners and there was similarly no prospectus issued.

41     As regards the CL Agreements in question, his evidence was that they were changed from earlier agreements drafted by the law firms Wong Partnership and Colin Ng & Partners and fine-tuned by one Pauline Song, who is an Australian IPO consultant.

42     He testified that the issue of whether a prospectus is necessary was considered and he was advised by the Australian IPO consultant that a prospectus was not required but that ‘it will be good to have an investment memorandum’ comprising of the company’s profile and the terms of the investment. He claimed he was unable to remember the name of the IPO consultant who gave this advice. He asserted the obligation for a prospectus only applies to listed companies.

43     As regards the Notice of exemption in P6, he confirmed that his signature was on it. He said that he would have been given P6 by Susan Chan to sign. He said it came from either Piper Alderman or Aptus Law Corporation but believed that it was prepared on the instructions of Piper Alderman.

44     He said Brandz Group was working on a prospectus with the assistance of Piper Alderman to be submitted to ASIC to secure the eligibility to list letter (‘ETL’) (see D1-Tab 23).

45     As regards the obtaining of the convertible loans, he stated that he was very clear from the outset when he spoke to some of the investors that the funds raised were to pay for the IPO, the business expansion and also to refinance the debt.

46     Under cross-examination, he stated that his instructions to his brokers were to raise the funds though their circle of friends. It was his evidence that he raised the convertible loans to meet the Net Tangible Assets test of A$2 million. He agreed that in 2005, the Group’s Net Assets were only $23,159.

47     He was referred to answer 9 of his statement P38 which he gave on 15 July 2010 where he stated that about $8m was raised and how the monies were used. He said that the amounts which he provided were estimates. In particular, he stated that about $1.5m was used to pay bank loans. He also admitted that the convertible loans were partially used to pay the investor, Arvind Khattar.

48     Asked why there was no mention of debt repayment in the Pre-IPO Investment summary (exhibit P3) and the marketing materials (exhibit P7) which were given to the prospective investors, he replied that it “may have been missed out.” He said that he informed the investors that monies were for business development, funding the IPO process and debt restructuring. He said that the brokers were also informed accordingly.

49     He was referred to the ‘Consolidated Cash Flow Statements’ for the entire Brandz Group from 1 January 2006 to 30 June 2006. He agreed that the Group was relying on debt to fund its daily operations as it had a negative cash flow position to the tune of $42,924. He also agreed that the net cash position and the net assets position of the Group in 2005 was negative. He agreed that the Income Statement (exhibit P22) showed that the Group made losses in 2004 and 2005. He agreed that the financial statements of Brandz Group were not shown to the investors. He asserted that there was no need to do so unless the investors were to ask for them

50     As regards the net assets test of A$2m, he was referred to the balance sheet as of 30 June 2006 which showed the amount of the net assets of $749,196 was far short of the threshold. However, the accused claimed that the conversion of the convertible loans into ordinary shares would have enabled the company to meet the target. He was asked by the learned DPP[^1]:

> Q    It’s a loan. But you are saying that a loan can be considered an Asset?

> A    When it’s converted, Your Honour.

> Q    And the conversion only takes place after the ETL letter is issued?

> A    Uh, yes, Your Honour.

> Q    But, at the point of deciding whether the ETL letter is to be issued, surely the loan cannot be considered a share?

> A    Certainly not, Your Honour.

> Q    So because the loan cannot be considered a share, it should not be part of the Net Tangible Asset?

> A    Your Honour---

> Q    Yes or no, answer my question.

> A    it is considered as part of the Net Tangible Asset, technically, and as part of the IPO process in Australia, it is even until today, Your Honour. I---Your Honour, this is what---I understand, this is what the consultants, uh, based this whole process on including the lawyers and the auditors, everyone. Um, not just 1 party but, uh, 2 or 3 parties. Um, the Honourable Prosecutor, the---this is what I understand, Your Honour. So, if I may suggest, you can verify that with ASIC, Your Honour.

> …

> Q    Yes, so in other words, the loans was ---the proceeds of the loans was to use to pay various sources or for various reasons. But you are now saying that the same loans that has been used can be considered Net Tangible Assets?

> A    Yes---

## Determination

### Applicability of s 240(1)(a) SFA to private limited companies

51     The defence submitted that s 240(1) of the SFA “was not intended to apply to, and should not be applied to private limited companies, as the primary purpose of the said legislation was to regulate listed entities”.

52     There is nothing in the SFA which states that it is restricted to the regulation of only listed entities. The preamble states that it is an Act “relating to the regulation of _activities_ and institutions in the securities and derivatives industry…” (emphasis added). The primary purpose of s 240(1) is to protect retail investors by ensuring that they have access to all material information set out in the prospectus for the purpose of making an investment decision. To achieve this objective, the section is drafted in wide terms and simply states “No _person_ shall make an offer of securities…” (emphasis added). It is clear from s 240(4A) (which deals with the person who must sign the lodged prospectus or profile statement) that ‘person’ can be an individual, entity, et cetera.

53     An entity is defined under s 2(1) of the SFA to include a corporation. Under s 2(1) of the SFA, a corporation has the same meaning as in s 4(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). Under s 4(1) of the Companies Act, a corporation means:

> any body corporate formed or incorporated or existing in Singapore or outside Singapore and includes any foreign company.

As the definition refers to “any body corporate”, a corporation under s 4(1) of the Companies Act (and by extension, under s 2(1) of the SFA) therefore includes locally incorporated private companies.

54     Prior to 8 October 2018, the definition of “securities” and “debentures” for the purposes of Part XIII (Offers of Investments), Division 1 (Shares and Debentures) of the SFA, was found in s 239(1). The Securities and Futures (Amendment) Act 2017 (Act 4 of 2017) deleted the definition and it is now part of the general definition in s 2. In s 239(1), ‘securities’ was defined as:

> means debentures or units of debentures of an **entity** or shares or units of shares of a **corporation**. (emphasis added)

The same definitions of ‘entity’ and ‘corporation’ are applicable here. Accordingly, the reference to entity for debentures and units of debentures and a corporation for shares and units of shares or debentures would include private companies.

55     In addition, the defence argued that if s 240(1) were to apply to a capital raising exercise by private limited companies, it would “place numerous persons in a difficult and perplexing position” and elaborated on this at \[34\] of its submissions. In this regard, it was stated in Parliament during the Second Reading of the Securities and Futures (Amendment No.2) Bill in 2005 as follows:

> … a prospectus will be required for all offers of investments unless they are specifically exempted. As a basis principle, such exemptions should only be given in limited circumstances where the cost of issuing a prospectus is not justified by the benefits of greater disclosure and investor protection. …

> Sir, the CLRFC recommended two new “safe harbours” which would allow private placements and small offers to be made without a prospectus. These safe harbours provide legal certainty in the case of capital raising by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and helps them do so efficiently without unnecessary regulatory costs.

56     The defence’s submission thus ignored the fact that the SFA has carved out specific exemption provisions in Part XIII, Division 1(4) of the SFA to help SMEs in their fundraising without unnecessary regulatory costs. In particular, a private company may utilise the small offers exemption under s 272A of the SFA or the private placement exception under s 272B of the SFA, if it abided by the requirements. Further, there is also the option of issuing a profile statement, instead of a prospectus, that is prepared in accordance with s 246 of the SFA.

57     Accordingly, I rejected the defence submission that s 240(1) is inapplicable to private limited companies.

### Was there an offer of securities by the CL agreements?

58     All offers of securities made to any person in Singapore are prima facie required to be accompanied by a prospectus unless expressly exempted. Section 240(1) reads:

> (1)    No person shall make an offer of securities unless the offer —

>> (a)    is made in or accompanied by a prospectus in respect of the offer —

>>> (i)    that is prepared in accordance with section 243;

>>> (ii)   a copy of which, being one that has been signed in accordance with subsection (4A), is lodged with the Authority; and

>>> (iii)   that is registered by the Authority; and

>> (b) complies with such requirements as may be prescribed by the Authority.

59     The defence’s argument is that the CL agreements did not make an offer of securities to the lenders as the agreements did not create a binding contractual obligation to issue shares on the part of the borrower to the lenders. This argument was premised on the basis that the issuance of the shares was contingent on whether the company was eligible for listing and the board of directors pursing the listing. If these conditions were not met, the loans then simply stood to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

60     On the other hand, the prosecution argued that the CL Agreements were deemed to be debentures by virtue of s 293 and the accused had therefore made an offer of securities in the form of debentures to the lenders which was unlawful for want of a prospectus. It was submitted that the lenders were invited to lend money to Brandz Group, and each CL agreement documented the loan by the lenders to Brandz Group pursuant to that invitation. It was submitted that it was irrelevant whether the CL Agreements were in the form of the New Shares agreement or the Vendor Shares agreement.

### Did the CL Agreements constitute an issue of debentures?

61     The SFA expressly specifies the circumstances as to what constitutes an offer for securities in s 293(6) as follows:

> (6)    For the purposes of this Division, a person makes an offer of securities if, and only if, as principal —

>> (a)    he **makes** (either personally or by an agent) an offer to any person in Singapore which upon acceptance would give rise to a contract for the issue or sale of those securities by him or another person with whom he has made arrangements for that issue or sale; or

>> (b)    he **invites** (either personally or by an agent) any person in Singapore to make an offer which upon acceptance would give rise to a contract for the issue or sale of those securities by him or another person with whom he has made arrangements for that issue or sale. (emphasis added)

62     Securities is defined in s 239(1) of the SFA to refer to shares or debentures of a corporation or entity. The definition of “debenture” in s 239(1) included:

> debenture stock, bonds, notes and any other debt securities issued by a corporation or any other entity, whether or not constituting a charge on the assets of the issuer but does not include...

In addition, s 239(3) of the SFA provides the following deeming provision in respect of debentures:

> (3)    For the purposes of this Division —

>> (a)    any **invitation** to a person to deposit money with or **to lend money** to an entity shall be **deemed to be an offer of debentures of the entity**; and

>> (b)    any document that is issued or intended or required to be issued by an entity **acknowledging or evidencing or constituting an acknowledgment of the indebtedness of the entity** in respect of any money that is or may be deposited with or lent to the entity in response to such an invitation **shall be deemed to be a debenture**.

>> (emphasis added)

63     Here, it is not in dispute that the Brandz Group was raising funds from the public in what was termed as a “Pre-IPO Fund Raising Process” for listing on the ASX. The express purpose of the usage of the funds stated in the Brandz Group ‘Pre-IPO Investment Summary’ was for compliance and listing expenses, working capital and business expansion. In my view, the fund raising project involved an “invitation” to “lend money” and the CLA Agreements therefore fell within the nature of a document “acknowledging or evidencing or constituting an acknowledgment of the indebtedness of the entity”.

64     In the case of the New Shares convertible loans, the loans were given directly to Brandz Group. The New Shares CL Agreements were the documents issued by Brandz Group acknowledging its indebtedness in respect of the loan given by each lender. In respect of the Vendor Shares CL agreements, it was similarly an invitation to the lenders to lend money to the Brandz Group. Although the borrower in the Vendor Shares CL Agreements is stated as the accused, Brandz Group was also named in the Vendor Shares CL Agreements. The intention of all parties was similarly for Brandz Group to apply the proceeds of the convertible loans to assist in its proposed ASX IPO. The relevant terms in relation to the conversion and repayment of the loans were also identical. It is also an undisputed fact that the accused passed on the loans under the Vendor Shares CL agreements to the Brandz Group and these convertible loans were recorded in its accounts. It is thus a fact that the convertible loans proceeds under the Vendor Shares CL Agreements went to Brandz Group.

65     Accordingly, following the deeming provision in s 293(3), I agreed with the prosecution that the New Shares and the Vendor Shares CL Agreements acknowledging the indebtedness of Brandz Group are deemed to be debentures which would make them a security as defined in s 239(1) of the SFA. Accordingly, the CL Agreements constituted an issue of debentures and thus fell within the ambit of an offer of securities which required a prospectus.

### Did the CL agreements make an offer of shares?

66     Under the 11 New Shares CL Agreements, the shares that would be received by the lenders would have been in part shares issued by the company and from the accused. The defence submitted that a transfer could not take place unless the ETL letter was issued and only when the listing price had been determined as the number of shares to be given by the company and the accused were dependent on the listing price. It was submitted that at the time when the listing price was determined, the prospectus would have been released to the lenders.

67     With respect to the Vendor Shares CL Agreements, the defence submitted that they simply evidenced a loan from the lenders and an agreement by the accused to transfer his shares to extinguish the loan. It was said that if the accused were in breach of s 240(1), it would mean that a shareholder would be unable to transfer or sell his shares without the issuance of a prospectus.

68     On the other hand, the prosecution contended that there was an offer of securities because the shares to be transferred pursuant to the CL Agreements were “units of shares” of Brandz Group. It was submitted that under clause 6.1 of the Vendor Shares CL agreements, the lenders had the “conditional right” to convert the loan into shares of Brandz Group if Brandz Group became eligible to list on the ASX. It was submitted that as a delivery of the underlying shares was contemplated when Brandz Group was listed, this conditional right gave the lenders a “legal and/or equitable interest” in the shares of Brandz Group. Accordingly, it was submitted that the lenders were deemed by virtue of s 4(6) of the SFA to have an interest in the shares of Brandz Group.

69     To begin with, the fact that the Brandz Group was preparing a prospectus for its listing in Australia is irrelevant. As the prosecution submitted, the convertible loans offered to investors in Singapore was a separate fund raising exercise from the ASX listing. I reproduce below the prosecution’s reply at \[20\] with which I agreed:

> Simply put, Brandz Group was raising money twice. Once through the convertible loan agreements and a second time through its listing on ASX (if it took place). For fund raising in Singapore through the convertible loan agreements, a prospectus was required, and it is separate and distinct from the prospectus which is to be issued when Brandz Group embarked on a differing fund raising exercise through a listing in Australia.

70     Section 239(1) defines “units” in the context of shares and debentures as:

> **any right or interest, whether legal or equitable, in the share or debenture**, by whatever name called, and includes any option to acquire any such right or interest in the share or debenture. (emphasis added)

‘Interest’ in a security is defined in s 4. Prior to the amendment which came into effect on 1 October 2018 (the amendment by Act 4 of 2017 was to include securities-based derivatives contract and unit in a collective investment scheme), s 4 provided the following:

> (7)    A person shall be deemed to have an **interest in a security** in any one or more of the following circumstances:

>> (b)    where he has a **right**, otherwise than by reason of having an interest under a trust, **to have a security transferred** to himself or to his order, **whether the right is exercisable presently or in the future and whether on the fulfilment of a condition or not**;

> …

> (9)    For the purpose of determining whether a person has an interest in a security, it is immaterial that the interest cannot be related to a particular security.

> …

> (11)  An interest in a security shall not be disregarded by reason only of–

>> (a)    its remoteness;

>> (b)    the manner in which it arose; or

>> (c)    the fact that the exercise of a right conferred by the interest is, or is capable of being made subject to restraint or restriction.

> (emphasis added)

71     It is provided for in Clause 3.1 that Brandz Group was under an obligation to endeavour to procure the listing. Under Clause 3.2, the board of directors still had a discretion whether to pursue the listing if the company was eligible. Whilst there was no undertaking to pursue the listing, there can of course be an implied term that the board of directors will not deliberately or wrongfully decide not to pursue the listing.

72     It is clear that this was not a situation where the loans could be cash-settled and no delivery of the shares was envisaged. Under the CL Agreements, a delivery of the shares was contemplated, and the key issue is whether the lenders had any “right” or acquired an “interest” in the shares under the CL agreements when they were not promised absolutely that the shares would be transferred.

73     Under the terms of the agreement, the principal obligation will accrue on the “conversion date”, which is the third working day after the ETL letter is received. The lender must then covert the convertible loan into conversion shares according to the conversion formula. If the borrower did not proceed with the listing, the lender was then entitled to give a “Put Option Notice”.

74     Based on the broad definition in s 4(7) of the SFA, a person is deemed to have an interest if the right is exercisable in the future and on the fulfilment of a condition. Accordingly, the lenders were deemed to have an interest in the shares even though their right was conditional on the issuance of the ETL letter. I thus decided that the CL Agreements did make an offer of shares.

## Was the accused entitled to rely on the small personal offerings exemption in s 272A(1)?

75     The accused asserted categorically in his defence that he was not relying on any of the safe harbour exemptions as the CL Agreements did not require a prospectus. Contrary to his assertion that he was not relying on any of the exemptions, the defence in its closing submissions submitted in the alternative that it was relying on the small offers exemption under s 272A of the SFA.

76     As the defence had not relied on the private placement exemption under s 272B, it will suffice for me to say that I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions in its supplemental submissions that the accused does not meet with its requirements.

77     First, under s 272A(1) of the SFA, there has to be a “personal offers of securities” to a designated group of offerees with an offer limit of $5 million within a period of 12 months. A “personal offer of securities” is defined in s 272A(3) as one that can be accepted only by the offeree and the offeree is likely to be interested in the offer due to: previous contact or professional or other connection with the offeror; or previous indication of interest to the offeror; or by Singapore licensed or exempt dealers and licenced financial advisers, dealers and financial advisers in other jurisdictions.

78     In the instant case, the investors had no previous contact or professional or other connection with the accused. Ang and Vincent came to know of the investment opportunity through friends and were thereafter introduced to the accused. In turn, they were the brokers who introduced others to the investment, and the persons that they introduced in turn introduced others. The investment was therefore opened to the public at large.

79     Further, there is no evidence that the accused had sought to limit his offers to a total of $5 million within a 12-month period. In fact, on the evidence there was no limit of $5 million. In the document titled “Brandz Group Pte Ltd ASX pre-IPO investment summary” (exhibit P3) which was given to potential investors, the accused stated that the Brandz Group and himself were “_offering the sale of vendor shares for the total investment amount of up to S$9 million as part of Pre-IPO fund raising process_”. The accused therefore clearly intended to raise more than $5m. Under cross-examination, the accused was referred to P3 and asked if he was intending to raise about $9m. He replied ‘yes’, but added that it was very fluid and the numbers could be changing. In his statement P38 which he made on 15 July 2018, at answer 8, he stated that a total of about $6m to $8m was raised. Accordingly, the accused had failed to comply with the requirement.

80     Second, under s 272A(1)(b)(i)(B), the offeree must be given a statement in writing of the reliance on the Exemption. Under s 272A(1)(b)(ii), there must be a notification in writing to the investors that the securities (i.e., the convertible loans) shall not be subsequently sold to any person.

81     It was not in dispute that the accused had signed on the Exemption Notice P6 which is dated 10 February 2006. He said that it would have been passed to him by his personal assistant, Susan Chan, to sign. Susan Chan was unable to recall if she did so due to the lapse of time. Whilst it was certain that P6 had been signed by the accused, what was less certain was when it was signed, who drafted it, why it was drafted and whether it was sent to the investors.

82     The accused claimed that he would have just signed the Exemption Notice P6 and would not have known why it was required. I was unable to accept that the accused would have signed P6 which is addressed to all investors without an understanding of what he had signed. I found that the accused took an ambivalent position on P6 not due to the lapse of time but because he knew that he would not be able to explain why he had signed it and also to show that he complied with the requirements.

83     The accused testified that he was “quite sure” that P6 was drafted by Piper Alderman. When asked by learned counsel if it could have been drafted by Aptus Law Corporation, he replied that he could not be sure because of the length of time. On the accused’s evidence, the communications with Piper Alderman started about one to two months prior to the visit to the firm in Sydney which took place on 5 May 2006 (see D2-Tab 1). Thereafter, the firm was engaged on 9 May 2006. The communications with Piper Alderman thus started well after the date on P6, which is 10 February 2006. Further, Piper Alderman had no role to play in the drafting of the CL Agreements. On Susan Chan’s evidence, the CL Agreements were collated and brought over to Australia after they had been signed. As regards Aptus Law Corporation, the accused’s evidence was that Aptus Law Corporation was appointed after Piper Alderman had been engaged and on their instructions. The accused went on to state that even if P6 was drafted by Aptus Law Corporation, it would have been done on the instructions of Piper Alderman. In fact, the accused at one stage of his evidence did allude to the fact that P6 may have been backdated. He said: “_My feel of it now after so long is that Piper Alderman did it like a hindsight. Like---like a just in case---just by the way. Just get it done, you know, as part of compliance.”_

84     It was Vincent’s ‘impression’ that the accused told him that a prospectus was not required for the CL Agreements. Asked if he had seen P6, Vincent stated he was not 100 per certain if he had seen it but said it was highly likely that he did. His evidence that it was highly likely that he did was inconsistent with his ‘impression’ that he was told that a prospectus was not required. It was plain that Vincent had no clear recollection and his evidence was not reliable. As for the other investors, their brokers, Ang and Goh, were certain that there was no mention of a prospectus. The investors themselves were either unable to remember if they had seen P6 or were certain that they had not. The materials used by the accused to promote the convertible loan investment in exhibits P3 and P7 did not make reference to the small offer exemption.

85     Accordingly, I was unable to accept that P6 was signed in February 2006. I found that the evidence showed that the investors were not given a statement of the reliance of the exemption and the notification of resale restriction.

86     Third, there must be no advertisements. ‘Advertisement’ is defined to mean in s 272A(10) as:

> (a)    a written or printed communication;

> …

> that is published in connection with an offer of securities, but does not include —

>> (i)    a document —

>>> (A)    purporting to describe the securities being offered, or the business and affairs of the person making the offer, the issuer or, where applicable, the underlying entity; and

>>> (B)    purporting to have been prepared for delivery to and review by persons **to whom the offer is made** so as to

> assist them in making an investment decision in respect of the securities being offered;

I agreed with the prosecution that the accused did not comply with this requirement. I accepted the following submissions made by the prosecution in its supplemental submissions at \[12\] and \[13\]:

> 12    The marketing materials of Brandz Group accompanying the offer of the convertible loans can be found at exhibits P3 and P7. These marketing materials would be an “advertisement” because they are written or printed communication published in connection with an offer of securities (i.e., the offer of the convertible loans).

> 13    The marketing materials would not come within the exception in s 272A(10)(i)(B) of the SFA because the evidence at trial was that the marketing materials were freely presented to anyone interested in the convertible loan investment scheme. The marketing materials were not prepared for “delivery to, and review by, the persons to whom the offer was made”...

87     Fourth, only certain selling or promotional expenses are permitted. Under s 272A(1)(d), commissions for the promotion of the offer can only be paid to the holder of a capital markets services licence or an exempted person. Here, the accused had arranged to pay commission to Ang at three to five per cent per investment and three per cent to Vincent. He issued a cheque of $30,000 to Ang and was aware that it was meant as commission to be paid to Goh. Ang, Vincent and Goh were not holders of a capital markets services licence or exempted persons. In his statement P38, the accused stated that he needed ‘$0.5 million to pay commission to brokers who assisted to raise these funds’ (see answer 9). At answer 10 he stated that the ‘independent brokers were paid a success fee between 3 to 5 per cent in cash or cheque upon receipt of investor’s cheque or telegraphic transfer...’

88     Accordingly, I found that the offer did not qualify for the small offer exemption as it was not made in compliance with the requirements.

## Was the accused personally liable to be charged?

89     The defence submitted that the ‘rightful party’ to have been charged should have been the company and not the accused. It was said that the company had formed a listing committee which worked together with the independent IPO consultants. It was argued that as the decisions in respect of the ASX IPO exercise and the CL Agreements were made by the listing committee, and the accused had acted in accordance with the decisions taken by the committee, he should not be personally liable.

90     In respect of the 12 Vendor Shares CL agreements, the offer was made directly by the accused. In respect of the 13 New Shares CL Agreements, the prosecution invoked s 331(1) of the SFA which provides that if the offence under s 240(1) of the SFA is “committed by a body corporate \[and\] … is proved to have been committed with the consent … of an officer of the body corporate, the officer … shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly”.

91     An officer of the company includes a director of the company. As regards the requirement of ‘consent’, it was held in _PP v Tan Seo Whatt Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 156</span> at \[39\]:

> ...I gratefully adopt the approach in _Abdul Ghani_ in relation to the requirements of “consent” to the present offence, which does not require that the individual has knowledge of the legal requirements giving rise to the primary offence. Hence, where “consent” is relied on to establish secondary liability, the offender _must be shown to have known the material facts that constituted the offence by the limited liability partnership and to have agreed to its conduct of the business on the basis of those facts._ Further, in my judgment, it is only right _not_ to require the offender to know of the legal requirement that the limited liability partnership failed to comply with.

92     The accused was the key person involved in raising of the funds through the CL Agreements. He was involved in drafting the ASX Pre-IPO Summary (P3) and was involved in making some presentations to prospective investors and also recruited brokers to introduce the CL Agreements to the lenders in return for a commission. Further, in both the Vendor Shares CL Agreements and the New Shares CL Agreements, he was a party to the agreements.

93     I therefore found that the accused (as a director of Brandz Group) was in breach of s 240(1) read with s 331(1) of the SFA for consenting to Brandz Group making an offer of securities to the individual lenders, which offer was not made in or accompanied by a prospectus, in respect of the 13 New Shares CL Agreements and as principal in respect of the 12 Vendor Shares CL Agreements.

## Amendment of charge

94     In respect of the charge in MSC-900813-2017 relating to Khoo Beng San, it was his evidence that he made an initial investment of $10,000 which is evidenced by the CL Agreement admitted as P28 and a further $10,000 which is evidenced by the consolidated CL Agreement P29. Accordingly, in my view, the charge in MSC-900813-2017 should relate only to the further convertible loan of $10,000 and not the combined amount. I thus amended the amount in the charge MSC-900813-2017 to $10,000.

95     I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the charge as amended and on the remaining 24 charges, and the accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted.

**Mitigation**

96     The accused was the managing director of Brandz Group. He was made a bankrupt on 3 July 2008. The bankruptcy related to him standing as guarantor for the liabilities of Brandz Group. He suffers from high blood pressure, high cholesterol and coronary heart disease.

97     It was submitted that the Brandz Group was a ‘viable and substantial’ business entity which operated a genuine business in branding, advertising, consultancy and related services with a ‘stable of well-known clientele’ in Singapore and the region. It was claimed that the Group had assets in excess of $11m and substantial revenue in the region of $9m.

98     It was emphasised that the fund raising was for a genuine IPO exercise on ASX which was carried out with professionals. The experts appointed were (i) Piper Alderman – the advising solicitors for the IPO and ASX listing exercise, (ii) Grant Thornton Australia – the independent auditors for the IPO and ASX listing exercise, and (iii) Aptus Law Corporation – the solicitors appointed to advice on compliance with Singapore law in respect of the IPO and ASX listing exercise. It was claimed that the CL Agreements were entered into on the “basis of the advice rendered from the external experts”.

99     It was stated that the ASX listing did not proceed because Grant Thornton declined to sign off the accounts as it was not comfortable with the revenue figures which pertained to China. It was submitted that the Brandz Group disagreed with the views of Grant Thornton and engaged a local firm, MGI Mah & Mah, who confirmed that the Brandz Group was entitled to proceed with the ASX listing on a compliance listing basis. However, the accused was made a bankrupt by one of the creditors and this led to the ASX listing exercise being aborted.

100    It was submitted that the task of issuance of the pre-IPO CL Agreements was handled by a team. Reference was made to the exemption notice under s 272A of the SFA (exhibit P6) and it was asserted that it was “prepared, apparently by one of the professional persons engaged by the company and was in fact signed by the accused”.

101    It was submitted that the accused did not receive any personal gain or benefit from the CL Agreements as the funds were used for the business of the company. It was added that the accused was forgoing his own shares in the company to raise funding for the company.

102    It was asserted that substantial information relating to the business of the company and the financial information was disclosed to the lenders. It was submitted that the only suggestion of information which was withheld was that the company had debts.

103    The defence also pointed to the fact that the accused was first investigated in July 2010 but was charged only in March 2017. It was submitted that the accused had undergone an extended period of pain, anguish, mental suffering and loss of his ability to lead a normal life.

**Sentence**

104    The offences are punishable under s 240(7) SFA with a fine up to $150,000 or imprisonment up to two years or both.

105    In _Tan Seo Whatt Albert_, where the offences were under s 240(1) read with s 331(3A) of the SFA, the High Court identified the factors which relate to culpability and harm. The court also gave the following broad guidance at \[56\]:

> Should an offence involve low culpability and harm, a fine of $10,000 and upwards would be appropriate. This is in line with the fine of $10,000 imposed in _Auston_ on the primary offender. Where there is high culpability and high harm, a custodial sentence is warranted. In between the two extremes, the difficulty is to determine whether the custodial threshold is crossed. In my view, where the offence is one of low culpability and moderate harm, or moderate culpability and low harm, a fine of $30,000 and upwards would be suitable punishment. Where culpability and harm are moderate in degree, a short custodial sentence _may_ be considered. That said, these broad positions may be moderated, depending on the other relevant factors (both aggravating and mitigating which fall outside the sentencing factors set out in \[54\]-\[55\] above).

106    In considering whether the custodial threshold has been crossed, I will first consider the sentencing factors which relate to the accused’s culpability.

## Culpability

#### (a)   The accused’s role in the CL Agreements

107    The accused is the founder and managing director of the company. He and his wife were the only two shareholders. In 2005, the accused conceived the idea to raise capital for the company through a public listing on the SGX. The attempt to list on SGX was aborted as the company was unable to meet the criteria. The accused then decided to list the company on the ASX.

108    In mitigation, it was submitted that the task of issuance of the pre-IPO CL Agreements was handled by a listing team. The company’s internal team comprised of the accused’s personal assistant, Susan Chan, and the heads of the departments. Susan Chan essentially provided the administrative support. Except for Mike Tan, who was the Group Financial Controller, there was no evidence that the other members had played any significant role.

109    On the evidence, it is clearly established that the accused was the decision-maker. It was his evidence that he was the fund-raiser for the company. He recruited the brokers to introduce the CL Agreements to the lenders in return for a commission. He was involved in making presentations to prospective lenders. Further, in both the Vendor Shares CL Agreements and the New Shares CL Agreements, he was a party to the agreements.

110    The accused was also involved in drafting the ‘Pre-IPO Investment Summary’ (exhibit P3). It was plain that he ran the show. I found that the accused had absolute control over the pre-IPO fundraising through the CL Agreements.

#### (b)   The accused’s mental state

111    In _Tan Seo Whatt Albert_, it was held that it is “irrelevant to sentencing that an offender does not know that a prospectus is required”. It was stated to be ‘at best a neutral factor’ and to have no mitigating value. It was held that it would be an aggravating factor if the offender knows that a prospectus is required, and yet intentionally or deliberately chooses not to issue one, and such a contravention ought to receive greater censure to reflect the defiance and disregard of the law.

112    The question is whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally or deliberately chose not to issue a prospectus. The prosecution had relied on P6, which is dated 10 February 2006, to submit that the accused had actual knowledge that a prospectus was required. In mitigation, the defence made a vague submission that P6 was “prepared, apparently by one of the professional persons engaged by the company and was in fact signed by the accused”.

113    On the accused’s evidence, he did not obtain legal advice before he started to raise funds in 2016. It was his evidence that the CL Agreements were adapted from earlier agreements. The defence tendered a CL agreement with Artha Asset Management Limited, Voo Kwong Kian and Lee Yee Pin (D1-Tab3) dated 25 March 2004, which was drafted by lawyers for the lenders. The circumstances in which the lenders came to lend the money (with the option to convert to shares) is unknown. It is therefore strictly of no relevance.

114    The accused claimed in his defence that he was advised by an Australian IPO consultant that a prospectus was not required. He did not give the name of the consultant. He claimed he was unable to recall the name. There was no correspondence or email seized in relation to any such communication. It is indeed odd that the accused would have sought advice from an Australian IPO consultant in relation to raising funds in Singapore. I found it highly doubtful that he did so.

115    Turning now to P6. It has not been established who had drafted P6 and when it was drafted. The accused in his evidence had alluded to the fact that P6 was prepared on hindsight and pre-dated. This is entirely plausible. I found that there is insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that P6 was prepared on or about the date stated in the document.

116    Accordingly, I was unable to find that the accused had deliberately and intentionally chosen not to issue a prospectus. It was plausible that the accused may have believed a prospectus was not required. I therefore regarded the accused’s mental state as a neutral factor.

#### (c)   Intention or motive of the offender

117    The accused was highly passionate about his business. He was proud of the fact that the company had been engaged by ‘well-known’ clientele. Although the company had cash flow problems and made a loss in 2005, the accused appeared bullish and optimistic that he could grow his business.

118    It is not in dispute that there was a genuine attempt to list on ASX. The CL Agreements were entered into between 21 April 2006 and 24 July 2006. The prosecution referred to the decision by the accountants, Grant Thornton, ‘in June/July 2006’ not to sign off the accounts and submitted that the failure to inform the lenders of the refusal was a material non-disclosure because it meant that the company could not list on ASX.

119    The prosecution has been unable to prove when exactly Grant Thornton did not agree to sign the accounts. Based on Piper Alderman’s invoice dated 16 August 2006 (exh D1-Tab 8), the firm was still attending to work in connection with the listing. I found that there was insufficient basis for the prosecution’s submission.

120    On the evidence adduced, I did not find any facts to suggest that the accused had any fraudulent or dishonest intention. However, as stated in _Tan Seo Whatt Albert_, _the “purpose or object of the offence is not to target fraud, and I do not agree that such fraudulent intent is a necessary condition for a custodial sentence to be imposed” (_at \[68\]).

121    The accused was a majority shareholder. On the accused’s evidence, the monies raised were used for debt restructuring, for working capital, for business expansion and to pay the listing costs. The accused clearly stood to gain by the injection of cash into his business.

#### (d)   Steps to mitigate the effects of the offence

122    The accused did not make any disclosure which would have enabled the lenders to fully appraise the risks if the listing was unsuccessful. Instead, as submitted by the prosecution, the lenders were only told the “good stuff” through the marketing materials that were provided to them. The accused ought to have disclosed the true financial position of the company because the company did not have the cash flow to repay the guaranteed principal sum if it was unable to list.

## Harm

123    In relation to harm, in _Tan Seo Whatt Albert_, the High Court considered the actual and potential loss caused, the scale of operations and the materiality of the information that was not disclosed.

#### (a)   Actual and potential loss caused to the investors

124    In _Tan Seo Whatt Albert_, there was no evidence of actual loss although ‘significant sums belonging to multiple investors were exposed to loss’.

125    Here, there were a total of 17 lenders for the 25 proceeded with charges. They did not receive back their monies and there is an actual loss in the amount of $2,825,000. This is a substantial sum of money. Taking into account the eight similar TIC charges, the total loss was $3,053,000.

#### (b)   Materiality of undisclosed information

126    Here, the focus is to consider the ‘materiality – the relevance and importance – of the information which should have been disclosed to investors in the prospectus.’ (para 55(b) of _Tan Seo Whatt Albert_). In this regard, the legislative purpose of the prospectus was stated in the decision at \[49\]:

> The provision sits within a disclosure-based regime, in which investors are meant to be presented with all the necessary information about a security so as to make informed decisions about whether to invest in that security. In this disclosure-based regime, the prospectus is critical to investor protection. It prevents the fundamental information imbalance between the securities issuers and the investing public that would otherwise result, by placing the obligation on issuers to disclose all information that a reasonable investor needs to make an informed decision about whether to invest.

127    Section 243(3) of the SFA states that “the assets and liabilities, profits and losses, financial position and performance, and prospects of the issuer” must be disclosed. The defence contended that Brandz Group had a viable ongoing business with substantial revenue and assets. It was submitted that the company was not in any financial difficulty with any creditor. On the other hand, the prosecution submitted that Brandz Group was in a poor financial position.

128    The financial health of the company is evident from its financial statements (exhibits D1-Tab 4 and P22). The defence’s claim that the company had assets in excess of $11m is not factually correct. The total assets as of 30 Jun 2006 were in excess of $8m. However, this figure does not take into account the liabilities of the company. After taking into account the liabilities, the net assets figure was only $216,381.

129    The assertion that its revenue was in the region of $9m is again inaccurate. The revenue and profit figure for the company for the first half of 2006 is unavailable. For the Group, the revenue figure for the first half of 2006 was $3.8m but the profit was a modest $807,296. In 2015, the company made a low profit of $193,358. The Group suffered a loss. In 2014, the company suffered a loss and there was also a loss at the Group level. The figures are summarised below:

130    Under cross-examination, the accused was referred to the ‘Consolidated Cash Flow Statements’ for the entire Brandz Group from 1 January 2006 to 30 June 2006. He agreed that the Group was relying on debt to fund its daily operations as it had a negative cash flow position to the tune of $42,924. In 2005, the net cash flow was negative to the tune of $23,160.

131    The investors were given the ‘Pre-IPO Investment summary (P3) which painted a very rosy picture of the company. It stated that the net profit after tax to be achieved for 2006 is at least $4m. There is no evidence to back-up this claim. In fact, it can be stated affirmatively that this was untrue as the net profit for the Group was less than $1m.

132    In P3, the accused stated that the company was raising $9m. The use of the funds was stated under a specific heading “Usage of Funds” as follows: 1. Compliance with ASX listing requirement on NTA – S$3,500,000. 2. Working capital and business expansion, specifically in Thailand, China and Middle East markets – S$5,000,000. 3. ASX listing costs – S$500,000.

133    The accused stated in his police statement (question 10 of P38) that the company needed to raise funds “with as little time as possible” as it was “facing severe cash flow problems” due to expansion in Asia and for the listing. The accused confirmed this in his evidence. He admitted that part of the funds raised were utilised for debt-restructuring. At answer 9 of the same statement, he stated that the funds were used as follows: 1) $1.5m to pay of the bank loans. 2) $0.5m to pay commission to brokers who assisted to raise the funds, 3) $2.5m towards listing expenses. 4) $3.5m for operation and expansion expenses. The accused stated in his evidence that he had estimated these amounts in answer 9. No evidence was given by the accused as to what the precise figures should have been.

134    The evidence of Mike Tan was that Brandz Group was “tight on cash” and the CL Agreements proceeds were used to pay its debts. He testified that the proceeds were used to pay $3.9m owed to UOB Bank Ltd and about $400,000 to $500,000 owed to International Factoring Services.

135    The accused gave no acceptable explanation why P3 did not state that the proceeds will also be utilised towards debt repayment. The accused’s explanation was simply that it was missed out. I was unable to accept that it could have been missed out. The company was tight on cash and its debt repayment was essential for its operations and to satisfy the listing criteria. It would thus have been uppermost on the accused’s mind and it could not be put down to an omission. It was plain that the information was unfavourable and consequently it was deliberately withheld. In the upshot, I agreed with the following submission of the prosecution at \[31\]:

> The accused must have known that if he made this disclosure, the pre-IPO fund raising would fail because all the investors testified at trial that they did not know their investment moneys would be used fully or partially to pay existing debts of the company. They further testified that had they known of this fact, they would not have invested.

#### The appropriate sentence

136    As the accused had claimed trial, there is no discount for a plea of guilt.

137    In my judgment, the custodial threshold was crossed. The culpability of the accused falls in the high range. There were material non-disclosures and suppression of facts relating to the negative cash flow and that a substantial sum of the monies raised were to be used to discharge the debts. The lenders were lulled into a false sense of security based on the marketing materials and that the CL Agreements were structured as fail safe for the investors. As the prosecution submitted, the lenders were misled into “thinking the convertible loan scheme was a high reward-low risk investment; that investors could cash in on their investment once the company listed and the share price jumped.”

138    In respect of harm, the individual losses correlate to the amounts lent by the investors. It ranged from $5,000 to $100,000. As for the CL Agreements signed by Vincent Ting, these were amounts lent by the lenders through Vincent Ting. The individual breakdown of the amounts lent is unknown. The entire sum raised by the accused of $3,053,000 ($2,825,000 for the proceeded charges and $228,000 for the TIC charges) was huge. None of the lenders were repaid.

139    Whilst I agreed with the total sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment proposed by the prosecution, I did not agree that there should be a standard sentence of six months imprisonment across board on all the charges which the prosecution sought. Instead, I calibrated the individual sentences having regard to the amounts involved.

140    As regards the delay between the investigation and the accused being charged in court, the delay was about seven years. Whilst I appreciated that it would have taken sometime for the prosecution to unravel the facts to determine the appropriate charges to be preferred, the long delay had not been explained by the prosecution. During this period, the accused was not allowed to travel without permission and it had caused him distress and anxiety. I factored in a discount of three months for the delay. This resulted in a reduction of the total sentence by three months’ imprisonment to 15 months’ imprisonment. The individual sentences were calibrated as follows with three terms ordered to run consecutively:
