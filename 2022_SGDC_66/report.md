### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The accused persons, Mr Koh Seng Lee (“Koh”) and Mr Chang Peng Hong Clarence (“Chang”) _claimed trial_ to 20 charges each under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”). The charges related to the payment of gratifications by Koh to Chang totalling more than S$6 million during the period 2006 to 2009.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the accused persons guilty and convicted them on the proceeded charges. I sentenced each of them to a total of 54 months’ imprisonment. In addition, I ordered Chang to pay a penalty of $6,220,095. The accused persons, being dissatisfied with their respective _conviction and sentence_, have filed appeals accordingly. The prosecution, being dissatisfied with the _sentence_ meted out to the accused persons, have also filed appeals against sentence.

3       I had provided brief oral grounds at the conclusion of the trial to explain some of my findings and my decision to convict the accused persons on the respective charges.[^1] At the sentencing stage, I had also set out brief reasons for the sentences imposed on them.[^2] I shall elaborate on my reasons for conviction and sentence in these grounds.

## The Charges

4       The two sets 20 charges against Koh and Chang were mirrors of each other, reflecting Koh as the giver and Chang as the receiver of the gratifications.

5       The first 18 charges against each of them were brought under section 6 of the PCA. These related to payments from Koh to Chang during the time Chang was employed by BP Singapore Pte Ltd (“BP Singapore”). These 18 charges were similarly framed, save as to the details relating to the date of the offence and the amount of gratification.[^3] As such, I shall set out in full the first of such charges against Koh (under section 6(b) PCA) and Chang (under section 6(a) PCA) respectively, followed by a table containing the salient details of each of the 18 charges for reference:

> DAC-927116-2017 (1st charge) against Koh

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, the sole shareholder and Executive Director of Pacific Prime Trading Pte Ltd (“PPT”), on or about 31 July 2006, in Singapore, did corruptly give gratification of USD300,000/- to an agent, _to wit_, Chang Peng Hong Clarence, a Regional Operating Unit, Manager Fuels in the employ of BP Singapore Pte Ltd (“BP”), via your HSBC HK Premier bank account number XXX, as an inducement to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, _to wit_, advance the business interest of PPT with BP, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

> DAC-9048841-2017 (1st charge) against Chang

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, on or about 31 July 2006, in Singapore, being an agent, _+_, a Regional Operating Unit, Manager Fuels in the employ of BP Singapore Pte Ltd (“BP”), did corruptly obtain gratification of USD300,000/-from Koh Seng Lee, the sole shareholder and Executive Director of Pacific Prime Trading Pte Ltd (“PPT”), via your HSBC HK Premier bank account number XXX, as an inducement to do an act in relation to your principal’s affairs, _to wit_, advance the business interest of PPT with BP, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241.

## Undisputed facts and the issues at trial

### Agreed and undisputed facts

7       The prosecution and defence had agreed to a Statement of Agreed Facts (Exhibit PS1) as well as the documents contained in two Agreed Bundles (Exhibits AB1 - 1 to 59 and AB2 – 1 to 346) for the purposes of the trial. I shall broadly adopt the contents of PS1 in summarising and setting out the background and undisputed facts in this case.

#### The relationship between Koh, Chang and BP

8       BP Singapore was the Singapore-based subsidiary of BP p.l.c. (“BP”), a British multinational company headquartered in London, and one of the world’s oil and gas “supermajors”. BP operated in all areas of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation and trading. BP Singapore served BP’s markets in the Middle East, Southern and East Africa, Australia, India, South East Asia, and China.

9       Koh was the sole shareholder and executive director of Pacific Prime Trading Pte Ltd (“PPT”). PPT was a limited exempt private company incorporated in Singapore on 5 April 2001, and its principal activities included wholesale and retail trade in mineral fuels and lubricants. PPT was one of the trading counterparties (“TCPs”) of BP Singapore from 2001 to 2015.

10     Vermont UM Bunkering Pte Ltd (“Vermont Bunkering”) was also BP Singapore’s TCP. Koh was one of Vermont Bunkering’s shareholders, together with Poh Fu Tek (“Poh”) and Vermont Groups Limited, a Hong Kong company.[^4]

11     Chang was an employee of BP for 13 years from 7 July 1997 to sometime around 9 July 2010.

> (a)     He joined BP Singapore’s Marine Department as a Marine Support Executive on 7 July 1997. He was promoted to Marine Trading Manager with effect from 1 November 1999, and then to Regional Operating Unit, Manager Fuels, with effect from 1 April 2003.

> (b)     Chang was in charge of BP Singapore’s marine fuels business, and managed a team of about 20 persons, comprising both sales and operations staff. The sales staff sold marine fuel (also known as bunker fuel) to customers such as shipowners while the operations staff liaised with shipowners and barge operators to ensure that the correct quality and quantity of bunker fuel was delivered to the customer’s vessel.

> (c)     From 1997 to 2009, Chang and his team (“BP Marine”) reported to the “Marine Fuels” unit, under BP’s “Air BP and Marine Fuels Strategic Performance Unit”.

> (d)     In 2009, following a restructuring exercise in BP, the “Marine Fuels” unit was absorbed by the “Global Residues” unit (“GRes”). Chang was re-designated Regional Marine Manager Fuels of GRes, with his team, BP Marine, covering oil trades in the Eastern Hemisphere, i.e. Singapore, Australia, South China and Middle East (see organisation chart in AB1-9).

12     BP’s fuel trades in the Eastern Hemisphere were handled by its Integrated Supply and Trading department’s (“IST”) fuel trading team in Singapore. The fuel trading team helped to support BP Marine’s business by providing them with the bunker fuel for sale.[^5]

#### Authority delegated to Chang at BP Singapore

13     It was not disputed that as at 1 April 2010, Chang was authorised by BP Singapore to enter into long-term contracts of up to 2 years in commitment (since 8 August 2005), and not exceeding USD25 million (since 7 August 2006). In addition, since 29 December 2004, Chang had the authority to decide which customers BP Singapore would sell goods and services to. Further, with effect from 28 January 2008, Chang had the authority to commit BP Singapore to sales decisions, including deciding on the sale price for goods and services for up to one year in duration. From 2 January 2009, Chang had the authority to agree to payment terms with a counterparty under circumstances which subject BP Singapore to certain degree of credit exposure.[^6]

#### BP’s bunker fuel trade

14     BP traded bunker fuel with TCPs on an “ex-wharf” or “delivered” basis.

15     For “ex-wharf” sales, BP sold bunker fuel to its TCP at the wharf:

![]([2022] SGDC 0066_Image/[2022] SGDC 0066_image1.png)

> (a)     The title to the bunker fuel, and accompanying risk, was transferred from BP to the TCP at the load port flange.

> (b)     The bunker fuel was sold at a “spot” fixed price or at a “floating” price which was quantified at either less than (“discount”), more than (“premium”), or equal to (“flat”) the Mean of Plattes (“MOPS”) – a public price index.

16     For “delivered” sales, BP carried out a “back-to-back” transaction by buying bunker fuel from the TCP, and simultaneously selling the bunker fuel to BP’s customer.

![]([2022] SGDC 0066_Image/[2022] SGDC 0066_image2.png)

> (a)     The bunker fuel BP bought from the TCP could comprise bunker fuel previously bought from BP and/or bunker fuel that the TCP had bought from other sources.

> (b)     BP took on the flash title and risk to the bunker fuel at the customer vessel flange, before title and risk was transferred to the customer.

> (c)     At the customer vessel flange, the bunker fuel was:

>> (i)       bought by BP from the TCP, and

>> (ii)       sold to BP’s customer at a “spot” fixed price or a “floating” price which was quantified at either less than, more than, or equal to (“flat”) MOPS or another public price index known as Bunkerwire.

17     It was also not disputed that BP Singapore did not own barges which were needed for delivering bunker fuel to its customers’ vessels. However, BP Singapore had long-term charter agreements for barges and would charge TCPs for the use of these barges in conducting back-to-back sales. For such sales, it was BP Marine which decided which TCP or supplier to buy the bunker fuel from and the price at which the fuel was to be purchased.[^7]

18     It was not disputed that PPT did not have a bunker supply licence from the Maritime Port Authority (“MPA”) to sell and deliver oil to ship owners. As such, it had to rely on BP’s licence in order to conduct such trades. PPT also did not have a licence to operate barges to transport the bunker fuel. It also did not own any storage facilities to store such fuel.[^8]

19     BP Singapore was the top bunker fuel supplier by volume in Singapore for 11 consecutive years up to and including 2014.[^9] PPT was BP Singapore’s largest trading counterparty for delivered sales by volume between January 2008 to July 2010.[^10] Between 2005 and 2010, PPT’s largest trading partner was BP Singapore, and trades with BP Singapore represented about 80 to 90 percent of PPT’s total traded volume.[^11]

#### Netting arrangements between BP Singapore and its trading counterparties

20     From 1 August 2001, BP Singapore entered into an agreement with PPT to set-off debts owed by BP Singapore to PPT against debts owed by PPT to BP Singapore. From 1 April 2006, BP Singapore entered into a “netting” arrangement with PPT which provided for the offsetting of debts between the parties. As there was no contractual right of set-off in standard marine fuel transactions, each party would have to pay the other in full for each transaction carried out. The “netting” arrangement enabled BP Singapore and PPT to set-off debts owed by one to the other. BP Singapore also had identical “netting” arrangements with other TCPs.

#### Fund transfers from Koh to Chang

21     Between 31 July 2006 and 26 July 2010, over 19 occasions, Koh transferred a total sum of USD 3,950,000 from his HSBC HK Premier bank account number XXX to Chang’s HSBC HK Premier bank account number XXX, as set out in the 1st to 19th charges against Koh and Chang.

22     It was also not disputed that subsequent to these transfers in Hong Kong, a portion of the monies were transferred by Chang to various bank accounts in Singapore.

23     It was not disputed that PPT’s net profits from its incorporation to financial year ending 31 March 2015 were as set out in its accounts in Exhibit B1-D4 and summarised in Exhibit B1-D5. Further, it was undisputed that the sums transferred by Koh to Chang during PPT’s financial years ending 31 March 2007, 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 exceeded the net profits earned by PPT in the same period. Further, as at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009, the total amount transferred by Koh to Chang exceeded the total cumulative profits made by PPT as of the respective dates, since its incorporation.[^12] It was also undisputed that at the material time, all of PPT’s profits were retained by the company and were not paid out.[^13]

#### Payments by Koh for Mindchamps City Square

24     Mindchamps City Square was incorporated on 3 September 2009, with Koh and Chang’s wife, Mdm Ong Mee Fun (“Mdm Fennie Ong”), as directors and equal shareholders. Mindchamps City Square operated a centre at City Square Mall which provided childcare services for pre-school children.

25     From September 2009, Koh made various payments for MindChamps City Square amounting to S$525,000 in total. Between 4 November 2014 and 17 February 2015, Koh was paid sums by Mindchamps City Square amounting to S$182,500.

#### Messages between Koh and Chang

26     It was not disputed that on 20 July 2009, the following messages were exchanged between Koh and Chang[^14]:

27     It was also not disputed that on 1 December 2009, Chang sent the following message to Chua Hwee Cheng, a Market Coordinator in BP Marine[^15]:

Chang forwarded the same message to Koh shortly thereafter[^16]:

![]([2022] SGDC 0066_Image/[2022] SGDC 0066_image4.png)

#### BP’s codes of conduct and guidelines

28     It was not disputed that during his employment with BP Singapore, Chang was aware of and had access to BP’s codes of conduct and guidelines which were applicable to him at the material time. It was also not disputed that BP had established policies against bribery and conflicts of interest. Employees were instructed to avoid placing themselves in positions of conflict and BP required their employees to provide disclosure in circumstances where potential or actual conflict of interests might arise. It was also undisputed that Chang did not disclose to BP Singapore any of the above fund transfers from Koh to him. Chang also did not disclose Koh’s business affiliations with his wife as well as Koh’s payments for Mindchamps City Square, to BP Singapore.[^17]

#### Statements given to the CPIB

29     About a year after the final transfer of money from Koh to Chang in July 2010, Koh and Chang were first called upon by the Corruption Practices Investigations Bureau (“CPIB”) to provide statements in relation to the transfers and payments. In the ensuing investigations that followed, Koh and Chang gave the statements set out in the table below (in chronological order) to the CPIB investigators. It was not disputed that the statements were provided voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise, and the statements were admitted into evidence as follows:

## The issues at trial

30     The central issue at the trial was the purpose of the transfers and payments from Koh to Chang and Mindchamps City Square, and, in particular, whether they were tainted by corrupt intent.

31     The prosecution’s case, in a nutshell was that these were payments made by Koh, on Chang’s request, on the understanding that Chang would advance PPT’s business interest with BP Singapore.

32     The defence’s case, in gist, was that these transfers and payments were not corrupt as they were Koh’s contributions to bona fide joint investments with Chang and/or Chang’s wife, Mdm Fennie Ong, in properties and the Mindchamps business.

## The case for the prosecution

33     The prosecution relied, in the main, on Koh’s and Chang’s statements given at the early part of the investigations, to prove that the payments set out in the charges were corrupt gratifications from Koh to Chang to advance the business interest of PPT. The prosecution called seven witnesses in support of its case.

34     As the evidence relied upon by the prosecution to prove their case against the accused persons were mainly drawn from agreed or undisputed facts or found in Koh’s and Chang’s statements, I do not propose to set out the testimony of the prosecution witnesses in detail. Instead, it would be helpful to highlight the salient parts of the statements recorded from Koh and Chang relating to the transactions in question, which were admitted in the course of the prosecution’s case:

## Submissions on no case to answer and the amendment of charges

35     At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for Koh and Chang made submissions on no case to answer and asked that the Court acquit both of them on all the proceeded charges. The arguments canvassed by the defence were focused on the sufficiency of evidence in support of the corrupt _mens rea_ against the accused persons. The defence argued that the evidence relied upon by the prosecution to support its case concerning the corrupt nature of the transactions were self-contradictory and rendered inherently incredible when considered against undisputed facts or objective evidence. As these contentions were repeated and expanded upon in the defence’s closing submissions at the close of the defence’s case, I shall deal with them at a later juncture in these grounds.

36     I should, however, highlight that counsel for Chang also made specific submissions concerning the 19th and 20th charges against Chang and Koh as they then stood. Briefly, the 19th charge against Chang was originally framed under section 6(a) of the PCA, and alleged that on 26 July 2020, Chang had obtained gratification while he was an agent in the employ of BP Singapore, as an inducement to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs. As it was an agreed fact that Chang had left BP Singapore on or around 9 July 2020, the defence submitted that the 19th charge was factually and legally flawed. As regards the 20th charge against each of the accused, they originally stated that the agreement between Chang and Koh was for Koh to give, and Chang to accept, gratification of S$500,000 as payment for Mindchamps City Square. The defence submitted, _inter alia_, that there was no evidence to support an agreement by Koh to give the specified sum of S$500,000 as payment to Mindchamps City Square.

37     Having reviewed the charges in light of the defence’s submissions, the prosecution eventually made an application to have the 19th and 20th charges against Koh and Chang amended to their latest form as set out in \[6\] above. The application was granted.[^19]

38     Having considered the evidence placed before the Court at the end of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against both the accused on the proceeded charges (as amended) and called upon them to give evidence in their own defence.

## The case for the defence

39     Both Koh and Chang elected to testify. Koh called Mr Hu Ning I (DW2, “Hu”) as a witness in support of his defence while Chang called Mr Ng Koh Sheng (DW4, “Ng”) and Mr Koh Leong Teck (DW5, “KLT”) as defence witnesses.

### The case for Koh

#### DW1 Koh Seng Lee

##### (1)   Koh’s education level and his level of proficiency in English

40     Koh testified that he had obtained his O-levels from a Chinese school. Although his English was “not very good”, he did not have problems with the usage of common business terminologies in English. Koh would usually converse with his friends and business associates (including Chang) in Hokkien and Mandarin and would bring along his English-speaking manager to assist him in business meetings.[^20]

##### (2)   Koh’s experience as an oil trader, his relationship with Chang, and the setting up of PPT

41     Koh had more than 30 years of experience in the oil trading industry. Before setting up PPT, Koh worked in New Orient Petroleum from 1996 to December 2007. Koh held 25 percent of the shares in New Orient Petroleum, and assisted to manage the bunker barges and deal in bunker trading.[^21]

42     Koh had dealt with BP Singapore since 1987 in the course of his work and got to know Chang in 1997 when Chang joined BP Singapore. They got to know each other well and met three to four times a week to talk about the oil trade. Their families also travelled together for holidays overseas.[^22]

43     When Koh’s employers wanted to exit the oil trade, Koh decided to set up a company so that he could carry on business in this trade. At the same time, one of BP’s larger TCPs (“Coastal”) was in trouble with the authorities and had their licence revoked by MPA. Other TCPs also exited the market. Chang informed Koh that BP Singapore had issues relating to quantity, quality and delivery with its TCPs. Therefore, Koh came up with the money and set up PPT which became a TCP to BP Singapore.[^23]

##### (3)   PPT as BP Singapore’s TCP

44     According to Koh, being a TCP made it easier for PPT to buy oil from BP Singapore and sell oil back to them. In addition, BP was an established multinational company which had the trust of ship owners and their volume of trade was high. Further, with the netting agreement, PPT was able to offset outstanding payments with BP Singapore on a periodic basis.[^24]

45     Using the back-to-back trading model, BP would pass the price fluctuation risks to its TCPs and made a profit both when it sold oil to the TCPs as well as when it sold the oil it bought back from the TCPs to the ship owners. On the part of PPT, it would analyse the market information and decide to buy or sell, in order to make a profit.[^25]

46     PPT became one of BP Singapore’s largest TCPs as it was able to work well with BP. PPT had no issues with quantity or quality in the oil delivered to the vessels. In addition, PPT was able to meet BP Singapore’s requirement for double hull barges to be used for delivery by hiring such barges to deliver the oil.[^26]

47     Since 2004 or 2005, PPT had two of its employees, Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei, sited in BP Singapore’s office as operational staff, on Chang’s request. They were tasked to assist in arranging the logistics for the supply of oil to BP Singapore’s customers. They were given access cards and telephones by BP Singapore and used BP Singapore’s computers. According to Koh, these operational staff had access to information concerning when a tanker was coming in with oil and when the customers’ ships were arriving. This arrangement continued until 2014, even after Chang left BP Singapore.[^27]

##### (4)   Barges hired by PPT for back-to-back trades with BP

48     During cross-examination, Koh agreed that as PPT did not have a barge operator licence and did not own any bunker barges, it had to hire bunker barges to transport oil for its back-to-back transactions with BP Singapore. The barges hired by PPT for this purpose included the following:[^28]

##### (5)   The SMSes sent by Chang

49     Koh testified that he did not do anything after receiving the message in AB1-42 from Chang. To him, the message did not make sense and it was just Chang’s prediction of what would happen to oil prices the next day. Moreover, one shipment alone was not going to cause the market to collapse as stated in the message. In addition, such information was not confidential vis-à-vis Koh as his employees would have known if it.[^29]

50     As for the messages in AB1-43 to 44, Koh treated it as information to him that BP intended to sell 250,000 tonnes of oil per month to PPT in the first quarter of the year. Koh found this volume to be high and a higher volume was not necessarily favourable to PPT. In addition, what was “good pricing” to BP might in fact be much higher than the prices offered by other oil suppliers or traders.[^30]

##### (6)   The HSBC accounts in Hong Kong

51     Koh testified that he had opened his Hong Kong HSBC account (“Koh’s account”)[^31] in 2001 as he travelled to Hong Kong for business very often and needed to withdraw Hong Kong dollars. Chang who was also in Hong Kong at that time had gone to the bank with him and opened his own account as well. The monies in Koh’s account were from his two off-shore companies operating in Hong Kong as oil brokers and traders.[^32]

52     When cross-examined by counsel for Chang, Koh agreed that he had transferred monies to Chang using his Hong Kong account because it was easy to do so and not because Chang had specifically asked for the transfers to be done in Hong Kong.[^33]

##### (7)   Chang’s departure from BP

53     Koh testified that in early 2010, he had known that Chang and a number of BP Singapore’s employees were planning to leave. Chang discussed his departure from BP Singapore with Koh. He told Koh that he would be joining Brightoil and invited PPT to join Brightoil as a TCP. Koh declined to do so as he preferred to continue working with BP. However, as most members of BP Singapore’s Marine team left, BP had to deploy staff members from overseas to plug the gap in the Singapore office. On his part, Koh assisted to ensure that deliveries were done on time. Eventually, at a discussion with Carlos[^34], Chang’s replacement in BP Singapore, Koh learnt that BP was worried that Koh would join Chang. Carlos “begged” Koh to stay as BP’s TCP and Koh assured Carlos that he had no intention to leave as long as BP Singapore continued trading using the back-to-back method.[^35]

##### (8)   Joint property investments with Chang

54     Koh gave evidence that since 2001, he had invested in various residential and commercial properties either in his sole name, jointly with his wife or Poh, or in the name of companies he owned.[^36]

55     Sometime in 2003 or 2004, Koh and Chang discussed investing in properties in Hong Kong and China together with Poh and Chang’s colleague, Hu. Eventually, Poh and Hu were not involved in the investments. Instead, the plan was for Koh to provide the funds through his Hong Kong HSBC account. The property investments would be made in Chang’s name. As Koh was engaged in a risky trading business, he wanted to set the money aside and did not want others to know of these investments. In this way, his creditors would not be able to seize these assets in the event he was made bankrupt. Further, Koh trusted Chang as he was a very good friend.[^37] Koh told Chang not to tell anyone about their joint investments.[^38]

56     Koh testified that the USD3.95 million he had provided to Chang was for the purpose of this joint investment. As for Chang, he would obtain a loan from the bank either in his sole name or together with Mdm Fennie Ong, for the property purchase. Koh was not really involved in deciding what investments to make. Chang would look at the properties and Koh would only agree or disagree. Koh was not given any documentation in relation to the properties but was aware of three joint-investment properties as follows:[^39]

57     During cross-examination, Koh explained that he and Chang did discuss his share of returns from the sale of the investment properties and the agreement was for a 50/50 split. However, Koh would agree to Chang taking a larger share of the profits in recognition of the time and effort spent on managing the property, including redevelopment work, if any.[^40]

58     Chang had consulted Koh before purchasing Ettrick. As it was an old house which Chang wanted to rebuild, Koh was initially concerned that the neighbours would complain. However, as Chang promised he would deal with the issues, Koh eventually agreed.[^41]

59     Koh had not seen any returns from the investments. He reckoned that the properties had to be sold before he could reap profits. During cross-examination, Koh added that Chang had informed him before proceeding to sell Da Silva and Livia. When the properties were sold, the monies would be returned to the pool. As Ettrick had been seized by the authorities and Koh had been advised not to speak to Chang during the course of investigations, it was not possible for Koh to discuss the returns of his investments with Chang since then.[^42]

60     Koh added that he had stopped transferring money to Chang after 26 July 2010 as Chang was sued by BP soon after his departure and might have to spend money on the suit. Furthermore, the accumulated funds already amounted to about S$4 to 5 million by then.[^43]

##### (9)   Koh’s investment in the Mindchamps business

61     Koh testified that it was Chang who suggested that he invested in the Mindchamps business. Although Koh did not have much interest in such investment as he was unfamiliar with the childcare business, he agreed to invest as Chang and Mdm Fennie Ong said that they would run the business. Koh first invested in Mindchamps Tampines but he was not a registered shareholder. As for Mindchamps City Square, he was registered as a director and shareholder pursuant to Chang’s suggestion. Koh had also signed as guarantor for Mindchamps City Square’s lease.[^44]

##### (10)   Koh’s statements to CPIB

62     Koh testified that he was not comfortable giving his statements to the CPIB investigators in English and was not able to express himself well. When he was first interviewed by CPIB on 18 October 2011, he did not feel that he was being investigated or that he was in some kind of trouble. Instead, he thought that Chang was being investigated and this was linked to the lawsuit with BP. In Court, Koh proceeded to clarify various parts of his statement in P1. In particular, Koh clarified that he did not borrow money to set up PPT as stated in \[4\] of P1, and PPT was not able to buy and store marine fuel as mentioned in \[6\] of P1. Koh added that he stated in \[14\] of P1 that Chang had borrowed USD500,000 from him as he did not wish to talk about the joint investments they had engaged in. This was because he did not want others to know about the money he had set aside. Furthermore, since Koh was of the view that he was not being investigated, he took matters quite lightly. He thought there was no need to tell CPIB about the investments which were matters between him and Chang and had nothing to do with BP. He also thought that since he had told the investigation officers that the monies had come from him, this would help Chang clarify any misunderstanding with BP.[^45]

63     Subsequently, in 2015, when his further statements were recorded, Koh decided to tell CPIB about the joint investments as he realised something was amiss.[^46]

64     As stated in \[15\] of P1 and \[25\] of P2, Koh was of the view that Chang had the authority to decide on the appointment of TCP and the power to terminate PPT’s relationship as BP Singapore’s TCP. However, if PPT did well, Koh felt that there was no reason for BP to end the relationship. Koh denied that he transferred money to Chang to keep the business relationship between PPT and BP Singapore intact.[^47]

#### DW2 Hu Ning I

65     Hu came from Taiwan to work in BP Singapore’s Marine team from 2003 to 2010 before leaving to join Brightoil. He initially held the title of sales manager but his designation was changed to market manager in 2004. Chang was Hu’s supervisor in BP Singapore. Hu first got to know Koh in 2002 or 2003 as they had business dealings. Hu participated in social activities and travels with Koh and Chang and knew their families. Hu and Koh communicated with each other mainly in Mandarin or Hokkien. Their usage of English in their communications with each other was limited to single words or terminology. At business meetings with BP Singapore, Hu noticed that Koh would invariably need help to express himself fully when he was required to speak in English. However, during cross-examination, Hu agreed that he was unable to assess how good or poor Koh’s English was.[^48]

66     Hu testified that in the early 2000s, it was relatively simple and straight forward to become BP’s TCP. The potential TCP would only need to provide basic information for verification by BP’s credit team. In his view, the biggest advantage of becoming BP Singapore’s TCP was to have a fixed and steady flow of business, with more business opportunities to choose from. As for the netting agreement with the TCPs, this was developed to avoid having to perform a payment settlement for every transaction and incur high banking fees on the part of BP Singapore and the TCP. Another benefit was that BP Singapore could set-off the amount owning from the TCP to BP Singapore for the ex-wharf portion of the back-to-back transaction, against the amount owing from BP Singapore to TCP for the delivered portion of the transaction. The TCP would also benefit from not being required to pay immediately for the ex-wharf transaction.[^49]

67     Hu recalled that PPT was one of more than ten TCPs when he joined BP Singapore in 2003. As time went by, many of the other TCPs either reduced or ceased trading activities with BP Singapore or were terminated by BP Singapore due to poor performance. BP Singapore’s main TCPs were PPT and Vermont Bunkering, with PPT being the largest TCP. Hu was of the view that this was due to PPT being able to fulfil the requirements set down by BP Singapore, including purchasing oil from BP, using barges provided by BP for delivery, as well as BP’s quantity and quality criteria. Hu added that BP Singapore had all along been on the lookout for new TCPs because BP Marine’s volume had been growing and there was a need to spread the risk. Koh had also mentioned previously that he was reluctant to take on too large a volume as that meant greater risk for PPT. On the other hand, it was very important for BP Marine to have TCPs to generate a profit using the back-to-back model.[^50]

68     During cross-examination, Hu agreed that Chang was in a position to provide input and assessment to BP’s shipping department on which barges to lease. One of the revenue streams for BP Singapore was the barging fee paid by the TCPs. Although Chang was also in a position to determine the price and margin to be earned on a back-to-back transaction, he was not involved in the daily sales activities and would not exercise this authority. However, Hu was not aware that Chang had given Chua Hwee Cheng instructions to give the term with good pricing to PPT in December 2009.[^51]

69     Hu confirmed that Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei were employees outsourced by PPT to perform operational work in BP Singapore. In fact, it was Hu who first made the suggestion when there was a fall in headcount in BP Singapore. These PPT staff were emplaced only after BP Marine obtained the endorsement of IST, as well as BP Singapore’s compliance, IT, security and human resource departments. Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei would be notified in advance that PPT had to deliver a particular shipment to the end user. Similarly, they would also be informed in advance of incoming cargo of marine fuel for operational purposes. In any event, this was ordinary information available in the market. However, PPT’s staff working BP Singapore’s office would not have access to trade secrets or secret information.[^52]

70     Hu was aware that Koh and Chang had joint investments in Mindchamps Tampines and City Square. This was because they asked Hu and Ng, another colleague from BP Singapore, whether they also wished to invest. As the amount required was rather large, Hu declined. Besides this, Koh, Chang, Poh, Ng and Hu had also discussed property investments in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The plan was for the properties to be registered in his name. However, the plan did not materialise eventually.[^53]

71     Hu never felt that Koh was afraid of offending Chang or BP Singapore. He recalled an incident during which one of the customers complained about quality of bunkers delivered (“the Hanjin incident”). Although it was not PPT’s fault, BP Singapore requested PPT to provide compensation to the customer through BP Marine as well as follow up with arrangements to unload and deliver a fresh batch of oil. Although Koh protested and refused to pay, BP Marine proceeded to deduct the amount from PPT. This resulted in a very serious argument between Koh and Chang.[^54]

### The case for Chang

#### DW3 Chang Peng Hong Clarence

##### (1)   The oil trading business in BP Marine

72     When Chang joined BP in 1997, the trading of bunkers in BP Marine was a money-losing business and there was no back-to-back business at that time. Chang was doing oil trading then on a daily basis and realised it was impossible for BP Marine to make money in that way. He had a series of discussions with his supervisor, Mr Chua Beng Kiong (“BK Chua”), and was tasked to work with IST for a joint-venture and to start the back-to-back business. The business model took the pricing risk away from BP Marine and it was able to make profits from every single transaction. IST also benefited from the model as it helped them manage their oil trading strategy. BP Marine was able to make a profit when it sold the oil ex-wharf, when it sold oil to the customers on the back-to-back sales, and from the barge fees collected.[^55]

73     At the start of the back-to-back business model, BP Marine was trying to recruit as many TCPs as possible. The registration process was simple and only required the TCPs to apply for a credit line from BP Singapore’s credit department. Along the way, BP received many serious complaints from customers concerning delay, quality and shortfall in quantity. Some of BP’s largest TCPs then also had their bunker licences revoked.[^56]

##### (2)   Chang’s relationship with Koh

74     Chang first met Koh when he joined BP Singapore. Koh was working for New Orient Petroleum which was already a TCP with BP. Koh had a very good relationship with the staff in BP Singapore and was good friends with BK Chua. Koh taught Chang the ropes of the business, and they as well as their families grew to become very close. Koh attended Chang’s wedding in 1998 and their families used to go on holidays overseas together.[^57]

75     Chang testified that he had never taken any loans from Koh.[^58]

##### (3)   Set up and growth of PPT

76     After Koh left New Orient Petroleum in 2000, he approached BK Chua and Chang and asked to be appointed BP’s TCP. BK Chua and Chang informed Koh of the application process.[^59] During that time, while Chang could make recommendations on TCPs, it was BK Chua who had the authority to decide whether or not to deal with a particular TCP. Chang did not make the recommendation for Koh to be a TCP. This was because Koh was already well-established in the business with a good track record.[^60]

77     When PPT first started as a TCP, it dealt with only a small volume. However, when BP Singapore’s largest TCPs ran into issues, PPT slowly grew to fill the void. PPT gave BP Marine the most attractive prices to compete with in the market, and was receptive to taking more pricing risk than other TCPs. It also bought back all the ex-wharf oil from IST, instead of sourcing for the cheapest oil from the market. Koh did not seek to approach shipping customers directly to undercut BP Marine. In addition, PPT was able to meet BP’s stringent shipping standards and was the only TCP who was willing to charter BP’s double hull barges to transport the oil (which was a requirement imposed by BP’s shipping department as a safeguard against the oil leaks and pollution).[^61]

78     Despite the above, PPT’s percentage share of BP Singapore’s volume was about 52 percent at the highest. This was because Chang and Hu were conscious of the risks involved in giving too much volume to one TCP and consciously kept PPT’s volume around 50 percent. At the same time, they sourced for other TCPs to cover the balance. PPT also did not want more volume because higher volume represented higher risk.[^62]

79     After 1 April 2003, Chang’s duties expanded to managing regional business and he seldom discussed business activities pertaining to the Singapore market with Koh. Although Chang initially thought that Koh was mainly doing business with BP Singapore, he learnt sometime in 2008 that Koh was also doing business with other parties. When Chang spoke to Koh about this, the conversation became heated because Koh felt that it was not reasonable for BP to stop him from doing business with others.[^63]

80     Overall, PPT was BP Singapore’s most cooperative and transparent TCP. Many of BP’s customers preferred to use barges operated by Koh. This was why BP Singapore rose to become the top bunker supplier in Singapore from 2002 to 2014. After PPT was terminated as a TCP in 2015, BP Singapore dropped from its market-leader position in the bunker trade.[^64]

81     In 2009, Chang did have the authority to terminate TCPs but he would require the agreement of all the stakeholders before he could effect the termination. Further, it was in BP Marine’s interest to have more TCPs and there would be no reason to terminate them unless they were in financial difficulties or had their licence revoked. Chang had never had the impression that Koh was afraid that PPT would be terminated. Instead, BP Marine was the one begging Koh for more business.[^65] Chang had also never given Koh the impression that he considered himself to have invested into PPT and to be a partner of PPT.[^66]

82     In relation to complaints, Chang recalled the Hanjin incident in 2007 or 2008 where the ship owner complained about quality issues and BP Marine had no choice but to make PPT pay the compensation as well as substantial costs for de-bunkering and re-bunkering. Koh was firm that the responsibility should not lie with him. Another incident involved quantity complaints relating to the “cappuccino effect” where the bunker clerk artificially inflated the quantity of oil by introducing air (“the cappuccino incident”). Chang told Koh to replace all his bunker clerks, but Koh resisted and asked for time to investigate. However, as Chang insisted, Koh had to transfer some bunker clerks to deal with other TCPs and terminate those who were suspected to be responsible.[^67]

##### (4)   Pricing decision for BP’s bunker trades

83     Within BP Marine, Chang would delegate his authorities for the Singapore market to Hu, who would in turn delegate his authorities to Chua Hwee Cheng (who held the designation of market coordinator) and Koo Soo Yong (who was the senior account manager). For ex-wharf sales of bunker fuel to TCPs or for delivered sales to shipping customers which were not on a back-to-back basis, the sale price would be determined by the IST traders. Chua Hwee Cheng and Koo Soo Yong would obtain the price from them for such transactions. As for the delivered sales on a back-to-back basis, BP Marine would pass the price enquiries from BP’s customers to the top three TCPs. BP Marine would add a profit margin to the best price quoted by the TCPs and would offer it the shipping customers. The pricing decisions concerning these trades were made on a daily basis by Chua Hwee Cheng or Koo Soo Yong, and Chang and Hu would not be involved. Although Chang had the power to determine the margin earned on a back-to-back transaction as well as the power to decide on the quantity to trade with a TCP, he would not exercise it in the context of day-to-day operations.[^68]

84     Chang did not have full authority on marine fuel sales such that he could give all BP Marine’s deals to PPT.[^69]

##### (5)   Netting agreements

85     According to Chang, the netting agreement was put in place to protect the interest of BP by ensuring that BP was always in a debtor’s position with respect to any TCP. This would help BP avoid the situation of bad debts from TCPs.[^70]

##### (6)   Joint property investments with Koh

86     In 2004 to 2005, Koh was very concerned that he was running a very volatile business and looked for a way to hold assets without using his name. Koh discussed this with Chang and told Chang that he could not find anyone else suitable to help him do that, as Poh was also highly leveraged. Chang’s only concern during the discussion was whether this involved profits from PPT. This was because if the money came from PPT, Chang might be accused of corruption. Koh assured Chang that the funds were not from PPT but from Koh’s other businesses. Koh first suggested to look at properties in Hong Kong and invited Hu and Poh to be involved as well. Eventually, it was decided that it was not viable to invest in Hong Kong and the decision was made to invest in property in Singapore.[^71] From 2006, Chang started looking at properties in Singapore. Koh told Chang to keep him informed before making any purchase.[^72]

87     As at the time of the trial, of the USD3.95 million transferred by Koh, about USD540,000 remained in Chang’s Hong Kong HSBC account. The rest had been invested into the properties and USD400,000 had been invested in Mindchamps Tampines. Chang had in fact cleared the bank account of his own money so that the account could be used entirely for this purpose.[^73]

88     Chang had opened the Hong Kong HSBC account in 2000 or 2001 so that he could withdraw money from the ATM whenever he was in Hong Kong or southern China. Koh had opened his Hong Kong HSBC account around the same time. According to Chang, the timing and quantum of some of the deposits into his Hong Kong HSBC account were determined by Koh, while the rest were requested by him to ensure that there were sufficient funds for investments. It was Koh who wanted the transfers to be conducted in Hong Kong out of convenience to him, and it was not Chang’s request to have the transfers done there. As Chang made frequent business trips to Hong Kong and China, he would drop by the bank to transfer the money when there was a need.[^74]

89     According to Chang, he and Koh wanted to maintain an equal share in the investment assets. They invested in the following properties using the monies transferred by Koh, Chang’s personal funds and bank loans taken by Chang: [^75]

90     Chang had spoken to Koh and had gone with Koh to view Da Silva before it was purchased. Koh was happy with the house. Chang and his family stayed in the house from late 2007 until it was sold. The initial plan was for Chang to stay there for a year, but due to the financial crisis ensuing thereafter, the house could not be sold and Koh agreed that Chang should continue to occupy it. On his part, Chang offered to pay for the renovations and property tax. However, CPIB had commenced investigations in October 2011 and warned Chang not to speak to Koh. Therefore, there was no subsequent discussion between them concerning the returns when the property was sold in August 2012. The profits made was channelled into Limau Purut.[^76]

91     As for Livia, Chang similarly spoke to Koh about the purchase before he bought the unit, but Koh did not wish to view it. Livia was sold in February 2011 because the bank did not want to disburse the loan due to Chang’s civil suit with BP. Chang informed Koh about this and Koh said it was better to sell it first and focus on the civil suit. After the unit was sold, Chang attributed half of the net profits to Koh.[^77]

92     As for the purchase of Ettrick, Koh and Chang initially had some disagreement as it was an old house which needed to be rebuilt. While Chang thought the price was very cheap, Koh was concerned about complaints from neighbours during the construction period. However, Chang managed to convince Koh that he would be able to manage the risk by purchasing insurance. After the reconstruction was completed, Chang needed to stay in the property for at least a year to qualify for property tax rebate. Koh had no objections and said that the issue of payment could be settled upon sale of the property.[^78]

93     During cross-examination, Chang testified that his discussions with Koh concerning capital gains, expenses and rental relating to the investment properties were all conducted orally and nothing was reduced into writing. He added that he did use personal notebooks which he kept in BP Singapore’s office to record some of the conversations he had with Koh concerning the investments as well as the amount in the joint investment funds, how much was used for each project and the balance. However, the notebooks were returned to BP Singapore upon his departure. After Chang left BP Singapore, Livia and Da Silva were sold and the investments were rolled into Limau Purut. As such, he did not keep any further records.[^79]

94     Chang did not speak to Koh before purchasing Limau Purut. The purchase was financed by rolled over funds from Koh, profits from Livia and Da Silva, as well as loans. The rental earned from Limau Purut was to be shared equally and placed back into the pool of funds. There were no further joint investments after this as all of Koh’s money were fully accounted for.[^80]

95     Aside from the above joint investments between Chang and Koh, Chang and his wife had also purchased other properties for investment using their own funds and bank loans. These included:[^81]

96     Chang kept records of each of the property transactions in individual folders in his house and CPIB officers had seized some of those records.[^82]

##### (7)   The Mindchamps business

97     Mindchamps Tampines was first registered under Chang and Mdm Fennie Ong’s names. Chang had asked Koh if the latter was interested in purchasing an existing preschool and Koh was keen because he wanted to diversify his business. Chang drew USD400,000 from the funds transferred by Koh to provide the initial financing for the purchase of the pre-school. Koh’s name was not registered because he wanted to keep it confidential.[^83]

98     As for Mindchamps City Square, the registered shareholders were Koh and Mdm Fennie Ong. Koh’s name was registered because the landlord required a guarantor with good financial standing for the lease. Koh directly contributed $525,000 towards the business[^84] and AB1-59 set out the return of director’s loans given by Koh. During cross-examination, Chang explained that Koh was being repaid $100,000 and $82,500 in November 2014 and February 2015 respectively because there was sufficient cash flow in the company’s bank account. Chang also explained that at the same time, Koh’s share capital was increased from $111,000 to $157,000 without any further cash contribution from Koh.[^85]

99     Chang testified that Koh was in fact very excited with the Mindchamps investments and spent a lot of time discussing business propositions in the pre-school and enrichment business.[^86]

##### (8)   The crisis in December 2009

100    According to Chang, in December 2009, the market conditions were very negative. As BP’s traders did not want to move the price down, BP Marine could not sell anything to the TCPs. Chang intervened and instructed Chua Hwee Cheng to check with the traders for the best price and to offer it to PPT first. As PPT was the largest ex-wharf customer for BP Marine, if PPT were to buy the oil, a large portion of the problem would be solved. In addition, this would allow PPT to ensure that it had oil to supply to BP’s customers in back-to-back transactions. Chang testified that this crisis was the only time he had used his authority to allocate good pricing to TCPs. Chang reiterated that he was not showing favour to PPT but taking action to resolve a crisis situation.[^87]

##### (9)   Chang’s departure from BP Singapore

101    Chang first informed Koh that he was planning to leave BP Singapore to join Brightoil sometime in mid-2009. Koh tried to persuade him not to do so but Chang went ahead as he wanted to follow Kwek Chin Thean, his superior and best friend in BP. In fact, many left BP around the same time. Chang resigned from BP Singapore on 15 June 2010 and was placed on gardening leave from 18 June. On 6 July 2010, he was served with a civil claim and an Anton Piller order by BP. After joining Brightoil and subsequently, OW Bunker, Chang continued to have business dealings with Koh.[^88]

102    Koh’s final transfer for joint investments was on 26 July 2010. When Koh informed Chang of the transfer, Chang told Koh that he would be very busy because he was starting his new job in Brightoil and had a civil suit to attend to. As he would not have the time to conduct the joint investment, he told Koh to stop the investment until further notice.[^89]

##### (10)   Chang’s statements to CPIB

103    On 18 October 2011, Chang was informed in the morning that CPIB officers were looking for him. When he called CPIB and spoke to IO Bay, he was told to proceed to CPIB’s office immediately. Although Chang informed IO Bay that he was required to sign the settlement agreement for the civil suit with BP at 4pm that day, he was told to proceed to CPIB nonetheless. Chang arrived at about 10am and was met by IO Bay. He again told Bay that he had a settlement agreement to sign and requested to postpone the interview to the following day but his request was rejected by IO Bay. During the interview with IO Bay, Chang told IO Bay about the settlement agreement yet again and it was noted in the statement. Chang asked if he could leave before lunch or at about 1 or 2pm but IO Bay said “no”. During cross-examination, Chang testified that although his role in the investigations was initially unclear, it became clear to him, midway through the interview that he was under investigations. Chang’s suspicions then was that BP was out to sabotage him to prevent him from signing the settlement agreement. Chang’s interview with IO Bay concluded after lunch and IO Bay proceeded to record P23 thereafter. Chang affirmed that the contents of P23 were largely recorded based on the information he provided to IO Bay but pointed out errors and inaccuracies in several paragraphs.[^90] Chang testified that he did not correct the inaccuracies as he was in a rush to sign the settlement agreement and wanted to complete the statement as soon as possible. His mind was not on the interview as his priority was to settle the civil suit. Additionally, in relation to \[15\], Chang had informed IO Bay that BK Chua and he had spoken to Koh to get New Orient to increase the amount of back-to-back business with BP Marine but was informed that New Orient would be withdrawing from the market. A couple of months later, Koh told them that he had decided to set up his own company and asked if they could help him become a TCP. On their part, BK Chua and Chang were happy to facilitate by conveying the paperwork to the relevant department for registration and approval. Chang also told IO Bay that it was in BP’s interest to have PPT as its TCP, but this was not recorded in the statement.[^91]

104    During cross-examination, Chang added that he did not have access to his phone at CPIB. During the lunch break at CPIB, he had asked to be given his phone so that he could make calls but his request was rejected by IO Bay. Chang testified that he was in fact hoping to call the other defendants to check with the lawyers what he should do in relation to signing the settlement agreement.[^92]

105    When Chang was asked by IO Bay at \[18\] of P23 about the purpose of the transfers from Koh to him, he tried to avoid answering the question as he had an agreement with Koh to keep the joint investments confidential, and was hoping that Koh would inform CPIB himself. IO Bay suggested many possible reasons, and said that moonlighting was “okay”. As Chang was in a rush to sign the settlement agreement, he took the suggestion and told IO Bay that he was a co-owner of PPT. In Chang’s view, the manner in which the monies were transferred did not make any commercial sense and CPIB would not believe his claim to be a co-owner. He also proceeded to provide his Hong Kong HSBC account number to IO Bay, with the hope that IO Bay would uncover the truth. In Court, Chang emphasised that he was never a co-owner of PPT as the business model was too risky and it would have been in direct conflict of interest with BP. Chang further explained that he was supposed to sign the settlement agreement that afternoon and was worried that should he fail to do so, he would be the lone defendant. At the same time, he wanted to uphold his agreement with Koh and was worried that if he were to tell CPIB about the investments, it would have taken a very long time.[^93]

106    After P23 was recorded, Chang was placed under arrest and released on bail. Chang left CPIB at about 8pm that day and immediately called his lawyer. He learnt that he was the only one who did not sign the settlement agreement and asked if he could still sign the following day. His lawyer informed him to do so the next morning. Chang did not seek advice from his lawyer concerning the investigations then because he believed he did not do anything wrong and CPIB would be able to find out the truth after their investigations. Although Chang retained a criminal lawyer on 25 October 2011, he also did not request the criminal lawyer to write in to clarify the statement he had given.[^94]

107    During cross-examination, when shown the settlement agreement in Exhibit P50, Chang confirmed that the agreement was dated 13 October 2011. Chang added that there were some amendments required and the signing was delayed until 18 October 2011. Subsequently, when shown an exchange of correspondence between his lawyers and BP’s lawyers wherein his lawyers sent the signed settlement agreement to BP’s lawyers with a cover letter dated 14 October 2011 (Exhibits P53 and P54), Chang agreed that the settlement agreement was signed on 13 October 2011. However, he reiterated that he was required to sign other documents in relation to the settlement on 18 October 2011. During re-examination, Chang was referred to emails dated 17 and 18 October 2011 (Exhibit B2-D8) and confirmed that he was in fact required to sign an affidavit on 18 October 2011. As he was unable to do so, he had sworn the affidavit on 19 October 2011 instead (Exhibit B2-D9).[^95]

108    During examination-in-chief, Chang testified that though he expected to return to CPIB soon after, it was only in January 2015 that he was next called up by CPIB. On that occasion, the IO who took over the case showed Chang the bank transfer slips and asked him for the purpose of the transfers. Chang then told the IO that they were for joint investments. Chang divulged this because it had been more than four years since the investigations began and he thought CPIB would have investigated every aspect of the case and Koh would have told them the truth. During cross-examination, Chang confirmed that the date he had returned to CPIB was on 2 February 2015 and the statement in Exhibit P40 was recorded from him. Prior to that, Chang had also attended at CPIB sometime in November 2011 to hand a letter (Exhibit P38) to IO Bay. Chang explained that he did this to ensure that everything he said to IO Bay 18 Oct 2011 was placed on record. Chang also agreed that he had gone to CPIB yet again on 16 January 2012 and a further statement (Exhibit P39) was recorded from him. Chang did not correct the earlier version that he gave IO Bay in P23 as he was hoping that Koh would have, by then, told CPIB the truth.[^96]

#### DW4 Ng Koh Sheng

109    Ng joined BP Marine in April 2001 and left in June or July 2010. His last role in BP Marine was market coordinator. Ng gave evidence concerning the adoption and development of the back-to-back model by BP Marine.[^97]

110    Ng recalled that sometime in 2005, PPT’s employees, Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei, were seconded to BP Marine. On a day-to-day basis, they were tasked to coordinate BP Marine’s operations relating to the loading and supply of bunker, regardless of whether the transaction concerned PPT. Ng’s job was to oversee their work. Due to the nature of their job, Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei had access to information such as the vessel’s name, the grade and quantity of oil ordered, the date and the person to contact. Ng added that generally, IST would not inform BP Marine of shipments of oil coming in. Even in situations where IST needed BP Marine’s help to clear oil from the storage tank to allow the new shipment to be unloaded, IST would only inform BP Marine of the amount and the date by which the oil had to be cleared. Further, only information relating to the rough quantity and deadline for clearance would be passed to the operational staff.[^98]

111    When Ng left BP Singapore, PPT was BP Marine’s largest TCP. PPT distinguished itself from other TCPs as it was responsive, transparent in its dealings with BP, forthcoming in pre-empting complaints from customers, and dealt with quantity issues effectively. At meetings with Koh, Ng did not recall noticing that Koh was fearful of Chang or any of BP’s staff. Disputes were settled amicably with a solution that was agreeable to both parties.[^99]

112    Ng testified that towards the end of 2009, the shipping industry was not doing well and the impact on BP Marine was double-edged such that both ex-wharf sales to TCPs and delivered sales were badly impacted.[^100]

#### DW5 Koh Leong Teck

113    KLT worked in BP Singapore from 1997 to 2013 in the IST department. He was a trader in IST’s fuel oil trading team from 2005 to 2013. The traders in the IST regarded BP Marine as their marketing arm for the bunker business. Since 2006 or 2007, KLT liaised with BP Marine on a daily basis. KLT would discuss with Chua Hwee Cheng’s team on the prices to set for the market on a daily basis, based on market information. The price to be offered would be set by the fuel trading team and BP Marine would bring the price to the market. If BP Marine were unable to sell at the price, they would return to further negotiate with the trading team. KLT would not speak to Chang on pricing.[^101]

114    KLT knew PPT as the biggest TCP with BP Marine. When there was mass resignation from BP Singapore in 2010, KLT stayed and ran the physical trading business while Chang was replaced by Carlos Torres (“Carlos”). Carlos worked together with KLT to stabilise the business and BP’s market share. As PPT was BP’s main barge operator which operated the barge that BP used to deliver fuel to customers, BP Singapore needed to try to keep PPT as its TCP. Carlos told KLT that PPT wanted to meet with him and he agreed to the meeting. At the lunch meeting, KLT met Koh for the first time and Koh asked whether KLT was going to continue working for BP. KLT’s impression was that PPT was worried that BP’s fuel trading team was unstable and would not be able to support BP Marine’s business. KLT assumed that Koh had heard of him through the BP Marine team and wanted to confirm that he would remain in BP Singapore. KLT assured Koh that he would stay to build a team and asked PPT to stay with BP.[^102]

115    Sometime in 2012, BP’s management requested that Carlos diversify the manner in which BP Marine ran the marine business as it was too dependent on one party. As such, Carlos and KLT expanded to a total of three barge operators, including Vermont Bunkering and Fratelli.[^103]

## The rebuttal evidence

116    At the close of the defence’s case, the prosecution applied to recall IO Bay and IO Lim, and to call 2 additional witnesses to provide rebuttal evidence relating to issues raised concerning Koh’s and Chang’s statements which were admitted into evidence during the defence’s case.

117    Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions on the application, I allowed the prosecution to recall/call the following witnesses to provide rebuttal evidence relating to specific issues raised during the defence’s case:[^104]

## Further cross-examination of Koh

118    Sometime after directions were given for the filing of closing submissions at the close of the defence’s case, the prosecution made an application to recall Koh for further cross-examination. This was because the prosecution only became aware of the following three documents after the defence had closed its case:[^106]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="17.5835167033407%"> <col width="31.0062012402481%"> <col width="37.8875775155031%"> <col width="13.5227045409082%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Document date</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Document title</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Parties</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Exhibit</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 January 2006</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Trust Deed in respect of United Maritime Pte Ltd</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Poh Fu Tek – the trustee</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Koh Seng Lee – the beneficiary</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P55</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 January 2006</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Trust Deed in respect of Sino International Shipping Pte Ltd</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Poh Fu Tek – the trustee</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Koh Seng Lee – the beneficiary</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P56</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 September 2006</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Trust Deed in respect of Sino Tankers Pte Ltd</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Poh Fu Tek – the trustee</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Koh Seng Lee – the beneficiary</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P57</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

119    As the defence did not object to the application, I allowed Koh to be recalled for further cross-examination in relation to these documents.

120    Koh agreed that he had signed all three documents. He explained that after Poh learnt that he had wanted to build up his own fleet, Poh asked the company secretary to prepare P55 and P56 in January 2006 and asked him to consider joining Poh’s companies instead. Subsequently, Poh gave Koh P57 to sign. At the material time, Koh understood that if he wished to join Poh’s companies, he was required to pay for 50 percent of the shares. Sometime after signing P57, Koh informed Poh that he would still prefer to build up his own fleet. Koh explained that if he were to join the companies, he would need to look into their accounts and inform the banks. He found this too complicated and preferred to build up a fleet of his own. Thereafter, Koh treated the deeds as if they did not exist because he never invested any money to join the companies. Koh was unable to recall if he had kept a copy of the trust deeds.[^107]

## Analysis of the evidence and the Court’s findings

### The Law

121    Sections 5 and 6 of the PCA stated:

> **5**.    Any person who shall by himself or by or in conjunction with any other person —

>> (_a_)    corruptly solicit or receive, or agree to receive for himself, or for any other person; or

>> (_b_)    corruptly give, promise or offer to any person whether for the benefit of that person or of another person,

> any gratification as an inducement to or reward for, or otherwise on account of —

>> (i)    any person doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed; or

>> (ii)   any member, officer or servant of a public body doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed, in which such public body is concerned,

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

> **6.**  If —

>> (_a_)    any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business;

>> (_b_)    any person corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business; or

>> …

> he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

122    To prove the charges under sections 6(b) and 6(a) of the PCA against Koh and Chang respectively, the prosecution had to prove the following elements of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt:[^108]

> (a)     First element – Koh gave / agreed to give gratification and Chang (as an agent) obtained / agreed to accept gratification;

> (b)     Second element – as an inducement for Chang to do an act in relation to his principal’s (BP Singapore’s) affairs, _to wit_, advance the business interest of PPT with BP;

> (c)     Third element – there was an objective corrupt element in the transactions;

> (d)     Fourth element – Koh and Chang acted with guilty knowledge.

123    As for the charges under section 5 of the PCA, the prosecution had to prove:

> (a)     First element – Koh gave and Chang received gratification;

> (b)     Second element – on account of Chang advancing the business interest of PPT with BP;

> (c)     Third element – there was an objective corrupt element in the transactions;

> (d)     Fourth element – Koh and Chang acted with guilty knowledge.

124    The first element would be the _actus reas_ of the offences while the other three elements pertained to the _mens rea_ of the giver / receiver of the gratification.

125    The second and third elements would normally form part of the same factual enquiry and the test was an objective one, based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. In conducting the enquiry, the Court would find or infer what the offender intended when he entered into the transaction. The question essentially was whether the giver gave, and the recipient received, the gratification as a _quid pro quo_ for conferring a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver.[^109] The surrounding circumstances of the case such as surreptitiousness or furtiveness of the transaction, the size of the gratification, relationship of the parties, would, where relevant, assist the judge in inferring what the intentions of the parties were.[^110] While the contravention of some rules or laws could assist the Court in deciding whether the intended transaction was corrupt according to the objective criteria, a corrupt element would not be constituted merely because there had been a contravention of the rules or laws.[^111] On the other hand, the Court would look beyond the pretext or guise which the parties clothe the transaction with, to determine the presence of an objective corrupt element in the transaction and the true nature of the arrangement.[^112]

126    The fourth element of guilty knowledge referred to whether the accused knew or realised what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard, and the test was a subjective one.[^113]

127    In relation to a charge under section 6(a) of the PCA, once the above elements have been proven, section 9(a) of the PCA provided that the recipient (i.e. the agent) would be guilty of the relevant offence notwithstanding that the recipient did not have the power, right or opportunity or the intention to do any act or show or forbear to show any favour or disfavour to any person, or that the recipient did not in fact do so. Similarly, under section 9(b) of the PCA, the giver in a charge under section 6(b) of the PCA would be guilty of the offence even if the receiver did not have the power, right or opportunity to do any act or show or forbear to show favour or disfavour.

128    Turning to the present case, as the _actus reas_ of the offences were not in dispute, the case primarily turned on the Court’s findings in relation to the _mens rea_ elements of the offences. To discern the intention behind the transactions set out in the charges, I had recourse to the parties’ account when they were first questioned concerning the same. In the following analysis, I would start by discussing the evidence and my findings concerning the intention behind the fund transfers as set out in the first 19 charges against Koh and Chang, before turning to consider the Mindchamps payments in the 20th charge.

### Koh’s and Chang’s explanations for the fund transfers to CPIB

129    Chang and Koh were first called upon by CPIB to explain the transfers and payments, about a year after the final transfer of funds in July 2010. Both Koh and Chang were interviewed on 18 October 2011 and provided statements (P1 and P23) to the investigation officers. The following day, Koh returned to CPIB to provide a further statement (P2). Having carefully perused the statements, I discerned a common thread that ran through both their explanations for the fund transfers:[^114]

> (a)     It was Chang who suggested that Koh set up PPT to be a TCP with BP Singapore.

> (b)     The understanding between them was that Chang would help PPT.

> (c)     Chang regarded himself as a shadow partner of PPT.

> (d)     The monies transferred by Koh to Chang were described by Chang to be his “share” of profits as a partner in PPT.

130    In his statements, Koh elaborated on his reasons for making the fund transfers to Chang:

> (a)     Chang gave Koh the impression that he had full authority in marine fuel sales in BP and that he could help PPT to become a TCP. If PPT maintained a good standard, Chang could favour PPT and give all BP deals to PPT.

> (b)     Koh understood that Chang had the power to “make or break” PPT.

> (c)     Chang was the one who asked for money from Koh. Koh understood that Chang regarded himself as having “invested” in PPT. Although Koh did not consider Chang as his business partner in PPT, he could not afford to offend Chang as he knew that Chang controlled the fate of PPT. Chang had the power to terminate PPT’s status as a TCP.

> (d)     Between 2005 and 2010 when Chang left BP Singapore, Chang had asked Koh for money on various occasions and Koh would transfer the money without question.

131    During the trial, both Koh and Chang sought to dispute the veracity of these statements, and to explain why neither of them informed CPIB of the true purpose of the fund transfers, which was that the monies were transferred for the purpose of joint investments.

#### P1 and P2 were accurately recorded from Koh

132    I shall first deal with Koh’s contentions. Koh alleged that his poor command of English resulted in various inaccuracies in P1, the first statement recorded from him in English.

133    Against Koh’s claim that he lacked proficiency in English, the Court heard evidence from four investigation officers (IO Wee, IO Bay, IO Lim and IO Fong) who recorded various statements from him in English between October 2011 and August 2015. All four investigation officers found Koh to be proficient or competent in the English language. In particular, IO Wee, who was himself not conversant in Mandarin, testified that Koh confirmed that he was conversant in English when IO Wee began the interview prior to recording P1.[^115] In fact, after P1 was printed out, Koh was able to read through P1 and personally penned a number of amendments, elaborations and clarifications in English.[^116] Next, while IO Bay (who recorded statements both in Mandarin and English) agreed that Koh was more comfortable speaking in Mandarin, he testified that he found Koh’s proficiency in both languages to be “very close” and Koh could “understand English perfectly”.[^117] IO Bay added that there were “plenty of times” when Koh corrected his verbalisations as he typed out P2 in English.[^118] IO Lim, who recorded a number of statements in English from Koh, similarly testified that Koh was conversant in English, capable of understanding the questions he had asked in English and could provide his responses in English. IO Lim also recalled that after Koh read his statement, he had highlighted amendments he wished to make to IO Lim. In addition, while IO Lim noticed that Koh would lapse into Mandarin and Hokkien at times, they were conversing principally in English.[^119] IO Fong recorded Koh’s statement in P35 in English on 13 Feb 2015. She had checked with Koh whether he was able to speak, read and understand English. Further, in the course of recording his statement, she would continue to check with him whether he was comfortable with English as well. IO Fong documented Koh’s response in the first paragraph of the statement, reflecting that he was able to “speak, read and understand English, Chinese and Hokkien”.[^120]

134    During cross-examination, when Koh was confronted with the amendments in P1, he agreed that they were all written by him but claimed that he was unsure whether it was he or IO Wee who initiated the amendments. He also alleged that IO Wee assisted him with the choice of words and spelling. In addition, while Koh confirmed that he told the IO Wee he was conversant in English, he alleged that he had “no choice” because IO Wee could not converse in Mandarin. Koh added that he was “very sure” that he told IO Wee that he was not comfortable with English.[^121] It was thus interesting to note that while the defence had cross-examined IO Wee on Koh’s discomfort with English when P1 was admitted into evidence, none of these specific allegations put forth by Koh during the defence’s case was put to IO Wee. Tellingly, IO Fong’s evidence concerning Koh’s confirmation of his competence in the English language was totally unchallenged by the defence. In my view, there was really no reason why IO Wee would have insisted on interviewing Koh and recording P1 in English had Koh raised an issue concerning this. In fact, IO Wee had readily agreed with the defence that it would have been easy for him to arrange for a Mandarin speaking officer to record Koh’s statement and he would have done so if he found that Koh was more comfortable in Mandarin.[^122] Having carefully assessed the evidence, I found that Koh’s allegations were afterthoughts trumped up by him to cast doubt on the accuracy of P1 (as well as the other statements recorded from him) in an attempt to distance himself from the parts of his statements which did not accord with or directly contradicted his defence.

135    Aside from the above observations by the investigation officers, the fact that Koh was capable of providing and understanding his statements in English was reinforced by the following objective facts:

> (a)     After P1 and P2 were recorded, Koh proceeded to give no less than six other statements to CPIB officers in English, over a period of about two-and-a-half years.[^123] These included statements in which Koh provided details concerning the joint investments he allegedly made with Chang. In fact, Koh’s cautioned statement which was handwritten by him in English was admitted as a defence exhibit (B1-D6). When it was pointed out to Koh during cross-examination that he chose to write his defence in English, Koh alleged that he had enquired if he could write in Chinese but IO Lim advised him to write in English and even taught him how to write it. Koh further claimed that without IO Lim’s help he would not have been able to write his defence in English as he “could only write in Mandarin”.[^124] IO Lim firmly refuted Koh’s allegations and explained that since Koh was denying the charge, he had no reason to stop Koh from writing Koh’s response to the charge in whatever language Koh chose.[^125] IO Lim’s evidence was that he read the charge in B1-D6 to Koh in English and Koh did not ask for a translation.[^126] IO Lim’s evidence on this point was not challenged by Koh. Having carefully considered the evidence in this regard, I found that this was yet another attempt by Koh to cast unfounded aspersions on the investigation officers to bolster his claim of being made to provide his statements in English.

> (b)     Koh communicated with Chang by SMS largely in English (P49). Hu Ning also received SMS messages in English from Koh.[^127] While the defence attempted to downplay the significance of this fact by pointing to Koh’s simple and monosyllabic responses, the fact remained that Koh employed English in his day-to-day SMS communications, even with his close associates and friends. In addition, upon closer scrutiny, it was apparent that Koh did in fact send moderately long messages to Chang in clear English. In my view, this indicated that Koh was exaggerating his discomfort communicating in English and that he was unable to write in English without assistance.

136    In support of its case that Koh was inept in the English language, the defence had pointed to the fact that Koh had obtained his highest qualifications at the 1977 GCE O-levels in Chinese (B1-D1). In my view, the mere lack of paper qualifications from his school years did not mean that Koh would be unable to achieve a good, working command of the language after more than 20 years working in the oil trading industry. I should also mention that, in assessing Koh’s command of English, I had considered the evidence of Chang and Hu that Koh mainly communicated with them in Mandarin and Hokkien. To me, any inclination on the part of Koh to communicate with friends and business associates informally in his mother tongue or dialect would similarly not detract from the fact that he was, at the same time, able to communicate effectively in English. In addition, while Hu observed that Koh required assistance when he needed to speak in English at meetings, he agreed that since he spoke with Koh in Mandarin or Hokkien, he was unable to judge how good or bad Koh’s English was.[^128]

137    It was perhaps most significant that Koh’s account in P1 was reinforced in P2, which was recorded in Mandarin from him the very next day, by a different investigation officer. Indeed, while Koh described his monetary transactions with Chang as loans in P1, Koh no longer referred to them as such in P2. Instead, in P2, he elaborated on his reasons for acceding to Chang’s requests for money “without question”, reinforced the control Chang had over the fate of PPT, and reiterated that Chang could “make or break” PPT. When confronted with the contents of P1 and P2 in Court, Koh alleged that he had told IO Wee that Chang did not have a share in PPT but IO Wee and IO Bay did not believe him. Koh also vacillated in his evidence as to whether he told IO Wee that the transfers were for joint investments.[^129] However, not only were these allegations not put to IO Wee and IO Bay, they fell far short of offering a coherent explanation for the incriminating contents of P1 and P2. On the contrary, even in P34, which was recorded more than three years later on 28 January 2015, Koh continued to echo his statements in P1 and P2 that he agreed to give Chang money because he thought it would be difficult for them to work together otherwise. Koh also added, damningly, that he knew Chang was trying to make use of Chang’s position to pressurise him into giving Chang the money as Chang had the power to cease PPT’s partnership with BP. Indeed, even in P35, where Koh stated that the funds transferred were for property investments, he mentioned that he was initially hesitant about Chang’s proposal to help him invest in properties. He also stated that he was “stressed” as he did not wish to offend Chang and admitted that he thought it was it was not very appropriate to give money to Chang.

138    During his testimony in Court, Koh also sought to explain why he failed to mention in P1 and P2 that the transfers were for property investments. Koh testified that he thought that he was not being investigated, so he took things quite lightly and decided not to disclose the joint investments to the investigation officer as the transfers had nothing to do with BP. Instead, he thought that the investigations were targeted at Chang, and, as long as he disclosed that the monies transferred to Chang came from him, he would be able to help Chang. In my view, Koh’s explanations could not withstand scrutiny. Firstly, even if Koh thought he was not under investigations, there was no reason for him to keep the joint investments with Chang a secret from CPIB. This was especially so when section 27 of the PCA (concerning his legal obligation to give information) was brought to his attention when both P1 and P2 were recorded, and Koh admitted he was cautioned to tell the truth before giving his statements.[^130] More importantly, it did not make sense how Koh, by incriminating both himself and Chang in P1 and P2, could think that he was helping Chang. In fact, Koh did not mention any joint investments with Chang even in his statements in P36 and P34 given to CPIB in early 2015. It was also telling that when Koh realised that he was under investigations when P33 was recorded from him on 4 Feb 2015, he expressly denied engaging in any joint property investments with Chang, even though pointed questions were asked of him in that regard. Under cross-examination, while Koh disputed the accuracy of the statement, and even claimed to have expressly told IO Lim that Ettrick was a joint investment, he did not offer any explanation why it was stated otherwise in the statement.[^131]

139    In conclusion, having carefully considered the evidence available before me, I found that P1 and P2 were accurately recorded from Koh.

#### P23 corroborated P1 and P2

140    As observed at \[129\], Chang’s statement in P23 corroborated P1 and P2 on several material points:

> (a)     It was Chang who suggested that Koh set up PPT to be a TCP with BP Singapore.

> (b)     The understanding between them was that Chang would help PPT.

> (c)     Chang regarded himself as a shadow partner of PPT.

> (d)     The monies transferred by Koh to Chang were described by Chang to be his “share” of profits as a partner in PPT.

141    In Court, Chang disputed the accuracy of the contents of P23 and attempted to explain why he did not inform CPIB that the money transferred by Koh were for joint investments. Chang alleged that on 18 October 2011, he was in a hurry to sign the settlement agreement with BP. As such he was in a rush to complete his statement and leave CPIB. In addition, Koh had wanted to keep the joint investments a secret. Therefore, Chang adopted the suggestion of “moonlighting” from IO Bay while giving his statement, as that was to him the most unbelievable explanation.

142    Having carefully considered the evidence, I did not find Chang’s explanations to be credible. Firstly, the objective evidence showed that Chang had signed the settlement agreement in P54 on 13 October 2011, several days before he was first called up by CPIB on 18 October 2011. In addition, even if Chang were scheduled to sign an affidavit (which was required by the settlement terms) on 18 October 2011, the objective evidence also showed that it was not due until 20 October 2011. As a matter of fact, Chang did sign the affidavit on the morning of 19 October 2011, well within the deadline. Further, Chang agreed in Court that he did not tell IO Bay that he must sign the settlement documents on 18 October 2011. To me, the above factors, taken together, indicated that Chang could not have been so anxious to sign the affidavit on 18 October 2011 that he would simply rush through his statement with IO Bay, just to get it over and done with. This was especially when, by his own account, Chang realised that he was being investigated by CPIB in connection with his dealings with Koh and Poh during his interview with IO Bay, even before P23 was recorded. Chang testified that he was convinced that this was a ploy by BP to sabotage him. Chang also mentioned in Court that when Koh allegedly asked Chang to help him find a way to hold his assets without using his name, Chang’s primary concern was whether the money came from PPT as he might be accused of corruption.[^132] Thus, it would make no sense for Chang to invent an elaborate tale about himself receiving profits as a shadow partner of PPT, which would expose both Koh and himself to possible allegations of conflict of interest or even corruption.[^133] Instead, if Chang were indeed eager to leave CPIB to sign documents relating to the settlement, and suspected that BP was trying to do him in, the simplest and most straightforward thing to do would be to inform IO Bay that the fund transfers had nothing to do with PPT or BP. As suggested by the prosecution to Chang during the trial, he could also have told CPIB that Koh had wanted to keep the real reasons for the transfers confidential and ask that CPIB check with Koh on this.

143    That the contents of P23 could not have been the result of Chang rushing to finish it was reinforced by the fact that he did nothing over the next few years to correct any alleged inaccuracies or untruths therein. This was the case even though he returned to CPIB in November 2011 to hand the letter in P38 to CPIB to ensure that everything he said to IO Bay on 18 October 2011 was placed on record; and had a further statement (P39) recorded from him on 16 January 2012. Chang even went on to reinforce the contents of P23 in his further statement P40, which was recorded from him on 2 February 2015 by IO Lim. Chang was given his earlier statements, including P23 to read but did not seek to make any amendments or clarifications. Instead, in answering a question from IO Lim as to why Koh had an understanding that he was a co-owner of PPT, Chang again mentioned that he had asked Koh to start PPT and added in handwriting that he “left as a shadow partner”. He also admitted to recommending PPT to be BP’s TCP and explained that he did not declare his vested interest in PPT because others might see it as a conflict of interest. After being confronted with the contents of P40 during cross-examination, Chang attempted, during re-examination, to explain the parts which were inconsistent with his version in Court, by claiming that he was merely clarifying or explaining his statement in P23.[^134] Having carefully reviewed and considered his explanations, I found them contrived and unconvincing.

144    Indeed Chang’s explanation in Court for choosing to adopt the moonlighting suggestion – that it was unbelievable because PPT’s business model was risky – was illogical in itself. This was because Chang had also claimed in P23 that Koh would transfer money to him when PPT made money and would not do so when PPT was not profitable. This clearly indicated that any risk in PPT’s business model did not reside with him as a shadow partner. Hence, there was really nothing objectively unbelievable about his claim that he had a vested interest in PPT. In addition, even if Chang had wanted to adopt IO Bay’s suggestion of moonlighting as a smokescreen, this would not explain his admission that he had suggested to Koh to set up PPT and had an understanding with Koh that he would help PPT. Chang’s version in Court that he had told IO Bay details concerning BK Chua’s involvement in requesting Koh to increase back-to-back business with BP and that it was Koh who decided on his own to set up PPT [^135] was never put to IO Bay when P23 was admitted into evidence. In fact, it was hard to see how Chang could have told IO Bay that he had nothing to do with the setting up of PPT but at the same time claim that he was a co-owner.[^136] It was interesting to note that when Chang was confronted with the inconsistencies between his version in Court and P23, he insisted that he did not lie in his statement, even though he claimed that some things stated therein were not true.[^137] In my view, the above indicated that what Chang stated in P23 was not the result of him adopting any suggestion made by IO Bay. Instead, Chang had volunteered the contents of the statement to IO Bay of his own accord.

145    In the final analysis, it was pertinent to note that despite Koh’s allegations of inaccuracies in P1 due to his poor command of English and Chang’s allegations that he adopted IO Bay’s “moonlighting” suggestion, Koh’s and Chang’s statements (P1, P2 and P23) were in sync on several material aspects such as those concerning the setting-up of PPT and the understanding between them. In my view, this was not due to sheer coincidence but revealed the true nature of the monetary transactions between them.

146    Thus, having carefully studied and considered the evidence and submissions by the parties in this regard, I found that the statements in P1, P2 and P23 had accurately captured the information concerning the transfers and payments which Koh and Chang had conveyed to the respective recording officers.

### The fund transfers were objectively corrupt and Koh and Chang had acted with guilty knowledge

147    Having carefully studied Koh’s and Chang’s explanations for the fund transfers in their statements, I found that they revealed the true purpose and understanding for these transfers as follows:

> (a)     Chang had initiated the setting up of PPT by Koh.

> (b)     The understanding between Koh and Chang was that Chang would facilitate the appointment of PPT as a TCP and help PPT.

> (c)     Although Chang did not invest any money in PPT, Chang regarded himself as a co-owner or shadow partner of PPT.

> (d)     While Koh did not regard Chang to be his partner in PPT, he understood that Chang, in his capacity as a manager in BP Marine, was in a position to “make or break” PPT.

> (e)     Chang had asked for and received money from Koh which Chang described as his share of profits from PPT.

> (f)     Koh had given the money to Chang upon Chang’s request as he did not want to offend Chang, so as to keep PPT’s business relationship with BP intact.

148    The above account given by Koh and Chang of the arrangement and understanding between them as well as the reasons for the fund transfers were consistent with, and buttressed by, other evidence before the Court:

> (a)     Firstly, the evidence showed that Chang was in a position to influence PPT’s appointment as BP’s TCP. It was undisputed that Chang could recommend the appointment of TCPs. His admission in P40 that he had recommended PPT to be a counterparty to BP Singapore[^138] was corroborated by Koh’s statements in P1, P2 and P35.[^139] This contradicted Chang’s claim in Court that he did not do so but merely facilitated the paperwork. Further, it was undisputed that in his capacity as manager of BP Marine, Chang also had the authority to terminate or replace TCPs.[^140] Thus, Koh’s concern that this might happen should he refuse to pay Chang[^141] was certainly not without basis.

> (b)     Secondly, the evidence showed that Chang was in a position to, and did advance PPT’s interest in its dealings with BP. Chang had the authority to determine the margin on back-to-back transactions as well as decide upon the quantity to trade with each counterparty.[^142] Chang was also able to allocate trades with good pricing to TCPs and admitted to exercising his power in December 2009 in favour of PPT.[^143] While Chang alleged in Court that this was done to resolve a “crisis situation” at that time, this was not the reason mentioned in the statements he gave to CPIB, even though he was shown the instructions he sent to Chua Hwee Cheng via SMS.[^144] On the contrary, he explained in P23 that it was “normal business strategy” to “take care of its biggest partner first” and “naturally the good terms will go to \[PPT\]”.[^145] Chang also clearly acknowledged that this was advantageous to PPT as he went on to emphasised that even if he were not a shadow partner in PPT, he would have done the same. In P45, Chang expounded on this and claimed that he gave PPT the contract terms with better pricing because PPT had the experience in dealing with BP’s long-term customers and it would reduce the risk faced by PPT. Chang also added in writing that such good pricing terms required higher level of service.[^146] In assessing the evidence in this regard, I had also considered Ng’s testimony that towards the end of 2009, the entire shipping industry was not doing well and all the suppliers were struggling to sell oil.[^147] While that might have been the case, it did not necessary indicate that this was the reason why Chang had given instructions to channel all the favourable terms to PPT. It was pertinent to note that even Hu, who was Chua Hwee Cheng’s supervisor, was oblivious to the fact that Chang had given instructions to Chua Hwee Cheng to allocate the good prices to PPT or the circumstances under which Chang had done so.[^148] Having carefully considered the point, I disbelieved Chang’s claim that he had awarded the good terms to PPT to resolve a crisis. Instead, I found that he had simply favoured PPT under the guise of “business strategy”.

> (c)     Thirdly, Chang had shared BP’s confidential information with Koh. The prosecution highlighted two SMS messages in AB1-42 and AB1-44 which Chang had sent to Koh in 2009. In relation to AB1-42, Chang had informed Koh that BP Singapore’s oil was coming in the next day and told Koh to “sell as much as possible \[before\] premium collapses”. The defence led evidence from Koh and Hu that such information concerning BP’s oil arriving was available to Koh’s staff working in BP at that time. I noted however, that this was directly contradicted by Ng’s evidence that the IST oil traders would usually not divulge when the oil they bought was coming in, even to BP Marine. As the officer tasked to oversee the work of PPT’s staff (Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei) in BP’s office, Ng also emphasised that the operational staff would only be given information on a need-to-know basis, without unnecessary details. Further, they would not have access to pricing information.[^149] Thus, even if Jack Kwek and Teng Lip Wei might have been privy to some information indicating shipments of oil arriving, they would not have been given the details, including specifically when and how much oil would be arriving. Ng’s evidence dovetailed that given by Chris Lu, who testified that information about BP’s oil coming in was BP’s proprietary information and should not be shared with third parties, including TCPs.[^150] In addition, while Koh claimed that the information did not mean anything to him and he did not act on the same[^151], it did not mean that the information was not confidential to BP. Turning to the SMS message in AB1-44, this was a message in which Chang had forwarded Koh his instructions to Chua Hwee Cheng, including those concerning the trading volume with different TCPs in the next quarter and the internal pricing that Chua Hwee Cheng was to obtain from the IST traders. Based on the evidence given by Chris Lu and Ms Zapiecki, this SMS message contained BP’s confidential information relating to internal pricing and allocation of volumes between TCPs,[^152] the sending of which infringed BP’s guidelines.[^153] Again, although Koh claimed that he did not do anything in response to this message, this was clear evidence that Chang had shared BP’s confidential information with Koh.

> (d)     Fourthly, it could not be disputed that PPT benefitted from being BP Singapore’s TCP. As a newly incorporated company in 2001, it was certainly to PPT’s advantage to be appointed as an oil supermajor’s TCP within the same year. Koh attested to this in his testimony in Court and listed the following advantages of being BP’s TCP:

>> (i)       It was easier to buy oil from BP as well as sell oil back to BP.

>> (ii)       BP was an established international company with its own customer base and a large volume of trades.

>> (iii)       Pursuant to the netting agreement, PPT was able to offset payments with BP.[^154]

This was echoed by Hu, who testified that the biggest advantage of being BP’s TCP was that of a fixed and steady flow of business and a wider array of business opportunities available.[^155] Hu also agreed that the netting agreement also helped the TCPs avoid having to pay banking fees for each transaction and the need to pay BP immediately for the ex-wharf trade.[^156] In addition, as PPT did not have its own bunker supply licence which was required to deliver oil directly to the vessels, PPT needed to rely on BP’s licence for this purpose.[^157] Indeed, the objective facts showed that PPT prospered as BP’s TCP. Over time, PPT’s traded volume with BP grew, and between 2005 to 2010, BP was the largest trading partner of PPT, comprising 80 to 90 percent of PPT’s total traded volume.[^158] Concurrently, PPT’s accounts showed that its profit also grew steadily during the same period (except for a dip in 2009) from S$235,360 in financial year ending March 2005 to USD1,179,373 in financial year ending March 2010.[^159] It was thus interesting to note that Koh’s payments to Chang also began during this period of growth for PPT. Koh’s election to remain as BP’s TCP, even though he was invited by Chang to join the latter at Brightoil, was further testament of the commercial viability and value of PPT’s relationship with BP Singapore. The monthly figures for the period January 2008 to July 2010 showed that PPT was entrenched as BP’s largest TCP, and its trades with BP grew to exceed 60 percent of BP’s total delivered sales for some months in 2010. Further, in 2010, 80 to 90 percent of BP’s back-to-back trades were concentrated in PPT and Vermont Bunkering (a company in which Koh had a 24.5 percent stake).[^160] During the trial, the defence led evidence in support of their case that PPT had grown to become BP’s largest TCP based on its own merits of being reliable, transparent and willing to adhere to and comply with BP’s requirements. However, even if this were true, it did not undermine the prosecution’s contention that the setting up of PPT and having it serve as BP’s TCP was part of the corrupt scheme from which Chang extracted gratifications for himself, and that Koh was willing to pay Chang to keep PPT’s relationship with BP intact. Indeed, PPT’s growth and prosperity during Chang’s watch in BP Marine would go towards confirming Koh’s impression of Chang having “full authority” on marine fuel sales and the ability to “make or break” PPT.[^161]

149    Having reviewed the full facts and circumstances of the case, I found that the aforesaid arrangement and understanding between Koh and Chang in relation to PPT clearly linked the fund transfers as set out in the 1st to 19th charges as _quid pro quo_ for Chang advancing the business interest of PPT with BP. Further, it clothed the fund transfers with an objective corrupt element and imputed Koh and Chang with corrupt knowledge. This was especially so when one considered the other surrounding circumstances of the transactions:

> (a)     The large quantum of money transferred resulted in Chang admittedly “earning” more from PPT than from his principal, BP Singapore.[^162]

> (b)     The fund transfers were done surreptitiously, through bank accounts in Hong Kong.

> It was not disputed that the funds were first transferred by Koh to Chang in Hong Kong. In their submissions, the defence argued that this did not indicate any surreptitiousness on Koh and Chang’s part as the accounts were opened prior to the offence period when both frequently travelled to Hong Kong. It was also submitted that the transfers were done in Hong Kong because the initial discussions were for property investments in Hong Kong or China and the monies came from profits generated in Hong Kong by Koh’s businesses there. Furthermore, the fact that the transfers were effected through bank accounts spoke to the transparency of the transactions and if the intention were to hide the transfers, Chang would not have transferred the money back into his bank accounts in Singapore and purchased properties in his own name.

> Having carefully considered the evidence, I disagreed with the defence’s submissions that the transfers were not surreptitious. Firstly, Koh’s and Chang’s evidence in Court that it was Koh who initiated the transfers in Hong Kong was contradicted by Koh’s statements in P2[^163] and P36[^164]. In these statements, Koh said that the transfers were done in Hong Kong on Chang’s behest and that Koh did not know the reason but suspected it could be that Chang did not want other people to know about the payments. Secondly, Chang conceded in Court that since the decision had been made to invest in Singapore properties prior to Koh’s first transfer of funds, it would have been more convenient and “made more sense” to set up an account in Singapore to receive the monies.[^165] Instead, Chang transferred the funds from his Hong Kong account into several bank accounts in Singapore and the funds were intermingled with other monies in those accounts. Finally, it was precisely due to the funds being transferred between foreign bank accounts that CPIB had expended much time and effort to obtain the bank statements in order to understand the full extent of the transactions and trace the funds. The above clearly indicated that the transfers were anything but transparent.

> (c)     Chang and Koh were knowingly acting in breach of BP’s policies and guidelines.

> In P35, Koh stated categorically that Chang was not entitled to a share of PPT’s profits. While he claimed in P35 that the fund transfers were for joint investments, he agreed that it was not appropriate for him to give money to Chang even for that purpose as Chang was employed by BP Singapore and they had a working relationship with each other. [^166] Koh reiterated this in P36 where he noted that there would be a conflict of interest.[^167] Chang similarly mentioned in P23 that he should not be seen as having an interest in PPT which was having a business relationship with BP.[^168] He added in P40 that he did not want BP to know that he and Koh had a joint venture business as there would be a conflict of interest.[^169] He also admitted that he did not make a declaration of his vested interest in PPT or that he received money from Koh, adding that BP would regard that as a conflict of interest.[^170]

150    I should highlight that before arriving at my findings, I had reviewed and considered the evidence and submissions put forth by the defence in support of their case that these could not have been corrupt payments. These included:

> (a)     Koh was not fearful of Chang;

> (b)     BP benefited from having PPT as its TCP and continued its dealings with PPT long after Chang’s departure;

> (c)     The fact that the transfers exceeded PPT’s profits over the same period;

> (d)     The first transfer took place long after the incorporation of PPT and their appointment as TCP to BP; and

> (e)     The final transfer was made after Chang’s departure from BP.

151    During the trial, the defence highlighted two incidents to demonstrate that Koh was not fearful of offending Chang, contrary to what he had stated in his statements. Firstly, during the Hanjin incident, Koh was not afraid to refuse BP’s request to pay compensation to BP’s customer and had a heated exchange with Chang. Secondly, Koh had declined Chang’s request to replace all his bunker clerks in relation to the cappuccino incident. In my view, the defence has misconstrued the apprehension expressed by Koh in his statements. Having scrutinised Koh’s statements, it was clear to me that Koh’s fear was not in relation to offending Chang _per se._ Instead, Koh feared offending Chang _if he refused to pay Chang when Chang asked for money_. On the other hand, the fact that Koh was not afraid to contradict Chang when PPT’s interests was at stake, was entirely consistent with the prosecution’s case that Koh was greasing Chang’s palms to protect and advance those very same interests.

152    Next, the fact that BP allegedly “benefited” from having PPT as its TCP did not necessary lead to the conclusion that the monetary transactions between Koh and Chang could not have been tainted by corruption. As mentioned by Chang in P23 “\[PPT\] and I depends (_sic_) on a performing BP. … The more customers I get for BP, the more BP would then pass to \[PPT\]”. Conversely, Chang must have known that Koh would have no reason to pay Chang money to advance PPT’s business interest with BP if BP Marine’s business were to flounder and fail, resulting in little or no business flowing from BP’s trade with its customers to PPT. That BP actively retained PPT as its TCP after Chang’s departure and continued working with PPT for another five years was, in my view, a reflection of how BP had, as a result of Chang’s advancement of PPT’s interest, become overly dependent on one main TCP.

153    As for the payments commencing several years after PPT was first appointed TCP, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the mutual understanding reached at the inception of PPT formed the basis for these payments. As I had noted earlier in these grounds, the commencement and continuation of payments to Chang coincided with the years of steady growth in profitability on the part of PPT. In my view, it was not incongruous for Chang to start asking for payment from Koh when PPT’s business flourished.

154    In the same vein, the fact that the final transfer was made shortly after Chang’s departure from BP, did not necessarily imply that the entire series of transfers and payments over the period of four years were for _bona fide_ purposes. To my mind, it was not illogical or irrational for Koh to continue to accede to Chang’s request for money amidst the mass exodus from BP until there was greater clarity where PPT stood with BP Singapore in the aftermath. As it turned out, Koh did not have to wait long for an answer as the evidence of KLT showed that BP had provided Koh with the assurance he sought, at a lunch meeting, not long after Chang’s departure.

155    As for the quantum of the payments exceeding the profits of PPT over the same period, I agreed with prosecution’s submissions that PPT stood at the core of a network of companies which Koh had a stake in, and which stood to benefit from PPT’s business relationship with BP. Koh’s evidence in Court that he had no interest in the companies which owned the barges chartered by BP Singapore for its back-to-back transactions was directly contradicted by the trust deeds in P55 to P57. The documents showed that Poh held Koh’s 50 percent share in Sino Tankers Pte Ltd, Sino International Shipping Pte Ltd and United Maritime Pte Ltd in Poh’s name on trust for Koh.[^171] As set out earlier at \[48\], these three companies were the registered owners of a number of barges chartered by BP Singapore at the material time. In addition, Koh was the owner and executive director of New Maritime Pte Ltd which took over as registered owner of the barge called “Radiance” from Sino International Shipping Pte Ltd.[^172] When confronted with these deeds during further cross-examination, Koh claimed that he considered them null and void as he did not pay Poh for his shares in the companies. In my view, this was an afterthought on Koh’s part as the clear words of the trust deeds, which were drafted by and executed in the presence of an advocate and solicitor, indicated that these were the agreed arrangements since the incorporation of the respective companies, and the deeds were executed to formalise the same. KLT’s candid evidence that he thought Koh and Poh were both owners of PPT, that he was unaware that PPT did not own any barges and that he considered PPT as BP Singapore’s largest “barge operator” buttressed the prosecution’s contention that Koh was more closely associated with the barging business than he cared to admit.[^173]

### Defence of joint investments was not credible

156    Having dealt with the prosecution’s case, I now turn to look at the defence’s case of a joint investment in property. In this regard, I found the account of joint investment proffered by Chang and Koh in their subsequent statements to CPIB and in Court to be an afterthought.

157    Firstly, as detailed earlier in these grounds, I was not persuaded by their explanation that they did not reveal this to CPIB initially as Koh had wanted to keep the joint investments a secret to protect his assets against creditors.

158    Secondly, it was rather telling that Koh’s and, perhaps more importantly, Chang’s statements and evidence in Court contained various glaring contradictions and inconsistencies pertaining to the joint investments, including those relating to which properties and investments formed part of the joint investment project.

#### 2B Da Silva Lane

159    While Koh claimed in Court that Da Silva was a joint investment property, he had expressly denied this in P33[^174]. In fact, he said that it was not true that he had bought the property with Chang, adding that he did not think that Chang would use the transferred funds for property investment. In Court, Koh claimed that Chang had informed him before purchasing and selling Da Silva.[^175] However, Koh contradicted himself during re-examination when he stated that there was no communication at the time the property was sold as both he and Chang were under investigations and it was only later that he was informed of the sale by Mdm Fennie Ong.[^176] Koh’s testimony also contradicted his statement in P35 at \[12\] and \[13\] where he stated that Chang had informed him of the purchase and sale of the property, after the fact.[^177] Additionally while Koh testified that there was an agreement before the properties were purchased that they would not be registered in his name,[^178] it was stated at \[15 - A22\] in P35 that Koh was only told that Da Silva was registered under Chang’s name after this was done and that he felt there was “not much point” in arguing with Chang on this.

160    Turning to Chang, much of what Chang claimed to have been discussed between him and Koh with regards to the plan to sell or rent out Da Silva and the reason why Chang and his family were staying there from 2007 to 2011,[^179] were never put to Koh even though these details were never mentioned by Koh in his testimony in Court nor in his statements to CPIB.

#### Livia condominium

161    Koh did not mention Livia in any of his statements to CPIB. Instead, he explicitly stated in at \[45 – Q3/A3\] of P35 that Da Silva and Ettrick were the only two joint investment properties Chang informed him of. To me, Koh’s explanation for his omission to mention Livia to CPIB -- that it was sold within “a very short period of time” and he had forgotten about it[^180] – was contrived and lacked credibility. It was not disputed that Livia was purchased in June 2008 and sold only in February 2011. In Court, Koh was even able to recall that Chang had informed him about selling Livia and even told him the estimated selling price.[^181] Thus it was highly unlikely that he would have totally forgotten about it when giving his statement in 2015.

162    Curiously, Chang had also omitted to mention Livia when he first provided the details of his alleged joint investments with Koh to CPIB in P42 (recorded on 18 May 2015). In fact, when P43 was recorded on 26 June 2015, Chang was given P42 to read. Aside from raising a point relating to Da Silva, Chang did not make any other amendments to P42 and confirmed it to be true and correct. Chang went on to state in P43 that he and Mdm Fennie Ong had purchased the unit in Livia for the purpose of investments.[^182] On 29 July 2015, the next occasion a statement was recorded from him, Chang reiterated at \[150 - Q12/A12\] of P44 that Livia was his and Mdm Fennie Ong’s “own investment” and expressly denied that Livia was part of the pool of investment properties with Koh. When confronted in Court with the conflicting accounts, Chang refused to accept that there was a contradiction between them. Chang alluded to a “misunderstanding” between him and Ms Lim when the statement was recorded and claimed that he was “not exactly very sure” what was recorded in the statement.[^183] Having considered the evidence in this regard, including Ms Lim’s unchallenged evidence that Chang had informed her that both condominiums were his own investments and that that at the end of the recording, P44 was made available to Chang to read through,[^184] I disbelieved Chang’s claim of a misunderstanding between him and Ms Lim. On the contrary, I found that Chang had clearly shifted his position as to whether Livia was an investment property.

#### 18 Ettrick Terrace

163    As for Ettrick, Koh again took inconsistent positions concerning whether this was a joint investment property and whether there was an agreement to have it registered in Chang’s name. Koh claimed in Court that Ettrick was an investment property and he was aware that Chang was residing in it with his family. This was in direct contradiction of P33 where Koh stated that he did not believe that Chang had used his money to invest in Ettrick which was a property bought under Chang’s own name and used as a family home. Koh also stated in P33 that Chang did not tell him that he was a co-owner of the property.[^185] Additionally, while he stated in Court that there was an agreement before the properties were purchased that they would not be registered in his name,[^186] Koh stated in P35 that he was only told that Ettrick was registered under Chang’s name after the purchased. [^187]

#### 18 Palm Drive and 60 Jalan Limau Purut

164    In Court, Koh testified that he was only aware of three joint investment properties, namely Da Silva, Livia and Ettrick. However, according to Chang’s evidence in Court, there were four investment properties, including Limau Purut which was purchased in September 2012 (and registered in Chang’s name).

165    Yet again, Limau Purut was never mentioned in both Koh’s and Chang’s statements to CPIB as an investment property. Instead, Chang had stated in P42 that he and Koh invested in Palm Drive in 2012 and even specified that Koh had contributed $1.2 million for the reconstruction of the premises as well as $1.46 million towards the purchase price.[^188]

166    In Court, Chang explained that he had purchased Palm Drive in June 2012 using his own cash and initially wanted to “pass” it to Koh as part of joint investments. However, when Chang bought Limau Purut he found that there were insufficient funds to cover Koh’s 50 percent share in Palm Drive. He decided to put Koh’s share in Limau Purut instead. Chang added that he made the decision to shift Koh’s share to Limau Purut when he needed to sell Palm Drive in 2017. As he still had in mind to give Koh a share of Palm Drive when P42 was recorded, this accounted for his answers therein. Chang said that Palm Drive was then in “suspension mode” and its status could change when Chang next spoke to Koh.[^189]

167    In my view, Chang’s and Koh’s internally inconsistent, mutually contradictory, and evolving accounts of the alleged joint investments lacked credibility and smacked of an afterthought. Indeed, aside from the fact that the monies from Koh were used by Chang for property purchases (including the two family homes at Da Silva and Ettrick purchased under the names of Chang and his wife) as well as channelled by Chang as capital injection in Mindchamps Tampines (in which Chang and his wife were shareholders and directors), there was no objective evidence available to indicate that these were joint investments. In fact, Chang himself was not even the registered owner of Palm Drive, which according to him, was originally intended to be a joint investment property. Instead, Palm Drive was registered in the sole name of Mdm Fennie Ong.

168    According to Koh, while he knew how much he had transferred for joint investments, Chang had never told him how much in total was the pool of funds set aside for this purpose.[^190] Koh was also never shown any documentation on the purchase of properties for joint investments nor did he discuss with Chang how much returns on investments was due to him. There was also no time horizon for Koh to obtain his share of returns and when Da Silva and Livia were sold, Koh was not told how much he would receive from the sale nor paid any money.[^191]

169    When questioned about accounts or records kept of the joint investments, Chang initially pointed to the folders he allegedly kept at home which contained the transaction records and expenses relating to each property, but did not capture a breakdown of what was due to Koh. However, when further probed, Chang testified that all his discussions with Koh concerning the joint investment properties were never captured in writing and Chang “just talked to” Koh.[^192] However, when the prosecution pointed out to Chang that it would have been important to keep a proper account of Koh’s share in the joint investments, Chang claimed that he had kept some personal notebooks in the BP Singapore office for use in meetings and also to record some of his conversations with Koh. According to Chang these notebooks were “returned” to BP Singapore when he left. Chang added that the notebooks did not contain details of what was due and owing to Koh nor did they contain the capital gains from properties or discussions concerning rental of Da Silva or Ettrick. Instead, he only kept the “big numbers” in his notebooks concerning Koh’s initial capital, Chang’s share of the loan and stamp duties. After Chang left BP, he stopped keeping records of property purchases apart from his folders. Instead, Chang kept a notional account in his head of what was due to Koh. This was because “everything” was rolled back into Limau Purut.[^193] Having scrutinised Chang’s evidence in this regard, I found that his claim to have kept an account of the joint investments in his notebooks to be another afterthought on his part to plug the gaps in his defence. As observed by the prosecution in their submissions, not only was his claim of keeping such records in notebooks brought up only during cross-examination and not put to any of the prosecution witnesses, his claim to have stopped keeping records after he left BP Singapore as everything was rolled back into Limau Purut was contradicted by his own testimony that this was only done in 2017 when he sold Palm Drive.

170    In my view, the evidence overwhelmingly indicated that the monies transferred by Koh to Chang were dealt with and used by Chang as if they were his own. As an example, in P47, Chang stated that the sales proceeds from Livia (amounting to $982,437.91) were deposited into his HSBC bank account and used to pay his income tax, credit card bills, settlement payment for the civil suit with BP Singapore, retainer fees for lawyers, and booking fee for a condominium unit at the Palette.[^194] It was also apparent that once Koh’s funds were transferred into Chang’s bank accounts in Singapore, they were co-mingled with Chang’s monies and there was no evidence of any effort on Chang’s part to keep records on the movements of Koh’s funds.[^195] Not surprisingly, at the time of the trial, Koh had not seen any investment returns from any of the properties which had been purchased and sold since 2007.

171    Based on the above analysis, I agreed with the prosecution that the inference to be drawn was that the alleged joint property investment was a complete fabrication by Koh and Chang in an attempt to provide a legitimate explanation for the large amount of funds transferred by Koh to Chang in Hong Kong. This, in turn, reinforced the prosecution’s case that the purpose of the fund transfers was in fact illicit and corrupt.

### The payments for Mindchamps City Square were part of the corrupt scheme

172    Having found that the fund transfers set out in the first 19 charges against Koh and Chang respectively were corrupt transactions, I now turn to review the case concerning the 20th charges, involving Koh’s agreement to make and Chang’s agreement to accept payments for Mindchamps City Square.

173    To recap, it was not disputed that Mindchamps City Square was incorporated on 3 September 2009 with Koh and Mdm Fennie Ong as directors and equal shareholders. From September 2009, Koh made various payments for MindChamps City Square amounting to S$525,000 in total.

174    In my judgment, Koh’s payments for Mindchamps City Square should not be looked at in isolation, but must be considered against the backdrop of Koh’s transfers of money to Chang at the material time, as well as his alleged prior investment in Mindchamps Tampines. Koh told IO Fong in P35 that Chang told him about the investment in Mindchamps Tampines sometime in 2008 or 2009. Chang also told Koh that he would share half of the profits with Koh. Koh added that Chang did not tell him before investing in Mindchamps Tampines and assumed that Chang had used part of the money that he had given Chang for investment in property to invest in Mindchamps Tampines, hence earning Koh a share in its profits.[^196] This dovetailed Chang’s statement in P40 that he had used $900,000 from the money transferred by Koh for Mindchamps Tampines as his wife did not have the money to start up the business.[^197] The above accounts from Koh and Chang showed that Koh’s “foray” into the pre-school business was intertwined with the funds he transferred to Chang, which I have found to be corrupt payments.

175    Turning to Mindchamps City Square, Koh mentioned in P2 and P35, as well as his testimony in Court that he did not have much interest in investing in the business.[^198] Koh’s statement in P2 made it clear that the payments to Mindchamps were regarded by Koh as yet another request for money from Chang which Koh paid so as not to offend Chang and keep PPT’s business with BP intact.[^199] Although the defence pointed to the fact that Koh was registered as a shareholder and director of Mindchamps City Square as indication that this was a _bona fide_ investment, it was pertinent to note that the reason provided by Chang in Court was that this was due to “additional requirements from the landlord, whereby they wanted somebody more influential” to stand as guarantor for the lease.[^200] In my opinion, the fact the Koh was registered as a director of Mindchamps City Square was to facilitate Mindchamps City Square securing the lease of the premises and not an indication that the transaction was above-board or was set apart from the corrupt scheme.

## The accused persons were found guilty and convicted

176    In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven the proceeded charges against Koh and Chang beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found them guilty and convicted them of the same.

## Sentencing

177    The parties filed several rounds of written submissions on sentence and supplemented these with oral submissions in Court. The final global sentencing positions of the respective parties were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.0551889622076%"> <col width="37.9724055188962%"> <col width="37.9724055188962%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Submissions by</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Koh</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Chang</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Prosecution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">80 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">80 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Defence</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">10 to 12 months’ imprisonment and a fine to be determined</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4 to 8 months’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $622,009.50 (in default 4 months’ imprisonment)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

178    The initial rounds of submissions were very much premised on the prosecution urging the Court to adopt and apply a five-step sentencing framework for sections 6(a) and 6(b) PCA offences and the defence persuading the Court to sentence the accused persons based on the application of relevant sentencing factors as well as a consideration of the sentencing precedents. Some of these arguments were subsequently superseded by the High Court’s judgment in the case of _Takaaki Masui v PP and another appeal and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 160</span> (“_Masui”_) dated 2 December 2020, setting out the sentencing framework to be applied for purely private sector offences under sections 6(a) and 6(b) of the PCA. Thus, parties filed an additional round of submissions in relation to the application of the _Masui_ sentencing framework. The prosecution and counsel for Chang also tendered submissions relating to the imposition of a penalty under section 13 of the PCA, as well as the prosecution’s application for the Court to consider enforcing the payment of the penalty by issuing an order for the attachment of property belonging to Chang through the appointment of a receiver under section 319(1)(b)(iii)(B) of the CPC.

179    As I was of the view that I was bound by the sentencing framework in _Masui[^201]_ and did apply the same in calibrating sentence, I would focus on outlining the parties’ submissions and detailing my decision on sentence based on the application of the framework.

180    Before delving into the details of these submissions, it would be useful to set out the submissions tendered by the parties which I had considered in arriving at the sentences imposed:

### Prescribed Penalties

181    An offence under section 5 or section 6 of the PCA was punishable with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.

### Antecedents

182    Both accused persons were untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

183    The prosecution highlighted that while they agreed generally with the five-step sentencing framework adopted by Justice Chan Seng Onn (“Chan J”) in _Masui_, it was unclear if the Modified Harm-Culpability matrix (“the _Masui_ Matrix”) and the manner in which the indicative starting sentences were interpolated using points in the matrix and contour lines, accorded with existing case law. Nevertheless, to assist the Court, the prosecution proceeded to submit on the application of the _Masui_ framework in the present case.

#### Step 1

184    In applying Step 1 of the _Masui_ framework, the prosecution submitted that the following offence-specific factors relating to culpability were engaged, and that culpability of Koh and Chang was high:

> (a)     High amount of gratification.

> The total amount of gratification involved in each charge was large, ranging from USD100,000 to USD350,000. The total amount of gratification in the present case was the highest in a corruption case to date. In relation to the 20th charge, transfers amounting to S$525,000 had in fact been made pursuant to the agreement to give or receive gratification. Although some of the advances were partially refunded to Koh, this did not have any relevance as a mitigating factor.

> (b)     Planning and pre-meditation as well as sophistication of the scheme.

> The accused persons had schemed to have PPT set up and appointed as a TCP. Once PPT was appointed, Chang’s advancement of PPT’s business interests was subtle, cloaked in the guise of legitimate commercial concerns. Koh sought to cultivate Chang and earn his goodwill. There was a concerted effort to conceal the offences by carrying out the fund transfers overseas in Hong Kong.

> (c)     Significant abuse of position and breach of trust.

> Chang had abused the various positions he held in BP Singapore and the high degree of trust reposed in him by the company. He had abused his position of trust by playing a pivotal role in setting up PPT and procuring its appointment as a counterparty to BP Singapore. Chang had also exercised his powers relating to appointment or termination of TCPs and allocation of contracts to TCPs in favour of PPT.

> (d)     The offences were motivated by greed.

185    The prosecution submitted that the following offence-specific factors going towards harm were relevant and the level of harm was moderate:

> (a)     Benefit to the giver.

> Koh derived substantial benefit from his cultivation of Chang. Without Chang, there would have been no PPT to speak of. Chang was instrumental in procuring PPT’s appointment as a TCP and also to its subsequent entrenchment as BP Singapore’s largest TCP. The benefit to Koh was not only by way of PPT’s profits but also his financial interests in other entities which relied on PPT’s business with BP Singapore.

> (b)     Detriment to the principal.

> The fact that the agent-principal relationship had been suborned by the agent’s failure to disclose the true position to the principal, including the personal benefits obtained by the agent without his principal’s knowledge, would suffice to amount to a detriment to the principal. In addition, BP Singapore had at the very least been put at risk of harm in the following ways:

>> (i)       BP Singapore’s business was overly concentrated on one TCP.

>> (ii)       BP Singapore had been deprived of opportunity to do business with competing TCPs.

>> (iii)       BP Singapore was exposed to additional risks by the implementation of netting arrangements favourable to PPT.

>> (iv)       Chang shared confidential and sensitive information belonging to BP Singapore with PPT which could have been taken advantage of by outsiders in negotiations with BP Singapore, thus resulting in losses to BP Singapore.

> (c)     Detriment to third parties.

> Chang’s preferential treatment of PPT would have violated the legitimate expectations of honest businessmen competing with PPT for business with BP Singapore. More importantly, the bunkering industry was a key strategic industry for Singapore. These offences would have the effect of undermining public confidence in the integrity of this key strategic industry.

186    In relation to harm, the amount of gratification would also be indicative of the extent of the detriment caused to the principal and the benefit obtained by the giver.

#### Steps 2 and 3

187    Moving on to Steps 2 and 3 of the framework, the prosecution submitted that based on the _Masui_ Matrix, the current offences would fall into the high culpability and moderate harm category which indicated a sentencing range of 12 to 44 months’ imprisonment and fine of up to $100,000 per charge. The indicative starting sentence would lie in the area indicated by the yellow box in the figure below at the lower to middle portion of “moderate” for harm and lower to middle portion of “high” for culpability. Interpolating from the black dot in the matrix closest to this area gave rise to indicative starting custodial sentences for each charge of between 20 to 28 months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000.

![]([2022] SGDC 0066_Image/[2022] SGDC 0066_image5.png)

188    Based on the quantum of gratification in each charge, the prosecution proposed the following range of starting imprisonment sentences per charge:

189    In considering whether it was appropriate to also impose a fine, the prosecution drew from the applicable principles governing the imposition of conjunctive sentences, and submitted that conjunctive sentences were not appropriate in the present case. The reasons were:

> (a)     In respect of Chang, his unlawful gains were already the subject of a section 13 PCA penalty order. It would thus be inappropriate to impose a fine for the purpose of disgorgement.

> (b)     Although Koh had benefitted from the corrupt scheme, it was difficult to quantify the amount of benefits he obtained and thus it would be inappropriate to impose a fine for the purpose of disgorgement.

> (c)     The other condition for imposition of conjunctive sentences, that the imposition of the maximum prescribed imprisonment sentence would not achieve the desired sentencing objectives, was also not met.

#### Steps 4 and 5

190    Following on with Steps 4 and 5 of the framework, the prosecution submitted that there were no offender-specific mitigating factors which warranted the downward adjustment of the individual sentences. Thus, the prosecution urged the Court to impose the following sentences on the accused persons:

### Koh’s Mitigation & Submissions on Sentence

192    Counsel for Koh took the position that _Masui_ being a High Court judgement specific to the sentencing for private sector corruption, was binding on this Court.

#### Step 1

193    The defence disagreed with the prosecution’s submissions on the harm element in Step 1:

> (a)     Benefit to the giver.

> The gratification was merely an inducement to advance the business interest of PPT with BP Singapore. It was not the case that the entire business of PPT resulted from the gratification given by Koh. Instead, Koh had spent his entire career of three decades in the oil industry.

> (b)     Detriment to the principal.

> There was no allegation or evidence of any real detriment to BP Singapore. The prosecution’s case, at best, was that BP’s busines was put at risk by insufficiently diversifying the TCPs it traded with. It was agreed that payments started long after PPT became a TCP and that BP Singapore continued to trade with PPT long after Chang left BP Singapore’s employment in July 2010. As BP Singapore was the number one bunker trader (by volume) in Singapore for 11 consecutive years from 2004 to 2014 and fell to number two in 2015 when BP stopped dealing with PPT in September 2015, the continued dealing with PPT must mean that BP Singapore was satisfied with PPT’s performance and found it commercially advantageous to continue trading with PPT even without Chang’s continued employment and influence. In any event, there was no evidence of any monetary loss caused to BP Singapore. Instead, PPT took on all the trading risk while BP Singapore enjoyed a steady profit. Therefore, the only detriment, if at all, was the loss of an opportunity for BP Singapore to diversify the credit risk by working more with other TCPs. However, the evidence showed that other TCPs were unsuitable and were phased out by BP Singapore.

> (c)     Detriment to third parties.

> The public confidence in the integrity of the bunkering industry was not undermined just because the offences occurred in the industry. There must be a “sufficient nexus” between the offence and the industry.

194    The defence also disagreed with the offence-specific factors identified by the prosecution relating to culpability.

> (a)     High amount of gratification indicating greed and the influence or advantage sought by the giver.

> The amount of gratification cannot be viewed in isolation. A link must be established between the size of the bribe and the culpability of the offender. This would in turn depend on the motivation of the parties, and must be determined on the facts of each case. Although the value of the gratification from Koh was significant, it did not in itself reflect a higher level of culpability. Nonetheless, the defence proposed that some weight be given to the high amount of gratification as it was the highest amount given by a single giver and received by a single recipient.

> (b)     Planning and premeditation, sophistication of scheme.

> There was no elaborate scheme in place. This case involved a single giver and single receiver, and no web of corruption was involved.

> (c)     Sustained period of offending.

> The period of offending was four years from 2006 to 2010 when monies were transferred, and did not begin from 2001. The duration of offending should not be double counted as a separate aggravating factor where there were several charges before the Court and the Court might choose instead to address the point by running sentences consecutively.

> (d)     Significant abuse of position and breach of trust.

> There was no breach of trust issue in the present case. PPT only stepped in as counterparty after BP Singapore lost their main TCP. There was also no evidence that Chang excluded other TCPs in order to advance the interests of PPT. Chang also did not have any control over the trading prices or sale price to PPT.

> (e)     Motivated by greed.

> The defence submitted that the profits made by PPT were less than the total gratification paid. Further, Koh received no benefits personally.

195    Overall, it was submitted that Koh’s culpability was significantly less than the offenders in _Masui_. This was because the four main factors that went towards culpability in _Masui_ could all be distinguished in the present case.

#### Step 2

196    The defence pointed out that the main consideration for the prosecution’s argument for high culpability in this case appeared to be the high amount of gratification. This ignored the nuanced approach taken in _Masui_ with regard to the indicative starting point. The High Court in _Masui_ explained that the relevance of the amount or value of the gratification under the framework did not inhere in a simple numerical figure and was not relevant in and of itself. The design of the framework was such that this factor was relevant only insofar as it contributed to the level of harm caused by the offender’s conduct and/or demonstrated the offender’s culpability.[^202] The gravamen of an offence under section 6 of the PCA was the influence of the gratification on the agent and it was apparent that the prosecution did not consider this but had only relied on the high amount paid in arriving at a starting imprisonment range per charge.

197    The defence submitted that the influence of the gratification on Chang vis-à-vis BP Singapore was limited as:

> (a)     The evidence did not show that Chang had any influence and/or control on the trading prices; and

> (b)     PPT’s status as a TCP to BP Singapore continued after Chang’s departure.

The link between the gratification payment and corrupt act was therefore not made out.

198    The defence therefore submitted that the indicative sentencing range applicable to Koh was at the lower end to middle portion of the moderate level of harm, and higher end of the low level of culpability. This was within the top-middle of the moderate harm, low culpability box as illustrated by the green diamond in the _Masui_ Matrix below:

![]([2022] SGDC 0066_Image/[2022] SGDC 0066_image6.png)

199    As the case fell within category 1 identified in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“_Romel”_), the diamond was situated within the dark blue region of the matrix but above the custodial threshold.

200    The indicative starting range was therefore up to 8 months’ imprisonment with the following bands based on the quantum of gratification:

202    With the imposition of a fine, a downward revision of the indicative custodial sentence would be factored in.

#### Step 4

203    As for offender specific factors, the defence submitted that the key mitigating factor was that Koh had no antecedents and an unblemished record.

204    Further, a downward adjustment of the sentence was warranted due to the inordinate delay in prosecution:

> (a)     The offence period was from 31 July 2006 to 26 July 2010.

> (b)     The investigations were commenced sometime in 2011 and Koh and Chang gave their first statements to CPIB on 18 October 2011.

> (c)     Statements were taken sporadically from Koh over the period of four years with the last statement taken on 11 August 2015.

> (d)     The investigations went cold and there was radio silence from the CPIB for two more years.

(e)

Koh was charged in August 2017 and trial commenced in February 2018.

(f)

There was further delay in the trial. On 30 August 2019, prior to exchange of written closing submissions, the prosecution gave notice that it intended to adduce further evidence on recently discovered trust deeds signed in 2006 which were seized by CPIB on 24 March 2016 in a separate investigation.

205    The delay was inordinate with seven years elapsing between the start of investigations and the commencement of trial. Koh was convicted in 2020, ten years after the last of the offences.

#### Step 5

206    There was no justification, based on the facts of the present case, for the prosecution’s submission for four sentences to run consecutively. The defence submitted that it would be appropriate for a maximum of three of the sentences to run consecutively as follows to arrive at a maximum of 18 months’ imprisonment:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.46%"> <col width="51.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence adjusted for Step 5</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 927119-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 927120-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 927135-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">AGGREGATE SENTENCE</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

207    Further downward revisions should be made on account of the imposition of a fine and the delay. The defence proposed a 10 percent fine based on the amounts transferred in each charge and a corresponding adjustment to the global imprisonment term of between 6 to 8 months depending on the fine eventually imposed by the Court. The resultant global sentence of 10 to 12 months did not factor in the downward revision warranted by the offender-specific factors.

208    The defence concluded that the appropriate sentence to be imposed against Koh would be imprisonment of 10 to 12 months and a fine to be determined.

### Chang’s Mitigation and Submissions on Sentence

209    Counsel for Chang submitted that faced with the conflicting decisions in _Masui_ and _PP v Tan Kok Ming Michael and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 926</span> (_“Michael Tan”_) where Justice Hoo Sheau Peng (“Hoo J”) rejected a sentencing framework for sections 5 and 6 PCA offences, and bearing in mind Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon’s (“Menon CJ”) caution in _PP v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 807</span> (“_Wong Chee Meng_”), this Court should not adopt the sentencing framework laid down in _Masui_. Instead, the Court should sentence Chang taking into consideration the absence of harm caused to BP Singapore, Chang’s low level of culpability, as well as relevant sentencing precedents such as _PP v Leng Kah Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 123</span> (_“Leng Kah Poh_”) and _PP v Tee Fook Boon Andrew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 192</span> (“_Andrew Tee_”). It was submitted that a global sentence of 30 to 35 weeks’ imprisonment would be adequate to meet the ends of justice in this case. Further, the Court should apply a one-third discount on account of the inordinate delay in the proceedings to arrive at a final sentence of 20 to 22 weeks’ imprisonment.

210    However, if the Court were minded to follow _Masui_, the defence submitted that the present case fell within the “slight harm, low to low-end of medium culpability” part of the _Masui_ Matrix based on the following reasons.

#### Step 1

211    The submission of “slight harm” was supported by the fact that there was only one offence-specific factor present in this case, which was the high amount of gratification. Even so, minimal weight (if at all) should be given by the Court to this factor. As noted by Chan J in _Masui_ the amount or value of the gratification was relevant to harm because the higher the bribe, the greater the corrupt influence exerted on the receiver. As such, the factor must be assessed along with the importance of the transaction sought to be influenced in order to see its relevance to harm._[^203]_ In the present case, there was no evidence correlating the quantum of the gratification and the transaction sought to be influenced, and the quantum of the gratification was not linked to the corrupt arrangement. Furthermore, all payments made in the present case were part of a joint investment agreement between Chang and Koh. Koh’s statements also did not indicate any oppression imposed on him by Chang to make payments of that quantum.

212    The defence submitted that the four offence-specific factors asserted by the prosecution were wholly unjustified and unmeritorious:

> (a)     Actual loss caused to principal.

> The prosecution had consistently failed to identify any actual harm suffered by BP Singapore and could only fall back on a hypothetical “risk of serious harm”. On the contrary, BP Singapore enjoyed great success throughout the tenure of its working relationship with PPT. BP Singapore was extremely successful under Chang’s leadership by virtue of the back-to-back business model pioneered by Chang which provided BP with three streams of revenue. PPT was instrumental to the success of BP Marine’s back-to-back business model. The importance of PPT to BP Singapore was corroborated by the unchallenged fact that BP Singapore had implored PPT to stay as its TCP even after Chang’s departure. The working relationship between BP Singapore and PPT continued even after CPIB had started investigations into Chang and Koh and lasted for four more years. It was therefore no coincidence that BP Singapore lost its ranking as top bunker supplier when BP Singapore stopped trading with PPT in 2015. BP Singapore’s inability to work with the new TCPs resulted in the loss of sales and downsizing of BP Marine. As noted by the Court in _Michael Tan,[^204]_ corruption offences which occasioned real harm to the agent’s principal would be considerably more aggravated than those where the principal suffered little or no harm. In addition, there was clearly an element of double counting by the prosecution in relying on the same factors in their submissions on “benefit to the giver” and “harm caused to the principal”.

> (b)     Benefit to the giver of gratification.

> There was little to no benefit gained by Koh and PPT. Prior to PPT’s incorporation, Koh was already well known to BP Marine staff from his previous dealings with them. The success enjoyed by PPT in rising to become BP Singapore’s top TCP was for _bona fide_ commercial reasons and not a result of the corrupt arrangement. In fact, if one were to conflate Koh’s personal funds with PPT’s financial position, Koh had in fact suffered losses. This was due to the undisputed fact that the total quantum of gratification in the present case exceeded the total profits of PPT during the material period. In fact the alleged gratification found by the Court to have been given to Chang was almost equivalent to the accumulated profits of PPT since inception. The prosecution’s attempt to rely on Koh’s financial interests in other entities which relied upon PPT’s business with BP Singapore was a non-starter since the prosecution had not been able to prove exactly how Koh and the other entities had benefitted from the corrupt arrangement.

> (c)     Type and extent of loss to third parties.

> The defence submitted that the prosecution had failed to adduce any tangible evidence in support of this factor. The fact that there was no quantifiable loss in the present case suggested that the factor should have limited significance, if any, on the sentence imposed. In fact, the prevailing evidence showed that BP Singapore’s business simply went to the TCP with the most competitive terms and was receptive to taking on more pricing risks, which happened to be PPT.

213    It was submitted that the harm occasioned by the offences in the present case was on the same level as that in _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (”_Ang Seng Thor”_) and less serious than that in the cases of _Masui_ and _PP v Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachel_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 217</span>_._

214    In terms of culpability, it was submitted that the case fell in the low category or low end of medium culpability. Whilst it was accepted that Chang occupied a senior position in BP Singapore and the gratification in the form of investment contributions was substantial, these factors had to be viewed in the context of the unique factual matrix in this case:

> (a)     Degree of planning and premeditation and level of sophistication.

> There was no pre-meditation or planning on the part of Chang. The corrupt arrangement must be viewed in the backdrop of the close personal relationship between Chang and Koh. Chang was not the mastermind of the scheme. On the contrary, he displayed a complete lack of interest or concern towards ensuring that PPT was profiting from the business arrangement with BP Singapore. To Chang’s mind, he believed that Koh and himself had embarked on joint investments which were made possible on account of their long-standing friendship. The prosecution’s failure to adduce any evidence to link the corrupt arrangement to any actual contract between PPT and BP Singapore spoke to the non-existent planning and/or premeditation behind the arrangement. There was also no attempt by Chang or Koh to conceal the payment of the gratification and all transfers were made by way of wholly traceable bank transfers. Entirely contrary to a sophisticated concealment of monies, the funds were transferred by Chang back to Singapore to accounts under his own name, and for the purchase of properties under his own name.

> (b)     Extent of the offender’s abuse of position and breach of trust.

> The prosecution was unable to adduce any evidence supporting their assertion that Chang had abused his position to procure PPT in becoming a TCP with BP Singapore. There was also no tangible evidence showing how Chang had favoured PPT. The prosecution could not be allowed to rely on piecemeal instances of alleged favour (in the form of netting agreement and/or purported allocation of contracts with good pricing) to establish Chang’s abuse of position and/or breach of trust, when a closer scrutiny would show that Chang had not in fact shown any favour to PPT. PPT had become TCP when Chang was only the Marine Trading Manager. There was no evidence that Chang had the authority to appoint PPT as a TCP. BP had identical netting agreements with other TCPs and these were executed on BP Singapore’s terms and to its benefit to minimise risk exposure in the event of insolvency of the TCPs. Furthermore, Chang had delegated substantially all of his authorities to his subordinates and did not play any role in sanctioning and/or rejecting any trades or transactions. On the supply side, the final authority on price and volume for ex-wharf sales still lay with IST. The sole instance that Chang stepped in to facilitate the negotiation process was during the 2009 crisis. On the other hand, Chang had continuously sought to look for new TCPs to diversify BP Singapore’s TCPs, even as late as 2008 to July 2010 where PPT’s share of BP Singapore’s delivered bunker sales fluctuated between approximately 30 to 60 percent. Chang’s priority remained BP Singapore’s competitiveness and well-being. He was protecting BP Singapore’s interests in ensuring that trading risks were offloaded from BP Singapore and passed to PPT. He also sought to benefit BP Singapore at PPT’s cost by having BP Marine keep the best deals with the highest margins, bypassing the TCPs.

> (c)     Offender’s motive in committing the offence.

> There were no motivations of greed on Chang’s part. There was a longstanding friendship between Koh and Chang that predicated and arguably led to the blurring of the personal and commercial lines resulting in the corrupt arrangement. Chang’s intention to pursue joint investments as opposed to solicitation of an outright bribe or allowing himself to be cultivated as an agent ought to lower his culpability in sentencing. In the event that the Court found that Chang was motivated by greed, it was submitted that there should not be any double counting of this as a standalone factor in view of the amount of gratification.

> (d)     Amount or value of gratification given or received.

> Here the gratification was in the form of joint investments entered into together by Chang and Koh. This meant that the sums involved were, at no point, intended to be a payment to Chang. Instead, Chang had pumped in his own half-share into the joint investment properties. Be that as it may, the defence accepted that Chang’s culpability might overlap between low and the low end of medium.

215    It was further submitted that comparing the facts of the present case against _Masui_, it was patently clear that Chang’s culpability was significantly less than the appellants in that case.

#### Steps 2 and 3

216    In the present case, it was submitted that the indicative starting sentence would lie in the area indicated by the yellow box in the _Masui_ Matrix below:

![]([2022] SGDC 0066_Image/[2022] SGDC 0066_image7.png)

217    The facts of the case placed this case squarely in the _Romel_ category 1 type cases. It was submitted that the indicative starting sentence per charge ought to be up to 3 months and a fine, and the following discrete ranges of starting sentencing position would be appropriate for the differing amounts of gratification received:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.74%"> <col width="50.26%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount of gratification</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Starting imprisonment sentence per charge</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to USD100,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to a fine of $100,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">USD100,000 to USD200,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 month to 2 months + fine</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">USD200,000 to USD350,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 months to 3 months + fine</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

218    The defence further submitted that it was evident from _Masui_ that a penalty order and a fine could be imposed conjunctively and they served different purposes. The fine would have a punitive and deterrent effect while a penalty order served to disgorge the spoils of crime from wrongdoers.

219    If the Court were so minded, it would be principled for a fine of approximately 10 percent of the bribe quantum to be imposed, with a corresponding reduction to the indicative starting sentence per charge by 1 month.

#### Steps 4 and 5

220    It was submitted that the following offender-specific mitigating factors should be considered by the Court:

> (a)     This was Chang’s first brush with the law.

> (b)     Chang was of good character and established reputation amongst his peers.

Following his charges, he would no longer be able to find active employment in the bunker industry.

221    Due regard must be made to the totality principle. In contrast to the egregious nature of the corruption in _Masui_ and _Leng Kah Poh_, the simplistic nature of the corrupt arrangement in the present case warranted a sentence proportionate and in line with the precedents.

222    The downward adjustment of the sentence was also justified by the prosecution’s inordinate delay in its prosecution, which was not occasioned by Chang:

> (a)     There was a three-year gap in time between Chang’s third and fourth statements recorded by CPIB.

> (b)     CPIB took a further two years from the time it resumed investigations in February 2015 until charges were brought in March 2017. There was another long gap which was unexplained where a period of one year elapsed between Chang’s statements in P46 and P47.

> (c)     After trial dates were taken, seven weeks before trial was due to commence, the prosecution suddenly informed the Court and Chang of its decision to charge Koh as well, and that a joint trial should be held.

> (d)     Further delay was caused during the trial by prosecution’s failure to disclose Koh’s CPIB statements and the calling of rebuttal and/or additional evidence even after the close of the defence’s case.

223    As a result of the inordinate delay, Chang was unable to work in the oil industry since he was charged. The proceedings had resulted in stigma and financial constraints to Chang and his family. Further financial hardship was caused by prosecution’s decision during investigations to freeze three of Chang’s bank accounts only to release them in May 2017. The protracted trial occasioned additional legal costs and expenses for Chang’s defence. Based on the above, the defence submitted that a one-third discount should be applied to the sentence.

224    For the first 18 charges, the defence submitted that the one transaction rule must apply despite the multiplicity of charges. These charges involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. They also involved the exact same actors and Chang’s single purpose in receiving the transfers was to further the joint investments he had with Koh.

225    Based on the above, the defence submitted for a global sentence of 4 to 8 months’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $622,009.50 (in default 4 months’ imprisonment) to be imposed on Chang.

### Prosecution’s reply

226    In response, the prosecution reiterated that the factor of sustained period of offending should only be taken into account at Step 5 of the _Masui_ framework, in applying the totality principle and determining the number of sentences to run consecutively. Additionally, even if the period of offending began only when the monies were being transferred to Chang, it was still a sustained period. Further, the prosecution argued that the fund transfers could not be delinked from the mutual understanding reached by the accused persons at the inception of PPT.

227    It was submitted that the defence’s attempt to distinguish the present case from the deliberate and premeditated schemes in _Leng Kah Poh_ and _Masui_ was without basis. As in those cases, a company (PPT) had been set up and used as a vehicle for the corrupt arrangement, and the advancement of business interests was subtle and cloaked in the guise of legitimate commercial dealings and interests.

228    The fact that the gratifications were not linked to any one transaction also did not mean that there was no planning or premeditation. On the contrary, the way Chang had been cultivated by Koh over the years showed that the present offences were indeed planned and pre-meditated.

229    The evidence also showed that from the start of the scheme, Chang had occupied important positions in BP Singapore and had a high degree of trust reposed in him. He then conceived the setting up of PPT, procured its appointment as TCP by making recommendations and advanced PPT’s interest. The fact that BP Singapore might have benefitted from the appointment of PPT was irrelevant to the abuse of position and breach of trust which took place. The defence’s contention that Chang did not interfere in BP Singapore’s day-to-day dealings with PPT was a red herring as there was no need for Chang to do so. What mattered was that Chang exercised his authority and influence in BP Singapore to advance PPT’s interests in a significant manner as he had done.

230    The accused persons had entered into and carried on the corrupt arrangement out of a mutual desire to derive significant financial benefit from the arrangements. This concerned the accused persons’ motivations and would not constitute double counting with the amount of gratification.

231    The amount of gratification in this case did reflect the level of influence or advantage Koh had sought to secure through the giving of bribes. Chang would request for payments and Koh would accede to these requests without question in order to keep the corrupt arrangement going. The evidence showed that the gratification had influenced Chang to advance PPT’s interest in various ways. Instead of viewing the high amount of gratification as a separate factor going towards harm, it would instead be indicative of the extent of the detriment caused to the principal and the benefit obtained by the giver.

232    The evidence showed that PPT’s business with BP Singapore would not have existed in the first place in the absence of the corrupt arrangement. PPT’s incorporation, Chang’s procurement of its appointment as a TCP and giving it business was done pursuant to the corrupt arrangement. Koh himself recognised that Chang “controlled the fate” of PPT.

233    The prosecution acknowledged that the harm occasioned in the present case had not been quantified in the same way as _Masui_ and that BP Singapore’s back-to-back business was a profitable one. This must however be seen in context. The sustainability and continuity of the corrupt arrangement was premised on a prospering PPT which in turn depended on a prospering BP Singapore. As observed in _Wong Chee Meng_, detriment to the principal might not always be in the form of direct monetary harm, and there might still be harm to the principal insofar as the agent-principal relationship had been suborned by the agent’s failure to disclose the true position to the principal, including the personal benefits the agent had received without the principal’s knowledge. The difficulties encountered by BP Singapore in trying to diversify its TCPs after Chang’s departure were at least partly due to how entrenched PPT was as a TCP.

234    As for harm to third parties, Chang’s actions in favouring PPT meant that competitors were not given any opportunity to compete on a level playing field because of the corrupt arrangement.

235    Contrary to the defence’s assertions, the prosecution submitted that there was a clear nexus between the present offences and the bunkering industry. The bunkering services provided by PPT to BP Singapore was a significant part of, if not central to the bunkering industry. Moreover, BP Singapore was the top- ranked supplier in the bunkering industry and PPT was its largest TCP. The offences would have adversely affected public confidence in Singapore’s bunkering industry.

236    Contrary to the defence’s arguments comparing the present case with that of _Masui_, the two factors of breach of trust and abuse of position, as well as planning, premeditation and sophistication of the offences were also applicable to the present case. Whilst the presence of threats, coercion or pressure was absent in the present case, the prosecution submitted that this must be weighed against the fact that the amount of gratification involved for each individual charge in the present case was far higher than that in _Masui_. This was relevant to culpability. In relation to harm, it was submitted that whilst there was no harm to the giver in the present case, unlike in _Masui_, there was a benefit to the giver, which was absent in _Masui_.

237    The prosecution submitted that there was no inordinate delay in the investigation and prosecution of the case. The three-year gap from January 2012 to February 2015 was due to a mutual legal assistance request that had to be sent to Hong Kong to obtain information and bank documents relating to the fund transfers. As the delay was due to Chang’s refusal to cooperate with the authorities to obtain the same from his bank in Hong Kong, the accused persons could not complain about a delay in prosecution, much less seek to opportunistically extract some mitigating credit from it. In relation to the alleged delay between January 2015 and the charging of the accused persons, it should be noted that investigations could only take place after the relevant information from Hong Kong was received on the fund transfers in Hong Kong as well as the transfers back to Singapore. These involved trawling through voluminous documents and complex tracing of movement of funds. As for Koh, his charging was also complicated by his involvement in separate investigations for another case and the application for joinder was made expeditiously on the same day Koh was charged. The application for vacation of the original trial dates was made by counsel for Koh.

238    As for the one transaction rule, it was not a rigid and inflexible rule and there were circumstances where the one transaction rule might be departed from and sentences ordered to run consecutively even where they did form part of a single transaction: _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee”_) at \[41\] to \[45\]. It was submitted that the present case was an appropriate one for the Court to depart from the one transaction rule to reflect the accused persons’ enhanced culpability and deter private sector corruption.

### Submissions on penalty and ancillary orders

239    Aside from their submissions on sentence, the prosecution and counsel for Chang also made submissions relating to the penalty to be imposed and whether an order should be made pursuant to section 319(1)(b) of the CPC, and if so, which order. As I have imposed a penalty order with a default sentence (pursuant to section 319(1)(b)(v)), I shall focus on summarising the parties’ arguments relating to the same.[^205]

#### Prosecution’s submissions

240    The prosecution submitted that the appropriate penalty sum to be imposed on Chang was S$6,220,095, with S$5,877,595 being the US dollar amounts in the 1st to 19th charges converted to Singapore dollars and S$342,500 being S$525,000 paid pursuant to the offence in the 20th charge subtracting the amount which was returned to Koh.

241    The prosecution sought to persuade the Court that the making of orders under section 319(1)(b) CPC ought to be deferred and it would be more appropriately dealt with after any appeal against conviction and/or sentence. The prosecution submitted that the Court’s ability to make all or any of the orders under section 319(1)(b) CPC would not terminate until the penalty in this case was paid in full. In the specific context of the enforcement of penalty orders, Menon CJ had in _Wong Chee Meng_ observed that the issue of the appropriate orders needed to address any failure to pay the penalty could be deferred until if and when it became necessary and possible to resolve this.[^206] In this case, it would be appropriate for the Court to defer making any of such orders as the event of non-payment of the penalty by Chang had yet to crystalise. The prosecution also took guidance from the decision of the High Court in _Wong Chee Meng_ at \[111\] where it declined to entertain applications for the making of further orders under section 319(1)(b) CPC where in default terms of imprisonment have already been ordered by the judge in the Court below.

242    The prosecution argued that the facts of the present case rendered it an appropriate one for the Court to make an attachment order (at the appropriate juncture) and impose an in-default imprisonment term as a measure of last resort. The prosecution emphasised that the purpose of section 13 PCA penalty order was to disgorge the bribes. Disgorgement served a deterrent purpose and there was a clear public interest in having the penalty order paid in full. The prosecution submitted that Chang clearly had the means to pay. The potential costs and administrative complexity involved in appointing a receiver in the present case was far outweighed by the public interest in enforcing the penalty order.

243    Additionally, the imposition of an attachment order should take precedence over the imposition of an in-default imprisonment term for the following reasons:

> (a)     As a matter of principle, Chang should not be permitted to “elect” to serve an in-default imprisonment term where he had the means to pay the penalty order.

> (b)     On the facts of the present case, there was a real risk that the imposition of an in-default term would create a perverse incentive for Chang to serve the imprisonment term instead of paying the penalty. This was a risk recognised in _Tay Wee Kiat and another v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 1033</span> (“_Tay Wee Kiat_”).

244    Thus, any in-default imprisonment term the Court was minded to impose should be held in abeyance until the order of attachment was completely executed.

245    As for the default sentence, the principles governing the imposition of the same were trite:

> (a)     The objective of an in-default sentence was to prevent / deter the evasion of the penalty.

> (b)     The overall sentence of imprisonment to which the offender might become subject to, must accord with the principle of proportionality, i.e. it should not exceed the proper tariff for the offence or be wholly disproportionate to the offence.

246    Further, there was limited utility in referring to precedents to determine the appropriate in-default imprisonment term to impose as:

> (a)     The terms of imprisonment in default must be set at a level sufficient to deter the individual offender from evading the payment of the penalty and the assessment of the proportionality of the overall imprisonment term to which the offender might become subject to would also be case specific.

> (b)     A review of the precedents showed that there was no discernible trend to the in-default imprisonment terms imposed in the cases and that reasons were rarely (if at all) provided for the imposition of such terms.

247    In the present case, the prosecution submitted that a default sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment in aggregate was warranted.

#### Chang’s submissions

248    In relation to the penalty sought by the prosecution, counsel for Chang submitted that the sum of $342,500 represented the balance sum of Koh’s legitimate investment in Mindchamps City Square and should not constitute a penalty order. The sum of $5,877,595 (reflecting the amounts in the 1st to 19th charges) were Koh’s contribution to the same joint investment agreement for the purchase of properties and Mindchamps Tampines and it followed that this sum also should not constitute a penalty order against Chang.

249    The defence further submitted that in the event a penalty order was made, a default imprisonment term would be sufficient to incentivise the payment and an attachment order was neither necessary nor desirable.

250    An order of imprisonment where an accused defaulted on the payment of a fine was the most common enforcement tool and had time and again been utilised by the Courts to great effect. The prosecution’s aversion to a default imprisonment term was based on a speculative assumption that there was a real risk that the imposition of such a term would create a perverse incentive for Chang to serve the in-default term instead of paying the penalty. In _Tay Wee Kiat_, the Court noted that in most cases, offenders with sufficient means were likely to pay the compensation amount to avoid serving the default term. This would be all the more so where the default term imposed was significant.

251    Chang was a first-time offender to whom the prospect of imprisonment was in itself a grave punishment and of great shame. He had a family with three children. The default sentence proposed by the prosecution alone would see Chang missing out on the formative years of his children’s lives.

252    Pertinently, the imposition of a default imprisonment term would avoid any prejudice that might be caused to Chang and obviate the need to venture into “quasi-civil” proceedings in the event that an attachment order was made. In the present case, the strain on judicial resources would be even more prominent given the complexity, permutations and steps involved. It would also be prejudicial to Chang as he would have to incur additional legal costs dealing with such quasi-civil proceedings long after any final judgment was given in the present case. In this regard, Chang should be given the opportunity, if necessary, to elect the means to raise funds for the purpose of the payment of a penalty order. This would only be allowed if a default term of imprisonment were ordered and the seized assets were released.

253    If the Court accepted the defence’s submission that a default imprisonment term would serve the interest of justice, an order should be made at the first instance to incentivise the payment of any penalty order and conversely deter the evasion of such payment. The default term of 30 months’ imprisonment submitted by the prosecution was manifestly excessive and out of step with case precedents which showed that a measured approach was taken by sentencing Courts when determining the appropriate default sentence. The default sentence imposed should also not be higher that the custodial sentence meted out. This would accord with the rationale for default sentences being a tool for disgorgement of payments and not a punitive measure. Taking the above into consideration, the defence submitted that if a penalty of $6,220,095 were imposed, the appropriate default sentence would be 15 months’ imprisonment.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing considerations & principles

254    As mentioned earlier in these grounds, the sentencing process in this case straddled the issuance of the High Court’s judgement in _Masui_. Having considered the parties’ positions and supporting arguments on whether the High Court’s decision in _Masui_ was binding on me, I was the view that I was bound and hence applied the sentencing framework set out in _Masui_ in sentencing Koh and Chang. In coming to this view, I noted that while the prosecution and counsel for Koh took the position that the decision in _Masui_ was binding on me, counsel for Chang was of the view that it was not. Counsel for Chang argued that the Court was faced with two conflicting decisions from the High Court in _Masui_ and _Michael Tan_, and should elect not to adopt the sentencing framework laid out in _Masui_. To my mind, while Hoo J in _Michael Tan_ declined to devise a general sentencing framework for _all_ corruption offences under sections 5 and 6 of the PCA (which would include those in which the public service rationale might be engaged)[^207], Chan J in _Masui_ had specifically confined the framework therein to section 6 PCA offences which were _purely private_ in nature. As the charges in this case (except for the 19th charges) fell squarely into the ambit of the framework in _Masui_, I was of the view that the framework was binding on this Court.

##### (1)   A brief outline of the _Masui_ framework

255    To recapitulate, the High Court in _Masui_ introduced a two-stage, five-step sentencing framework for purely private sector corruption cases under sections 6(a) and 6(b) of the PCA. The framework may be outlined as follows:

> (a)     In Step 1, the Court identifies and assesses the relevant offence specific factors present on the facts of the case, guided by a table of non-exhaustive factors that go towards harm and culpability respectively.

> (b)     In Steps 2 and 3, the Court would derive an indicative starting sentence using the _Masui_ Matrix.

> (c)     In Steps 4 and 5, the Court considers the offender-specific factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence in question. These would include aggravating factors such as offences taken into consideration, relevant antecedents and evident lack of remorse as well as mitigating factors such as a guilty plea, co-operation with the authorities or actions taken to minimise harm to the victims. After determining the sentences for each charge, the Court would have regard to the totality principle in determining the global sentence to be imposed.

##### (2)   Application of the _Masui_ sentencing framework

(A)   Step 1

256    Having considered the parties’ submissions on sentence, it was apparent that the main bone of contention in this case was whether, and to what extent, the offence-specific sentencing factors were engaged. In my sentencing remarks, I had briefly mentioned my views on the relevant sentencing factors. I shall elaborate.

(I)    _Offence-specific factors going towards harm_

(a)    The intangible detriment caused to the principal, BP Singapore

257    While I agreed with the defence that there was no evidence of any actual, pecuniary loss caused to BP Singapore, an inquiry into the harm caused to the principal by a corrupted agent should not end there. The observations of the High Court in _Wong Chee Meng_ served as an apposite reminder of the insidious manner in which the principal might suffer harm. As noted by Menon CJ in _Wong Chee Meng_, even in instances where the principal did not suffer direct monetary harm from a corrupt transaction, the agent-principal relationship would have been suborned by the agent’s failure to disclose the true position to the principal, including the personal benefits the agent has received without the principal’s knowledge. In relation to this issue, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that there was in fact evidence reflecting the suborning of the principal-agent relationship between BP Singapore and Chang, and the potential harm BP Singapore was exposed to, as a result. These included the over- concentration of BP Singapore’s business with PPT and the sharing of BP’s confidential information with Koh. In my view, the fact that BP Singapore found itself having to coax PPT to stay and had difficulty diversifying its business with TCPs was symptomatic of the harm caused to BP Singapore by the corrupt arrangement between Koh and Chang.

258    Further, the fact that BP Marine enjoyed commercial success with PPT serving as its TCP should be viewed in the context of the mechanisms of the corrupt arrangements in the present case. As pointed out by Chang himself, PPT and Chang both depended on a performing BP Singapore. As BP Marine and PPT prospered, Chang stood to reap gains from both sides. Chang admitted that he was in fact “earning” more from his vested interest in PPT than from his employer BP Singapore.

(b)    Benefit derived by Koh

259    In relation to the benefits to Koh, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that Koh had derived substantial benefits from the corrupt agreement with Chang. First and foremost, as in the case of _Wong Chee Meng_, what Koh obtained from his cultivation of Chang over the years was having an “insider” in a senior position in BP Singapore who would be watching out for PPT’s interests. Secondly, as both Koh and Chang had told the CPIB, PPT was born from Chang’s suggestion to Koh to set up a company to serve as BP Singapore’s TCP. As explained earlier in these grounds, I found that the evidence indicated that Koh did not only benefit from profits earned by PPT, but also from his financial interests in other companies which derived business from PPT’s relationship with BP Singapore. In my view, a major part of the benefits derived by Koh from the corrupt arrangement with Chang was in having PPT entrenched as the main TCP for the top bunker fuel supplier by volume in Singapore at that time.

(c)    Impact on legitimate expectations of stakeholders in the bunkering industry and society at large

260    As highlighted by Menon CJ in _Wong Chee Meng_ citing V K Rajah JA’s decision in _Ang Seng Thor_ at \[46\], corruption was capable of giving rise to harm that was less readily apparent but no less detrimental to society. One of the harms caused by corruption was its impact on society’s expectations that transactions and decisions in both the private and public sphere would be carried out fairly and transparently. In this case, I found that the corrupt arrangement between Koh and Chang would have had a negative impact on legitimate expectations of stakeholders in the bunkering industry and society at large that transactions in this highly competitive industry would be carried out and decisions would be made in a fair and transparent manner, untainted by corrupt considerations. Contrary to the defence’s submissions, there was certainly a proximate nexus between the corrupt arrangement in this case and the business of the bunkering industry in Singapore, not least because it involved BP Singapore (who was then the top bunker trader) and its predominant TCP. Further, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that Singapore being one of the largest and most important bunkering ports in the world, these offences would have had the effect of undermining public confidence in the integrity of this strategic industry.

261    Before moving on to discuss the factors going towards culpability, I should clarify that I did not include the value of gratification given and received as a distinct, additional factor going towards harm. Instead, I took guidance from \[244\] to \[250\] of _Masui_ and considered the amount of gratification in this case in assessing the level of corrupt influence being exerted on Chang.[^208]

(II)    _Offence-specific factors going to culpability_

(a)    Planning and premeditation in putting in place the corrupt scheme, as well as in concealing the bulk of the payments through the use of overseas bank accounts

262    The scheme to set up a company, have it appointed a TCP to BP Singapore and for Chang to use his position in BP Singapore to advance its business, certainly involved significant deliberation, planning and careful execution on Chang and Koh’s part. The payment of the bulk of the gratification via fund transfers in Hong Kong to avoid detection, and Chang transferring the monies to various bank accounts in Singapore thereafter, also added a layer of complexity to the scheme. While I agreed with the defence’s submission that there was no web of corruption involved and there was only one giver and one receiver, I was not persuaded that there was a significant difference between the complexity of the arrangements in this case and those in _Leng Kah Poh_ and _Masui._ On the contrary, all three cases involved the parties using a company or business as a vehicle to enter into a commercial relationship with the principal, facilitated by the agent. While I did recognise that there was a difference in the manner in which gratification to the agent was derived, the schemes were, to my mind, largely comparable in terms of sophistication.

(b)    The abuse of position and breach of trust on the part of Chang

263    During Chang’s 13-year employment in BP Singapore, he had risen through the ranks from a Marine Support Executive to become a Manager with regional responsibilities for oil trades in the Eastern Hemisphere, spanning the markets from the Middle-East to Asia and Australia.[^209] Taking reference from the authorities delegated to him in BP Singapore,[^210] it was clear that Chang was a trusted employee of the company. In committing the offences, Chang had abused his position and betrayed the trust reposed in him by his principal.

(c)    The fact that the offences were motivated by greed

264    Based on my findings of fact that these transactions were corrupt payments and not genuine joint property investments, it could not be disputed that the offences were motivated by greed on both Koh and Chang’s part.

(d)    The quantum of the gratification involved per charge, which ranged from USD100,000 to a sum in excess of USD350,000

265    I had considered the quantum of the bribe involved per charge in assessing the culpability of Koh and Chang. As for the duration of offending, I agreed with the submissions of Chang’s counsel as well as the prosecution that in cases such as this where multiple charges were involved, this factor should be considered in Step 5 in calibrating the appropriate global sentence.

(B)   Steps 2 and 3

266    Having identified and assessed the relevant offence-specific factors in Step 1, I proceeded to determine the specific degree of severity for the harm and culpability parameters to be applied to the _Masui_ Matrix. In doing so, I had employed _Masui_ as a guide to determine where in the matrix the present case should be placed.

267    In _Masui_, Chan J had determined that there were two main factors in that case that went towards harm. The first was that significant harm was caused to the giver in that case, as the giver was forced to partake in an arrangement which did not make commercial sense and the profit-sharing arrangement in that case exposed the giver’s business to the risk of ever-increasing tax liability as the business flourished. Secondly, harm was caused to the receivers’ principal. The principal had successfully brought a civil suit against the offenders in respect of damages suffered and was awarded damages of about $875,000. Based on the above, Chan J found the aggregate harm to be at the lower end of severe for the purpose of the total sentence, and determined that the harm accruing from the individual instances of corruption, with each involving much smaller amounts of bribe, to be between the low and the middle portions of the moderate level, depending on the individual amounts of bribe for each charge.[^211] Turning to the present case, while there was no direct financial loss caused to Chang’s principal, nonetheless, detriment was caused to BP Singapore through the suborning of their agent-principal relationship. Be that as it may, I was of the view that the degree of harm caused to BP Singapore in the present case was less than that occasioned to the principal in _Masui_’s case. Next, though there was no harm caused to the giver of the bribe in the present case, there was significant benefit to the giver of gratification. To my mind, the amount of gratification that Koh was willing to pay to Chang was indicative of the value or worth the corrupt arrangement was to Koh. Where the giver in _Masui_ was coerced into entering and remaining in the corrupt scheme in order to protect his other business which he had built up over more than 20 years, Koh was motivated to make multiple payments in this case to keep PPT’s flourishing business as BP Singapore’s TCP intact. Further, an additional factor going towards harm was identified in the present case – that the corrupt scheme impacted negatively on society’s expectation of fair play and transparency in one of Singapore’s key industries. Having carefully weighed the sentencing factors relevant to harm in this case, I agreed with the prosecution (as well as Koh’s counsel) that the level of harm caused was _between the low to the middle level of the moderate range_.

268    Moving on to culpability, in _Masui_, Chan J found that there were four main factors that went towards culpability. Firstly, the amount of gratification involved in each charge was between $13,750 to $117,523. Chan J highlighted the Court’s observation in _Heng Tze Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 976</span> at \[25\] that the amount of gratification involved was an important factor in determining the proper sentences for corruption offences. Secondly, Chan J was of the view that the offences were sophisticated and involved considerable planning and premeditation. Thirdly, the offenders had threatened and coerced the giver into entering and remaining in the corrupt scheme, using the giver’s edible flour business as leverage. This was found to be a significant aggravating factor. Fourthly there was an abuse of position and a breach of trust. The offenders there occupied senior roles in their principal’s companies and were valued employees. A significant degree of trust had been reposed in both of them which they betrayed by conceiving of, and implementing the corrupt profit-sharing arrangement that continued for several years. Based on the above, Chan J found that culpability as a whole was at the higher end of medium. In our case, Chang and Koh had conceived a plan for Koh to set up PPT and have it appointed as a TCP. The understanding was that Chang would help PPT in advancing its business interest with BP Singapore. Comparing the facts in _Masui_ with the present case, I found that the level of sophistication of the scheme in the present case to be on par with that in _Masui_. Similar to _Masui_, there was significant abuse of position and breach of trust on the part of Chang as a senior, trusted officer in BP Singapore. Although the present case was a _Romel_ category 1 case and there was no threat or coercion practiced on Koh by Chang, the amount of gratification Koh provided to Chang in the present case far outstripped those received by each of the offenders in _Masui_. Having weighed the sentencing factors relevant to culpability in this case, I disagreed with both the prosecution’s and defence’s assessment of culpability and was of the view that _culpability was between the higher end of medium to the lower end of high_, depending on the quantum of individual amounts of bribe in each charge.

269    Having situated this case using the harm and culpability parameters in the _Masui_ matrix, I assessed the range of indicative starting sentences to be between 10 to 24 months’ imprisonment. I should add that, having carefully considered the issue of imposing conjunctive fines on each charge, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that it was neither appropriate nor necessary to do so in this case. Hence, the discrete ranges of indicative sentences were:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="51.86%"> <col width="48.14%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Starting sentence per charge</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">USD100,000 to USD 200,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 to 16 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">USD200,00 to USD300,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 to 22 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Above USD 300,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Above 22 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

271    Before moving on, I should clarify that in calibrating sentence for the individual charges, I was mindful that the 19th charge was one under section 5 of the PCA, and, strictly speaking, the _Masui_ framework would not be applicable to this charge. I had also carefully considered the submissions by Chang’s counsel that since he had already left BP Singapore by then, any culpability on his part in relation to this charge ought to be on the lowest end of the scale. As for harm, it was submitted that none could be linked to the 19th charge. In my view, based on my findings of fact in this case, the gratification in the 19th charge represented a final payment made by Koh to Chang pursuant to the same corrupt scheme as that in the preceding charges. I therefore agreed with the prosecution that there ought to be parity between the sentence imposed for this charge with the 1st to 18th charges.

(C)   Steps 4 and 5

272    Turning to the final steps of the framework, it was my view that there were no offender-specific factors which would apply to further moderate the individual sentences.

273    At this juncture, I had also considered the defence’s submissions that a discount should be accorded to the accused persons as there was inordinate delay in the prosecution of the case. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case, I was of the opinion that there was really no inordinate delay on the prosecution’s part in prosecuting this matter. Although the accused persons were only first charged about five-and-a-half years after investigations commenced, any delay during this time (and in particular the three-year gap between 2012 to 2015) was attributable to the lack of cooperation on accused persons’ part in obtaining the relevant bank statements from Hong Kong. This resulted in much time expended by CPIB in obtaining the bank statements from Hong Kong through the mutual legal assistance process. Further, given the duration of the offences, the multiple fund transfers that took place in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the Accused persons’ claim to have embarked on joint investments, I did not find the time taken to investigate the relevant transactions unreasonable. As for the conduct of the trial, I also did not find any lack of expedition or diligence on the prosecution’s part to have contributed to any substantive delay. In view of the above, I declined to accord any sentencing discount to the accused persons.

274    Moving on, I applied the totality principle to determine the appropriate global sentences. In this connection, I took into account the overall quantum of the gratification and the duration of offending from the inception of the corrupt scheme sometime in 2001, through the period of corrupt payments from 2006 to 2010. While Chang’s counsel had submitted that the one transaction rule should apply to the first 18 offences, it was clear to me that the facts and circumstances of this case would justify a departure from the one transaction rule with regard to the first 18 charges.

275    In calibrating the global sentence, I also took guidance from the decision of the High Court allowing the appeal on sentence in the case of _PP v Li Chaoyun and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 215</span> (“_Li Chaoyun_”). In that case, the offender was convicted after trial on a total of 34 charges under section 6(a) of the PCA. He was employed by Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“Jurong Shipyard”) as a section manager in the engineering department. He set up a company as a joint venture with the co-offender and assisted the company to successfully quote for contracts with Jurong Shipyard. In return, the offender received gratification in the form of share transfers as well as cash payments totalling $956,600 in value, from January 2012 to September 2014. Similar to the present case, there was no evidence that the corrupt arrangement caused direct financial harm to Jurong Shipyard. The trial court had originally sentenced the offender to a global sentence of 34 months’ imprisonment. At the hearing of the appeal on 6 May 2021, Justice Vincent Hoong reduced the global sentence to 24 months’ imprisonment.

#### Sentences imposed

276    Based on the full facts and circumstances of the case, Koh was sentenced as follows in relation to the proceeded charges against him:

278    I further ordered the sentences in DAC 908844-2017, DAC 908845-2017, DAC 908856-2017 and DAC 908860-2017 to run consecutively. The other terms of imprisonment would run concurrently.

#### The penalty imposed and default sentence

279    Having determined the appropriate sentence, I moved on to consider the imposition of the penalty and default sentence.

280    Section 13(1) of the PCA provided:

> “Where a court convicts any person of an offence committed by the acceptance of any gratification in contravention of any provision of this Act, then, if that gratification is a sum of money or if the value of that gratification can be assessed, the court shall, in addition to imposing on that person any other punishment, order him to pay as a penalty, within such time as may be specified in the order, a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification or is, in the opinion of the court, the value of that gratification, and any such penalty shall be recoverable as a fine.”

281    In this case, it was not disputed that the total quantum of the gratification involved in the 1st to 19th charges was S$5,877,595 (after conversion from US dollars) and the amount of S$342,500 represented the balance of the S$525,000 paid by Koh pursuant to the agreement in the 20th charge after taking into consideration the repayment of S$182,500 to Koh. The defence submitted that both these sums should not constitute the penalty against Chang as the first sum was Koh’s contribution to joint investments while the second sum was Koh’s legitimate investment in Mindchamps City Square. I could not agree with the defence’s submissions as it ran contrary to my findings of fact that the defence of joint investments, whether in properties or the Mindchamps business was a sham and that the payments for Mindchamps City Square were made pursuant to the corrupt arrangement.

282    In this connection, I had also considered the prosecution’s submissions for me to defer making any order under section 319(1)(b) of the CPC, including that of imposing a default sentence in relation to the penalty order. Having considered the prosecution’s arguments, I did not agree with the proposed approach. I was of the view that the usual practice of pronouncing a default sentence when the Court imposed a fine or penalty order would not bar the Court from doing any of the other things under section 319(1)(b) CPC where appropriate, before the fine or penalty was paid in full. The imposition of a suitable default sentence would also incentivise Chang to make payment of the penalty, without requiring the Court to resort to other means of enforcement. I should hasten to add, however, that I agreed with the prosecution that it was not appropriate to impose an attachment order against Chang at the point of sentencing. Hence, I left the issue open for determination, if and when appropriate and necessary.

283    I therefore imposed a penalty on Chang of $6,220,095, in default 28 months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that the default sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment was proportionate to the quantum of the penalty imposed and would serve the purpose of deterring Chang from evading payment of the same.

## Conclusion

284    The total net sentence against Koh was _54 months’ imprisonment_.

285    The total net sentence against Chang was _54 months’ imprisonment and a penalty of S$6,220,095, in default 28 months’ imprisonment_**.**

286    In my view, these sentences were reflective of and proportionate to the accused persons’ criminality and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.
