21 June 2019

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

### The Accused Persons

1       The first accused, Lim Hong Liang (“Lim”), paid the second accused, Ong Hock Chye (“Ong”) to recruit thugs to beat up his mistress’ boyfriend (“victim”). Ong managed to find these thugs who then tailed the mistress and the victim and assaulted the victim. One of the thugs slashed the victim’s face with a knife which scarred his face permanently. The two accused (Lim and Ong) were charged for the offence of engaging in a conspiracy to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to the victim, under s 326 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“Penal Code”). In addition, Ong faced two other unrelated charges which were stood down.

### Verdict, Sentence and Appeal

2       Both accused claimed trial to their respective charge. Lim was represented at the trial whereas Ong was in person. At the conclusion of the trial and after considering all the evidence and the respective parties’ submissions, I found that the prosecution has proved the charge against both accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, both accused were convicted of their respective charge.

3       Lim was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment. No caning was imposed because he was 55 years old. Ong, who was 48 years old, was sentenced to 5½ years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

4       Lim is appealing against both his conviction and sentence. Ong is only appealing against his sentence. Both are presently on bail pending their appeal. For completeness, the two remaining charges against Ong that were stood down before the trial have been scheduled for a pre-trial conference at the time of writing these grounds.

## Charges

5       For ease of reference, I will set out the charge against both accused respectively. Thus, Lim was charged as follows:

**Lim’s Charge**

> You…are charged that you, some time on or before 30 April 2016, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Ong Hock Chye, Lim De Mai Ron, Nur Muhammad Irwan Bin Mohd Ngat (“Irwan”), Mohammad Amin Bin Aman, and Nur Atika Fuziana Binte Sherhan, to do a certain thing, namely, to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Joshua Koh Kian Yong (“Joshua”) by means of an instrument for stabbing or cutting, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, on 30 April 2016 at or about 1.07 a.m. in the vicinity of 9 Townshend Road, Singapore, to wit, Irwan did use a pen-knife, being an instrument used for stabbing or cutting, to slash Joshua on his face, resulting in lacerations and the permanent disfiguration of Joshua’s face, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 326 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

6       As for Ong, because he was subject to a police supervision order at the time of the offence, he was therefore liable to enhanced punishment under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. His charge reads as follows:

**Ong’s Charge**

> You…are charged that you, some time on or before 30 April 2016, in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with Lim Hong Liang, Lim De Mai Ron, Mohammad Amin Bin Aman, Nur Muhammad Irwan Bin Mohd Ngat (“Irwan”), and Nur Atika Fuziana Binte Sherhan, to do a certain thing, namely, to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Joshua Koh Kian Yong (“Joshua”) by means of an instrument for stabbing or cutting, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, on 30 April 2016 at or about 1.07 a.m. in the vicinity of 9 Townshend Road, Singapore, to wit, Irwan did use a pen-knife, being an instrument used for stabbing or cutting, to slash Joshua on his face, resulting in lacerations and the permanent disfiguration of Joshua’s face, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 326 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed);

> and further that you, at the time of the commission of the said offence, which is a scheduled offence under the Third Schedule to the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67, 2000 Rev Ed), were a person subject to supervision under the said Act by virtue of an Order made by the Minister on the 1 April 2016 and which Order has not been revoked, and you are thereby liable to enhanced punishment under section 35 of the said Act.

## The Prosecution’s Case

7       The prosecution’s case is essentially that Lim’s mistress was cheating on him with her boyfriend, the victim. In revenge, Lim paid Ong and a gang of thugs to beat up and disfigure the victim. There were a total of 7 persons involved in the conspiracy to hurt the victim, including the two accused. All the conspirators, including the thugs and another middleman, have pleaded guilty to their respective charges. It is the prosecution’s case[^1] that the two accused are the most culpable of the conspirators and, as it turned out, also the most unrepentant since they decided to claim trial.

8       At the trial, the other conspirators were called to give evidence for the prosecution. Lim’s mistress and her boyfriend, the victim, also testified. I will summarise the prosecution’s case as evidenced by the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and as set out in the prosecution’s submission[^2] as follows.

9       The attack on the victim and the injuries caused are not in dispute. The fact that Ong had instructed the thugs to carry out assault on the victim is also not in dispute. The main dispute is whether (i) Lim had instructed Ong and therefore masterminded the assault on the victim; and if he did, whether (ii) the conspiracy extended to causing grievous hurt to the victim by slashing and permanently disfiguring his face.

### Relationship between the parties

10     Lim was portrayed as a successful businessman who owned a logistics company. At the material time of the offence in 2016, he was married with three children. It is not in dispute that he had a mistress, (PW4) Audrey Chen Ying Fang (“Audrey”).[^3] The salacious details as to how they met and became intimately involved and also how much he lavished on her, while interesting as tabloid fodder, are largely irrelevant to the charges. Suffice to say that Audrey moved into Lim’s apartment in a condominium and was provided financially in every way by Lim from late 2014 till May 2017.[^4] In short, she was a kept woman. In return for Lim taking care of Audrey financially, he expected her to be faithful to him and not to “_fool around outside_”.[^5]

11     Lim lavished gifts on Audrey. More importantly, Lim provided Audrey with a car, a white Mercedes Benz C180 bearing registration number SKX 1991B (“Audrey’s car”), which she drove exclusively from February 2016. However, without her knowledge, Lim fitted a Global Positioning System (“GPS”) tracking device within the dashboard of Audrey’s car so that he could keep tabs on her whereabouts.

12     As providence would have it, Audrey met and started dating the victim ((PW8) Joshua Koh Kian Yong) sometime in March 2016. Rather unwisely and indiscreetly, they made “public” their status as a couple on Facebook. Audrey believed that Lim found out about their relationship and was “_obviously unhappy_”[^6] that she was cheating on Lim. In particular, Lim removed all her handbags and told her that if she wanted them back, she would have to stop seeing the victim.[^7] However, she continued her relationship with the victim.

### Revenge Beating – 8 April 2016

13     Lim went to China for a kidney transplant sometime in April 2016. It is the prosecution’s case that Lim found out from his sources that the victim was visiting Audrey in his apartment. Lim claimed that he found out from his domestic help that Audrey had brought a man back to the apartment.[^8] On the evening of 8 April 2016, when Lim was still in China, Lim instructed his son, who was accompanied by Lim’s nephew cum employee, Ron[^9], to go to his apartment to retrieve a sum of money from his safe. Ron is one of the conspirators named in the charges. Lim probably thought it would be wise to remove the money since the victim was staying in the apartment. In any event, after Lim’s son had retrieved the cash, Ron assaulted Joshua by punching and kicking him. When the victim asked Ron the reason for the assault, Ron said (in Mandarin) _“_I was sent here to kill you_”_.[^10] After the assault, they took photos of the victim with their mobile phones. The victim’s face was swollen and bleeding after the assault.[^11] He was conveyed by ambulance to the hospital and was found to have sustained fractures of the nasal bone and nasal septum.[^12] Audrey also testified that the two men had taken away all her branded handbags and watches.[^13]

14     It is the prosecution’s case that Lim had ordered Ron to beat up the victim. Audrey received three voice messages from Lim that evening after the attack. The messages (in Mandarin) from Lim were admitted in evidence as follows to show that Lim knew about the victim and was behind the revenge beating:

>   
| 

11:31pm:

 | 

All thanks to Summer \[a friend of Audrey\]. I have to thank Summer. She told me that you brought ‘Joshua’ back home to sleep. I don’t know about it. Your good friend told me.[^14]

 |
| 

11:43pm:

 | 

What you did, was it right or wrong? You bring a man back to sleep when I go overseas. What you did was it right or wrong? I provided you and everything. You want money, I provided you with money. I even protect 300K for you to open a coffee shop.[^15]

 |
| 

11:44pm:

 | 

Please do some reflection. From the way I treat you, I accommodate to all your demands. What you did was right or wrong?[^16]

 |

  
  

15     Audrey replied saying that what Lim had done to the victim was too much and also informed that the victim was now in ICU_._[^17] Lim was not the least surprised and berated Audrey for betraying him by bringing the victim home.[^18] Lim also let on that the police had already contacted his son.

### Revenge slashing (Offence) - 30 April 2016

16     Notwithstanding the beating, Audrey did not break off her relationship with the victim. She in fact left the apartment and stayed with the victim in various hotels to escape from Lim.[^19] This angered Lim even more and he wanted to exact a heavier punishment on the victim. He instructed Ron to find someone to teach the victim a lesson. Lim wanted the victim’s limbs to be broken. Ron then approached Ong (the second accused) who in turn recruited and paid a gang of thugs to beat up the victim. Whilst the prosecution has described these thugs as “hitmen”[^20], I would much prefer a less sensationalistic descriptor. It is the prosecution’s case that Ong suggested that the thugs slash the victim so as to disfigure the victim’s face and Lim agreed to the suggestion.

17     The attack that was carried out on the victim is not in dispute. Two of the thugs assaulted the victim and one of them slashed the victim’s face with a penknife, causing a permanent scar across the victim’s face. This amounted to grievous hurt within the meaning of s 320(_f_) of the Penal Code.

18     The couple was staying at Oasia Hotel in Novena on the night of 29 April 2016. Just after midnight on 30 April 2016 (i.e. morning of the offence), they left the hotel and proceeded to an eatery located off Townshend Road for supper. Audrey said she thought that they were being followed by a group of Malays in a car. They arrived at the eatery and had supper. At about 1.00am, two Malay men attacked the victim. He was punched on the head and slashed in the face. Audrey saw one of the men “_signal, like, ‘let’s go’_”[^21] to the other and they ran off. She saw that the victim was bleeding on the mouth and on the arm.[^22] She called the police.[^23]

19     The attack of the victim was captured on CCTV at the eatery and the footage was admitted in evidence and shown in court.[^24] The assault on the victim and the identity of the assailants were not challenged.

20     The victim testified that he was certain that Lim was behind the attacks on him because prior to the offence in question, Lim had made a veiled threat against him by telling Audrey to caution the victim to _“open \[his\] eyes big enough to see \[his\] surroundings”_.[^25]

### Grievous hurt caused by knife

21     It is not disputed that the victim sustained the following injuries[^26]:

> i.     Laceration measuring 2cm over the left upper lip;

> ii.     Laceration measuring 5cm over the right lower lip;

> iii.     Laceration over the right tricep area;

> iv.     Bruise measuring about 3cm over the left face;

> v.     Bruise measuring about 5cm over the back of the head; and

> vi.     Tenderness over the upper neck region.

22     The doctor who had examined the victim at the hospital, (PW9) Dr Lee Chee Sean, testified that the lacerations on the left upper lip and right lower lip could have been caused from a “_single slash_.”[^27]

23     The victim was referred to the Plastic Surgery Department and operated on by (PW10) Dr Jeremy Sun Mingfa (“Dr Sun”) to repair his lacerations. Dr Sun stated in his medical report (P14) that there were lacerations over the lip and face and that any laceration will result in permanent scarring of the skin. Dr Sun testified that he saw the victim in court on the morning of 18 May 2018 and observed that there was _“a very faint white line, vertical white line on the upper lip but the right angle of the mouth, there is a depressed, slightly reddish scar.”_ Dr Sun gave the opinion that the appearance of the victim’s scar was age-appropriate considering that the injury was sustained two years ago. In Dr Sun’s opinion, the scar “.._is unlikely to change any further_” and this would be the victim’s permanent state.[^28]

### Ron and the other conspirators

24     As noted above, Ron is Lim’s nephew and also worked for him as a driver in his company.[^29] Sometime in March 2016, Lim asked Ron to tail Audrey and to report to him her whereabouts. Lim would pay Ron each time he reported to Lim.[^30] Ron was able to track Audrey’s car by accessing her car’s GPS tracking account. He obtained the password to the said account from the company’s HR executive, (PW7) Lin Ruoyan (“Fion”), as directed by Lim.[^31] Fion also worked for Lim in the company and Lim is her uncle. It is not disputed that Lim instructed Fion to provide Ron with the password to the GPS tracking account for Audrey’s car.

25     In respect of the revenge beating, Lim had instructed Ron to go his apartment to beat up the victim and also to remove Audrey’s bags and money. Ron agreed to do so because he was obligated to Lim. Ron was accompanied by Lim’s son when they went to Lim’s apartment to confront the victim. Lim told Ron not to implicate him after assaulting the victim.

26     Sometime after the revenge beating, Lim called Ron to look for someone to break the victim’s limbs because the victim was still seeing Audrey. Ron was at Ong’s (second accused) flat when Lim called him. Ong took over the phone from Ron and spoke directly to Lim. Ong said he knew people who would do the job. He further suggested that instead of breaking the victim’s arms and legs, they should slash and disfigure his face. Lim agreed to the suggestion.[^32]

27     Lim paid Ong (through Ron) $2000 as “transportation fee.” Ong then called the thugs i.e. (PW12) Nur Muhammad Irwan Bin Mohd Ngat (“Irwan”) and (PW14) Mohammad Amin Bin Aman (“Amin”) whom he got to know from his prison days. Ong offered them the “job” of slashing the victim’s face. Ong then told Ron that he had found the people for the job. Lim paid Ong (through Ron) $8000 i.e. $2000 for Ong and $6000 for the thugs. Lim also provided a photograph of the victim for the thugs to identify the victim. Lim further instructed Ron to provide the GPS account details and password to the thugs.

28     The hired thugs were:

> (i)     Irwan;[^33]

> (ii)     (PW11) Nur Atika Fuziana Binte Sherhan (“Atika”) – Irwan’s girlfriend;[^34]

> (iii)     (PW13) Juhari Bin Ab Karim (“Juhari”) – Irwan’s friend;[^35] and

> (iv)     Amin.[^36]

29     The hired thugs (except Juhari) met Ong and Ron on 27 April 2016 at a coffee-shop in Toa Payoh. The discussion was mainly between Ong, Amin and Irwan. It is not in dispute that Atika had only a minor role and that Juhari was only subsequently recruited by Irwan. Ong explained to Amin and Irwan that the job was to slash the victim’s face. Ron provided them with the victim’s photograph. Atika was given the GPS username and password to track Audrey’s car. The thugs would be paid $5000 for the job. A “downpayment” was given with the balance to be paid after the job.[^37] The thugs were told that the victim needed to be taught a lesson because he had cheated a girl. After the meeting, Irwan told Atika that Ong said _“there was some issue with a Chinese guy”_ and that he was _“gonna leave a mark on that Chinese guy’s face”_.[^38] Amin’s recollection was that Ong’s instruction to them was to _“punch the guy”_, _“teach the guy a lesson”_, and to _“leave a mark on the face”._[^39]

30     Atika used the GPS tracking account to track Audrey’s car between 27-30 April 2016. She also physically followed them by tailing the car a number of times. She was carrying out reconnaissance to look for a suitable location to carry out the assault.[^40] On 29 April 2016, Atika tracked Audrey’s car to the carpark at Oasia Hotel. However, they did not carry out the job there as there were many CCTV cameras at that location. Later that evening, they tracked Audrey’s car to Townshend Road. They thought there were no CCTV cameras in the area and decided to carry on the job there.[^41]

31     Irwan, Amin and Juhari carried out the job at Townshend Road.[^42] Juhari first walked up to the victim and punched him in the face. Juhari continued punching the victim who tried to cover his face. Irwan then came over on the other side and slashed the victim’s face with a pen-knife. Amin was also present at the scene but did not physically attack the victim.[^43] After the attack, the three thugs left the scene and drove off. Later that morning at about 10 am, Ong met Amin and Irwan at Queensway Shopping Centre and paid them the balance amount for the job.

32     After the revenge slashing, Ong also called Ron to report that the job had been completed. A day or two later, Ron showed Lim a photo taken of the victim after he had been slashed. Lim told Ron not to expose him (Lim) and promised to pay Ron $5000 a month. However, Ron did not eventually receive any money from Lim.[^44]

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

33     At the close of the prosecution’s case, neither accused made any submission of no case to answer. I was satisfied that there was prima facie evidence to support the key elements of the charge at the close of the prosecution’s case. Accordingly, I called on both accused to give their defence to their respective charge.

## The Defence

34     As Ong is not appealing against his conviction, there is no necessity to set out his defence in detail, except to state that he did not dispute that he was the one who found the thugs to beat up the victim. Ron wanted the victim’s “hands and legs” to be broken. There was a suggestion to slash the victim’s face instead but Ong denied making that suggestion. He was told of that intention by either Amin or Ron later when they asked for $5000 to carry out the job.[^45] He also claimed that he merely introduced Ron to the thugs and did not implicate Lim in the conspiracy to assault the victim.

### Lim’s defence

35     Lim also chose to take the stand to give his defence.

36     First of all, Lim denied instructing Ron to carry out the revenge beating at his apartment. Lim claimed that he merely asked his son to retrieve the cash from the safe in his bedroom because his maid had called him to tell him that there was a man in the apartment. Ron happened to be with his son at the time and therefore, they went to the apartment together.[^46] Lim claimed not to be aware of Audrey’s infidelity, let alone the identity of the victim, until he received the call from his maid.

37     Lim also denied any involvement in the revenge slashing of the victim on 30 April 2016. He claimed that he has never spoken to Ong before, let alone conspire with him to slash the victim. He also did not ask Ron to arrange for the victim to be assaulted. He has never spoken to Ong or any of the thugs.[^47] It is a significant point in the defence that only one person (Ron) out of all the alleged conspirators was able to identify Lim.[^48] Lim did however give Ron $2000 but that was for Ron’s motorcycle instalment or repairs and had nothing to do with any plan to assault the victim.[^49]

## Court’s Findings and Reasons

38     The charge against Lim (and also against Ong) is one of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy to cause grievous hurt to the victim by means of a cutting/stabbing instrument and pursuant to that conspiracy, Irwan slashed and permanently disfigured the victim’s face with a pen-knife. It is not in dispute that Irwan had slashed and permanently disfigured the victim’s face with a pen-knife. The issues in this case are whether Lim was one of the abettors and if so, the scope of the conspiracy.

### Law on abetment by conspiracy

39     The law on abetment by conspiracy is comprehensively addressed by both the prosecution[^50] and the defence[^51]. I will set out the relevant statutory provisions and some of the more relevant principles as decided by case-law as follows.

40     First of all, there are three types of abetment i.e. abetment by (a) instigation; (b) conspiracy; and (c) aiding. The present charge concerns the second type of abetment (by conspiracy) which is defined in s 107(b) of the Penal Code as follows:

> 107.  A person abets the doing of a thing who –

>> (a)    \[Instigation\]

>> (b)    engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing;

>> (c)    \[Aiding\].

41     The elements for a charge which alleges an abetment by way of conspiracy are laid down in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[76\]:

> The essential elements of abetment by conspiracy are: first, the person abetting must engage with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; second, the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and third, an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.

42     Explanation 5 to s 108 of the Penal Code and the accompanying illustration also make it clear that it is not necessary for the abettor to have agreed or arranged directly with all the other conspirators or even the person who commits the offence:

> _Explanation 5_ – It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.

_Illustration_

> _A_ concerts with _B_ a plan for poisoning _Z_. It is agreed that _A_ shall administer the poison. _B_ then explains the plan to _C_, mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning _A_’s name. _C_ agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to _B_ for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. _A_ administers the poison; _Z_ dies in consequence. Here, though _A_ and _C_ have not conspired together, yet _C_ has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which _Z_ has been murdered. _C_ has therefore committed the offence defined in this section, and is liable to the punishment for murder.

43     While there must be knowledge of a common design and the unlawful objective of the conspiracy, not every conspirator needs to be equally informed as to every detail of the conspiracy. It was held in _Nomura Taiji v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 259</span> at \[110\] that:

> Thus, in essence, although there must be knowledge of a common design, it is not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed as to the details. However, they must at least be aware of the general purpose of the plot and that plot must be unlawful. The test of guilt is not what was the object of the accused, but whether having regard to the immediate object of the instigation or conspiracy, the act done by the principal is one which according to ordinary experience and common sense, the abettor must have seen as foreseeable – see _The Penal Law of India_ by Sir Hari Singh Gour at p 945.

See also the holding of then Yong Pung How CJ in _Er Joo Nguang and Another v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 60</span> at \[34\].

44     It was also held in _PP v Yeo Choon Poh_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 302</span> at \[20\] that an agreement between parties may be inferred from the words and actions of the parties:

> One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been coordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.

45     Finally, s 111 of the Penal Code also stipulates that an abettor may be liable for abetting an act even when a different act is done:

> When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had directly abetted it:

> Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed…in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.

### Ong is guilty of the charge

46     I found Ong to be guilty of the charge of abetting Irwan to slash the victim’s face, by engaging in a conspiracy with Lim and the others to cause grievous hurt to the victim by means of a cutting/stabbing instrument. The fact that Ong engaged in a conspiracy to cause grievous hurt to the victim is not disputed by Ong. The fact that Juhari and Irwan had physically assaulted the victim is not in dispute. The fact that Irwan permanently disfigured the victim by slashing the victim’s face with a pen-knife is also not disputed. I reject Ong’s defence that he did not make the suggestion to slash the victim’s face.

47     I also reject Ong’s defence that he did not speak to or engage in a conspiracy with Lim. Even if Lim is removed from the equation, Ong would still be guilty of abetting the slashing of the victim. He admitted as much in his submission at the close of the trial.[^52] However, at the end of the day, I found him guilty as charged. He did not appeal against his conviction.

48     For the sake of argument, even if it is accepted that Ong had never spoken to Lim (a point which is heavily relied on by the defence), this fact in itself would not absolve Lim from the present charge. As highlighted above, explanation 5 to s 108 of the Penal Code and the accompanying illustration makes it abundantly clear that it is not necessary for the abettor to concert the offence or conspire together with each and every conspirator. As a matter of law, even if Lim was an undisclosed principal and Ron acted as Lim’s agent and conspired with Ong to recruit Ong’s men, Lim would still be liable for abetting Ong’s men to slash the victim, notwithstanding that Lim did not speak to Ong directly. I will return to this point later on in my judgment.

### Lim is guilty of the charge

49     I found Lim guilty of his charge.

#### Lim had the motive

50     I found that Lim has more than sufficient motive to punish and exact revenge on the victim. After all, his mistress was cheating on him by being with the victim and that had hurt his feelings and wounded his ego. He was betrayed by his mistress and the victim was the cause of that. To put it bluntly, the victim had stolen his woman.

51     I found that Lim had instructed Ron to keep tabs on Audrey by means of the GPS device installed in her car. The defence has pointed out that a GPS tracking device was installed in all of Lim’s company cars. The defence also claimed that Lim was concerned that Audrey was taking drugs or that she would drive into Malaysia. The defence tendered evidence of a police report that Lim made to CNB.[^53] However, I noted that all these allegations that Audrey was abusing drugs were not put to Audrey. Furthermore, as the prosecution has pointed[^54] out quite poignantly, the information was given to CNB only after Audrey had given evidence on the stand. In any case, I found that even if these claims and concerns were accepted, they do not detract from the fact Lim had Ron specifically tail Audrey because she was seeing another man. In other words, his possessiveness as regards Audrey would not be inconsistent with (but would in fact encompass) his concerns, if any, that she may be taking drugs or driving to Malaysia possibly to abuse drugs.

52     I found that it was Lim who had instigated Ron to beat up the victim at the apartment (i.e. revenge beating) as a lesson and revenge for seeing Audrey and staying over at the apartment. The WhatsApp messages highlighted above that Lim sent to Audrey on the very night after the revenge beating[^55] clearly showed that Lim was well aware that Ron had beaten up the victim. The messages also clearly refuted Lim’s claim that he did not know the identity of the victim or that he was seeing Audrey. Lim’s claim that he sent his son to remove the cash from the safe in his apartment (likely because the victim was staying in the apartment) does not explain why Ron also went along. Clearly, while the son was tasked to retrieve Lim’s money, Ron’s purpose was to beat up the victim. However, despite the beating, the victim continued to be with Audrey and therefore Lim decided to take even more drastic measures by abetting Ron and the rest to cause even more permanent injuries to the victim.

53     In fact, as pointed out by the prosecution[^56], Lim’s rage at being betrayed did not abate and continued even after he was charged for the present offence. Audrey testified that sometime in April 2017, Lim confronted and threatened her and her male companion.[^57] Lim did not deny threatening Audrey and he received a stern warning from the police for an offence under s 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A).

54     Unlike Ron, Lim had both the motive and financial muscle to pay Ong and his thugs to teach the victim a severe and lasting lesson without needing to get his (Lim’s) hands dirty. It was all too easy for Lim to push all the blame to Ron.

#### Lim abetted Ron, Ong and the others

55     I accept Ron’s evidence which implicated Lim as being the mastermind of the conspiracy leading to the slashing of the victim on 30 April 2016. Ron also implicated Lim in respect of the revenge beating at the apartment on 8 April 2016. I also found that his evidence is largely consistent with the following statements that he gave to the police[^58]:

> (i)     P20 was recorded on 3 January 2018 and relates to both the revenge beating and slashing incidents; and

> (ii)     P21 and P22 are identical to P20 and were recorded on 17 April and 19 April 2018, after Ron had pleaded guilty and sentenced.

56     I agree with the prosecution’s submission[^59] and I accept Ron’s testimony as to the following material facts:

> a.     That Lim instructed Ron to use the GPS account for Audrey’s car and paid him to follow her to report her whereabouts to Lim[^60];

> b.     That Lim instructed Ron to beat up the victim at his apartment and also to remove the valuables from his safe[^61];

> c.     That Lim asked Ron not to implicate him to the police in respect of the revenge beating[^62];

> d.     That Lim then asked Ron to find someone to break the victim’s arms and legs because he was still seeing Audrey;[^63]

> e.     That Ong offered to help Lim[^64];

> f.     That Lim paid Ong (through Ron) a down-payment[^65];

> g.     That Ong suggested to Ron that instead of breaking the victim’s arms and legs, they should leave a lasting impact by cutting the victim’s face with a penknife, and that Lim agreed when Ron relayed this suggestion to Lim[^66];

> h.     That Lim gave Ong (through Ron) the balance payment for the job and also provided a photograph of the victim for identification as well as the access codes to the GPS in Audrey’s car[^67];

> i.     Tat after the job, Ron informed Lim that the job was done[^68]; and

> j.     That when Ron was called up for investigations, Lim promised to pay Ron a sum of money every month if Ron did not implicate Lim[^69].

57     The defence does not disagree that Ron’s evidence in court is consistent with his statements in P20-22.[^70] However, the defence takes issue with the prosecution’s reliance on these statements in their submission. To be clear, I made a finding on the above enumerated material facts based on Ron’s testimony in court and not in reliance on his statements in P20-22. However, I considered that his testimony is consistent with these statements.

58     I found that as a matter of logic and evidence, Ron’s evidence is to be preferred over Lim’s denial of his involvement. There is neither reason nor motive for Ron to engage a group of thugs to cause grievous hurt to the victim. If Ron (for whatever reason) wanted to beat up the victim, he would and could easily have done so himself which was what happened at the apartment. However, that was a revenge beating at the behest of Lim. Whilst Lim may have been motivated by and consumed by jealousy and anger to want to teach the victim a lesson for sleeping with his mistress, Ron had no motive to hurt the victim, even less so to cause grievous hurt to him. He was merely acting on Lim’s instructions when he went to Lim’s apartment to beat up the victim and he did so out of a sense of loyalty. He was again complying with Lim’s instructions when he acted as an intermediary between Lim and Ong and his thugs. It was a conspiracy to disfigure the victim. This went beyond simply beating him up. It made no sense and there is absolutely no reason for Ron to have acted on his own to engage Ong and his men to carry out such a vicious and meticulous attack. Ron could not have been the master-mind behind the conspiracy.

59     Although not a significant point, I did not think that Ron had the financial means to recruit Ong and his thugs. After all, he was merely working for Lim as a driver. I note that the defence has calculated Ron’s total salary for the three years that he worked for Lim. The defence’s point is that Ron has earned enough money to pay Ong and his gang.[^71] That may be true if I were to look purely at his aggregate salary for three years. However, if I were to consider that the job to slash the victim would cost him $10,000, that represented 200% of his gross monthly pay, without even making allowances for living expenses. In that sense, it would be reasonable to conclude that Ron did not have the financial means to recruit Ong his men for the job.

60     Counsel for the defence confronted Ron with the following statements that Ron gave which were inconsistent with his testimony and his statements in P20-22:

> (i)     D1 was recorded on 9 April 2016 and relates only to the revenge beating on 8 April 2016 at the apartment;

> (ii)     D2-D5 were recorded between 5-13 May 2016 in respect of the revenge slashing on 30 April 2016;

> (iii)     D6 is a cautioned statement recorded on 8 May 2016;

61     However, I found that these apparent inconsistencies must be seen and understood in the circumstances when Ron gave these statements and that they do not detract from his testimony in court. For example, in D1 where Ron recounts the events of the revenge beating at the apartment, he did not implicate Lim as the person who had instructed him to beat up the victim but claimed, instead to have gotten into a fight with the victim. However, I accept Ron’s explanation in court that he did not implicate Lim only because Lim asked him not to tell the police and also promised to pay Ron $2000 for keeping quiet.[^72] I accept and found that Ron owed some form of allegiance to Lim being both related to and employed by Lim and was therefore agreeable to not to get him involved, irrespective of whether Lim would reward him more for his reticence. Ultimately, there can be no doubt that Ron had beaten the victim to a pulp and that he had gone to the apartment on the instructions of Lim to do his bidding.

62     As regards the other statements in D2-D6 that the defence contended were inconsistent, I accept that these statements were recorded from Ron when he was being investigated for the present offence and he then tried to minimise his own involvement and culpability. However, he decided to come completely clean in the subsequent statements in P20-22.

63     Thus, the defence made an issue that according to the sequence of events in D2, Lim would have been in China and could not have personally given Ron the money to be handed to Ong. The defence placed the date of this handing of the money at around 13-14 April 2016 when Lim was out of the country. As regards inconsistencies and gaps in a witness’ testimony, the Court of Appeal in _Sandz Solutions Strategic and Others v Worldwide Assets Limited_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 27</span> (“_Sandz Solutions Stategic_”) observed that there will likely be discrepancies and inconsistencies in any witness’s testimony and that the court must recognise and give reasonable allowance for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. The appellate court at \[56\] highlighted that a witness should not be judged to be less credible merely because of gaps in his memory, particularly where a long period of time has passed since the occurrence of the events in question. Ultimately, the trial judge has to consider the _totality_ of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence. I venture to add that this observation is particularly apposite when it concerns a witness’ recollection of exact dates.

64     In this case, as rightly pointed out by the prosecution[^73], it was the defence who had calculated and placed the handing of the money at a specific time-frame. It was not Ron who said so in his statement. I accept Ron’s evidence, which he repeatedly stressed during cross-examination, that he had forgotten the actual dates. Nonetheless, he was consistent and clear as to the sequence of events.[^74] Therefore, I would not hold it against him for not being able to specifically pin-point the date on which he had gotten the money from Lim. Ultimately, I reiterate my finding that there can be no question Ron had acted on the instructions of Lim. It is also not disputed that Ron handed the money to Ong and the thugs at the meeting at the Toa Payoh coffee-shop. Therefore, Ron would have gotten the money from Lim at some point in time before the said meeting at the coffee-shop.

65     I accept and found that Ron has already pleaded guilty and sentenced for his role in the offence and has no motive to lie in court or fabricate evidence against Lim. I dismiss as irrational the defence suggestion[^75] that Ron was implicating Lim at the trial because the prosecution was appealing against Ron’s sentence which appeal had yet to be heard at the time he was testifying. I do not see the logic or reasoning behind the suggestion or how his chances of succeeding at the appeal would be improved by testifying against and implicating Lim. After all, Ron had already implicated Lim by admitting to the statement of facts when he pleaded guilty to his charge. I certainly do not think for one moment that the defence is implying that the prosecution had perhaps indicated to Ron that it would abandon the appeal in exchange for his favourable testimony. The defence certainly made it clear that it was not suggesting that Ron had been pressured in any way by the prosecution.[^76] Ultimately, the prosecution did proceed with the appeal against Ron’s sentence but did not succeed.

66     For completeness, I also considered the discrepancies raised as regards how much money was handed over to Ong and the rest and what was the share between them and so on. I did not consider these discrepancies, if at all, to be material. Ultimately, I found that Lim had (through Ron, the intermediary) paid Ong and his thugs to assault and slash the victim.

67     Notwithstanding the inconsistencies pointed out by the defence in D2-D6 when compared to P20-P22, I agree with prosecution’s submission[^77] that Ron did incriminate Lim in the conspiracy. Taken as a whole, there can be no doubt that Ron was acting on the instructions of Lim to pay Ong and the thugs for the job, as may be seen from the following references in the statements:

> a.     D2 at \[5\] – “I believed it was my uncle \[Lim\] who instructed “Chai” \[Ong\] to beat Joshua \[victim\] up.”

> b.     D3 at \[7\] – “About 3 days after “Chai” made contact with my uncle, my uncle called me on the phone at about 10am, and called me to go to his house to receive an envelope which contained money and other items, which I did not know what it was, to pass to “Chai”. My uncle also instructed me to hand over the GPS account to “Chai”.”

> c.     D4 at \[8\] – “At that time, my uncle called me to ask for Audrey’s location and I told him. Subsequently, “Chai” knew that the caller was my uncle and he asked for my phone to talk to my uncle. “Chai” then started to tell my uncle that my uncle need not to instruct me to do things and “Chai” can settle things for my uncle in return for money.”

> d.     D6 (cautioned statement) – “It’s my uncle Lim Hong Liang, create such things out.”

#### Lim agreed to slashing the victim’s face

68     Lim had originally intended to break the victim’s limbs. However, I accept Ron’s evidence that Ong then suggested to slash the victim’s face instead with a penknife. Although Ong denied making the suggestion, he agreed that slashing the victim’s face (as opposed to breaking his limbs) was better because it was quicker and it would leave a permanent mark on the victim’s face. More importantly, Ong said that leaving a mark on his face would be the most appropriate punishment for the victim because Ong used the mandarin phrase “xiao bai lian” to describe the victim which meant that the victim was a pretty boy _“using his face”_ to “_live off women_” and therefore deserved to have his face disfigured.[^78] Given the specific linguistic context of the suggestion, it could not therefore have come from one of the Malay conspirators. Further, Ong admitted in his statement he was the one who made the suggestion to slash the victim’s face.[^79] Ong’s statement was admitted in evidence as he did not challenge the voluntariness of his statement. In any case, Ong is not appealing against his conviction and consequently against my finding that he made the suggestion.

69     Apart from Ong’s admission, there was also no reason for Ron to make the suggestion since Lim’s instructions were to break the victim’s limbs. I therefore dismissed Ong’s defence that the suggestion did not originate from him. I found that he did suggest disfiguring the victim’s face because the victim was a pretty boy. I also found that Ron would have and did convey the suggestion to Lim who agreed with Ong’s suggestion.

70     As regards the Malay conspirators, both Irwan and Atika understood that the plan was to slash the victim’s face. Irwan did eventually carry out that plan by slashing the victim’s face. Amin testified that he thought that the plan was _“give him a lesson with a mark…on the face.”_ Amin’s understanding of the plan therefore stopped short of the detail of using a knife to slash the victim’s face. However, as held in _Sandz Solutions Strategic_, I ought to and was prepared to give some allowance for the imperfection or human fallibility of Amin’s recollection of the plan. In any case, Amin’s understanding of the general plan to leave a mark on the victim’s face is entirely consistent with and encompasses the more specific intention of using a knife to slash the victim’s face.

71     I agree with prosecution’s submission[^80]that because Lim showed Ron a photo of the victim with his face slashed,[^81] this demonstrated that Lim was fully aware of and complicit in the plan to slash the victim’s face. Lim also offered to pay Ron $5000 in exchange for his silence.

72     The lowest common evidential denominator amongst all the conspirators, including Ong and Amin, was to leave a mark on the victim’s face. That being the case, I was of the view that s 111 of the Penal Code (which was highlighted earlier) applied in that Lim would be liable for one act (i.e. leaving a mark on the victim’s face) even when a different act (i.e. slashing the victim’s face with a knife) is committed, because there can be no denying that the second act is the most direct and probable consequence of the abetment of the first act and was done in pursuance of the conspiracy (i.e, to cause grievous hurt).

73     For the sake of argument, even if it is accepted that Lim only wanted to break the victim’s limbs and the act that was eventually abetted was a completely different one of slashing the victim’s face, Lim would nonetheless be guilty, at the very least, of abetting Ong and the rest to cause grievous hurt to the victim by breaking his limbs.[^82] Counsel for the defence acknowledged this possibility when he addressed the court on sentencing[^83]:

> Now, as a matter of law, if a particular act is conspired to and another act results from that, it can still be---you can still find the accused person guilty. I concede that.

### Miscellaneous issues

74     The defence also invited the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution[^84] for failing to call a witness (one Edwin also known as “San Mao”) who was mentioned in Ron’s statements.[^85] Ron said in his statements (D3-D5) that Edwin was also present at Ong’s flat when Lim spoke to Ong on the phone and would be able to corroborate Ron’s testimony that Ong had spoken to Lim. The prosecution decided not to call Edwin but offered him to the defence. However, the defence also did not call Edwin. It would appear that Edwin was not useful to either side. In these circumstances and since the prosecution did offer Edwin to the defence and also provided the defence with his contact details, I declined to draw any adverse inference against the prosecution for not calling him as their witness.

75     The defence also made an application for the prosecution to furnish them with Edwin’s police statement.[^86] The prosecution accepts[^87] that it is under a common law duty to disclose to the defence a limited amount of unused material i.e. material which tends to undermine the Prosecution's case or strengthen the Defence's case: _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> at \[113\], \[114\] and \[117\] and _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 791</span> (“Kadar obligation”).

76     In summary, I accept prosecution’s submission[^88] that the Kadar obligation did not apply because (i) Edwin’s statement would not have been admissible as substantive evidence in court; and (ii) the statement would not have been exculpatory. I was unable to agree with the defence that the statement would be exculpatory.[^89] Although prosecution’s position is that the statement is neutral[^90], I would prefer to take the view that on the face of Ron’s evidence (that Edwin would be able to testify that Lim did speak to Ong), the statement is likely to inculpate Lim and therefore falls outside the Kader obligation to disclose.

77     In any event, the defence could have called Edwin to give evidence on behalf of the defence. They chose not to do so. In conclusion, I ruled that the prosecution is not obligated to furnish Edwin’s statement. Accordingly, I dismissed the defence’s application.

### Conclusion - Verdict

78     I accept Ron’s testimony which implicated Lim. I found that it was Lim, not Ron, who had masterminded the conspiracy to grievously hurt the victim. It would not have made any sense otherwise. I reject Ong’s defence that Lim was not involved. Having considered the totality of all the evidence, I reject Lim’s defence that he did not instruct Ron to find people to cause grievous hurt to the victim. I found that he did speak with Ong and enlisted his help to teach the victim a lesson. I further found that he agreed with Ong’s suggestion to slash the victim’s face with a knife in order to disfigure him by leaving a mark on his face, and paid Ong and his thugs after the job was completed. I found that the act of slashing the victim was eventually carried out by Irwan and his gang pursuant to the conspiracy to hurt the victim grievously.

79     In conclusion, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt against both Lim and Ong. Accordingly, both accused were convicted of their respective charge.

## The Sentence

80     Both Lim and Ong appealed against their respective sentence. There was no appeal by the prosecution notwithstanding that I did not agree with its proposed sentences. My reasons for the sentences imposed on the two accused are as follows.

### Prescribed punishment

81     The punishment prescribed for an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a knife under s 326 of the Penal Code is life imprisonment (which is not applicable here), or imprisonment up to 15 years, and a liability to a fine or caning. Pursuant to s 109 of the Penal Code, the abetment by conspiracy of the said offence is punishable with the same sentence if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment (which is the case here).

82     In the case of Ong, he was, at the time of the commission of the said offence, which is a scheduled offence under the Third Schedule to the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67, 2000 Rev Ed), subject to supervision under the said Act by virtue of an order made by the Minister. Ong is therefore liable to enhanced punishment under section 35 of the said Act.

83     For completeness, I should also add that s 335 of the Penal Code provides for a lesser punishment where there is “_grave and sudden provocation._” On the facts of the present case, I found that there was _no_ grave and sudden provocation by the victim. Neither Lim nor Ong conducted their defence on that basis.

### Parties’ sentencing positions

84     The prosecution sought the following sentences against the two accused[^91]:

> (a)     For Lim – 7 years’ imprisonment, and an additional 3 months’ imprisonment in lieu of 6 strokes of the cane;

> (b)     For Ong – 6 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

85     Counsel for Lim asked for “as light a sentence, as is legally possible.”[^92] Counsel did not submit for any specific length of sentence but he cited the case of _PP v Sumanthiran s/o Selvarajoo_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 879</span> (“_Sumanthiran_”) for the court’s reference. In that case, the accused was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane for a similar offence under s 326 of the Penal Code. However, the accused in _Sumanthiran_ was convicted not only of a s326 charge but also other charges including a s 304(a) Penal Code charge. I was of the view that _Sumanthiran_ does not assist the defence in its submission for a light sentence because (i) the accused in that case was only 18 years old and with a mental disorder which meant that the sentencing principle of rehabilitation would have been more relevant in that case, and (ii) the High Court at \[83\] made it very clear that its main focus in sentencing was the s 304(a) charge as that was the most serious charge.

86     As for Ong, he merely pleaded for leniency and did not submit for any particular length of sentence.[^93] He certainly did not do himself any favours when he further stated that he would appeal if he received a “heavy sentence”.[^94]

### Conspirators’ sentences

87     The conspirators pleaded guilty and were sentenced as follows[^95]:

88     I accept the principle of parity as set out by the prosecution i.e. (1) the starting premise is that co-offenders who have been convicted of the same offence should _ipso facto_ receive the same sentence, and (2) the sentence for each offender is then to be calibrated upwards or downwards to account for the relevant differences in their respective degrees of responsibility and/or personal circumstances.[^96]

89     It should be emphasised that that both Ron’s and Amin’s sentence were affirmed by the High Court on appeal by the prosecution and Amin respectively. Therefore, these two precedent cases served as definitive reference points from which to calibrate the appropriate sentence for Lim and Ong. The sentences of the conspirators (two of which have been affirmed by the High Court) plainly reflect the roles played by them. In terms of increasing culpability, Atika, being the youngest and also having the smallest role, was ordered to undergo reformative training. Ron, who acted as Lim’s agent and did not receive any financial rewards, was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes. Amin, who was part of the group which attacked the victim received 4 years and 3 months’ imprisonment and 5 strokes, and Irwan, who committed the actual slashing, rightly received the most severe sentence of 4.5 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes.

### Lim and Ong most culpable

90     I agree with the prosecution’s submission[^97] that Lim and Ong were the most culpable of all the conspirators. They were also the most unrepentant because they showed no remorse by claiming trial to their respective charge. Between the two accused, Lim is unarguably more culpable and unremorseful. Notwithstanding that Ong tried to downplay his role in the conspiracy, he nevertheless accepted throughout that he was part of the conspiracy. He has also not appealed against his conviction. The same cannot be said of Lim who has denied any involvement whatsoever in the conspiracy, notwithstanding his greater culpability as both the mastermind and financier, and he has appealed against his conviction.

91     I accept prosecution’s submission that Lim commissioned the attack on the victim because the latter was having an affair with his mistress. He paid Ong and his thugs handsomely to teach the victim a lesson and to exact revenge for taking away his mistress. Lim’s motive for the offence is a clear aggravating factor. His intention was to cause serious and permanent injuries to the victim. He had wanted to break the victim’s arms and legs and he was prepared to pay others to do the dirty deed so that he could keep his hands clean. When Ron found Ong who then suggested inflicting another form of grievous injury that was no less grievous and in fact more wicked, Lim readily agreed. Without his abetment by way of instructions to Ron, provision of aids to identify and locate the victim, and financial rewards to Ong and the thugs, the attack on the victim would not and could not have been carried out.

92     As regards Ong, he may have been the intermediary like Ron but I found that he was much more culpable than Ron because he recruited the thugs (or most of them), instructed them to use a knife to disfigure the victim, and distributed the monetary rewards to the thugs and himself. Ong was motivated purely by the financial reward. This motive is also a clear aggravating factor. In comparison, Ron was Lim’s employee and relation and his role was merely to represent Lim to meet with Ong and his henchmen and to pay them both before and after the job.

93     I also considered as aggravating factors that both accused abetted an organised gangland style attack on the victim which was brazenly carried out in public and which resulted in the victim’s face being permanently scarred. In addition to the obvious relevance of the sentencing principle of general and specific deterrence, I also considered (as would the courts who had sentenced the conspirators) that the sentencing principle of retribution should apply to this case. Menon CJ in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span> at \[97\] explained that the concept of retribution is based on the notion that the punishment imposed on an offender should reflect the degree of harm and culpability that has been occasioned by the offender’s conduct. As such, when hurt and injury has resulted from the offender’s conduct, the retributive principle ought to apply and the court must attribute necessary weight to it, having regard to the degree of actual (or potential harm) caused.

94     Finally, I considered that both Lim and Ong claimed trial to their respective charge. While the defence has made the point[^98] that Lim’s decision to claim trial ought not to prejudice him, provided he has a viable defence, that is not to say that he cannot, in principle, be denied the sentencing discount which would have been given to the other conspirators who had decided to plead guilty thus saving much prosecutorial and judicial resources.

### No exceptional mitigating factors

95     Lim’s counsel pleaded that Lim suffered from a host of medical conditions which included having a liver transplant following liver failure, diabetes and various cardiovascular ailments.[^99] The court was told that he required specialist medical care. In general, the prison authorities would be able to manage most, if not all medical conditions of its inmates. In _PP v Ravi Krishnamoorthy[^100]_, I had conducted an ancillary hearing to determine, _inter alia_, whether the prison facilities were adequate to accommodate the accused in that case who also suffered from a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, including a spinal disability, and had significant mobility issues. Evidence was led from the prison’s Chief Medical Officer and relevant prisons officers to show that the prison runs its own medical centre that is operational round the clock and is licensed by the Ministry of Health. Even if an inmate required specialist treatment and care, the prison authorities will arrange for the inmate to be referred to the public hospitals, chiefly Changi General Hospital, for all necessary specialist consultation and treatment. I accepted the evidence in that case and there was no appeal. In the present case, I have no reason to believe that the accused’s conditions cannot be similarly and adequately managed by the prison authorities if he is incarcerated.

96     While the court may be sympathetic, on a personal level, to the medical conditions of an accused person, nevertheless, the court must also consider, as a matter of law, whether these medical conditions may amount to mitigating circumstances or warrant the exercise of judicial mercy. In this regard, I considered that Lim’s medical conditions had no bearing on the offence and do not reduce his culpability and therefore had no mitigating value. They were also not life-threatening, terminal or so serious that a custodial term would carry a high risk of endangering his life. Therefore, the pre-conditions are not triggered for the exercise of judicial mercy for a substantial reduction in sentence.[^101] Nevertheless, I considered that he was a first offender and he was sentenced accordingly as a first offender. Having said that, given the seriousness of the offence, the fact that he is a first offender meant very little in terms of any reduction in the sentence.

97     As for Ong, he did not canvass any mitigating factors for himself. He was certainly not a first offender. I considered that he has previous convictions for violence-related offences of robbery, robbery with hurt and possession of offensive weapons. These previous convictions are relevant to the present offence of abetment of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a knife. In addition, he had also been detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provision) Act and was placed under police supervision following his release. He committed the present offence whilst he was subject to police supervision and is therefore liable to enhanced punishment i.e. twice the maximum prescribed imprisonment.

### Conclusion - Sentence

98     I considered that Lim and Ong were more culpable than the other conspirators and that Lim was more culpable than Ong. As they both claimed trial to their charge thus demonstrating their lack of remorse, their sentence should be appropriately adjusted upwards from the most severe of the conspirators’ sentence (i.e. Irwan’s sentence of 4.5 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes) which would have been much discounted because of a plea of guilt.

99     Having weighed and balanced the accused persons’ mitigation plea against all the sentencing factors above, I sentenced them as follows:

> (i)     Lim was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment. No caning was imposed because he was 55 years old; and

> (ii)     Ong was sentenced to 5½ years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

100    In conclusion, I was of the view that the sentences imposed on the two accused were necessarily deterrent and retributive, and also entirely justified, appropriate and proportionate to their respective culpability and role.
