### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Charges and Sentence

This is an appeal brought by the Accused, a 53 year-old Singaporean, against his conviction and sentence.

2       He claimed trial to five charges under section 354(1) of the Penal Code. The particulars of the charges and outcomes are set out as follows:

3       I ordered the imprisonment terms in MAC 911997/2017 and MAC 911999/2017 (3rd and 5th charges as listed above) to run consecutively, making the total sentence one of 8 months’ imprisonment.

4       There was no appeal against acquittal filed by the Prosecution in respect of MAC 911995/2017. For this reason, these written grounds will not deal with the facts and findings in relation to MAC 911995/2017. Suffice to say, no evidence was forthcoming from the victim on MAC 911995/2017. This was an _attempt_ charge. The victim did not experience an inappropriate touch from the Accused on this occasion and the Prosecution relied solely on CCTV footage – evidence which I considered unsatisfactory to prove the Accused’s guilt on that _attempt_ charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Prosecution’s Evidence

5       The Prosecution’s case rested essentially on the victim’s evidence and portions of video footage captured on close circuit TV (“CCTV”) at various parts of Fullerton Bay hotel.

##### Victim’s Evidence

6       The victim was 18 years old at the time of the offences. The victim got acquainted with the Accused when she was deployed by an employment agency to Fullerton Bay Hotel as a banquet server for two days: 22 July 2017 and 23 July 2017. The Accused was an assistant banquet manager at Fullerton Bay Hotel at the material time. On her first day of work on 22 July 2017, the victim was assigned to work with the Accused and under his supervision. The victim’s duties included serving dinner to one room of guests, and cleaning up thereafter.

7       The victim reported for work at 5:30 pm. She testified that in the course of dinner service on 22 July 2017, as the Accused and her were alone in an area behind the room where the guests were seated and whilst the victim was wiping a champagne glass, the Accused talked and “_made dirty jokes_”[^1]. She felt disgusted. After dinner service, as the Accused and her were cleaning up and clearing things from the room where dinner was served, the Accused told the victim that he had “_a relationship with another part-timer, a sexual relationship_”. When he learnt that the victim had financial problems, he offered to help her out and asked if she would be his “_sugar baby_”. The victim understood that to be her needing to give him sexual favours in exchange for his help. The victim felt disgusted but simply said “_okay_”, as her way of ending the conversation to continue with her work. The Accused seemed “_happy”, “smirking_” [^2].

#### Evidence relating to MAC 911996/2017 (2nd charge)

8       After the “_sugar baby, sugar daddy talk_”, the victim testified that as she was leaving the Voyage Room pantry, the Accused who was walking behind her, smacked her buttocks. Although disgusted and shocked, the victim simply left[^3]. Her evidence was that even though there was a part-timer around, she would not have seen it as she (the other part-timer) was facing another way. The victim stated that she did not raise the incident to the other part-timer or ask for help because she did not want to have trouble as she was only working part-time at the hotel. The victim explained that she needed money at that point in time; she did not want to risk not getting her pay because of the incident[^4].

#### Evidence relating to MAC 911997/2017 (3rd charge)

9       The victim also related another incident where she had completed the ironing of table cloths and needed to keep the iron. As she went into the pantry to keep the iron, the Accused followed her in, to show her where to keep the iron. In the pantry, as she bent over to keep the iron, the Accused touched both of her buttocks with one hand for about 10 seconds. The victim felt shocked that the Accused did that and told him “_can you stop_?” many times. The Accused responded: “_Why must I stop? Why not_?”. She pushed his hand away and quickly left the pantry. In court, the victim described the touch as “_brush and a bit of grab_”, with “_not so much force_”. She further added that as the Accused followed her into the room, he closed the curtains of the pantry[^5].

#### Evidence relating to MAC 911998/2017 (4th charge)

10     The victim could remember four distinct incidents where the Accused had touched her inappropriately in the course of the evening.

11     On another occasion, whilst the victim was wiping cutlery in an area outside a room, the Accused came from behind, brushed his hand against her buttock and smacked it. There was “_not so much force_” used but she could feel it. The victim was shocked but did not react because there was another part-timer who was standing beside her. The victim again explained that she did not want to cause any trouble, hence she did not ask the other part-timer for help. The victim was certain that the Accused’s touch was not accidental even though the area was not spacious[^6].

#### Evidence relating to MAC 911999/2017 (5th charge)

12     The last incident took place as she was signing out from her duty. The victim testified that as she bent over to sign out, the Accused came from behind her and she could feel his erect penis against her. According to her, there were other part-timers who were signing out at the same time but they were not standing in front of her such that they could see what was happening. The victim felt disgusted and quickly went home. She did not raise an alarm or ask them for help because she did not want any trouble.

13     By this time of the night, the victim was feeling stressed. She did not know what to do about all that had taken place at work. On her way home, she called her then-boyfriend (PW4). She told him about the Accused touching her. She testified that PW4 was “_angry and pissed off_”… and “ _he wanted to come and beat \[the Accused\] up_”. She left it to him as to what he wanted to do[^7].

14     The victim reported to work at 5:30 pm on 23 July 2017, the second day of her deployment to Fullerton Bay Hotel. The victim testified that nothing happened on her second day of work. She was working with a friend and the interaction she had with the Accused was limited to work. The Accused was busy; the victim was also working in another room. It was only after her work that she realised that PW4 had come to the hotel to confront the Accused. Eventually, PW4 called the police and the incidents came to light.

#### Video Footage from Fullerton Bay Hotel

15     Turning to CCTV footage, PW2 ASP Sim Yi Cheng, the original Investigation Officer, testified that he recovered CCTV footage from Fullerton Bay Hotel. He found 8 CCTV footages which involved the Accused coming into contact with the victim. Upon verification with the victim, 5 of the 8 footages were found to pertain to the occasions where the victim felt she had been molested by the Accused. As part of his investigations, PW2 ASP Sim prepared a 10-page document consisting of 8 incidents with extracted screenshots, date, time and a brief description of the screenshot. This document was admitted into evidence as P3.

16     On the stand, PW2 ASP Sim confirmed that out of the 8 incidents he documented, 5 charges (based on 5 incidents) were preferred against the Accused. In relation to P3, these were: Incidents 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The CCTV footage relating to these 5 incidents were collectively marked and admitted as P4. The charges, incidents (as described in P3), and clip descriptions in P4 may be co-related in this manner:

17     The video footage assisted in providing the relevant place and time periods for the commission of the alleged offences. There was no dispute that the footage captured both the victim and the Accused in various parts of Fullerton Bay Hotel on the night of 22 July 2017 to the wee hours of 23 July 2017.

18     I will deal with the nature and quality of the CCTV evidence as I discuss the strength of the Prosecution’s case.

## Assessing the Prosecution’s Case

19     The victim’s testimony about the alleged incidents of molest were not without corroboration.

20     After the victim had fully related the incidents in court, she was shown the CCTV footage. There can be no basis to suggest that the victim may have tailored her testimony in court to what was captured on the CCTV footage. In viewing the video footage retrieved from the hotel, I find these following clips in P4 to be helpful in corroborating the victim’s account:

21     Whilst the CCTV footage may not have distinctly captured the offending acts of the Accused, the relevant footage did corroborate key aspects of the victim’s evidence.

##### MAC 911996/2017 – 2nd charge

22     The victim testified that the Accused had smacked her buttocks as she was leaving the pantry. The video footage in Clip 2 showed the Accused’s hand at the victim’s buttocks as she was leaving the pantry and he was walking behind her. It also showed the Accused’s hand in a downward motion towards the victim’s buttocks.

23     The Accused denied touching the victim in this instance and explained in his examination-in-chief that what he was doing with his hands as seen in the footage was that he wanted to guide the victim from the back[^8]. However, the Accused could not offer a good reason as to why his hand was at the level of the victim’s buttocks other than his failure to recall and maintaining that he did not touch her[^9]. He agreed that he noticed from the CCTV footage that his hand was moving from right to left but could not explain he would need to put his hand near the victim’s buttocks even if he had only meant to guide her[^10]. The value of the Accused’s assertion that he would not have touched the victim since others may see it diminished in light of the fact that the motion of his right hand would have been shielded by the victim’s body and the narrow doorway they were walking through in any case[^11]. I did not find the Accused’s explanation satisfactory.

##### MAC 911997/2017 – 3rd charge

24     The victim had testified that as she went into the pantry to keep the iron, the Accused had followed her in. As she bent over to keep the iron, the Accused touched both her buttocks. The video footage in Clip 1 showed the Accused closing the curtains of the room, thereby shielding whatever had taken place within the pantry.

25     The Accused’s explanation for closing the curtains was that he had placed an alcoholic drink in the pantry for the victim[^12] (since hotel staff were prohibited from drinking alcohol drinks during work) and the victim “_just want to try_”[^13]. I find it hard to believe the Accused. According to the Accused, the alcoholic drink that he supposedly offered to the victim was similar to ginger ale and was contained in a normal-looking, tall water glass. He agreed that any casual staff looking at the mixture would simply assume that the victim was drinking ginger ale or a carbonated, non –alcoholic soft drink[^14]. If so, there would not have been a need to conceal the drinking of such a drink within the pantry as the Accused claimed he was trying to do when he shut the curtain. The victim flatly denied the existence of any drink in the pantry[^15].

26     Further, as astutely highlighted by the Prosecution, the objective evidence in the form of the CCTV footage showed that the Accused had shut the curtain at 12:37:17. It was open again at 12:37:29, a period of about twelve seconds. If the Accused’s version of events is to be believed, it would mean that the victim was to have kept the extension wire and stored the iron in the bottom shelf, retrieved and drank the hidden glass of alcoholic beverage that the Accused had prepared for her, passed it to the Accused for him to finish up the rest and then have the glass replaced in the cabinet by either herself or the Accused before leaving the pantry[^16] – all in the space of twelve seconds. I find it highly unlikely that all that could have taken place given the short span of time. I did not believe the Accused’s version of events and his explanation as to why he had shut the curtain of the pantry.

27     The video footage corroborated the victim’s account of the incident. At 00:37:15, it showed the victim crouching low to stow the iron just before the Accused pulled the curtain shut. Her testimony that as she was bending over, the Accused touched both her butt cheeks for about 10 seconds[^17], before she told him to stop, pushed him and then left. The timing as shown in the video footage cohered with the victim’s testimony in respect of the incident[^18].

28     There was perhaps one troubling aspect of the Prosecution’s evidence. As the curtain of the pantry were drawn open, the CCTV footage from time-stamp 00:37:29 showed the victim smiling as she walked out of the pantry. I accept this would not be the expression or behaviour typical of one who had just had her buttocks inappropriately touched.

29     When asked, the victim explained her expression as one of “_smirking it off_”. She testified: “_I tend to smirk and smile if I’m stressed. I always hide my feelings_”[^19]. Whilst pressed under cross-examination, the victim admitted that she was indeed smiling as she came out of the pantry. However, it was not because she had an alcoholic drink in the pantry. The victim agreed that she did not have a look of distress on her face but maintained that “_I tend to smile when I am stressed”._ She was not angry; more disgusted and expressed her _“stress with a smile to cover_”. When pressed further as to why there would be a need to hide her stress, the victim replied that she wanted “_to finish the work and \[she\] needed the money”[^20]._ I accept the explanation of the victim.

#### Reaction of the victim

30     The reaction of the victim towards the Accused and/or the incident, was an issue in this trial.

31     The victim expressed a myriad of feelings about the incidents. In her testimony, she testified that she felt disgusted and shocked when the Accused smacked her butt at the Voyage pantry[^21] (MAC 911996/2017 - 2nd charge). She was distressed by the incident that took place in the Port of Call pantry room[^22] (MAC 911997/2017 – 3rd charge). She was shocked when he brushed and smacked her butt whilst she was wiping the cutlery[^23] (MAC 911998/2017 – 4th charge). She was disgusted when the Accused positioned his groin with the erect penis against her buttocks as she was signing out at the end of the work day[^24] (MAC 911999/2017 – 5th charge).

32     Despite all that the victim experienced, she was caught smiling after emerging from the pantry, just after the Accused had allegedly touched her buttocks behind closed curtains. In other portions of the footage throughout the night, the victim was seen continuing her close interaction with the Accused, and observed smiling and talking to the Accused despite alleged inappropriate behaviour towards her[^25]. Other than telling him to stop on the occasion when the Accused was touching her buttocks in the Port of Call pantry room, the victim did not react to the Accused on the other occasions when he smacked her buttocks or rubbed his groin against her. It is also undisputed that the victim did not mention any of the incidents to any of the staff working with her; she also did not raise the matter with the other supervisors who were present that night.

33     In court, the victim candidly admitted that she was smiling as shown in the footage. She reiterated that she tends to smile when she’s stressed and she did so “_just so that people won’t really know \[her\] true feelings_”. She acted neutrally towards the Accused because she had to continue her work_[^26]_. She did not ask the other staff for help because she did not want to cause trouble[^27]. She needed money at that point in time and did not want the incident to cause her not to receive her pay[^28].

34     At first blush, it might seem odd for the victim to behave in the way she did. In saying that, I am aware that I have implicitly acknowledged that oftentimes, there is a certain expectation of how victims of sexual offences ought to react or behave. However, as wisely stated in the case of GBR v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> at \[20\]: _“…victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner. The fact that the victim was young, sexually inexperienced and was thus likely to have been taken aback by the appellant’s unexpected but brazen conduct meant that her reaction was well within the realm of possibilities and indeed would have been perfectly foreseeable”._ I was mindful of this as I assessed the victim’s evidence.

35     I find the victim’s explanation for the way she behaved to be cogent and convincing. At the time of the offence, the victim was only 18 years old. Her superior, whom she just got to know that evening, had touched her inappropriately. She was at Fullerton Bay Hotel to work because she needed the money. She repeated that several times in her testimony[^29] and even went on to describe her financial situation to the court[^30]. For somebody in that position, the victim had to keep her focus on the work that she had to do. She had committed to working 2 days at Fullerton Bay Hotel and she was determined to get paid for the time she had worked, despite all that was taking place. She did not want any trouble. Hence, she bore with whatever was happening to her and dealt with it in a way she knew best, whether by “_smirking it off_” or by keeping quiet about the incidents and continuing with her work, even going back to work at the hotel the next day.

36     It was not that she did not care. At the end of her first work day, the victim did inform PW4 that she had been molested at work and briefly told him what the Accused had done[^31]. The victim also testified that she had planned to make a police report after the end of her work on the second day. She did not want to make a police report earlier because she needed the money to help her mother (who was a single mother and out of job at that point in time) and herself[^32]. Considering the circumstances of the case and the situation which the victim found herself in, I fully accept the victim’s explanation for the way she had responded to the incidents; how she tolerated the conduct of the Accused and continued to work with him through the night.

##### MAC 911999/2017 – 5th charge

37     Towards the end of her first work day, the victim testified that as she bent over the desk to sign out at the end of her work, the Accused came from behind her and she could feel the Accused’s erect penis against her.

38     The CCTV footage in Clip 3 shows a fairly busy area at the sign-out desk. The victim was observed standing at the desk, bent over, with her back facing the camera. The Accused was observed at 01:04:26 approaching the back of the victim and subsequently standing behind her and then around her, at very close proximity. The Prosecution pointed out that the Accused had been so close to the victim that the front of his shoes and the back of the victim’s shoes were almost touching (01:04:37)[^33].

39     The movement and subsequent positioning of the Accused as shown in the CCTV footage corroborated the victim’s account of what happened at the sign-out desk. She was also speaking the truth when she testified that the other staff were in front of her, not behind her and hence, would not have been able to see what the Accused was doing[^34].

40     The Accused was not able to give a satisfactory explanation for his behaviour at the sign-out desk that night. He claimed that he was trying to see what the older female staff was doing with the sign-out sheet. However, instead of positioning himself beside the older female staff, he went behind the victim instead. When questioned, the Accused was defensive and retorted that he could stand wherever he wanted[^35]. The Accused could not sufficiently explain his behaviour caught on CCTV footage.

41     In respect of the above 3 incidents, I find that the victim’s evidence, in material aspects, was well-corroborated by independent and objective evidence. As mentioned, whilst the CCTV footage may not have distinctly captured the offending acts of the Accused in clear terms, the relevant footage placed side by side with the victim’s oral testimony, presented a consistent and complete picture of what had taken place that night.

##### MAC 911998/2017 – 4th charge

42     This was the incident where the victim and the Accused were wiping cutlery when the Accused came from behind and allegedly brushed his hand against the victim’s buttock and smacked it. The CCTV footage in Clip 4 merely showed a general view of the scene where the alleged incident took place but the area where the victim was standing was obscured by a large pillar. I did not find any portion of the video footage to be particularly helpful for the Prosecution’s case. It would not be wrong to say that the Accused’s conviction on this charge depended solely on the quality of the victim’s oral testimony.

#### Internal and External Consistency

43     Just as she did for the other charges, the victim described the incident in a clear, coherent and simple manner. Given the general view of the area in between the Compass and Voyage room as observed on Clip 4 of the CCTV footage, it would not be probable as the victim had testified, that the other staff working in the area would have noticed the offending act of the Accused on the victim as he walked past her. They were engaged in their own tasks[^36]. The victim’s inability to pinpoint the relevant time in the footage where the Accused had smacked and brushed her buttock also did not affect her credibility since it was a quick act which could have taken place any time whilst she was wiping cutlery.

44     Defence Counsel highlighted the discrepancy between the victim’s oral testimony on this charge and her statement to the police, the schedule of offences (Exhibit D1), PW2 ASP Sim’s description of the screenshots in P3 and the charge[^37]. In respect of the schedule of offences as well as PW2 ASP Sim’s description of the screenshots in P3, it should be borne in mind that these were pre-trial documents, prepared by the investigation officer for his investigation purposes. They were not documents prepared by or originating from the victim, for example, a contemporaneous journal entry, such that she had to provide a satisfactory explanation for the way and/or form in which they eventually appeared for use in court.

45     In the course of the trial, after the victim had given her oral testimony, the Prosecution also applied to amend this charge (MAC 911998/2017) to include the word “_smack_” in addition to the Accused’s act of brushing the victim’s buttock. In this respect, a relevant portion of the victim’s further statement recorded on 26 July 2017 was made available to the Defence and was subsequently admitted as Exhibit D2. In the statement, the victim only stated that the Accused had “_brushed_” one of his hand on her right butt cheek. She did not mention “_smack_”. In considering this aspect of the victim’s evidence, I bore in mind the fact that several incidents had taken place that night in question. When the victim gave her statements to the police just a few days later, it is not surprising that the victim may not have been able to remember the details of each and every incident and her reaction to each one of them, but only to have her memory jolted at a later point in time. What is more significant is that from the start of investigations to trial, the victim had consistently maintained that there was an incident that night as she was wiping the cutlery where the Accused brushed her buttock as he walked past her[^38].

46     Apart from the fact that the victim has given a clear and credible account of the incident contained in the 4th charge in court, her evidence was also internally and externally consistent on material aspects. Upon a consideration of the relevant circumstances relating to this charge, I was satisfied that it was safe to convict the Accused on the victim’s evidence on this charge.

#### Quality of the victim’s evidence

47     Portions of the victim’s account of the four incidents were well-corroborated by objective video evidence. Even when the footage did not capture the distinct act of molest, the video footage, as discussed above, supported the victim’s account of the incidents in key aspects. Where the video footage was of no help at all (as in the 4th charge), I found the victim’s evidence to be consistent, both internally and externally.

48     With or without corroboration, the quality of the victim’s testimony in this case can be described as being “_unusually convincing[^39]”_, even though it was not without deficiencies. I find the victim to be an honest witness; she was telling the truth when she described what happened to her that night. She gave a clear and logical account of the incidents which took place that night. She was able to describe simply but coherently how the Accused had touched her inappropriately on those occasions. I did not observe any tendency on her part to embellish her evidence. On the 1st charge (which I acquitted the Accused of), the victim candidly admitted that she was not aware of the incident until she was shown the footage by the police. There was no attempt on the victim’s part to pad up the evidence relating to the 1st charge[^40] which she could have easily done if she had wanted to.

49     She was straightforward in the giving of her answers, whether in examination-in-chief or under cross-examination. She was candid when admitting to portions of evidence which were not in her favour such as when she was caught smiling on the footage or seen interacting normally with the Accused. As discussed, her explanation for the way she behaved was logical and rational, even if not usual. I did not find her credibility to be shaken despite lengthy cross-examination.

50     The victim had no reason to make these stories up to implicate the Accused. Prior to being deployed to Fullerton Bay Hotel to work for two days, the Accused and her were not known to each other. She had nothing to gain by falsely implicating the Accused after her two days of work; on the contrary, as a result of the incident, the victim was now no longer permitted to return to Fullerton Bay Hotel to work[^41]. Further, according to the PW2 ASP Sim, even though he had retrieved a total of eight footages from the hotel which involved the Accused coming into contact with the victim, the victim only confirmed 5 such incidents. I agree with the Prosecution that if she had intended to get the Accused into trouble and to frame the Accused, there would be no need for her to be restrained in her accusations[^42]. By the Accused’s own admission, he had also not given the victim any reason to be angry with or to dislike him[^43].

51     PW4’s spontaneous reaction towards the Accused as a result of what the victim had informed him was also telling of the veracity of the victim’s account. He was the victim’s boyfriend at the time of the alleged incidents. He testified that the victim had called and informed him that she “_got molested at work_”. She told him that she “_got slapped and one more is, she felt Rosman’s private part was rubbed against her buttocks_”. The Accused also “_did talk dirty to \[her\]_[^44]”. Feeling angry, PW4 turned up at Fullerton Bay Hotel and confronted the Accused, whom he identified from a photograph taken by one of the victim’s friends[^45].

52     At the time of the trial, PW4 was no longer in a relationship with the victim. There was no basis to suggest that both the victim and him had colluded to frame the Accused; he also had no reason why he would lie about what was told to him by the victim. Even if the information relayed to PW4 by the victim may be considered self-serving, the consistency in the victim’s accounts was notable.

## The Defence

53     On the other hand, the Accused’s evidence was insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the victim’s evidence and on the Prosecution’s case. I did not find the Accused to be a credible witness.

54     Certain key aspects of the Accused’s evidence have already been discussed alongside the victim’s evidence. Apart from those highly unsatisfactory aspects of his evidence wherein he sought to explain his conduct towards the victim as seen on CCTV footage (in charges 2,3 and 5), I also observed that the Accused appeared overly eager to paint himself as a helpful and caring superior in his testimony - one who offered monetary help to the victim and treated her like a daughter, despite meeting her only on the day itself[^46]; one who was willing to put his job on the line by offering, not one but two, alcoholic drinks to the victim whilst on duty, despite knowing that it was against the rules and regulations of the hotel[^47]. As a result, certain aspects of the Accused’s testimony turned up incongruent[^48].

55     Further, there were several details in the Accused’s account which were never put to the victim when she was on the stand[^49]. I find these details to be an afterthought in a bid to bolster his claims that he did not molest the victim. In the course of his testimony, the Accused was also observed to be evasive in his answers[^50] and/or seemingly taking a long time to answer relatively simple questions[^51]. When pressed at times, the Accused would be agitated and defensive[^52].

56     In examination-in-chief, the Accused did not have any trouble understanding what “_dirty talk_” meant as he denied that he ever engaged in “_dirty talk_” with the victim[^53]; yet, in cross-examination, the Accused claimed that he did not understand what “_dirty talk_” was[^54]. The victim’s evidence that the Accused had engaged in “_dirty talk_” with her and offered to help her with her $1000 debt in return for a “_sugar daddy-sugar baby_” arrangement before the incidents of inappropriate touching took place, added to the credibility of her account.

#### Accused’s Police Statements

57     The Accused’s two statements were admitted after an ancillary hearing (P5 and P6). The Accused claimed that he was tired, constantly badgered and pressured to give the statements the way PW2 ASP Sim wanted them. However, the Accused’s claims of involuntariness evolved as the ancillary hearing went on and were not consistent[^55]. The material allegations of how PW2 ASP Sim repeated questions and answers to the Accused[^56], how the Accused himself had to repeat his answers until it matched with the victim’s claims[^57] were not put to PW2 ASP when he was on the stand. I find these claims by the Accused in respect of his statements, to be made up and a clear afterthought. I did not believe him. I was satisfied that the police statements were voluntarily given.

58     Apart from voluntariness, I also find that the statements were accurately recorded. There was no reason why PW2 ASP Sim would fabricate the contents of the statements. A perusal of the statements would reveal that they were “mixed” statements – ones in which the Accused did not confess unreservedly to the allegations of molest. There were portions of his statements which sought to explain the incidents of touching by the Accused and how they were innocuous in nature[^58]. If PW2 ASP Sim had indeed fabricated the contents of the statements, there would be no reason for him to include exculpatory portions in them. Moreover, the statements also contained details which were within the personal knowledge of the Accused. I did not have any difficult attaching full weight to the contents of the Accused’s statements.

59     There were material contradictions between the police statements and the Accused’s oral testimony. In court, the Accused denied touching the victim but in his statements, he admitted to touching the victim on four different occasions[^59]. The Accused also denied engaging in “_dirty talk_” with the victim whilst he was on the stand, but admitted to so doing in the statement[^60]. There were also other inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence thrown up by the statements, as highlighted by the Prosecution[^61].

60     In his defence, the Accused presented an account in court which was filled with inconsistencies and contradicted by his own police statements. He was not a credible witness. His bare denials and assertions of what happened at Fullerton Bay Hotel that night were not believable. His explanations for his behaviour captured on CCTV footage were unconvincing and unsatisfactory. I rejected the Accused’s evidence.

## Charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt

61     For a charge of outrage of modesty to be made out, I had to be satisfied:-

> a)     That the Accused had used criminal force on the victim;

> b)     That the Accused had the intention to outrage the modesty of the victim.

62     I had no difficulty with the first ingredient of the charge. That has been adequately established by the Prosecution’s evidence and even the Accused’s own admissions.

63     As for the intention on the part of the Accused, that may be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case and the conduct of the Accused. Accused himself acknowledged that the victim and him were “_just working colleagues_”[^62]; they barely knew each other when he first begun touching the victim in the manner she described. He admitted that he should not have touched the victim at all[^63]. The Accused also admitted that he was initially aroused by the victim; he found her attractive and even told her that she has a “_big butt_” [^64]. The victim had on the occasion in the Port of Call pantry room, told him in no uncertain terms to stop what he was doing. That would have put him on clear notice that what he was doing was not welcomed by the victim. Despite his protestations in his statements that he had no intention to molest the victim but had merely touched her inadvertently albeit inappropriately in the course of work, given the objective facts and circumstances of the situation, I find that the Accused did have an intention to outrage the modesty of the victim at all material times.

64     On the strength of the Prosecution’s evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the 4 charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charges.

## The Appropriate Sentence

65     An offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 carries an imprisonment which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with a combination of such punishments.

##### Sentencing Framework in _Kunasekaran_

66     The sentencing bands for offences under section 354(1) Penal Code, following the case of _Kunasekaran_ are:

> a)     Band 1: less than 5 months’ imprisonment

> b)     Band 2: 5 to 15 months’ imprisonment

> c)     Band 3: 15 – 24 months’ imprisonment

#### Offence-specific factors

67     The Accused had brushed, smacked, grabbed and/or caressed the victim’s buttocks on 3 different occasions. I accept that they were mainly fleeting touches with no skin-to-skin contact and no intrusion of the victim’s private parts. In respect of the 5th charge, the Accused had rubbed his groin with his erect penis, against the victim’s buttocks. Whilst there was no skin-to-skin contact as well as no intrusion of the victim’s private part, the Accused had used his own private part to rub against the victim’s buttocks.

68     On a further consideration the circumstances of this case, I agreed with the Prosecution’s characterisation of the Accused’s conduct that night. There was a certain persistence in and an escalation of the brazen conduct of the Accused. It started with a smack in the 2nd charge, to the grabbing and caressing of the buttock in private in the Port of Call pantry, to the brush and smack in the presence of other staff in the vicinity and eventually, rubbing his penis on the victim’s buttocks over clothes in the 5th charge, with others present[^65]. The Accused became increasingly emboldened in his conduct towards the victim as the night progressed. At the material time, the victim was also only 18 years old, working as a part-time staff at the hotel under the Accused, who was a manager. Whilst the intrusions were mostly opportunistic, the Accused had leveraged on his position as a superior and taken liberties with the victim.

69     Bearing the above in mind, I find that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th charges fall within mid-range of Band 1 of _Kunasekaran_’s sentencing framework. Given the facts of the case, I was satisfied that a custodial term was called for. As for the 5th charge, this offence also fell within Band 1 but at the higher end, towards the lower end of Band 2.

#### Offender-specific factors

70     The Accused had an unrelated antecedent of disorderly behaviour in 1994. I did not find any mitigating factors in favour of the Accused[^66]. On the contrary, the Accused had claimed trial. He was not entitled to a sentencing discount. There was no remorse demonstrated; the victim was put on the stand and was subjected to lengthy cross-examination.

71     Upon consideration of the factors, I sentenced the Accused to the following:-

72     The case precedents tendered by both the Prosecution and the Defence in respect of intrusions on a victim’s buttock, revealed imprisonment terms from 2 weeks to 3 months[^67].

73     In this case, even though the intrusions all involved the victim’s buttocks, I chose to impose different jail terms, drawing a distinction between the circumstances in which the offences took place. The act of the Accused in deliberately pulling the curtain shut at the Port of Call pantry room before he grabbed and caressed the buttocks of the unsuspecting victim who was stowing the iron, warranted a more severe imprisonment term within Band 1, compared to the rest.

74     In relation to the 5th charge, it fell at the higher end of Band 1, towards the lower end of Band 2. I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 5 months would be sufficient to punish the Accused for that act. In _PP v Goh Eng Chin_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 17</span>, a case precedent submitted by the Defence, the offender repeatedly rubbed his penis against the victim’s buttocks over 30 seconds whilst clad only in his underwear. A sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment was imposed in _Goh Eng Chin[^68]_.

75     I ordered the imprisonment terms in the 3rd charge (MAC 911997/2017) and 5th charge (MAC 911999/2017) to run consecutively, making the total sentence one of 8 months’ imprisonment. Noting how the offences had all taken place within a short period of time, I did not see the need to order the imprisonment terms in more than 2 charges to run consecutively. I was mindful of the totality principle in determining the global sentence to be meted out. In so doing, I was satisfied that a global sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment did commensurate with the overall culpability and criminality of the Accused in this case.

## Conclusion

76     The Accused is currently on bail, pending the hearing of this appeal.
