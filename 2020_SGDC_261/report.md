Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Sexual penetration of a minor

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9868/2020/01.\]

12 November 2020

### Senior District Judge Bala Reddy:

1       The Accused, Yap Lee Kok, a 57-year-old male, pleaded guilty to two charges under s 376A(1)(a) punishable under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). The charges arose from an incident on 4 February 2019 where the Accused sexually penetrated a minor below the age of 16 (“the Victim”). The two charges are reproduced below:

> DAC-907580-2020

> “You…Yap Lee Kok…are charged that you, on 4 February 2019, between 6.00am and 6.40am, in your car at level 6 of the multi-storey carpark located at Block 669 Jurong West Street 64, Singapore, did penetrate with your penis, the mouth of one \[●\], a minor under 16 years of age, to wit, 14 years of age at date of incident (D.O.B. \[●\]), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(a) punishable under Section 376A(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.).”

> DAC-907583-2020

> “You…Yap Lee Kok…are charged that you, on 4 February 2019, between 6.00am and 6.40am, in your car at level 6 of the multi-storey carpark located at Block 669 Jurong West Street 64, Singapore, did penetrate with your penis, the vagina of one \[●\], a minor under 16 years of age, to wit, 14 years of age at date of incident (D.O.B. \[●\]), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(a) punishable under Section 376A(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.).”

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. The Accused consented to have two other charges under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code and one other charge under s 292(1)(a) Penal Code, taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing the sentencing submissions from both parties and mitigation plea on behalf of the Accused, I sentenced the Accused to 12 months’ imprisonment for charge DAC-907580-2020 and 18 months’ imprisonment for charge DAC-907583-2020. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently with the result of a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed an appeal against the sentence. The Accused is currently serving the sentence pending the hearing of the appeal. I now set out the grounds of my decision below.

## Statement of Facts

5       The SOF setting out the facts in relation to the offences committed by the Accused is reproduced in full below:

Statement of Facts

> 1.    The accused is Yap Lee Kok, a 57-year-old male Singaporean Citizen, NRIC: SXXX.

> 2.    The minor is \[●\], a 16-year-old female Singaporean Citizen (D.O.B. \[●\]). At the material time of the offences, she was 14 years old and was a Secondary 3 student.

> 3.    The witness is \[●\]. At the material time of the offences, she was the minor’s form teacher in her secondary school.

> First Information Report

> 4.    On 7 February 2019 at about 1:36pm, the minor lodged a police report at Nanyang NPC stating that, on 4 February 2019, she had been raped by a man she knew as “Peter Teo” in his car. The incident location was reported as the sixth floor of the multi-storey carpark at 669 Jurong West Street 64.

> 5.    The offence came to light because the minor had asked the witness where she could obtain a pregnancy test kit. Upon further questioning by the witness, the minor admitted that she had sex with an older man and that she felt very upset and fearful after the incident. The minor was referred to the school’s counsellor, and thereafter lodged the police report.

> Background Facts

> 6.    Investigations revealed that sometime in January 2019, the accused was looking to befriend females on Facebook using the moniker “Peter Teo”. He came across the minor’s Facebook profile and added her as a friend. After the minor accepted the accused’s friend request, they began to chat via the Facebook Messenger app.

> 7.    In the course of their chat, the accused asked the minor how old she was, and the minor replied that she was 14 going on 15. The accused remarked that the minor was young and told the minor that he was about 40 years old. The accused initiated conversations of a sexual nature with the minor and sent photos of his penis to the minor. He asked the minor to send nude photos of herself, and the minor sent him one photo of her breasts and one photo of her vagina. The accused asked the minor if she was a virgin and the minor replied affirmatively. The accused also asked the minor if she wanted to try giving a ‘blowjob’ but the minor did not answer the question.

> 8.    Thereafter, the accused suggested that they should meet up for a ‘blowjob’. The minor initially refused the accused’s request, but eventually agreed after the accused kept repeating the request and offering to drive the minor to school after their meeting. The minor was under the impression that she was meeting the accused only to give a ‘blowjob’.

> 9.    Thus, the accused asked the minor to meet him at the ground floor lift lobby of the multi-storey carpark at 669 Jurong West Street 64. Prior to their meeting, the accused instructed the minor not to wear her shorts or panties under her school uniform.

> 10.    On 4 February 2019 at about 6am, the minor met up with the accused at the ground floor lift lobby of the multi-storey carpark at 669 Jurong West Street 64. The minor complied with the accused’s instruction not to wear her panties and kept it in her school bag instead.

> 11.    The accused brought her to the sixth floor of the carpark where his multi-purpose vehicle (“MPV”) was parked and brought her into his MPV. The accused folded down the rear passenger seats of the MPV such that there was an empty flat space at the rear.

> Facts Relating to the 1st Charge (DAC-907580-2020)

> 12.    Once the accused and minor were both at the rear of the accused’s MPV, the accused took off his pants and underwear, exposing his penis. The accused asked the minor to fellate him, and the minor complied by putting the accused’s penis into her mouth. The accused did not use a condom. In the course of the fellatio, the accused rubbed the minor’s exposed vagina with his finger and also exposed the minor’s breasts by pulling her bra and T-shirt upwards, before sucking and rubbing the minor’s right nipple.

> 13.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused penetrated the mouth of the minor, who was below the age of 16, with his penis, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(a) punishable under Section 376A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

> Facts Relating to the 3rd Charge (DAC-907583-2020)

> 14.    After the minor had fellated the accused (as detailed above), the accused penetrated the minor’s vagina with his penis, before the minor fellated the accused a second time.

> 15.    After the second fellatio, the accused instructed the minor to lie down and the minor complied. The accused then got on top of the minor and held her legs apart with his hands, before penetrating the minor’s exposed vagina with his penis for a second time. The accused did not use a condom.

> 16.    After a while, the accused pulled out his erect penis from the minor’s vagina and ejaculated on the minor’s stomach and face.

> 17.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused penetrated the vagina of the minor, who was below the age of 16, with his penis, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(a) punishable under Section 376A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

> 18.    The accused has admitted to the above offences and stands charged accordingly.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the charge DAC-907580-2020. For the charge DAC-907583-2020, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment noting that penile-vaginal penetration is more serious than penile-oral penetration. In seeking a global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment, learned DPP Nicholas Lim cited the following aggravating factors:[^1]

> (a)     The Victim agreed to meet with the Accused on the agreement that she would perform fellatio, not sexual intercourse;

> (b)     The Accused sexually groomed the Victim by engaging in sexual conversation with her and sending photos of his penis to her to arouse her curiosity. He also asked the Victim to send him her nude photos to lower her guard and attune her to the idea of sexual acts;

> (c)     The Accused exhibited a degree of premeditation, coercion and exerted pressure on the minor to meet with him to engage in sexual acts, in particular full-blown sexual intercourse with penile-vaginal penetration, knowing that she was a minor. The Accused asked her to meet with him repeatedly despite her initial rejections, and told her not to wear her shorts or panties so that he could easily gain access to the Victim’s vagina;

> (d)     The Accused did not wear a condom when engaging in sexual intercourse with the Victim, exposing her to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases;

> (e)     The Victim suffered fear and trauma after the incident, which led to her asking her teacher about pregnancy test kit. As a result, the Victim had to undergo counselling in school; and

> (f)     Two other similar charges and one other charge of transmitting images of his penis to the Victim that were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Mitigation

7       The Defence urged the court to impose a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. The Defence Counsel in his written mitigation plea sought a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for DAC-907580-2020 and 12 months’ imprisonment for DAC-907583-2020, with both sentences to run concurrently.[^2] The following factors and personal circumstances were raised by the Defence in the written mitigation plea:

> (a)     The Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest instance. His plea of guilt is a genuine act of remorse which had saved valuable time and resources and the need for the Victim to testify in court;

> (b)     The Accused has had an unblemished record. He has been a law-abiding and productive citizen of society; and

> (c)     The Accused is in poor physical and mental health, and the financial burden of his family falls squarely on him.

## Court’s Decision

8       In the case of _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> (“_AQW_”), the High Court held at \[41\] that a sentence of between ten and 12 months’ imprisonment would be the appropriate starting point for an offence under s 376A of the Penal Code where (a) the sexual act that took place between the offender and the minor was fellatio, regardless of which party performed and which received the fellatio, (b) the minor is 14 years old or above, and does not appear to be particularly vulnerable, (c) the offender did not coerce or pressure the minor into participating in the sexual act, and (d) there was no element of abuse of trust.

9       The benchmark sentence laid down in _AQW_ would be relevant for the charge DAC-907580-2020 which involved penile-oral penetration. As for the charge DAC-907583-2020 which involved penile-vaginal penetration, there ought to be a further uplift in terms of the appropriate starting point sentence. In _Pram Nair v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[152\] that there was clearly a distinction made between penile-vaginal penetration and other forms of penetration. Cases of penile-vaginal penetration represent the most serious form of penetration and therefore deserve the most serious sentences. A substantial uplift from the benchmark sentence in _AQW_ would thus be appropriate.

10     Looking at the applicable sentencing factors in the present case, I found that based on the culpability of the Accused and the harm caused to the Victim, there were aggravating circumstances that would justify an increase in sentence from the usual benchmarks:

> (a)     First, the Accused had found and contacted the Victim through the use of the internet. The Accused had used a Facebook account under a moniker to prowl and befriend teens on Facebook. He came across the Victim’s profile, added the Victim as a friend and began chatting with her _via_ the Facebook Messenger app.

> (b)     Second, there was a measure of persistence and premeditation in getting the Victim to engage in physical sexual activity. The Victim initially refused the Accused’s request to meet up for the supposed “blowjob”, but eventually agreed after repeated requests from the Accused and his offer to drive her to school after the meeting. Prior to the day of the incident, the Accused expressly told her not to wear her shorts or panties which suggested that the sexual activity he had in mind was not limited to merely a “blowjob”.

> (c)     Third, there was a pattern of escalation in conditioning and grooming the young Victim for sexual activity. The Accused began by initiating sexual conversations, then moved on to sending nude photos and eventually proposed for the Victim to give a “blowjob”. The sexual exchanges in their conversation would have had the effect of lowering her guard and attuning the Victim to the sexual acts and offences eventually committed by the Accused. While I did not find that there were sufficient facts to establish coercion or pressure, there was nevertheless a sustained course of communication in sexually grooming the Victim to meet up for a “blowjob”.

> (d)     Fourth, the incident caused the Victim fear and emotional harm. The Victim was clearly affected by the incident when she approached her form teacher in her secondary school on how to obtain a pregnancy test kit. The Victim understandably felt upset and fearful after the incident. At the material time of the offences, the Accused did not use a condom, thereby exposing the Victim to the risk of sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy.

11     In terms of the applicable mitigating factors, no significant weight could be given to the Accused’s personal health and financial situation in the absence of any exceptional circumstances. However, I recognised that the Accused had pleaded guilty to the charges and obviated the need for the Victim to testify in court and relive her painful experience. Taken together with the fact that the Accused was a first-time offender, I had factored these in the sentencing discount for the overall sentence.

12     Bearing the above aggravating and mitigating sentencing factors in mind, I then looked at the sentencing precedents before me. The learned DPP cited the following unreported decisions pertaining to s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code in a table of sentencing precedents:[^3]

> (a)      _PP v Ahmad Jumaidi Bin Sallah_ DAC-920837-2019 & Ors (unreported): The offender faced two proceeded charges, one under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code punishable under s 376A(2) Penal Code and another under s 8(b)(ii) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) for consumption of methamphetamine. One other charge under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender befriended the minor (14 years old) through Instagram. They consumed methamphetamine together and thereafter engaged in consensual penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. The offender had no relevant antecedents. He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for the s 376A Penal Code offence.

> (b)      _PP v Chen Yongzhao Ashton_ DAC-913178-2018 & Ors (unreported): The offender faced two charges under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code punishable under s 376A(2) Penal Code, and one charge under s 376A(1)(a) punishable under s 376A(3) Penal Code. Three other charges under s 376A(1)(a) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender created a Facebook profile with the intention of chatting with other girls about sex and added the minor (14 years old) as a friend on Facebook. In the course of their chat, the minor explained that she was in need of money and the offender offered to help her if she agreed to perform oral sex and had sexual intercourse with him. The minor agreed to perform the acts after being informed that she would receive $80. The offender engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with the minor on the first occasion, and penile-oral intercourse on the second occasion. The offender in that case was untraced. He was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment per charge and a global sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment.

> (c)      _PP v Zahier Hilmi Bin Zulkifli_ DAC-935028-2017 & Ors (unreported): The offender faced three charges under s 376A(1) Penal Code punishable under s 376A(2) Penal Code. Eight other charges under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code and one other charge under the s 7(a) Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) were taken into account for the purpose of sentencing. The offender got to know the minor (15 years old) through instant message application “Kik” and chatted with her about sexual topics, including their pornographic fetishes. They would also communicate with each other while masturbating. The offender subsequently met up with the minor and engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse (without condom), fellatio (without condom). He also digitally penetrated the vagina of the minor. The offender was untraced. He was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment for the penile-vaginal penetration charge, and 12 months’ and 10 months’ imprisonment for the penile-oral and digital-vaginal penetration charges respectively. The global sentence imposed was 24 months’ imprisonment.

> (d)      _PP v Muhammad Idris Bin Osman_ DAC-940172-2017 (unreported): The offender faced a single charge under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code punishable under s 376A(2) Penal Code. The offender and the minor were in a romantic relationship since the minor was in Secondary 1. The offender and the minor engaged in consensual penile-vaginal intercourse which resulted in the minor becoming pregnant. The offender and the minor decided not to terminate the pregnancy and to raise the child together. At the time of the sexual intercourse, the offender was 29 years old and the minor was 15 years old. The offender did not have relevant antecedents. He was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment.

> (e)      _PP v Len Teck Guan_ DAC-936149-2017 & Ors (unreported): The offender faced a single charge under s 376A(1)(a) Penal Code punishable under s 376A(2) Penal Code. One other similar charge was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender met the minor (15 years old) through Facebook. During one of their conversations, the minor told the offender that she was in financial difficulty, and the offender asked the minor to engage in paid sexual intercourse with him in return for $150. The minor agreed and met up with the offender to engage in penile-vaginal sexual intercourse. The offender had used a condom. He had an antecedent in 2000 for an offence of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354A(1) Penal Code. The offender was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment.

13     The present case was clearly more serious than _Ahmad Jumaidi Bin Sallah_, where the offence took place after the offender and the minor were friends through Instagram. Here, the Accused met the Victim while he was prowling online to befriend females through Facebook under a moniker. In the short span of about a month from when he first befriended the Victim, the Accused embarked on a course to get the Victim to engage in activities of an increasingly sexual nature. Further, the Accused lied about his age in telling the Victim that he was about 40 years old when in fact he was 55 at the time of the offences.

14     Both _Chen Yongzhao Ashton_ and _Zahier Hilmi Bin Zulkifli_ involved the offenders reaching out to minors through the internet or social media platforms. In those two cases, there were also factors that included communicating with the minor over a period of time on sex-related topics before the sexual offences were committed. Even though the individual sentence for the s 376A Penal Code offence for penile-vaginal penetration was 14 months’ imprisonment, the global sentences imposed in _Chen Yongzhao Ashton_ and _Zahier Hilmi Bin Zulkifli_ were imprisonment terms of 28 months and 24 months respectively which reflected the gravity of the offences committed over more than one occasion.

15     The cases of _Muhammad Idris Bin Osman_ and _Len Teck Guan_ involved only one charge each under s 376A(1) Penal Code, both receiving an individual sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment. In oral submissions, the Prosecution in the present case argued that the element of sexual grooming warranted a significant uplift from 15 months’ imprisonment to 20 months’ imprisonment. During his oral submissions, counsel for the Accused acknowledged that penile-vaginal penetration is more serious than digital-vaginal penetration and countered the Prosecution’s submission of 20 months’ imprisonment with one that was between 15 to 18 months’ imprisonment, with allowance for any mitigating factors.[^4]

16     In my view, _Muhammad Idris Bin Osman_ involved a case where the offender and the minor were in a romantic relationship where they eventually decided to raise the child together. As for _Len Teck Guan_, the offender was a 37-year-old who had similarly met the minor through Facebook. That case was aggravating as it involved payment in exchange for consensual sexual intercourse. However, only one charge was proceeded against the offender who had worn a condom at the material time. In the present case, the Accused had unprotected sex with the Victim which would have contributed to her eventual fears that she could be pregnant. I agree with the Prosecution that there should be a significant uplift from 15 months’ imprisonment.

17     As a final point of observation, the Accused in the present case was 55 years old at the time of the offence, more than 40 years older than the Victim. At an age that was old enough to be the Victim’s father, he preyed on the vulnerability of the Victim over the internet and sexually groomed her to satisfy his depraved sexual desires. A deterrent sentence ought to be imposed to signal the moral depravity of the Accused’s sexual conduct. At the same time, there is a need for this group of minors to be protected, especially when the reach of potential criminal offenders is now expanded through the wide range of chat and instant messaging applications online. It is all too easy for offenders to hide behind the veil of anonymity or a false persona to lure and corrupt unexpecting minors into committing sexual acts. Online prowlers like the Accused are easily finding teens to groom for sex and such criminal conduct must be visited with a strong deterrent message.

18     Taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the submissions from both parties and mitigation, I imposed a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the charge DAC-907580-2020 which involved penile-oral penetration. For the charge DAC-907583-2020 involving penile-vaginal penetration, I imposed a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, resulting in a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment which is fair and appropriate. The Accused who is serving sentence has appealed against the sentence imposed.
