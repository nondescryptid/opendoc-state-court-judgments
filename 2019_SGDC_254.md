\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9275/2019/01.\]

28 November 2019

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

## BACKGROUND

The Accused, Mr Musadiq s/o Abbas, pleaded guilty to a charge under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”).

2       I sentenced the Accused to _15 months’_ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with the _sentence_ has filed an appeal. The Accused had initially commenced serving sentence on 6 November 2019 but made an application for stay of the execution of his imprisonment term upon filing his appeal on 8 November 2019. I granted his application and he is currently _on bail pending appeal_.

## CHARGE

3       The details of the charge which the Accused pleaded guilty to were as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on **42 occasions** between the 8th day of November 2017 and the 18th day of April 2018, in Singapore, by submitting 869 forged receipts into the victim’s loyalty rewards programme, “CapitaStar”, did embark on a course of conduct of cheating CapitaLand Limited (“the victim”), thereby deceiving the victim into believing that 18 third parties had accumulated a total of 4,070,000 Star$, a fact you knew to be false, and by such deception, you dishonestly induced the victim to deliver CapitaLand vouchers worth S$4,070 to you, which the victim would not have done had the victim not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which is an **amalgamated charge** pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

> (**emphasis added**)

## FACTS

4       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

> **(A) Parties**     

> 1.    The accused is Musadiq s/o Abbas, a 32-year-old Singaporean male bearing NRIC No. XXX. At the time of the offences, he was working as a perfume promoter.

> 2.    The victim is CapitaLand Limited (“**CapitaLand**”). CapitaLand’s loyalty programme, CapitaStar, is an intiative to reward customers who shop or dine at participating outlets in CapitaLand shopping malls. Customers can sign up for a free account online through the CapitaStar website or through the CapitaStar mobile application.

> 3.    Upon registration of a CapitaStar account, the customer can scan and upload his spending receipt into the account and be awarded Star$ in exchange. Under the loyalty programme, customers earn 5 Star$ for every S$1 spent at the participating outlets in CapitaLand shopping malls. The Star$ can in turn be exchanged for CapitaLand vouchers, which can be used as cash at CapitaLand shopping malls.

> **(B) First Information Report**     

> 4.    On 8 May 2018 at about 10.35 a.m., the Head of Operations of CapitaStar, one Yong Wei Ming, lodged a police report at Bukit Merah East Neighbourhood Police Centre as some transactions in which customers had redeemed CapitaLand vouchers were suspicious.

> **(C) Facts surrounding the commission of the offence**     

> 5.    Between 16 March 2017 and 19 January 2018, the accused created 18 CapitaStar accounts using the personal information of his family members, colleagues and acquaintances. The accused had obtained the information from a production they had been involved in sometime in 2015 when he was working as an assistant producer, as he was given copies of their identity cards which he stored on a thumbdrive. For each CapitaStar account, the accused provided a name, NRIC number, email address and phone number. The accused intentionally deceived CapitaLand as to the identity of the CapitaStar account holders.

> 6.    To obtain the receipts for submission on these 18 CapitaStar accounts, the accused searched the online platform, Carousell, for sellers who put up mobile phones for sale. The accused contacted these sellers on the pretext of buying the mobile phones and requested for receipts showing the sellers’ purchase of these mobile phones. Once the accused obtained receipts issued by participating outlets from CapitaLand shopping malls, the accused uploaded them onto the CapitaStar accounts he had created to redeem Star$. The accused intentionally deceived CapitaLand into believing that these transactions were real transactions entered into by the CapitaStar account holders.

> 7.    Over time, the accused faced difficulties in getting fresh receipts from mobile phone sellers on Carousell. The accused decided to amend the details on the receipts that he had previously obtained from Carousell sellers and submitted. He scanned the receipts onto his desktop, and amended the date, time of purchase and the receipt number using the Microsoft application, Paint. Thereafter, the accused uploaded these forged receipts onto the CapitaStar accounts he had created to redeem Star$. The accused intentionally deceived CapitaLand into believing that these transactions were real transactions entered into by the CapitaStar account holders.

> 8.    The accused redeemed the Star$ for CapitaLand vouchers every month at CapitaLand shopping malls. The accused was aware that it was a requirement for the CapitaStar account holder to personally redeem the CapitaLand vouchers from the customer service counters, unless there was a signed authorization form permitting someone else to redeem the vouchers on their behalf. He was also aware that he had to present a copy of the account holder’s identity card.

> 9.    For each redemption, the accused printed out the authorization form and filled in the information based on the account he sought to redeem vouchers from. He would authorize himself as the person collecting the vouchers on behalf of the account holder. He would bring along a copy of the identity card of the account holder, which he had access to, as detailed at \[5\]. The accused intentionally deceived CapitaLand into believing that he had been authorised by the CapitaStar account holders to redeem CapitaLand vouchers for them.

> 10.    The table below shows the 18 CapitaStar accounts created by the accused and the corresponding Star$ awarded to each account:

> 11.    The accused only stopped his offending conduct sometime in May 2018 when he discovered that his own CapitaStar account had been suspended whilst trying to redeem CapitaLand vouchers at a customer service counter in a CapitaLand shopping mall.

> 12.    Between 8 November 2017 and 18 April 2018, the accused submitted 869 receipts (including the forged receipts) onto the 18 CapitaStar accounts and was awarded a total of 4,070,000 Star$ in return, which he redeemed for S$4,070 worth of CapitaLand vouchers at CapitaLand shopping malls. He sold the vouchers online for cash.

> 13.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused intentionally deceived CapitaLand into believing that 18 third parties had accumulated a total of 4,070,000 Star$ and dishonestly induced CapitaLand to deliver S$4,070 worth of CapitaLand vouchers to him, thereby committing an offence of cheating punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), and stands charged with an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

> 14.    The accused has made full restitution to CapitaLand.

## CHARGE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

5       The Accused admitted and consented to have the following amalgamated charge under section 420 of the Penal Code, in relation to 7 occasions of offending, be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charge”):

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 7 occasions between the 8th day of November 2017 and the 18th day of April 2018, in Singapore, by submitting 143 receipts into the victim’s loyalty rewards programme, “CapitaStar”, did embark on a course of conduct of cheating CapitaLand Limited (“the victim”), thereby deceiving the victim into believing that you had accumulated a total of 850,000 Star$, a fact you knew to be false, and by such deception, you dishonestly induced the victim to deliver CapitaLand vouchers worth S$850 to you, which the victim would not have done had the victim not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

## ANTECEDENTS

6       The Accused was untraced.

## SENTENCE

#### Prescribed punishment

7       Section 420 of the Penal Code states:

> Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

8       For completeness, I should highlight that in relation to an amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the CPC, subsections (8) and (9) of section 124 provide for enhanced sentencing powers of the Court as follows:

> (8)    Subject to subsection (7), where a charge is framed under subsection (2) or (4), and a person is convicted of the offence specified in that charge —

>> (a)    the court may sentence that person —

>> …

>>> (ii)   in any case where the charge is framed under subsection (4) — to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence mentioned in that subsection; but

>> (b)    any sentence of caning imposed by the court in respect of that offence must not exceed the specified limit in section 328.

> (9)    Despite anything to the contrary in this Code, where a Magistrate’s Court or District Court would (apart from this section) have jurisdiction and power to try a particular type of offence, and a charge specifying an offence of that type is framed under subsection (2) or (4) — the Magistrate’s Court or District Court (as the case may be) —

>> (a)    has jurisdiction to hear and determine all proceedings for the offence specified in that charge; and

>> (b)    has power to award the full punishment provided under subsection (8) in respect of the offence specified in that charge.

9       However, as the offences in this case took place before the date of commencement of section 32 of the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018[^1], pursuant to section 124(10) of the CPC, _subsections (8) and (9) would not apply to the charge in this case_.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

10     The prosecution made oral submissions on sentence and sought a term of _18 months’ imprisonment_.

11     The prosecution first highlighted 2 sentencing precedents in **_Tan Sai Tiang v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 4</span> and **_PP v Soh Eng Luan_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 64</span> (MA 9071/2019/01) in support of their sentencing position. The prosecution’s table summarising the salient facts in these 2 cases is reproduced below (without the “Antecedents” column as both accused persons were untraced):

12     The prosecution took the Court through the details of the two cases, both of which involved the _use of forged documents_ in the commission of offences of cheating. The accused in those cases had also _pleaded guilty_ and made _full restitution_ of the monies they received from the offences. The prosecution compared the salient features in those cases with the facts of the current case, and the distinguishing factors may be summarised as follows:

13     The prosecution then proceeded to highlight the aggravating factors in the present case. Firstly, the prosecution pointed out that there was planning and premeditation involved in committing the cheating offences, as seen from the manner in which the Accused had used Carousell to obtain receipts and subsequently forging the receipts himself. The Accused had also forged the signatures on the authorisation forms to redeem the vouchers. Secondly, the Accused had misused the personal information in other persons’ identity cards, which were given to him during his previous employment as an assistant producer in a production involving those individuals.

14     The prosecution recognised that the Accused had made full restitution and had no previous convictions. However, in light of the number of occasions of cheating, the amount involved, the time period over which the offences took place, and the aggravating factors highlighted above, the prosecution submitted for a sentence in line with that in **_Tan Sai Tiang_**, which was 18 months’ imprisonment.

15     While the prosecution acknowledged that the sums involved in both precedents cited where much higher, the prosecution emphasised that this should be balanced against the significant number of occasions of offending in the present case, as well as the significantly higher number of forged documents involved. There was also no misuse of confidential information of third parties in the 2 precedents highlighted.

#### Mitigation

16     In mitigation, the Accused told the Court that he was aware of all the charges against him and accepted full responsibility for what he did. The Accused said that he had initially committed the offences because he needed money as he was holding a job that did not really pay well. However, the Accused recognised that that was not an excuse for his actions.

17     The Accused expressed deep remorse and felt sorry towards the victims. He added that both his parents were not working and he was supporting them. As such, the Accused hoped that the Court would show him some mercy in sentencing.

#### Sentencing considerations

18     In considering the appropriate sentence in this case, I was mindful that the proceeded amalgamated charge represented a course of criminal conduct and not a single offence. In this regard, the High Court’s decision in the case of **_Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span>_** provides useful guidance on the approach the Court may take in dealing with sentencing for an amalgamated charge. In **_Gan Chai Bee Anne_**, the accused faced 154 charges under section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, for knowingly giving to an agent, receipts which contained false statements and which she knew were intended to mislead the principal. In considering the challenge of sentencing for multiple similar offences, each of which, taken alone, may be a minor offence, but taken together, demonstrated a single course of more serious criminal conduct, Sundaresh Menon CJ opined at \[23\]:

> “I acknowledge that the challenge of sentencing for multiple similar offences that constitute a single course of criminal conduct may, to some degree, have been ameliorated by recent amendments to the CPC which have permitted a single charge to be framed in respect of two or more incidents of the commission of the same offence which, having regard to their time, place and purpose, amount to a course of conduct: see s 32 of the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018 (No 19 of 2018); s 124 of the CPC. If an accused person is convicted on such a charge, then the sentencing judge would likely not be faulted if he approached sentencing for that charge in a single step, _focusing solely on the totality of the accused’s criminal conduct_.”

> (_emphasis added)_

19     The above approach dovetails that set out in the English cases which dealt with amalgamated charges under rule 10.2(2) of the UK Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 read with Para 10A.11-14 of the UK Criminal Practice Directions 2015, which is materially similar to section 124(4) of the CPC. Both provisions allow the amalgamation of two or more incidents of the same offence, where the incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct having regard to their time, place or purpose. Further, in both the UK and Singapore, a course of conduct may arise in one or more of the following non-exhaustive circumstances:

> (a)     The victim was the same if there was an identifiable victim;

> (b)     The alleged incidents employed the same method;

> (c)     The alleged incidents occurred in the same place;

> (d)     The alleged incidents took place over a clearly defined period of no more than a year.

20     The case law on the UK provisions on amalgamation indicates that its purpose is to, _inter alia_, “reflect the defendant’s alleged criminality_”_ when the offences are so similar and numerous that it is inappropriate to indict each occasion or many different occasions in separate charges; as well as to enable the judge to “reflect the seriousness of the offending_”_ by reference to the central factors in the case: e.g. the number of victims, the nature of the offending and the length of time over which it extended (see **_A v R_** \[2015\] EWCA Crim 177 at \[47\]; **_R v Lunn_** \[2017\] EWCA Crim 34 at \[99\]).

21     I was also mindful that in calibrating the sentence for an amalgamated charge, it should not result in a sentencing discount for the Accused vis-à-vis the overall sentence he would have received had he been prosecuted on multiple charges in relation to the same offending acts which constituted the course of conduct reflected in the amalgamated charge.

22     The English Court of Appeal recently held in **_R v Givemore Tonderei Gezi_** \[2019\] EWCA Crim 286 at \[29\] that in cases of amalgamated charges, it would be _“_wholly artificial and contrary to the interests of justice_”_ to apply sentencing guidelines as though the charge alleged only a single offence. The Court stated that sentencing guidelines would apply to a single offence whereas **_Givemore_** concerned an amalgamated charge (known as a “multiple incident count”) with multiple offences.

23     In deliberating the sentence in this case, I was well aware that generally, in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence: **_Gan Chai Bee Anne_** at \[42\]. However, this was subject to a number of qualifications, one of which, as highlighted by the Court in **_Gan Chai Bee Anne_** at \[43\], was that economic value was an accurate proxy for only the economic harm suffered by the victim. It would not reflect intangible harm, such as harm suffered by society at large.

24     In **_Logachev Vladislav v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> at \[49\], Sundaresh Menon CJ observed that whilst the amount of loss is an important factor to consider in sentencing, it was not at the forefront of the Court’s consideration. Although **_Logachev_** did not involve a section 420 Penal Code offence (but section 172A Casino Control Act charges), the Court cited the case of **_PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> and considered that it was inaccurate to state that, in section 420 Penal Code cases, the quantum involved would always be at the “forefront” of the Court’s consideration in sentencing.

25      **_Fernando Payagala_** is also instructive as to the nexus between the number of offences and quantum. In that case, V K Rajah J held that an offender who cheated a victim of small amounts a hundred times over is a serial offender and he would be regarded as more culpable than an offender who cheated only once, albeit of a large sum: \[48\]. Accordingly, His Honour held at \[48\] that the total sentence imposed on the serial cheat would probably be _higher_ than the sentence imposed on an offender convicted of a single cheating offence “if the total quantum is identical in both instances”, and even “significantly higher” in the appropriate circumstances since a serial offender would be hard put to submit that his conduct was the result of momentary indiscretion.

26     In the present case, the facts revealed that the Accused was the sole mastermind and executor of an elaborate and complex course of dishonest conduct to cheat CapitaLand. Although the value of the vouchers the Accused obtained from CapitaLand was not particularly large, I agreed with the prosecution that this has to be weighed against the totality of his criminal conduct as follows:

> (a)     In creating the 18 CapitaStar accounts, the Accused had misused the personal data of 18 individuals which were provided to him in his previous job as an assistant producer. Thus, beside the economic harm caused to CapitaLand, there was also intangible harm caused to these 18 persons whose personal particulars had been employed by the Accused to facilitate his offences.

> (b)     Although the period of offending stated in the proceeded charge was about 6 months (from 8 November 2017 to 18April 2018), the Statement of Facts revealed that the Accused had begun creating the 18 spurious CapitaStar accounts as early as 16 March 2017 and continued to do so until 19 January 2018.

> (c)     It was clear that the Accused had created a number of CapitaStar accounts in order to avoid detection.

> (d)     In order to obtain receipts for submission, the Accused had lied to sellers on Carousell that he was interested to purchase their mobile phones, so as to deceive them into sending him their original receipts.

> (e)     The Accused then proceeded to forge hundreds of receipts by changing the details in the receipts he obtained from Carousell sellers and uploaded these forged receipts into the CapitaStar accounts he had created. Working backwards from the more than 4 million Star$ he managed to accumulate in the 18 CapitaStar accounts, the Accused would have uploaded receipts representing more than $800,000 worth of purported purchases from participating outlets in CapitaLand shopping malls.

> (f)     In order to redeem the vouchers, the Accused forged the authorisation forms, authorising himself to redeem the vouchers on behalf of the purported CapitaStar account holders.

> (g)     He again misused the personal data of the 18 individuals when he brought along a copy of their identity cards to facilitate his redemption of the vouchers.

27     In my view, the totality of the Accused’s criminal conduct clearly demonstrated that he was a serial offender who had committed multiple layers of offences, on numerous occasions, over several months. The Accused also admitted that he only stopped his offending conduct when he discovered that his own CapitaStar account had been suspended. In my view, if not for the fact that CapitaLand had become suspicious of some transactions, the Accused would most likely have carried on with his criminal enterprise for some time.

28     I should add, however, that I did consider the Accused’s remorse and early plea of guilt favourably. Further, I accorded due weight to the fact that the Accused had made full restitution to CapitaLand.

#### Sentence imposed

29     Having deliberated on and scrutinised this case and both sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution, and taking into consideration the distinguishing factors between the 3 cases, I was of the view that the appropriate custodial term should lie somewhere between those in **_Tan Sai Tiang_** and **_Soh Eng Luan._**

30     In the final analysis, based on the facts and circumstances of this case, I was of the opinion that 15 months’ imprisonment would be proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.
