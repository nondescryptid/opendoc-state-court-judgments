### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

1       This case is about the credibility of three waitresses who complained that the Accused had touched them inappropriately.

## Background:

2       At the material time, Mr Ng Kum Weng (“the Accused”) was 43 years old and was working at a major international bank in the central business district as a senior compliance analyst. It was a Friday night, and he was out drinking with some colleagues and friends. By his own estimation, they finished a bottle of whiskey between them. A friend in the group, one Kenneth Ho Tat Meng (PW10) then received a call inviting him to join another group for more drinks over at a music lounge at Tanjong Pagar Road. Kenneth agreed and invited the Accused along. The Accused agreed to go along. When they reached the lounge, it was past mid-night at about 1 am on the 12th of December 2015.

3       During the course of their time there at the lounge, more liquor was ordered and consumed. The Accused also interacted with some waitresses. The last interaction ultimately resulted in a confrontation. When the police arrived at the scene, three waitresses separately stepped forward to complain that he had touched them inappropriately earlier. The Accused was arrested as a result. Later at the police station, after he had sobered up, the Accused entered a partial admission in his long statement that he “_was very drunk_” and “_it is possible that I might have molested those girls in the pub_”, “_about 2-3 girls_”, but that he could not remember the details. He then ended by stating that he would “_like to sincerely apologise to the girls for committing such a disgusting act on them_”, before stating that “_I am really shameful and will never do it again_”.[^1] He later resiled from all this in his Cautioned Statements (recorded about 9 months later on 19 Sept 2016), stating that whilst he was “_really very drunk_”, he “_did not remember any body contact_”, that he had “_no intention to do any wrong_”, and that he ‘_believed that he did not touch them_’.[^2] In court, his memory of that night’s events strengthened even further and he categorically stated that he did not touch them inappropriately. Not only that, he went on to offer up a detailed account about what allegedly happened instead. In essence, he said that the three waitresses were an unwelcome presence, and that he had given them short shrift variously over their shoddy behaviour, poor service, and pesky attempts to market them more drinks. He explained that was actually what he was apologising for in his long statement, and he submitted that the waitresses were coming forward to falsely implicate him precisely because of his boorish behaviour towards them at the lounge.

## Issues to be determined

4       The issue at the trial before me was therefore whether these waitresses were credible witnesses on their complaints. I found that they were. In large part, their accounts were amply corroborated by CCTV footage which was subsequently retrieved by the police from the lounge.[^3] That footage tallied with the details that each of them had provided earlier about how the Accused had touched them. That showed their credibility on their complaints. At the same time, the footage also debunked the Defence Case. I now set out the evidence from the three complainants, and what the CCTV footage showed.

## Findings on the Evidence:

5       All three waitresses testified confidently and comfortably on their accounts. **The first (in sequential order of the acts that night) was one Ms Wong Liping** (33 years old at the material time). It was an accepted fact that Ms Wong did not even wait upon the table of the Accused that night. She said that she was simply resting on a seat nearby, looking at her handphone, when the Accused turned towards her, reached out his right hand and stroked her right thigh skin on skin (this formed the subject matter of DAC 902408/2017 under section 354(1) of the Penal Code). Ms Wong – an experienced waitress at such nightspots for the past several years – said she swiped his hand away, stared at him and confronted him with an ‘_Excuse me!_’. She said the Accused cheekily smiled back, mockingly beat his own offending hand as if in apology, and then just turned back to face his drinking buddies. Ms Wong was then dressed in a pair of short black shorts, a tucked out white button shirt, and strappy heels. Ms Wong said she then moved further away from him and was otherwise prepared to let the matter rest. She only raised the complaint when the police later arrived, and she learnt that the Accused had also touched two other waitresses inappropriately. In response, the Defence put it to Ms Wong that she had bumped into the back of the Accused when she made her way to that seat, and that the Accused took objection to her clumsiness. That was why he turned to face her, gestured with his hands that she was plus sized, and that her legs were like pig trotters. The Accused was apologetic in court for the offensive rudeness, and explained that he was not on his best behaviour that night as he had been drinking. Ms Wong flatly rejected that Defence version. An objective review of the CCTV footage shows little indication that the Accused was bumped into by Ms Wong. In fact, the CCTV shows that the Accused was taking a big swig of his drink when she was behind him, and that he managed to complete and down that swig with no apparent interference. From his continued attention focussed forward on his mates around the table, it appeared that he was not at all bothered by anything which had just happened behind him, and did not even seem to know that someone had just gone past his back.[^4] He only seemed to take notice of Ms Wong about 27 seconds later when he turned to his right to talk animatedly to the drinking buddy on his right, one Eric Chan Tze Choong (DW2), and saw her sitting close by then.[^5] Whilst he is talking to Eric, he is seen swaying/reaching towards Ms Wong, and Ms Wong is seen reacting and confronting him. Words are clearly being exchanged between them, and the Accused is later seen beating his own hand, facing her and motioning what appears to be an apologetic gesture, before turning back to face his friends and continuing the animated interactions with them.[^6] Ms Wong is also seen moving further away from him. Throughout that episode, the Accused showed no sign of irritation, and appeared to be having a good time. As a result, the CCTV corroborated Ms Wong’s account; and at the same time, it powerfully contradicted the Defence Case and showed how contrived it was.

6        **The next witness was Ms Quek Boon Teng** (30 years old at the material time). Prior to the material events for her, it was an accepted fact that Ms Quek also wasn’t waiting on the Accused’s table that night; she was standing at another part of the lounge when the Accused approached her to order some food.[^7] When she found out from the kitchen that the dish he wanted was not available, she brought the menu to him at his table, explained the situation, and invited him to order something else. She was accompanied by the floor manager of the lounge (i.e. one Mr Neo Xing Wei, PW3) because the Accused had earlier spoken to her in Cantonese which she was not familiar with, and Mr Neo was there to help explain.[^8] After leaving the Accused to review the menu for a while, Ms Quek returned – alone this time – to ask the Accused if he was ready to order. She said the Accused then raised his left hand, pointed his index finger at her breasts, reached out and touched her breast by poking with his finger (this formed the subject matter of DAC 902411/2017 under section 354(1) of the Penal Code).[^9] Ms Quek was then wearing a short skirted black dress with a low cut top held up by little straps which crossed at her back, and the touch was skin on skin at the top of her cleavage. As he did so, Ms Quek testified that he said that he wanted to eat “_Yu Dan_” and laughed.[^10] Ms Quek said the others at the table saw what the Accused did and also laughed. She recoiled backwards when he touched her so, and said that the Accused tried to do it again but she managed to grab hold of his hand and stopped him. Ms Quek, who had even more work experience in the night entertainment industry, could tell that the Accused was drunk, and she decided not to make an issue out of it. She did however tell Mr Neo and the latter simply told her not to go back to the table again. She also told her fellow waitress and friend Ms Wong, and that was when she learnt that the Accused had touched Ms Wong’s thigh earlier as well. They nonetheless decided not to pursue the matter further. Ms Quek only later came forward to raise the complaint when the police arrived and she found out that a third waitress had been touched by the same Accused. In response, the Defence put it to Ms Quek that she was incompetent in handling his simple food order, and that the Accused became very frustrated and was simply pointing at her in frustration but that he did not actually touch her at her breast area. Ms Quek flatly rejected that Defence version. An objective review of the CCTV footage shows Ms Quek’s version being corroborated. When she goes back to the table to check whether they were ready to order, she was at a position opposite from the Accused.[^11] She can be seen talking to them for a while before eventually walking away from the table. The CCTV then shows the Accused _calling her back_ to his side. When she moves to his side, he can be seen extending his hand towards her cleavage, and Ms Quek can be seen recoiling away. His drinking buddies (Kenneth & Eric) are seen looking on. The Accused is then seen trying that move again, but Ms Quek manages to block his hand, and she continues to do that in a seemingly playful and animated manner. The CCTV then shows the Accused eventually turning back to face his drinking buddies with a big grin on his face.[^12] When Ms Quek finally walks away, the Accused appears to have a big laugh before initiating a fist bump gesture with his friend Kenneth; the CCTV also captures the latter animatedly reciprocating that gesture.[^13] There appears to be laughter all round. As a result, the CCTV corroborated Ms Quek’s account; and at the same time, it powerfully contradicted the Defence Case and showed how contrived it was.

7        **The final waitress was one Ms Pearline Tan Qiu Ting** (23 years old at the material time). That was her first job in the night entertainment industry, and she was introduced to it by her elder sister, one Ms Candice Tan Qiu Si (29 years old at the material time), who was already working at the lounge as a waitress. Pearline said she had a day job, and that she took on the waitress job as well because she needed the money as a single mother to support herself and her 2 year old child. All that is set out not as a sympathy factor (which Pearline did not in any event need given the CCTV footage), but to provide context to how she subsequently reacted when the Accused reached out towards her. On that night, Pearline and Candice, being part of the more junior waitressing team (unlike Ms Wong and Ms Quek), were required to dress up in a Japanese school-girl outfit: i.e. a short tucked out white button shirt over a short red checked mini-skirt. The CCTV footage shows Candice actively serving the table that night – both before and after the arrival of the Accused over there. She brought them their drink orders, fresh cups and ice, and helped pour them for each. At various points that night, the group even made space for Candice to sit with them at their table as they interacted. The CCTV shows the animatedly exaggerated actions of those around her, and they indicate that she was obviously a welcome presence there and that they were having a good time. At various points, one of the men at her side had his arm gently wrapped around her waist, back and shoulder as they interacted. At another point, when Candice was at a position opposite from the Accused, the Accused appeared captivated with her and reached over the table to hold her hand as she was pouring their drinks – drinks which they had ordered and which she had just brought to their table. This was quite soon after his incident with Ms Wong. The Accused holds her hand in a lingering fashion, pulls it over and rubs her hand slowly against his face, nose and mouth a few times, before letting go a couple of minutes later.[^14] That episode appears animatedly exaggerated, and the drinking buddy (Eric) on his right can be seen wearing a smile on his face as he watches. The Accused then calls Candice to come over to him, and she complies and the interactions continue in an animated and playful manner about the spectacles that she was wearing. The Accused displayed no sign of irritation whatsoever throughout; quite the opposite, he appears to be having a good time and a smile can even be seen on his face at various points during that episode. At another point that night, the CCTV also shows the Accused grabbing hold of Candice to make her follow him towards the exit of the lounge for a smoke.[^15] Candice was capably holding her own throughout her interactions with the Accused and the others at the table. The CCTV showed that she was however not present at the table when any of the earlier incidents happened, or when her younger sister later approached the table. Pearline testified that she approached the table because she needed to explain to them that their song requests were about to be interrupted because there was a birthday celebration at another table. She was then talking to the group from a position opposite from the Accused, and the Accused later calls her over to his side instead. When Pearline moves there, the Accused holds her arm, pulls her towards him, and reaches out with his other hand towards her chest and touches her at the area in between her breasts (this formed the subject matter of DAC 902409/2017 under section 354(1) of the Penal Code). Pearline was shocked and said she did not manage to move away in time. She then crosses her arms across her chest and keeps a distance as the Accused tries to reach out towards her again. She then saw the Accused make a gesture with his hand to the rest of his friends at the table; the gesture was with his thumb and index finger pressed together to indicate “smallness” – this gesture is captured on CCTV. Pearline understood that the Accused was saying that her breasts were small (this formed the subject matter of DAC 902410/2017 under section 509 of the Penal Code). Pearline was upset but tried to control her emotions. She saw one of the men at the table signal to her to move away from the Accused and she did. Pearline then walks around and eventually settles down to a seat at a staff table, and is seen crying by others, but she does not let on about what happened. Candice is subsequently alerted, and she goes to Pearline. When Pearline finally tells Candice what happened, Candice launches to confront the Accused, and that results in the police being called to the scene. In response, the Defence put it to Pearline that she was actually pestering them at their table to buy more drinks, and that the Accused had called her “cheap” in his attempt to brush her off and that he did not actually touch her at her chest. In relation to the hand gesture caught on CCTV, the Defence said it was the Accused trying to signal to Pearline that she was “small and insignificant” and to not bother him. Pearline flatly rejected that Defence version. An objective review of the CCTV footage shows Pearline approaching the table, and that their interactions were animated. At various points, the Accused can be seen smiling at Pearline during those interactions.[^16] At one point, the Accused is even seen reaching across the table and attempting to touch her at her face/chest but does not succeed because Pearline moves back in time.[^17] He is then seen motioning for her to come round next to him instead. When Pearline complies, he suddenly puts his hand out and places it at the back of her neck and pulls her face forwards towards his own but Pearline manages to break free just before their faces touch. The Accused then turns to face her, and when she comes close enough again, he suddenly grabs her arm with his left hand and reaches out with his right hand towards her chest – his hand can be seen making contact with Pearline at that area.[^18] Pearline is seen immediately recoiling and putting up her arms to block. Kenneth and Eric both clearly see what happened, and the CCTV shows Kenneth immediately reacting to what the Accused just did by reaching out his hand to seemingly both block and to motion to calm the Accused down. The Accused is next seen saying something to Pearline while making the gesture of smallness with his hand and pointing at her breasts. When Kenneth sees that, the CCTV again shows Kenneth immediately intervening to grab hold of that hand of the Accused and pulling him back to face their table instead; Kenneth appears to maintain his hold on the Accused until Pearline moves away. As a result, the CCTV corroborated Ms Quek’s account; and at the same time, it powerfully contradicted the Defence Case and showed how contrived it was.

8        **The Confrontation:** When Pearline later finally tells Candice what happened to her, Candice is seen on the CCTV launching towards the Accused.[^19] Two others can be seen trying to hold her back and to calm her down, and Pearline is also seen following further behind. Candice bumps into some others enroute to the Accused, and the resulting scrum of people eventually stumbles towards the Accused. There is some shoving about, and the Accused is seen taking the opportunity to shove back against a lady who was actually trying to calm Candice down. The Accused can also be seen saying something to that lady as they shove about, and this ultimately earns him a big slap across the face from her.[^20] When Kenneth sees that slap, he immediately intervenes by moving to stand in front of the Accused to shield him. The ensuing shouting and confrontation then results in a number of calls being made to the police.[^21] When the police arrive, their on-site interviews with the various parties ultimately results in the arrest of the Accused. Later at the police station, the Accused then enters a partial admission in his long statement that ‘it might have been possible that he molested 2-3 girls there’.

### Review & Decision

9       An objective examination of the testimonies from the three complainants will find them to be each clear, complete and coherent. They remained that way under cross-examination as well, and none of the three complainants wavered on their accounts about how the Accused had touched them and behaved that night. That consistency served to bolster their credibility. Most importantly, their accounts were all amply corroborated by the CCTV footage. Although the footage was grainy, it nonetheless offers up enough detail to clearly make out that the Accused had indeed behaved in the manner alleged by each of them in turn. Not only this, an objective review of the footage will also show that it effectively debunked the Defence Case about his alleged frustrations with each of them that night, and shows it for the strained and contrived narrative that it really is. The testimony of the Accused was considered, and his hesitant and unconvincing delivery in court confirmed how contrived it was. If there was any credibility to his version, then one would expect at least some support from the CCTV footage, and/or from his friends who were present at the table. As indicated earlier, there was none to be had in the former; in fact, the CCTV footage completely contradicts his version. They capture him clearly having a good time with the waitresses, even fist-bumping to celebrate after successfully touching Ms Quek’s breast. For similar reasons, there was none to be had in the latter category either when those friends claimed that they saw none of the things which the CCTV clearly shows that they witnessed. The drinking buddies (Kenneth and Eric) of the Accused haltingly offered up instead some guarded and unclear accounts about his supposed frustrations that night, accounts which also did not end up exactly coinciding with the Defence version. It was apparent that these drinking buddies had not practised their attempt to water down the actions of the Accused that night. As a result, I found the friends to be unworthy of credit given the poor quality of their testimony and how they were plainly contradicted by the CCTV footage. Finally, the version offered up by the Accused in court was also shown to be a recent invention, and that he had in fact entered a partial admission to having touched the waitresses when he was first held to account for what he did at the lounge. There was therefore no credibility at all to this Accused, and the Defence version was rejected in its entirety. I found the three complainants to be reliable witnesses of truth on their allegations, with no credible evidence before the court of any possible motive for why they would come forward to lay false allegations against him. On the strength of their testimonies and the CCTV footage, I found the 4 Charges proven beyond all doubt. The Accused was thus found guilty and convicted on them.

10     I conclude this section with a few other points. The Defence will likely say that this judgment does not substantively deal with all the areas they raised. They would be correct. Before me, the Defence pursued a highly exploratory strategy during the trial, covering a whole host of other areas which were ultimately peripheral to the main events. I nonetheless considered them all and whether they helped the main Defence contention that these waitresses were biased and unworthy of credit. In the end, none of them justified further comment in these grounds because they did not affect the evidence before the court which showed what the Accused did and how he behaved towards those waitresses that night.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties for Offences under ss 354 & 509 of the Penal Code:

11     The prescribed penalty for molest offences under section 354(1) of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of those punishments.

12     Next, the prescribed penalty for insulting the modesty of a woman under section 509 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.

### Antecedent:

13     Before me, the Prosecution highlighted that Mr Ng had a previous drink-driving conviction on 23 December 2004 under section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act. For that, Mr Ng was fined $2,000 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for 18 months.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence:

14     The Prosecution submitted that an aggregate term of at least 11 months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed on Mr Ng, together with a fine of $5,500:

> (a)      **A fine of $3,000** for DAC 902408/2017 under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for sliding his hand on Ms Wong’s right thigh skin-on-skin;

> (b)      **5 months** imprisonment for DAC 902411/2017 under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for poking Ms Quek’s breast with his index finger (reduced from 7 months’ imprisonment on account of the totality principle);

> (c)      **6 months** imprisonment for DAC 902409/2017 under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for touching Ms Pearline Tan’s chest in between her breasts (reduced from 8 months’ imprisonment on account of the totality principle); and

> (d)      **A fine of $2,500** for DAC 902410/2017 under s 509 of the Penal Code for using his fingers to gesture that Ms Pearline Tan had small breasts.

The Prosecution submitted that the two imprisonment terms ought to run consecutively so as to arrive at the aggregate cited earlier.

15     In arriving at that position, the Prosecution pointed out the following:

> (a)     That Mr Ng claimed trial;

> (b)     That the victims belonged to a class of persons deserving of special protection;

> (c)     That there was a rise in the number of outrage of modesty cases in public entertainment nightspots;

> (d)     That the offences were laced with insults and disrespect;

> (e)     That there were multiple victims;

> (f)     That there was escalation in offending both in manner and frequency; and

> (g)     That Mr Ng was intoxicated and he had an antecedent for offending while intoxicated.

I found points (b) and (c) above to be problematic. The first effectively invited this court to lay down a legal precedent and create a new specially protected class of persons, whilst the second was premised on statistics which did not even reference waitresses specifically. I therefore indicated my concerns and invited the parties to submit.[^22]

#### Preliminary Question: Should waitresses at public entertainment nightspots be given special/additional protection under the law?

16     The Prosecution submitted that waitresses are a class of persons deserving of special protection under the law because such persons are more vulnerable to assaults and other transgressions than the ordinary person on the street. This was due to the nature of their jobs which necessitates their having frequent and close contact with all manner of persons – a large proportion of whom would be under the influence of alcohol. The Prosecution submitted that such customers can lose their inhibition and start exhibiting bad behaviour. This was especially the case in such public entertainment nightspots where the lighting is usually dim, and with loud music being played. The Prosecution submitted that all this causes service staff at such nightspots to be more vulnerable to sudden, unwanted contact, and which is often difficult to detect and prove. Next, in relation to the statistics, the Prosecution conceded that they did not relate to waitresses specifically, but nonetheless invited the court to take notice of the trend _generally_.

17     I considered those arguments but did not find them to be persuasive. Setting down a legal precedent to create a new specially protected class of persons is not something to be done lightly. There ought to be sound empirical data justifying its necessity, together with a sound argument explaining why the general sentencing framework was deficient and that something more needed to be done. In this case, neither were present: there was no data, and there was no sound reason provided to show why a special class needed to be created. None of the precedents cited by the Prosecution – which were in any event distinguishable on their facts – also justified the suggested approach. One ought to recognise that such exercises of creating special groupings and categories in the law inevitably involves a social ranking of sorts, where consensus is often elusive. The lone judicial activism invited of me – without any of the benefits which accrue from the issue being first robustly scrutinised and debated at the legislature instead – is usually not advisable. In the end, I found the general sentencing framework remained entirely adequate to deal with cases like the present, and there was no justification or necessity to create further categories for special protection under the law. The court could take the specific vulnerabilities and aggravating factors of each case into account.

### Mitigation & the Defence Submissions on Sentence:

18     Against the Prosecution’s suggested aggregate of 11 months’ imprisonment and fine, the Defence submitted for a global fine of $10,000 instead. Their main points are summarised as follows:

> (a)     Mr Ng was a first time offender and there was no likelihood of him re-offending;

> (b)     The entire investigation as well as the court process was punishment in itself;

> (c)     He was a victim of assault by staff members of Kylin Lounge (the “Lounge”) that night;

> (d)     He had a family of dependants to support (a 10 year old daughter, a homemaker wife with health issues, and an elderly father with health issues), and that he would lose his employment regardless of the sentence imposed; and with a criminal record, it would be extremely difficult for him to be employed again in a financial institution;

> (e)     No private parts were intruded upon: the acts were committed on the thigh of Ms Wong, chest / sternum of Pearline, and the area above the breast of Ms Quek;[^23]

> (f)     The acts were brief, fleeting (with duration of about one second each), on the spur of the moment, and not persistent or repeated;[^24]

> (g)     None of the aggravating factors which the court laid out in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> were present in Mr Ng’s case[^25];

> (h)     Absence of factors relevant to the circumstance of the offence (which were set out in _GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”))[^26]

### Reasons for the Sentence

19     After considering the submissions and precedents tendered by both sides, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment and a total fine of $5,000 in default 5 weeks’ imprisonment on Mr Ng. I now explain the reasons for this sentence.

#### Sentencing Framework for Molest Offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code

20     The sentencing starting point for molest offences under section 354(1) of the Penal Code is the case of _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”). The High Court sought to lay down a sentencing framework for such offences, and the parties before me were in agreement that the approach set out there was binding upon this court. The “two-step sentencing bands” approach requires an assessment as to which band the offence fell under, before turning to assess the impact of the offender specific factors. The three bands were:

> (a)     Band 1: Cases where one or no offence-specific factors are present, and where they involve a fleeting touch or with no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts, a sentence of less than 5 months’ imprisonment is imposed;

> (b)     Band 2: Cases where more offence-specific factors are present, a starting indicative sentence of between 5 to 15 months’ imprisonment is imposed; and

> (c)     Band 3: For the most severe of cases, a starting indicative sentence of between 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment is imposed.[^27]

21     After taking into account the circumstances in which each of the offences were committed, I determined as follows:

> (a)     The offence involving Ms Wong fell into the low end of Band 1 (DAC 902408/2017). Though it was skin on skin, it did not involve a private part, and it was a fleeting touch. It was also apparent from the CCTV that Mr Ng had reached out towards Ms Wong’s thigh on the spur of the moment soon after he saw her sitting nearby there within an arm’s reach away. There was no prior interaction between them. Ms Wong was offended by the unwelcomed molestation and immediately swiped his hand away, and the episode came to an end soon after when he offered his putative apology. There was nothing else to indicate that this case deserved a more serious penal approach. A review of the precedents shows that fines are imposed for cases like this.[^28]

> (b)     The offence involving Ms Quek fell into the low end of Band 2 (DAC 902411/2017). The touch was skin on skin (I accepted the testimony of Ms Quek on this) and it was very close to her private part, i.e. at the top part of the cleavage of her breast which was exposed given the low cut dress which she was wearing. Though the touch was fleeting, that had much to do with Ms Quek having the presence of mind to react appropriately by moving backwards and holding her hand up. There was also an element of persistence since the CCTV shows Mr Ng actually trying again to reach out towards her chest and being playfully blocked by Ms Quek instead. It was also right to take into account the fact that this offence did not appear at all to be on the spur of the moment. The CCTV shows Ms Quek actually walking away from the table when Mr Ng called her back to his side instead. Ms Quek’s act of walking away indicated that the matter about their food order was already resolved, and that Mr Ng’s act of calling her back to his side to say that he wanted to eat “_Yu Dan_” was just a spurious pretext for what he actually wanted to do to her. The celebratory fist bump which Mr Ng later initiated after Ms Quek left was also consistent with the overall picture that Mr Ng had planned that entire exchange. A review of the precedents shows that imprisonment terms are imposed for cases like this.[^29]

> (c)     The offence involving Ms Pearline Tan similarly fell into the low end of Band 2 (DAC 902409/2017). Though the touch was fleeting, and not skin-on-skin, the area was nonetheless an intimate area (i.e. in between her breasts) and very close to her private parts. From the CCTV, that area came to be touched only because Ms Pearline Tan had reacted and moved when she saw his hand coming towards her breasts. Mr Ng appeared to be aiming for her breasts instead, and his act of subsequently gesturing that she had small breasts confirmed this. Like the incident involving Ms Quek which happened just a few minutes before, there was a clear element of persistence since the CCTV shows Mr Ng reaching out towards Ms Pearline Tan a few times before successfully touching her there. It also did not appear to be on the spur of the moment either since this entire exchange lasted a few minutes. Mr Ng’s actions against Ms Pearline Tan also appeared to be a result of his being emboldened after successfully touching Ms Wong and Ms Quek earlier and not being taken to task for those actions. In this case, he can be seen in the CCTV calling Ms Pearline Tan over to his side, attempting to pull her face towards his own, before holding on and restraining Ms Pearline Tan at her right arm as he reached out towards her breasts. His subsequent actions in gesturing that her breasts were small also meant that this offence was laced with pure insult. Ms Pearline Tan ended up in tears as a result. His actions were so objectionable that even his friend can be seen in the CCTV stepping in to calm him down and to stop the further insults. In my judgment, an imprisonment term was entirely justified here, and the same precedents confirm this.

22     I now turn to address the offender specific factors. None of them significantly shifted the preliminary points arrived at in the first step:

> (a)     The offences were committed by an inebriated Mr Ng. He deserves no accommodation on this count.

> (b)     The convictions were being recorded after a full trial. All three victims were subjected to a long and laborious cross-examination which not only covered a whole host of collateral (and ultimately immaterial) aspects, but also subjected them to a spurious defence as to their motives. At no point before me did Mr Ng exhibit any insight or remorse for his offences. No quarter was given, and none should therefore be expected.

> (c)     The personal circumstances (family and job) cited in mitigation were not so exceptional as to displace the clear public interest to be served in ensuring that such offences are robustly dealt with.

> (d)     I did not agree with the Prosecution’s submissions that Mr Ng’s drink driving antecedent warranted a stiffer penalty. That was a difference offence altogether. I therefore treated Mr Ng as a first offender, and his sentences were not loaded further on this count.

23     All considered, I imposed sentence as follows:

> (a)     For DAC 902408/2017, for using criminal force on Ms Wong Liping, intending to outrage her modesty, by sliding his hand on her right thigh skin-on-skin, and which was an offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code: **a fine of $3,000**, in default of which to serve three weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)     For DAC 902411/2017, for using criminal force on Ms Quek Boon Teng, intending to outrage her modesty, by poking her breast with his finger, and which was an offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code: **5 months’ imprisonment** (adjusted down from 7 months on account of the totality principle).

> (c)     For DAC 902409/2017, for using criminal force on Ms Pearline Tan, intending to outrage her modesty, by using his hand to touch her chest in between her breasts, and which was an offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code: **6 months’ imprisonment** (adjusted down from 8 months on account of the totality principle).

> (d)     For DAC 902410/2017, for insulting the modesty of Ms Pearline Tan, by gesturing with his fingers that she had small breasts, and which was an offence under section 509 of the Penal Code: **a fine of $2,000**, in default of which to serve two weeks’ imprisonment.

24     On account of the offences being completely distinct in terms of time, act, and victim, the imprisonment terms ought to therefore run consecutively, and I so ordered. Mr Ng saw it fit to do more and more after he got away with touching Ms Wong. He now reaps the consequences of his own actions. There was no good reason to treat him with any special deference. I also agreed with the Prosecution that such offences rightly attracted an emphasis on deterrence, and I found that the 11 months’ aggregate sentence (which had already been adjusted in its components on account of the totality principle) was entirely appropriate. In the end, Mr Ng’s total sentence for all the charges came to 11 months’ imprisonment, and a fine of $5,000, in default five weeks’ imprisonment:

25     The Defence has lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. In the meantime, the sentence has been stayed, and Mr Ng is on bail pending the appeal.

* * *

[^1]: The long statement of the Accused was admitted and marked as Exhibit P7. This statement was recorded a day plus later at 2.10 pm on 13 December 2015 after the Accused had sobered up and he had some time to think about what he wanted to say about his actions. The admission was entered in response to a simple question on ‘whether he had molested any girls in the pub’. In the statement, the Accused also indicated that he did not sustain any injury at all in the subsequent melee at the pub, and that he did not wish to pursue that aspect. He then pleaded for a chance as he had a family and job.

[^2]: The cautioned statements of the Accused were admitted and marked as Exhibits P8, P9, P10 and P11. The Accused provided a near identical response in all 4 of these statements. In them, he also pleaded so as not to lose his family and job.

[^3]: The CCTV footage were admitted into evidence and marked as Exhibits P2 and P3. Each captured a view of the lounge but from different perspectives. P2 was a normal colour recording, whilst P3 was a UV recording. Both were synchronised in their timestamps. The Defence also commissioned video extracts being made to focus on certain aspects. These were also admitted into evidence and marked as Exhibits D4, D5 and D6. It is imperative to review all of them in their entirety.

[^4]: Ms Wong starts to walk past his back at timestamp 1:16:18.

[^5]: Timestamp 1:16:45.

[^6]: Timestamp 1:17:00-10.

[^7]: Timestamp 1:48:30.

[^8]: Timestamp 1:50:21.

[^9]: Timestamp 1:52:00.

[^10]: Cantonese for Fish Ball.

[^11]: Timestamp 1:51:33.

[^12]: Timestamp 1:52:18-25.

[^13]: Timestamp 1:52:29-32.

[^14]: Timestamp 1:18:10 to 1:20:02.

[^15]: Timestamp 1:24:50.

[^16]: Timestamp 1:54:50 to 1:55:20 in P2.

[^17]: Timestamp 1:55:25 in both P2 and P3.

[^18]: Timestamp 1:55:49 in both P2 and P3.

[^19]: Timestamp 1:58:24 in P3.

[^20]: This lady was ultimately not identified. It did not matter, because this melee was a distraction to the issues in dispute.

[^21]: Exhibit P1 was the FIR by one Edwin Tay, a manager at the lounge. One of the drinking buddies at the table with the Accused also called the police to report the ‘fight’, and that FIR was admitted and marked as Exhibit P5.

[^22]: State Court letter dated 11 January 2019 to the parties.

[^23]: Paragraph 18 at pages 8-9 of the Plea in Mitigation dated 15 November 2018.

[^24]: Paragraph 19 at pages 8-9 of the Plea in Mitigation dated 15 November 2018.

[^28]: _Soh Yang Tick v PP_ \[1998\]1 SLR 209, and _Ng Chiew Kiat v PP_ \[1999\]2 SLR 927 were the only cases cited by the Defence. Both involved fines, and were pre-_Kunasekaran_ but remained persuasive. The Prosecution cited two unreported cases: _PP v Marcus Ong Yong Qiang_ (SC-911624/2017) where a $1,500 fine was imposed after the offender pleaded guilty to having stroked the right thigh of another night-club patron; and _PP v Yujiro Tomita_ (SC-901776/2018) where a fine of $3,000 was imposed after the offender pleaded guilty for slapping the buttocks of the victim in a bar.

[^29]: _PP v Adaikkalam Sivagnanam_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 43</span>: convicted after trial, 6 months’ imprisonment for grabbing the breast of a waitress. _PP v Thompson Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 179</span>: convicted after trial, 4 months’ imprisonment for sliding his hand from the hip to the breast of a stewardess during a flight. On appeal, the High Court indicated that 8 months’ imprisonment was appropriate for such offences committed on a plane, but decided to impose 6 months’ imprisonment on account of the offender’s specific personal circumstances.
