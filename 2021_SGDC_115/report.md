### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The Accused, Mr Li Yong De, a 35 year-old Singapore citizen faced a total of 23 charges and had pleaded guilty to the following eight charges:

> (a)     One amalgamated charge under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) in _DAC 910471 of 2020_;

> (b)     One amalgamated charge under s 477A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) in _DAC 910476 of 2020_;

> (c)     One amalgamated charge under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) read with s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) in _DAC 910478 of 2020_;

> (d)     One charge under s 47(1)(c) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, Rev Ed 2000)(“**CDSA**”) and punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the same Act in _DAC 910483 of 2020_ and

> (e)     Four charges under s 70(1)(a) of the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 and punishable under s 70(2) of the said Act in _MSC 901024 of 2020_ to _MSC 901027 of 2020_.

2       The Accused consented to 15 of the remaining charges namely:

> (a)     One charge under s 408 of the Penal Code;

> (b)     One charge under s 417 of the Penal Code;

> (c)     One charge under s 477A of the Penal Code;

> (d)     Four charges under s 47(1)(c) CDSA and punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the same Act and

> (e)     eight charges under s 70(1)(a) of the Pawnbrokers Act 2015

> being taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing.

3       The Accused admitted to the facts in both the Statements of Fact _ie Exhibit PS1_ and _Exhibit PS2_ without qualification save for paragraph 38 of _Exhibit PS1_.

#### Newton hearing

4       As the Accused had disputed paragraph 38 of the Statement of Facts in _Exhibit PS1_, in particular the nature of the agreement relating to the transfer of 516,429 shares in Sin Lian Pawnshop Pte Ltd belonging to his parents, Tio Ai Chu and Lee Kim Boon to SK Properties Pte Ltd, I conducted a Newton hearing to determine this issue.

5       The crux of the matter was whether the transfer of his parents’ shares amounted to a full restitution of the monies the Accused had misappropriated from Sin Lian Pawnshop Pte Ltd. It was the Defence’s case that there was an oral agreement between the parties to use his parents’ shares in SLP to offset against the at least S$5,431,900 he had misappropriated.

6       After a careful consideration of the evidence as well as the written submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I ruled that the agreement between the Accused’s parents was a commercial decision and did not amount to a full restitution of the at least S$5,431,900 that the Accused had misappropriated from SLP.

7       On 31 May 2021, after a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, his plea in mitigation and in view of his overall criminality, I had sentenced him as follows:

8       As the Accused had been remanded since 16 June 2020, I ordered the aggregate imprisonment term of 14 years' imprisonment to take effect from his date of remand. His fine of $60,000 remains unpaid.

9       The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision filed his Notice of Appeal against his sentence on 4 June 2021. He is presently serving his sentence and his earliest date of release is on 17 January 2030.

10     Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

11     Sin Lian Pawnshop Pte Ltd (“**SLP**”) is a pawnshop in the business of offering secured loans to customers in exchange for the customers pledging valuable items which are used as collateral for the loan. SLP would keep records of the transactions and issue pawn tickets which reflected the customer’s name, the loan value, the monthly interest rate (pegged to a percentage of the loan had amount), a description of the pledged item, and the expiry date of the pawn ticket. Each pawn ticket had a six-month validity period. The customer has the option of renewing the pawn ticket by servicing the interest. The interest after one month was 1% of the loan amount but would increase to 1.5% of the loan amount if the interest was serviced after two months or more. Each renewal would result in a fresh pawn ticket issued for the same pledged item and be valid for another six months from the date of extension. If the customer failed to redeem his pledge by repaying the loan within the validity period of the pawn ticket, SLP was entitled to deal with the pledged item as it saw fit.

12     The Accused was the Managing Director of SLP. He first joined SLP as a valuer. He was thereafter promoted and was registered as a director in 2010. Subsequently, he became Managing Director of SLP.

13     At the material time, he was employed as a servant by SLP and was responsible for running the day-to-day operations of the pawnshop. He received a basic monthly salary of $4,500, monthly CPF contributions, as well as an allowance. His responsibilities included valuing luxury watches and jewellery and conducting daily checks on SLP’s cash float. In his capacity as a servant, he was entrusted with dominion over property belonging to SLP such as the funds in SLP’s bank account, its cash float, as well as the sales proceeds from the sale of SLP’s pledges such as watches and jewellery.

14     SLP maintained a corporate current account with United Overseas Bank (“**UOB**”) (account no. XXX) (“**SLP’s UOB account**”). Cheque withdrawals from SLP’s UOB account required at least two signatures by the authorised signatories to the UOB account. At the material time, there were three authorised signatories to the UOB account – the Accused, Lee Kim Boon (his father and Chairman of SLP at the time), and Soh Bong Seng (one of the directors of SLP at the time).

#### Facts relating to the charge of Criminal Breach of Trust As A Servant under s 408 Penal Code – DAC 910471 of 2020

15     In 2011, the shareholders of SLP set up a peripheral watch and jewellery business, Sin Lian Watch & Jewellery Pte Ltd, which was located within SLP’s premises and which would purchase unredeemed pledges from SLP. The Accused was placed in charge of this business, and he ran both businesses concurrently.

16     Sometime in 2013, the Accused wanted to buy over Sin Lian Watch & Jewellery Pte Ltd. To fund this purchase, sometime around June 2013, he made unauthorised cash cheque withdrawals from SLP’s UOB account amounting to S$350,000. He was able to do so as he had previously obtained Soh Bong Seng’s signatures on the blank cheques for the purpose of running SLP’s daily operations. He thus purchased and renamed Sin Lian Watch & Jewellery Pte Ltd as Prestige Watches & Jewellery Pte Ltd (“**Prestige**”). He was employed as a servant by Prestige and received a basic monthly salary and monthly CPF contributions. In his capacity as a servant, he was entrusted with dominion over the goods owned by Prestige, including its watches.

17     To cover up his dishonest misappropriation of the S$350,000 from SLP to fund his purchase of Prestige, the Accused balanced the deficit in SLP’s accounts by dishonestly misappropriating 30 watches from Prestige, valued at S$200,000, by pawning these 30 watches to SLP under a single pawn ticket (no. B/0713/01938) under one Leow Fan Siew’s name in July 2013. This gave the appearance that SLP had given a loan of S$200,000 to Leow Fan Siew, with 30 watches pledged as collateral. The Accused accounted for the remaining S$150,000 in cash by utilising the monies from SLP’s cash float.

18     From August 2013 to November 2013, the Accused renewed the pawn ticket backed by the 30 watches monthly, by servicing the monthly interest of 1% of the value of the pawn ticket using monies he misappropriated from SLP. Sometime on or around January 2014, he sold nine of the watches and redeemed part of the pawn ticket – he split the single pawn ticket valued at S$200,000 (which was backed by the 30 watches) into 21 pawn tickets amounting to S$150,000 in total, with each pawn ticket backed with one watch. He then sold the remaining 21 watches but continued servicing the monthly interest of the 1% of these 21 pawn tickets.

19     He continued to further dishonestly misappropriate monies from SLP using various methods, including:

> (a)     Making withdrawals from SLP’s UOB account via cash cheques and utilizing the monies for unauthorized purposes. The Accused admitted that that he had misappropriated about 90% of the cash cheque withdrawals he made;

> (b)     Pocketing the sales proceeds from the sale of watches belonging to SLP;

> (c)     Pocketing cash from SLP’s cash float, which included payments made by SLP’s customers for renewal of their pawn tickets or redemption of pledges.

20     To cover up his dishonest misappropriation, he created fake pawn tickets under Leow Fan Siew’s and Lee Wee Boon’s names to create the illusion that SLP had given out loans in exchange for pledges, when there were no such pledges in reality.

21     The Accused claimed that he utilised the misappropriated monies to, _inter alia_:

> (a)     Service the interest payments on the pawn tickets each month, failing which his actions would have been discovered as there were no pledges backing the tickets. The aggregate interest payments on all the fake pawn tickets between June 2013 and July 2018 amounted to approximately S$227,677.

> (b)     Gamble at the casinos. When he lost monies, he misappropriated further amounts to gamble again. The Accused’s transaction records from Marina Bay Sands Casino and Resort World Casino showed that the transaction flows were about S$3,876,000 and S$3,406,000 respectively between 2014 and 2018.

> (c)     Pay dividends to the shareholders of SLP, which was higher than the amount SLP ordinarily would have had to pay, as a result of the purportedly higher stock value of pledges in SLP artificially inflated due to the fake pawn tickets. The aggregate dividends paid to SLP’s stockholders between 2014 and 2017 was approximately S$1,539,508.00. As a result of his misappropriation from SLP, there were insufficient funds to pay dividends to the shareholders. He then utilized the fake pawn tickets he had created to obtain more money from UOB pursuant to the credit facility between UOB and SLP and dishonestly misappropriated the monies from SLP in order to make dividend payments to the shareholders to avoid raising their suspicions of the lack of funds in SLP due to the Accused’s misappropriation.

> (d)     The Accused also utilized the misappropriated monies for his personal expenses and for business expenses relating to his other business, Prestige, which was in the business of buying and selling watches.

22     To keep up with the mounting expenses, the Accused continued to dishonestly misappropriate further sums and then create more fake pawn tickets. He carried on in this manner until around July 2018. His actions went unnoticed as he was given full discretion and had oversight over the running of SLP. He was only required to report to the shareholders at the end of each year. For instance, he was given signed blank cheques by the other authorised signatory of SLP’s UOB account, Soh Bong Seng, in order to run SLP. Further, he was solely responsible for conducting the daily checks on SLP’s cash float, which ranged in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and pledges. Just before each annual audit, he would top up the shortfall in the cash float to avoid detection.

23     Every few of months between 2014 and 2018, the Accused would consolidate the fake pawn tickets. In other words, he would create a new pawn ticket representing the total sum of the earlier pawn tickets, which he would indicate as redeemed. By the time the police report was lodged, there were 35 fake consolidated pawn tickets with a total value of S$5,431,900. The Accused admitted that this sum represented the value of money he had dishonestly misappropriated from SLP at the material time.

24     From June 2013 to July 2018, in Singapore, the Accused, being employed as a servant, _to wit_, an employee of SLP, and being entrusted in such capacity with dominion over property belonging to SLP, _ie_ cash amounting to at least S$5,431,900, had committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property by dishonestly misappropriating it on multiple occasions during the said period, which taken together amount to a course of conduct, and had committed an offence punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“**PC**”) which charge was amalgamated under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)(“**CPC**”).

#### Facts relating to the charge of Falsification of Accounts under s 477A Penal Code – DAC 910476 of 2020

25     To cover up his misappropriation from SLP, the Accused created false entries in its Pawnshop Management System – an electronic database used to keep track of the pawn transactions – in order to create fake pawn tickets to give the illusion that SLP had pledges such as diamonds or gold worth the amount stated in the pawn tickets. His intention was to create the illusion that SLP had given out cash equivalent to the amount reflected in the pawn tickets to the pawn ticket holders in exchange for the pledge reflected in the pawn tickets. In reality, he had misappropriated the cash from SLP, and the pledges described in the pawn tickets were non-existent.

26     At the same time, the Accused intended for the creation of the fake pawn tickets to reflect an inflated total stock value of pledges in SLP. The inflated total stock value of pledges would deceive UOB and dishonestly induce UOB to implement a higher line of credit to SLP’s UOB account than it otherwise would have had it known the true total stock value of pledges in SLP.

27     To create the false entries, the Accused utilised the personal particulars of Leow Fan Siew and Lee Wee Boon as the purported pawners in relation to the fake pawn tickets. He deliberately chose to create the fake pawn tickets under Leow Fan Siew’s name to avoid suspicion from the auditor given his prior history in pawning items of large value with SLP. Lee Wee Boon is his uncle and he was aware of his personal particulars, including his NRIC number, because he had previously helped his uncle to apply for CPF contributions.

28     The Accused also created further false entries in the Pawnshop Management System to renew the fake pawn tickets when he serviced the monthly interest. In total, the accused created at least 1,052 false entries in the Pawnshop Management System. There were at least 188 false entries under Leow Fan Siew’s name and at least 864 false entries under Lee Wee Boon’s name[^1]. At all material times, Leow Fan Siew and Lee Wee Boon were not aware that their names and NRIC numbers were utilised in the creation of the fake pawn tickets.

29     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused, on not less than 864 occasions between October 2014 and July 2018, in Singapore, being a servant, _to wit_, an employee of SLP, had embarked on a course of conduct to falsify accounts, by wilfully and with intent to defraud, made false entries in an electronic record (Pawnshop Management System) in the possession of SLP, by recording that Lee Wee Boon had pledged a certain sum to SLP on a certain date, which he knew to be false, and had committed an offence punishable under s 477A PC, which charge was amalgamated under s 124(4) CPC.

#### Facts relating to the charge of Cheating and Dishonestly Inducing Delivery of Property under s 420 Penal Code – DAC 910478 of 2020

30     At the end of each month during the material period, the Accused had to generate SLP’s Monthly Returns of Pawnbroking Business (“**the monthly returns**”), which would reflect SLP’s total stock value of pledges for that month. As a result of the fake pawn tickets which the accused created, the monthly returns reflected an inflated total stock value of pledges.

31     Pursuant to a credit facility arrangement between UOB and SLP, UOB would implement a line of credit up to 85% of the total stock value of pledges declared by SLP in its monthly returns for the preceding month. For instance, in determining the line of credit to extend to SLP for January 2014, UOB would rely on the monthly returns reflecting the total stock value of pledges in SLP in December 2013, which would be submitted to UOB by the accused via fax in early January 2014. If, for instance, the monthly returns reflected that SLP had a total stock value of pledges of $10,000,000 at the end of December 2013, UOB would allow SLP to draw down on its overdraft facility up to $8,500,000.

32     Between February 2014 and April 2018, the Accused submitted monthly returns to UOB knowing that the total stock value of pledges at SLP of the preceding month was false due to the fake pawn tickets he had created. As a result, UOB extended a line of credit that was higher than it otherwise would have permitted based on the actual stock value of pledges in SLP in the preceding month. However, the Accused kept the overdraft amount within the limit that UOB would have issued based on the actual (_ie_ non-inflated) stock value of pledges in the monthly returns. Nonetheless, UOB would not have continued with the credit facility arrangement had it known that the Accused had submitted false information in SLP’s monthly returns.

33     Between May and August 2018, the Accused submitted monthly returns to UOB knowing that the total stock value of pledges at SLP of the preceding month was false due to the fake pawn tickets he had created. Believing the monthly returns to be true, UOB was dishonestly induced to disburse at least S$1,076,339 to SLP during this period. The overdraft amount incurred by the accused who exercised sole control of SLP’s UOB account exceeded the implemented line limit UOB would ordinarily have extended to SLP based on the actual stock value of pledges. The Accused’s actions thereby exposed UOB to significant risk in the event of a default[^2]. The Accused had dishonestly misappropriated most of the funds disbursed by UOB by making unauthorised withdrawals from SLP’s UOB account.

34     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused, on not less than 4 occasions sometime between May and August 2018, had embarked on a course of conduct to cheat UOB, when he deceived UOB into believing the stock value of pledges in SLP for the preceding month in the said period was as declared in SLP’s Monthly Return on Pawnbroking Business for May to August 2018, which he knew that to be false, and he thereby dishonestly induced UOB to deliver at least S$1,076,339 to SLP, and he had committed an offence punishable under Section 420 PC, which charge was amalgamated under Section 124(4) CPC.

#### Facts relating to the charge of Using Benefits of Criminal Conduct under s 47(1)(c) punishable under s 47(6)(a) Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act – DAC 910483 of 2020

35     Sometime in April 2018, the Accused utilised the casino winnings he had obtained after gambling monies he dishonestly misappropriated from SLP to make a down-payment of S$20,000 for the purchase of a Mercedes Benz car. The sum of S$20,000 indirectly represented his benefits from criminal conduct.

36     On or around 12 May 2018, the Accused dishonestly misappropriated S$57,000 from SLP. He deposited this sum into his personal POSB account no. XXX. He then obtained a Cashier’s Order of S$57,005.55 and utilised this for the balance down-payment of the Mercedes Benz car. Out of the sum of S$57,005.55, the sum of S$57,000 directly represented his benefits from criminal conduct.

37     By virtue of the foregoing, between April and May 2018, the Accused had used property, which in whole directly and indirectly represents his benefits from criminal conduct, _to wit_, criminal breach of trust as a servant, to make a down-payment of S$77,000 for the purchase of a Mercedes Benz car, and he had thereby committed an offence under s 47(1)(c) CDSA which offence is punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the CDSA.

##### CONCLUSION

38     Between 2014 and 2017, the audits conducted on SLP’s accounts did not manage to uncover any irregularities. Sometime in April 2018, SLP’s accounts for the financial year which ended on 31 December 2017 were audited. When further checks were conducted due to the higher purported revenue for that financial year, the audit team found some discrepancies in the accounts as there were insufficient supporting documents. The audit team asked the Accused to provide the supporting documents, and he delayed providing these documents. Sometime in August 2018, the Accused was discovered to have created false pawn tickets. When confronted during a shareholders’ meeting on 11 August 2018, the Accused admitted to the above offences.

39     After the discovery of the offences, SK Properties Pte Ltd (“**SK**”), an existing investor in SLP, decided to attempt to acquire SLP at a loss in order to keep the business going by restoring UOB’s trust and confidence in SLP. At the time, the amount owed from SLP to UOB was about $10 million and SLP was at significant risk of default since its liabilities far exceeded its assets. An auditor’s report produced later reflected that SLP’s Net Asset Value was at negative equity (about negative $2.8 million) by the end of Financial Year ending 31 December 2018.

40     At that time, the Accused’s parents, Tio Ai Chu and Lee Kim Boon, owned 258,215 and 258,214 ordinary shares respectively, making it a total of 516,429 shares in SLP (21.43% of the total issued shares) at the material time. Both of them accepted SK’s offer and decided to transfer all their shares to SK in consideration of the sum of S$25,821.40 and S$25,821.50 respectively. The transfers were duly effected on 2 October 2018. SK decided to buy over the Accused’s parents’ shares at about $0.10 per share (below their initial investment at S$1 per share) at a fair value given SLP’s negative equity. SK did not benefit financially from the purchase of the shares.

41     SK then successfully acquired all the remaining shares in SLP and negotiated a settlement with UOB to restructure the loan, whilst standing as guarantor, which permitted SLP’s business to continue. To date, the Accused has not made any restitution to SLP.

42     The Police seized the following items, total value of about S$34,593.10, which were proceeds from the Accused’s criminal conduct:

> (a)     A Glashutte watch for men valued at S$12,000, the subject matter of the 19th Charge (DAC-910479-2020);

> (b)     A Locman watch for ladies valued at S$1,300, the subject matter of the 20th Charge (DAC 910480 of 2020);

> (c)     A Chopard watch for ladies valued at S$5,000, the subject matter of the 21st Charge (DAC 910481of 2020);

> (d)     An IWC watch for men valued at S$11,000, the subject matter of the 22nd Charge (DAC 910482 of 2020); and

> (e)     A sum of S$5,293.10, including accrued interest, (after satisfying the outstanding balance owed to UOB under the hire purchase agreement), being the balance sales proceeds of the Mercedes Benz, the subject matter of the 23rd Charge (DAC 910483 of 2020).

43     The Police also seized the following items during investigations:

> (a)     A Cartier watch for ladies valued at S$6,000;

> (b)     A clear colourless stone; and

> (c)     Celine Dion passport covers.

#### Facts relating to the four charges of Proving False Information to the Registrar under s 70(1)(a) of Pawnbrokers Act 2015 – MSC 901024 of 2020 to MSC 901027 of 2020

44     The Accused was a director of SLP (“the licensee”) which has been granted licences for pawnbroking by the Registrar of Pawnbrokers since 28 November 2005.

45     The Accused, whilst being a director of the licensee, was in charge of compiling and submitting, to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers on behalf of the licensee, monthly statements which provided information on the licensee’s transactions. Under s 24(1)(b) of the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 (“**the Act**”), a licensee must submit to the Registrar, at such intervals and in such form and manner as the Registrar may require, statements containing such particulars as may be prescribed in relation to its transactions.

46     Under s 70(1)(a) of the Act, a person must not provide to the Registrar, for the purposes of this Act, any information that the person knows or has reason to believe is materially false or misleading. Under s 70(2) of the said Act, a person who contravenes subsection (1)(a) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $40,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

#### FACTS RELATING TO MSC 901024 of 2020

47     Investigations revealed that, on 14 May 2018, the licensee, through the Accused, pursuant to s 24(1)(b) of the Act, submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, a statement containing particulars in relation to its transactions for the month of April 2018.

48     Investigations further revealed that in the said statement of transactions for April 2018, the Accused provided information which included 30 pawn items which were allegedly pawned by one Lee Wee Boon. Subsequently, during the course of investigations, he admitted that Lee Wee Boon is his uncle and that he used the latter’s particulars, without his knowledge, to generate 30 fictitious pawn tickets in April 2018, which did not have any pledges. The Accused then included transaction values relating to these 30 fictitious pawn tickets in the statement of transactions submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for April 2018[^3].

#### FACTS RELATING TO MSC 901025 of 2020

49     Investigations revealed that, on 3 June 2018, the licensee, through the Accused, pursuant to s 24(1)(b) of the Act, submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, a statement containing particulars in relation to its transactions for the month of May 2018.

50     Investigations further revealed that in the said statement of transactions for May 2018, the Accused provided information which included 29 pawn items which were allegedly pawned by his uncle, Lee Wee Boon.

51     Subsequently, during the course of investigations, the Accused admitted that he used Lee Wee Boon’s particulars, without his knowledge, to generate 29 fictitious pawn tickets in May 2018, which did not have any pledges. The Accused then included transaction values relating to these 29 fictitious pawn tickets[^4] in the statement of transactions submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for May 2018.

52     The Accused, by providing the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, for the purposes of the Act, information in the statement of transactions for the month of May 2018 in respect of the 29 fictitious pawn transactions in relation to the total number of pledges received, the total number of loans granted and the total stock of pledges held by the licensee for the month of May 2018, which he knew were materially false, has committed an offence under s 70(2) read with section 70(1)(a) of the Pawnbrokers Act.

#### FACTS RELATING TO MSC 901026 of 2020

53     Investigations revealed that, on 4 July 2018, the licensee, through the Accused, pursuant to s 24(1)(b) of the Act, submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, a statement containing particulars in relation to its transactions for the month of June 2018. Investigations further revealed that in the said statement of transactions for June 2018, the Accused provided information which included 32 pawn items which were allegedly pawned by his uncle, Lee Wee Boon.

54     Subsequently, during the course of investigations, the Accused admitted that he used Lee Wee Boon’s particulars, without his knowledge, to generate 32 fictitious pawn tickets in June 2018, which did not have any pledges. The Accused then included transaction values relating to these 32 fictitious pawn tickets[^5] in the statement of transactions submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for June 2018.

55     The Accused, by providing the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, for the purposes of the Act, information in the statement of transactions for the month of June 2018 in respect of the 32 fictitious pawn transactions in relation to the total number of pledges received, the total number of loans granted and the total stock of pledges held by the licensee for the month of June 2018, which he knew were materially false, has committed an offence under s 70(2) read with s 70(1)(a) of the Pawnbrokers Act.

#### FACTS RELATING TO MSC 901027 of 2020

56     Investigations revealed that, on 1 August 2018, the licensee, through the Accused, pursuant to s 24(1)(b) of the Act, submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, a statement containing particulars in relation to its transactions for the month of July 2018.

57     Investigations further revealed that in the said statement of transactions for July 2018, the Accused provided information which included 35 pawn items which were allegedly pawned by his uncle, Lee Wee Boon.

58     Subsequently, during the course of investigations, the Accused admitted that he used Lee Wee Boon’s particulars, without his knowledge, to generate 35 fictitious pawn tickets in July 2018, which did not have any pledges. The Accused then included transaction values relating to these 35 fictitious pawn tickets[^6] in the statement of transactions submitted to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for July 2018.

59     The Accused by providing the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, for the purposes of the Act, information in the statement of transactions for the month of July 2018 in respect of the 35 fictitious pawn transactions in relation to the total number of pledges received, the total number of loans granted and the total stock of pledges held by the licensee for the month of July 2018, which he knew were materially false, has committed an offence under s 70(2) read with s 70(1)(a) of the Pawnbrokers Act.

60     During investigations, the Accused stated that he had fabricated the pawn transactions in order to inflate the total amount of pledges received for the respective months in order to conceal his earlier dishonest misappropriation of the licensee’s funds as well as to dishonestly induce the bank to extend a higher loan to the licensee when required, which funds he also dishonestly misappropriated.

### Antecedents

66     The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

67     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 16 years’ imprisonment and $60,000 fine. The breakdown of the individual sentences sought by the Prosecution were as follows:

> (a)     For the amalgamated charge under s 408 PC read with s 124(4) CPC in DAC 910471 of 2020, at least ten years’ imprisonment and the sentence is to run consecutively;

### Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

68     In contrast, the Defence sought an aggregate sentence of no more than ten years’ imprisonment for the proceeded charges. The Defence had also argued that the actual amount the Accused had misappropriated was between $3.5 million to $3.6 million while a substantial part were ‘paper interest’ of the pawn tickets which were not taken by the Accused.

## My decision on sentence

69     In the present case, I found that the Accused had misappropriated at least S$5.4 million and used significant portions of his criminal proceeds to gamble, buy luxury goods and for his personal expenses. As he had committed serious offences with both offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating features, this clearly attracted the principle of deterrence.

70     I agreed with the Prosecution that the severity of the offences he committed is evident not only in the significant amounts and valuable property he had misappropriated from multiple victims between 2013 to 2018 but also the complexity of the means he had employed to do so.

## Aggravating factors

### Offence-specific aggravating factors

#### A   Blatant abuse of the trust and authority reposed in him

71     As the High Court observed in _Pittis Stavros v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 181</span> at \[69\], “\[it\] is a sensible proposition that the greater the trust reposed in an offender that is subsequently betrayed, the higher the sentence ought to be”.

72     I agreed with the Prosecution that the stakeholders of SLP reposed a high level of trust in the Accused. He held the position of the Managing Director and the running of SLP was entirely left to him. The high level of trust reposed in him was further demonstrated by the fact that he was given pre-signed blank cheques to SLP’s UOB account by Soh Boon Seng, the account’s other signatory, which were meant for the operations of SLP. However, the Accused utilised these cheques to make withdrawals and misappropriated about 90% of these withdrawals from SLP’s funds by utilising the monies for unauthorised purposes.

73     I noted that he was also solely responsible for conducting daily checks on SLP’s cash float, which ranged in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and SLP’s pledges. However, he pocketed cash from SLP’s cash float and proceeds from the sale of the pledges. During the annual audit of the cash float, he topped up the shortfall in the cash float from other funds to avoid detection. By virtue of his trusted position, the Accused knew the inner workings of SLP’s mechanisms and processes and exploited them to his advantage over the years.

#### B   Significant degree of premeditation

74     It is trite that when an accused commits an offence with deliberation, it is regarded as an aggravating factor: _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“**_Payagala_**”) at \[39\] to \[41\]. In the same case, the High Court at \[42\], had also observed that “a sophisticated offence replete with carefully-orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid detection is an aggravating factor in sentencing”.

75     The complexity of the scheme the Accused employed _ie_ by abusing the trust and authority reposed in him as Managing Director of SLP, cheating a financial institution into extending credit to SLP and into disbursing him over S$1 million over a four months and concealing his tracks meticulously over five years demonstrated a significant degree of premeditation as well as a high level of criminality.

76     He took steps to conceal these losses from the company by falsifying SLP’s records through the creation of fake pawn tickets. He utilised these fake pawn tickets to cheat UOB and misappropriated a significant portion of the funds disbursed to SLP under its credit facility arrangement with the bank. He also laundered the monies he misappropriated to purchase luxury watches and a Mercedes Benz car.

77     I was mindful that during his offending period, the Accused created at least 1,052 false entries by creating fake pawn tickets or renewing the fake pawn tickets. He deliberately chose to create the fake pawn tickets under Leow Fan Siew’s and Lee Wee Boon’s names because he thought that the fake pawn tickets in their names would not arise suspicion from the auditors given their prior history in pawning items of large value with SLP. In order to avoid raising the suspicion of SLP’s shareholders, the Accused allocated a portion of misappropriated funds from SLP to make dividend payments to the shareholders.

78     The Accused also used the fake pawn tickets to cheat UOB in relation to SLP’s credit facility arrangement over an extended period. I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s creation of the fake pawn tickets not only assisted him to cover-up his initial instances of misappropriation. It gave him the opportunity to misappropriate further amounts as his deception on the bank gave him access to a steady and significant stream of funds through SLP’s corporate account.

#### C   Accused’s criminal acts were committed over a lengthy period

79     As highlighted by the Prosecution, the Accused’s committed his brazen acts of misappropriation of at least S$5.4 million from SLP for over half a decade from June 2013 until about July 2018, when his offences were finally uncovered during an audit of SLP’s accounts.

80     I noted that between February 2014 and April 2018, the Accused deliberately kept SLP’s overdraft amount within the limit that the bank would have issued based on the actual (_i.e._ non-inflated) stock value of pledges in the monthly returns between February 2014 and April 2018. UOB was thus dishonestly induced by his deception to continue to maintain credit facility arrangement with SLP, which they would not otherwise have done had they discovered the false declaration of monthly returns. This enabled the Accused continued access to a large pool of funds throughout the years, from which he continuously misappropriated.

81     Between May 2018 and August 2018, he submitted the inflated monthly returns to the bank despite knowing that nearly half of the declared total stock value of pledges in the preceding month was inflated as a result of the fake pawn tickets he had created. This resulted in UOB significantly increasing the limit of the line of credit by nearly S$3 million to S$4 million, which gave the Accused access to a much larger pool of monies. Indeed, during this period UOB was being dishonestly induced to disburse at least S$1 million to SLP, most of which the Accused misappropriated.

82     I agreed with the Prosecution that in light of his deliberate and sustained course of conduct over an extended period of time, the Accused should not be treated as a first-time offender, even if he has no antecedents: _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[17\]. Further, the long period of offending is a separate aggravating factor. As observed by the High Court in _Payagala_ at \[43\]:

>     “The length of time a particular scam or offence has gone undetected would be yet another relevant sentencing consideration in sentencing. … The relevance of this as a sentencing consideration may also be tied to the recalcitrance of the offender. In the case of a hardened offender, he would have repeatedly committed a pattern of offences without any sign or acknowledgement or contrition or remorse. The longer the period of time over which the offences have been committed, the more irrefutable it is that the offender manifests the qualities of a habitual offender. Specific deterrence is incontrovertibly an important sentencing consideration in such cases.”

#### D   Significant harm caused to multiple victims

83     In offences such as criminal breach of trust and cheating, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated or cheated, the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court. Further, the High Court in _Payagala_ at \[49\] had also noted that the harm may sometimes “be intangible when it assumes the form of inconvenience, embarrassment, loss of reputation, time and costs expended in investigations as well as time, research, effort and costs involved in enhancing security measures”.

84     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused caused significant financial harm and intangible damage to multiple victims. Throughout the offending period, he misappropriated a staggering amount of at least S$5,431,900 from SLP. Only a fraction of this amount, about S$34,593.10, was recovered during investigations in the form of luxury watches and the proceeds from the sale of the Accused’s car and no restitution has been made to SLP.

85     SLP was a profitable pawnshop with over S$2 million in share capital before the Accused committed these offences. It also had a credit facility arrangement with UOB. His criminal conduct left SLP insolvent and on the brink of collapse by the time the offences were discovered years later. It also damaged UOB’s trust and confidence in SLP. Had the bank proceeded to wind-up SLP over its debts, not only would SLP’s shareholders have lost the value of their initial investments, the public’s trust and confidence in the pawnbroking industry and the financial security of their pledged items would be eroded.

86     His other victims included Prestige which suffered a loss of S$200,000 when he misappropriated 30 luxury watches in June 2013 and had used them as collateral. No restitution was made by the Accused to Prestige.

87     The Accused’s sustained deception on UOB between February 2014 and August 2018 resulted in the bank maintaining the credit facility arrangement with SLP, which they would not otherwise have done had they discovered the false declaration of monthly returns. This enabled him to continue to draw down on SLP’s overdraft facility, which amounts increased over time. Notably, the bank was dishonestly induced to disbursing at least S$1 million to SLP, most of which the Accused misappropriated. His actions thereby exposed the bank to significant risk in the event of a default. I was mindful that the total outstanding amount owed to UOB in the period after the offences stood at about S$10 million whilst SLP had negative equity and little prospects of repaying the loan.

88     Offences against financial institutions are aggravating because such conduct adversely affect the integrity of Singapore’s financial system. As the High Court noted in _Payagala_ at \[88\]:

>     “An enormous amount of time, money and effort is unnecessarily expended by financial institutions and authorities in combating such fraud. Such offences, if left unchecked, would be akin to a slow drip of a subtle but potent poison that will inexorably and irremediably damage Singapore’s standing both as a financial hub as well as a preferred centre of commerce.”

### Offender-specific factors

#### E   Greed and personal benefit

89     Being motivated by greed in the commission of the offences is recognised as an aggravating factor. As the High Court observed in _Zhao Zhipeng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 879</span> at \[37\], “\[t\]he law has always recognised that motive affects the degree of an offender’s culpability for sentencing purposes. Persons who act out of pure self-interest and greed will rarely be treated with much sympathy”.

90     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused leveraged on his position at SLP to enrich himself. It was clear from his conduct between June 2013 and July 2018 that he treated SLP’s funds as his own. He utilised the money for his personal expenses and for business expenses relating to his other business, Prestige. He also laundered the monies by purchasing luxury watches and making a down-payment for his Mercedes Benz car.

91     It was undisputed that the Accused was a compulsive gambler. Whilst the exact amount of misappropriated funds used to gamble is unknown, the accused’s transaction records from Marina Bay Sands Casino and Resort World Casino showed that between 2014 and 2018, he had gambled exorbitant sums of S$3,876,000 and S$3,406,000 in the two casinos respectively.

#### F   Culpability enhanced by the TIC charges

92     The Accused had consented to 15 of the remaining charges to be taken into consideration. The effect of doing so is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in respect of the proceeded charges, especially where they are similar in nature to the proceeded charges: _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[38\].

93     As the charges taken into consideration were similar in nature to the proceeded charges, I agreed with the Prosecution that it ought to enhance the Accused’s individual sentences in respect of the proceeded charges.

#### G   Evidence of lack of remorse

94     In his written mitigation, the Defence had submitted that he was remorseful for his wrongdoing and the loss he had caused to SLP and his parents. He had not posted bail (of $250,000) to show his remorse and repentance. Nevertheless, despite admitting that the total value of the 35 consolidated pawn tickets was $5,431,900 as set out in paragraph 16 of _Exhibit PS1_, his Counsel had argued in his plea in mitigation that the actual amount the Accused had misappropriated was between $3.5 million to $3.6 million while a substantial part were ‘paper interest’ of the pawn tickets which were not taken by the Accused.

95     With respect, I disagreed with the Defence and instead agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had to service the interest payments to avoid detection. In fact, he had also paid out higher dividends in order to avoid suspicion by SLP’s shareholders. I further agreed that although he did not receive the monies for himself, the payments were made to his benefit so that he could perpetuate his criminal scheme. To my mind, this was evidence of his lack of remorse for his actions.

96     The Defence had also sought to reduce the level of harm caused by the Accused in the present case by arguing that there was an oral agreement between the parties to use his parents’ shares (which amounted to only 21.43% of total issued shares in SLP) to offset against the at least S$5,431,900 he had misappropriated. A Newton hearing had to be conducted over two days to resolve this issue. To my mind such a contention was without merit and was another instance of his lack of remorse for his actions.

## Mitigating factors

97     In the present case, as the Accused had pleaded guilty to the proceeded eight charges and had consented to his remaining charges to be taken into consideration, I had accorded some weight to his plea of guilt.

98     As it was undisputed that the Accused had co-operated with the authorities upon his arrest, I had taken this into account in my consideration of the appropriate sentence.

99     I now turn to the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the proceeded charges.

### DAC 910471 of 2020 – amalgamated charge under s 408 PC

100    The Prosecution had submitted that a sentence of at least 12 years’ imprisonment was warranted for the amalgamated s 408 PC charge, which maximum punishment is 15 years’ imprisonment. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused’s conduct fell within the upper range of the sentencing spectrum bearing in mind all the aggravating factors present in this case.

101    The Prosecution had relied on the case of _PP v Yeo Kay Keng Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 425</span> (“**Matthew Yeo**”) in support of its sentencing position. In that case, the untraced offender, an Accounts Manager at a telco company, misappropriated handsets to his own benefit over a 2.5-year period. He caused a loss of about $2 million to the company and no restitution was made. A sum of $800,000 was nonetheless recovered by the police. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for the s 408 PC charge and one year’s imprisonment for the money-laundering charge, giving rise to a global sentence of six years’ imprisonment. The offender’s appeal against sentence lapsed.

102    It was the Prosecution’s case that the proposed sentence of at least 12 years’ imprisonment was amply justified on the basis that the Accused was in a position of a higher level of trust as Managing Director of SLP, his period of offending was nearly double, and the sum misappropriated involved was more than double. Further, only a fraction (about S$36,000) was recovered in the present case and the financial consequences caused to SLP were severe as the accused’s actions had left SLP insolvent and on the brink of being wound-up. As the present charge is one of the more serious sentences which ought to run consecutively, after accounting for the totality principle, it was proposed that his sentence should be recalibrated to ten years’ imprisonment.

103    In the present case I was of the view that this was a case which involves severe harm and high degree of culpability. While I agreed that the sentence should be within the upper range of the maximum penalty, in my view an appropriate starting point for this offence is ten years’ imprisonment _ie_ 2/3 of the maximum range instead of the 12 years’ sought by the Prosecution. A sentence of 12 years’ would have been more appropriate if the Accused had claimed trial. A downward calibration of two years would then have to be made to account for the mitigating factors namely, his plea of guilt, his lack of antecedents as well as cooperation with the authorities. His plea of guilt had saved the court’s time and resources in what would otherwise have been a lengthy trial due to the complexity of this case. Furthermore, this was one of the more serious sentences that ought to run consecutively.

104    All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment was appropriate, and reflective of the Accused’s culpability, the harm caused and the gravity of the offence. Such a sentence would also be sufficiently deterrent, given the substantial sum involved and that the offence was committed out of his greed and personal benefit.

### DAC 910476 of 2020 - the amalgamated charge under s 477A PC

105    The Prosecution had submitted that a sentence of at least three years’ imprisonment was warranted for the amalgamated s 477A PC charge. The Accused had blatantly falsified not less than 864 entries in SLP’s Pawnshop Management System by creating or renewing fake pawn tickets using his uncle’s name with the intent of avoiding detection of his misappropriation (the subject of the proceeded amalgamated charge). Including the charge which was taken into consideration, he created no less than 1,052 entries over a five-year period.

106    The Prosecution had relied on the High Court decision in _Tan Puay Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 390</span> which identified four factors in determining the relevant sentence for offences under s 477A PC:

> (a)     Whether there was deviousness or surreptitious planning in commission of the offences;

> (b)     Whether the falsifications were committed for personal gain;

> (c)     Whether there was an abuse of trust; and

> (d)     The amount involved in the falsifications.

107    It was the Prosecution’s case that the first three factors were evidently present, as elaborated above. In addition, the falsifications had effectively allowed the Accused to siphon over at least S$5.4 million over more than half a decade by concealing the losses to avoid detection.

108    As evident from precedent cases, _PP v Kwa Tian Hwa_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 119</span> and _PP v Lim Ai Wah_ and _Thomas Philip Doehrman_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 249</span>, where the amounts involved in the falsifications involve millions of dollars, lengthy custodial terms of between 18 months and 30 months’ imprisonment have been imposed.

109    It was the Prosecution’s case that considering the aggravating factors present and bearing in mind that the s 477A PC charge was an amalgamated charge for offences committed between 2013 and 2018, a custodial term of at least three years’ imprisonment was justified.

110    In the present case I was guided by the High Court in _Tan Puay Boon v PP_ as well as the two precedent cases in my determination of the appropriate sentence. In view of the degree of culpability and the level of harm caused, I agreed with the Prosecution that as the amounts involved in the falsifications was at least S$5.4 million a custodial term of three years’ imprisonment was justified and supportable based on the precedents provided.

111    All things considered, such a sentence of three years’ imprisonment was appropriate, and reflective of the Accused’s culpability, the harm caused and the gravity of the offence. Such a sentence would also be sufficiently deterrent, given the substantial sum involved and that the offence was committed over more than half a decade by concealing the losses to avoid detection.

### DAC 910478 of 2020 - the amalgamated charge under s 420 PC

112    The Prosecution had submitted that a sentence of at least eight years’ imprisonment out of the maximum punishment of ten years was warranted for the amalgamated charge under s 420 PC read with s 124(4) CPC.

113    It was submitted that the sentence was warranted based on the Accused’s sustained deception on UOB, a financial institution, between February 2014 and August 2018. This deception gave the Accused continued access to a large and steady stream of funds which he misappropriated. In particular, UOB disbursed at least S$1 million to SLP between May and August 2018, most of which the Accused misappropriated. This placed UOB at significant financial risk in the event of a default by SLP because the accused undermined UOB’s contractual safeguard of disbursing up to 85% of the value of pledges in SLP by virtue of his deception. Further, SLP faced a real risk of default given that its liabilities far exceeded its assets because of the Accused’s offences. It was further submitted that it was only fortuitous that SK Properties stepped in to restore UOB’s and the public’s trust and confidence in the pawnbroking industry.

114    In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution relied on _PP v Neo Aileen_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 315</span> at \[5\]. In that case, the court observed that the sentencing range for s 420 PC where the amounts involved were S$830,000 to S$1.3 million was between 6 to 7.5 years imprisonment. The case involved an untraced offender who cheated two friends into handing over two cheques of USD500,000 each (totalling approximately S$1.2 million) purportedly for foreign currency exchange, the court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 78 months’ imprisonment (6.5 years’ imprisonment). No restitution was made by the offender, and her appeal against sentence was withdrawn.

115    It was the Prosecution’s case that the proposed sentence of at least eight years’ imprisonment was amply justified bearing in mind the similar amounts cheated and the aggravating features, namely, the prolonged offending period (including the charge under amalgamated charge under s 417 PC taken into consideration) and the fact that the victim is a financial institution. The Accused has likewise made no restitution. As the present charge is one of the more serious sentences which ought to run consecutively, after accounting for the totality principle, it was proposed that his sentence should be recalibrated to at least six years’ imprisonment.

116    In support of its position, the Prosecution had also referred to _PP v Gene Chong Soon Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 117</span>(“**Gene Chong**”). The untraced offender had cheated and siphoned about S$3.2 million from his company over an 8-year period as the finance manager. He had repeatedly masked his tracks by making false entries in the company’s ledgers and his misdeeds were only recovered when he resigned. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to 33 months’ imprisonment per charge with four ordered to run consecutively for a global term of 11 years’ imprisonment. The sentence was upheld on appeal.

117    I noted in that _Gene Chong_ at \[26\], the District Judge had adapted the harm-culpability sentencing framework _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 121</span> (“**Logachev**”) to utilise the full range of possible sentences that can be imposed for an offence under s 420 PC.

118    I agreed with the harm-culpability sentencing framework in _Gene Chong_ and adopted the approach in the present case as it provided a systematic way by which sentences for offences under s 420 PC can be comprehensively considered.

119    As I was of the view that this was a case which involves severe harm and high degree of culpability, a sentence of six years’ imprisonment was justified and supportable based on the precedents provided. I had considered the fact that UOB was dishonestly induced to deliver $1,076,339 and based on the precedents cited by the Prosecution, an appropriate starting point for this offence would have been approximately 6.5 years’ imprisonment _ie_ 2/3 of the maximum range ten years’ imprisonment. A downward calibration would then have to be made to account for the mitigating factors namely, his plea of guilt, his lack of antecedents as well as cooperation with the authorities. His plea of guilt had saved the court’s time and resources in what would otherwise have been a lengthy trial due to the complexity of this case.

120    All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of six years’ imprisonment was appropriate, and reflective of the Accused’s culpability, the harm caused and the gravity of the offence. Such a sentence would also be sufficiently deterrent, given the amount involved and that the offence was committed out of his greed and personal benefit.

### DAC 910483 of 2020 – the charge under s 47(1)(c) CDSA

121    The Prosecution had submitted that a sentence of at least one year’s imprisonment is warranted for the charge under s 47(1)(c) CDSA. The Accused used the benefits from criminal conduct to make a down-payment of S$77,000 towards a Mercedes Benz car, yet another clear signal that he was wantonly abusing his position for his personal gain. There were four further money-laundering charges for converting a total of S$40,000 to buy luxury watches which have taken into consideration for sentencing.

122    The Prosecution had sought at least one year’s imprisonment for this charge and relied on _Matthew Yeo’s case_ (referred to earlier at \[101\] above) and _PP v Yak Puay Khim_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 85</span> (“**Yak Puay Khim**”). In _Mathew Yeo_’s case, in respect of the s 47(1)(b) CDSA charge, the offender had transferred S$58,092 (HK$319,000) from his Standard Chartered Xtrasaver account to a Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited account in Hong Kong belonging to one Yang Chi Kit as part-payment for the purchase of two luxury watches. He was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for this charge.

123    In _Yak Puay Khim_’s case, the offender was an accounts clerk for four companies run by her family members. Between 2007 to 2011, she forged a total of 93 cheques involving $4,798,017.02 to obtain unauthorised payments for her personal benefit. The accused forged the signatures of Yak Thye Peng (her uncle) and Yak Eng Siong, directors of the companies, on the cheques to obtain payments for her personal benefit. In particular, for the charges under s 47(1)(c), she had used the monies she obtained from the unauthorised cheque payments to purchase properties. The amounts involved in the CDSA charges ranged from $70,950 to $266,273.67. For the s 47(1)(c) CDSA charges involving $70,950 to $129,532.32, she was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.

124    In the present case I was guided by the two precedent cases in my determination of the appropriate sentence. In view of the degree of culpability and the level of harm caused as set out at \[121\] above, I agreed with the Prosecution that a custodial term of one year’s imprisonment was justified and supportable based on the precedents provided.

### MSC 901024 of 2020 to MSC 901027 of 2020 - the charges under s 70(1)(a) Pawnbrokers Act

125    The Prosecution had submitted for a fine of at least $15,000 to be imposed for each of the four charges of providing false information to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, giving rise to a global fine of $60,000. As there were no sentencing precedents in respect of the present offence, the Prosecution had relied on the sentences imposed for offences under s 24(7)(a) and s 25(4) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) for knowingly furnishing false information to the Registrar of Moneylenders as a comparative basis. The prescribed penalty for such offences is a fine not exceeding $30,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. It was submitted fines ranging from $8,000 to $15,000 have been imposed for such offences.

126    In the present case, the Accused, was a director of the licensee _ie_ SLP and was in charge of compiling and submitting the statement of transactions to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers, on behalf of the licensee. He had fabricated the pawn transactions in order to inflate the total amount of pledges received for the respective months in order to conceal his earlier dishonest misappropriation of the licensee’s funds as well as to dishonestly induce the bank to extend a higher loan to the licensee when required, which funds he also dishonestly misappropriated. The offences were committed over a continuous period of one year _ie_ from August 2017 to July 2018, which resulted in the 12 charges being preferred against him.

127    In view of the Accused’s egregious and highly dishonest conduct in the commission of the offences, including the reasons for committing the offences _ie_ for his own personal and unlawful gains, it was submitted that a high fine of not less than $15,000 should be imposed for each of the offences.

128    In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the usual sentencing tariffs for offences of knowingly furnishing false information to the Registrar of Moneylenders was persuasive as a comparative basis due to their similar nature. This was even though the maximum fine for the present offence is $40,000 but the imprisonment term is similar.

129    As I was of the view that this was a case which involves severe harm and high degree of culpability, I agreed with the Prosecution that a high fine of $15,000 for each charge was justified. In my view a high fine was necessary to act as deterrence to like-minded persons that such crimes will not be tolerated. The punishment imposed must also persuade an Accused to refrain from similar unlawful conduct.

## Conclusion

130    After having decided on the individual sentences, the next step was to decide on the global sentence. By virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), when a person is convicted and sentenced for at least three distinct offences, the court must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

131    In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a global sentence of at least 16 years’ imprisonment by having the sentences for two of the sentences ordered to run consecutively. It was submitted that the two most serious sentences ought to run consecutively to take into account:

> (a)     the sustained period of offending and the multiplicity of offences which have been committed by the Accused; and

> (b)     to give weight to the need to send a strong deterrent message.

In contrast while the Defence had urged the court to impose a global sentence of no more than ten years’ imprisonment.

132    After having regard to the totality of the offender’s conduct and his level of criminality, in view of the individual sentences imposed I was of the view that an aggregate imprisonment term of 14 years’ was just and appropriate in respect of the charges where custodial sentences were imposed. A term of 16 years sought by the Prosecution is excessive having regard the totality principle and in view of the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty. Nevertheless, a global sentence of ten years’ imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately reflected the overall criminality of the Accused’s conduct.

133    Accordingly, I ordered the sentences for _DAC 910471 of 2020_ and _DAC 91078 of 2020_ to run consecutively in order to arrive at the global sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and a global fine of $60,000 with the remaining charges in _DAC 910476 of 2020_ and _DAC 910483 of 2020_ to run concurrently.

134    The Accused, being dissatisfied, has appealed against the sentence imposed. He is serving sentence pending the hearing of his appeal.
