### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Arjun Retnavelu, a 27 year-old Singapore citizen had claimed trial together with his co-accused Mr Pravin Rajendiran for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by means of a knife under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“Penal Code”). As he was subject to a remission order by the Commissioner of Prisons and had committed the offence while the order was in force, he was also liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed)(“Prisons Act”) with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 378 days.

2       The matter had proceeded on a joint trial over six days of hearing. On the seventh day of the trial and after six witnesses for the Prosecution had given evidence, both the accused and his co-accused indicated that they wished to take a certain course of action.

3       On 27 August 2021, pursuant to an offer by the Prosecution, the accused pleaded guilty to five charges namely DAC 924789-2018, DAC 900078-2019, DAC 912731-2019, DAC 916478-2019 and DAC 916521-2019.

4       Three of the accused’s remaining charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing namely:

> (a)     a charge under s 14(3) Societies Act (Cap 311, Rev Ed 2014) and further punishable under s 50T(1)(_a_) Prisons Act;

> (b)     a charge under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and further punishable under s 50T(1)(_a_) Prisons Act;

> (c)     a charge under s 6(1)(_a_) punishable under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015)(“POHA”) and further punishable under s 50T(1)(_a_) Prisons Act.

5       The matter was subsequently adjourned to enable the Prosecution to address the Court on sentence and for the Defence to prepare the accused’s written plea in mitigation. The Prosecution urged the court to call for a Corrective Training suitability report under s 304(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)(“CPC”) as the accused fulfilled the technical requirements. His Defence Counsel had no objections to the calling of such a report. As I was satisfied that the calling of such a report was justified in the circumstances, I ordered that a pre-sentence corrective training report be prepared.

6       On 22 November 2021, as I was satisfied that it was expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should receive corrective training, I ordered eight years of corrective training. In addition, as three of his charges required caning to be imposed and I was further of the view that enhanced sentences should be imposed for each of the proceeded charges, the breakdown of my orders are as follows:

7       I ordered his imprisonment sentence to be backdated to 26 July 2018, the date of when he was first arrested. I also ordered that the Singapore Prison Service is to take into account the period he spent in remand and to exclude the period he was on bail. The accused was on bail from 14 November 2018 to 3 January 2019.

8       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence on 22 November 2021. He is presently serving his sentence.

9       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

> 15.    On 25 July 2018, at about 2.10pm, the co-accused persons wanted to have lunch together. They were travelling along Serangoon Road in a Nissan Latio car (registration number: SJH 6064R) (“the car”), driven by Dinesh, when the accused spotted the victim seated at the bus stop located opposite Broadway Hotel. The accused had a history of conflict with the victim. He alerted other co-accused persons and asked Dinesh to stop the car along the side of the road. The accused asked Dinesh to open the car boot where he (the accused) had previously placed a box of weapons. The box of weapons contained a samurai sword, a baton and a chopper. The co-accused persons stepped out of the vehicle. The accused armed himself with the chopper. Dinesh armed himself with the samurai sword, which was sheathed with a white sheet. Sharvin armed himself with a baton. Victor and the Haresh were unarmed. The accused and co-accused persons then walked towards the bus stop together.

> 16.    Haresh then walked in front to confirm the victim’s identity. Haresh confirmed the identity of the victim and signalled to the others to attack. The accused ran forward to the victim and started to slash him with the chopper. Dinesh then unsheathed the samurai sword and started slashing the victim with it. Sharvin then hit the victim with the baton and Haresh joined in by throwing punches and kicks at the victim. The attack on the victim spilled from the bus stop onto the first lane of the road, disrupting traffic.

> 17.    The accused then accidentally dropped his chopper and so took the baton from Sharvin and used it to continue hitting the victim. The co-accused persons then fled back to the car and Dinesh drove the car away. The accused asked Dinesh to drive to his friend’s residence at Blk 624 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore. The accused called his friend, one Mathan Raj s/o Kunasegaran, male, (“Mathan”) as he wanted to pass Mathan the weapons.

> 18.    On the same day at about 3pm, the accused met Mathan at the void deck of Blk 624 Yishun Ring Road and passed him the samurai sword and the baton.

The victim was hospitalised for a week and was given 3 months of hospitalization leave. The injuries were sustained as a result of the attack by the co-accused persons.

> 21.    By virtue of the foregoing, the co-accused persons were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim with deadly weapons. In the prosecution of the said common object, the co-accused persons used violence against the victim, and were armed with deadly weapons, namely a chopper, baton, and samurai sword. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 148 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

That was when SGT You Xun intervened to arrest the accused for disorderly behaviour. As SGT You Xun was placing him under arrest, the accused pushed him twice on the chest and shouted “fuck you” in English and “chee bye” in Hokkien (which means cunt in English) and said that he was from the “Ang Soon Tong” Triad Society.

> 25.    By pushing SGT Yu Xun, a police officer and public servant, with intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such public servant, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

Along the way, the accused told the other co-accused persons about his dispute with the victim and that he wanted to settle his dispute with the victim by fighting with him. As Viikneesh was driving along Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, in the vicinity of Block 302, he spotted the victim alighting from a taxi and recalled what the accused had said about the victim. Viikneesh then alerted everyone in the car that the victim was alighting from the taxi. The coaccused persons wanted to catch the victim so that the accused could have a ‘one-to-one’ fight with the victim.

> 32.    Viikneesh stopped the car and Uthaya alighted first and shouted to the victim to come over. The victim ran away and Uthaya gave chase. The accused, Sharvin, Mathan, and Devaraj then alighted and started to chase the victim as well. The chase occurred at about 3.45 a.m. Viikneesh remained in the car and stood-by to pick up the other five co-accused persons after the fight. However, the five co-accused persons were not able to catch the victim and lost sight of him at one of the blocks at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. Viikneesh then picked the other co-accused persons up in the car before they were stopped by the police at about 3.55 a.m. at the drop off point between Blocks 302 and 305 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, just as they were about to drive off.

> 33.    When the accused was searched by the police, he was found to be in possession of an offensive weapon, to wit, a foldable knife measuring about 5cm in length, otherwise than with lawful authority or for lawful purpose.

> 34.    In the circumstances, the accused, together with the other co-accused persons, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim and the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 143 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 35.    The accused has also committed one count under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed) on the facts at \[33\] above.

> 36.    And further, the accused, from 16 December 2017 to 22 March 2019 (both dates inclusive), was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect, the accused, on 2 January 2019, committed the aforesaid offences (at \[34\] and \[35\] above) and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and he is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 80 days from 2 January 2019 to 22 March 2019 for both these offences.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

18     The Prosecution sought a sentence of nine years’ corrective training (“CT”) and 24 strokes of the cane. It was submitted that this was in line with _Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> (“Sim Yeow Kee”). The proposed breakdown for the caning were:

> (a)     DAC-924789- 2018 – 12 strokes of the cane;

> (b)     DAC-912731- 2019 – 12 strokes of the cane;

> (c)     DAC-916478- 2019 – 6 strokes of the cane;

#### If the accused were sentenced to imprisonment, his likely term would be more than 9 years

19     As the Prosecution was required to set out the accused’s likely imprisonment terms according to Step 2 of the framework in _Sim Yeow Kee_, the submitted sentences were as follows:

#### Likely total sentence

20     It was submitted that the sentences for the accused’s three most serious charges (under ss 148, 326, and 143 of the Penal Code) should be ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 116 to 133 months’ imprisonment (more than 9 years or 108 months) and 24 strokes of the cane for the following reasons:

> (a)     They were unrelated and the accused should be punished separately for each of them (see _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\]);

> (b)     Ordering them to run consecutively would not be disproportionate to the totality of the accused’s offending behaviour, and indeed, would be necessary to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence and would be in keeping with the gravity of the accused’s offences, especially since:

>> (i)       His actions have left two victims with serious and permanent or long-lasting injuries.

>> (ii)       He had used weapons against both victims.

>> (iii)       For a third incident where he fortuitously did not have the opportunity to use a weapon (the charge under s 143 of the Penal Code), he was also found to be in possession of an offensive weapon (the charge under section 6(1) of the CESOWA).

>> (iv)       He had played a leading role in all three incidents.

>> (v)       He reoffended while on bail (in respect of the charges under ss 353 and 143 of the Penal Code, and the charge under section 6(1) of the CESOWA.

#### Mandatory Aftercare Scheme(“MAS”) would apply to the accused

21     It was submitted that the accused’s charges under ss 148, 326, and 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) are listed in the First Schedule of the Prisons Act, and he would likely be subject to the MAS for these. However, even if MAS were applicable, given the severity of the crimes committed by the accused, there should be a greater emphasis on crime prevention (see _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[107\]). It was the Prosecution’s case that CT should be imposed since it is designed to both reform the accused and to prevent crime.

#### The suggested sentence of CT and caning would not be disproportionate

22     It was submitted that given that the accused would likely receive a sentence of more than nine years’ imprisonment, a CT term of nine years cannot be said to be disproportionate (see _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[105\]). A substantial time is needed to ensure that the accused is sufficiently reformed before he is released back into society.

23     It was highlighted that:

> (a)     The accused has presented with several pro-violent attitudes and had been involved in several fights during even when in custody (page 5 of the CT suitability report);

> (b)     The accused is at a moderate-high risk/need of re-offending, belonging to a group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release. The accused’s risk of re-offending is assessed to be in the high range (page 6 of the CT suitability report);

> (c)     He currently only plans to start changing his behaviour after he completes his current stint of incarceration (page 6 of the CT suitability report).

#### The suggested sentence under s 50T of the Prisons Act

24     It was submitted that applying _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>, the enhanced sentence that the accused should receive under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act should be the entire of the 378 days based on the earliest offence committed by the accused (the s 326 Penal Code charge). The proposed breakdown was as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.36%"> <col width="28.02%"> <col width="62.62%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Suggested Enhanced Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DAC 924789-2018</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">126 days, (being less than 2/3 of 241 days, but given the maximum of 378 days, unable to go further)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DAC 900078-2019</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">126 days, (being less than 2/3 of 241 days, but given the maximum of 378 days, unable to go further)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DAC 912731-2019</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">252 days (being 2/3 of 378 days)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DAC 916478-2019</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">126 days, (being less than 2/3 of 241 days, but given the maximum of 378 days, unable to go further)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DAC 916521-2019</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">126 days, (being less than 2/3 of 241 days, but given the maximum of 378 days, unable to go further)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

25     It was the Prosecution’s case that the offences at S/N 1 and 3 of the table above are Band 3, high severity cases and given the quick return and escalation of the accused’s offending behaviour. It was submitted that he should receive at least 2/3 of the remaining duration for those offences, capped at 378 days.

#### Total suggested sentence not crushing

26     It was submitted that the accused has committed a slew of offences that range from violence against persons, offences committed against public servants, and unlawful possession of a weapon. The total recommended sentence of 9 years corrective training, 378 days’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane would not be inappropriate or excessive given the variety and severity of the offences committed by the accused and his criminal record.

## Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

27     In contrast, the Defence sought a global custodial sentence of 97 months’ imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane and 245 days of enhanced sentence to be imposed on the accused. The proposed breakdown was as follows:

#### CT is not a viable sentencing option

28     It was submitted that the three principles that the court must consider in assessing whether the imprisonment term arrived is sufficient and whether a longer imprisonment term would be called for are:

> (a)     the principle of escalation;

> (b)     the imposition of two or more consecutive sentences on the offender concerned; and

> (c)     the rehabilitation opportunities that come with the MAS.

29     If the court considers that a longer term of incarceration than the likely term of regular imprisonment is called for to specifically deter the offender and that this would be preferable for the offender’s prospects of reformation, the court should then sentence the offender to CT if it is an available sentencing option. The court must also articulate why a longer term of incarceration is called for on the facts before it

30     It was the Defence’s case that the proposed sentence of a least 117 months, _ie_ 9.75 years’ imprisonment coupled with 15 strokes of the cane, was in itself sufficient to meet the ends of both general and specific deterrence. It was submitted that the proposed sentence was not significantly longer than the Prosecution’s position of 9 years corrective training.

31     The accused was previously sentenced to RTC following which he was sentenced to a prison term of 54 months and 6 strokes of the cane. The sentence submitted is substantially higher in view of the aggravating and mitigating factors.

32     It was submitted that the charges that the accused faces are listed in the First Schedule of the Prisons Act wherein he will likely be subjected to MAS. It was further submitted that the role of corrective training must consider both crime control and the rehabilitation of the accused, see _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[87\] and not crime control alone. It was the Defence’s case that the fact that the accused will be subjected to the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”), sufficiently tackles the issue of rehabilitation.

## My decision on sentence

### Sentencing principles

33     In the present case, the accused had committed predominantly serious offences which attracted the sentencing principles of both specific and general deterrence. Prior to the commission of these offences pursuant to s 50I of the Prisons Act, on 16 December 2017 after the accused had served the required portion of his sentence imposed on 19 October 2015, the remaining portion of his sentence was suspended from 16 December 2017 to 22 March 2019. Hence, these eight offences were committed in breach of the basic condition of his remission order under s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act.

34     Despite being only 27 years old, the accused has multiple antecedents. His antecedents are generally violence-related and are similar to the offences which he pleaded guilty to in the present case. He was first placed on 18 months’ probation on 17 May 2010. On 20 April 2011, he was sentenced to reformative training. For his last conviction on 19 October 2015 just before he turned 21 years of age, he was given a global sentence of 48 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

35     On 27 July 2018, he was first produced in court in respect of the charge under s 148 Penal Code of the Penal Code. His case was adjourned several times for police investigations to be completed and for additional charge under s 326 of the Penal Code to be tendered. He was released on bail from 14 November 2018 to 3 January 2019. While on bail he committed the following offences:

> (a)     two charges under s 353 of the Penal Code;

> (b)     one charge under s 143 of the Penal Code;

> (c)     one charge under s 14(3) Societies Act;

> (d)     one charge under s 6(1) CESOWA and

> (e)     one charge under s 6(1)(_a_) and punishable under s 6(3) POHA.

36     With the above factors in mind, I had to consider the appropriate type of sentence to be imposed for the five proceeded charges.

#### Regular imprisonment term versus corrective training

37     The Prosecution had urged me to order nine years’ corrective training on the accused while the Defence had proposed a 97 months’ imprisonment term. It was the Defence’s case that corrective training was not a viable option as a regular imprisonment term was sufficient to meet the ends of both general and specific deterrence. It was submitted that the sentence proposed by the Defence was not significantly longer than the Prosecution’s position of 9 years corrective training.

38     In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed in the present case, I was guided by the sentencing framework in _Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> at \[84\] to \[108\]. In that case the High Court laid down the following framework for cases involving corrective training (“CT”):

> (a)      _Stage 1_: Does the offender satisfy the technical requirements for CT to be imposed?

> (b)      _Stage 2_: Is it expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime?

>> (i)       What is the imprisonment term that would likely be imposed on the offender for the underlying offence?

>> (ii)       Would the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) apply to the offender if he were sentenced to regular imprisonment?

>> (iii)       Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

#### Technical requirements of CT

39     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused satisfied the technical requirements for the imposition of CT. As the accused is 27 years old, he is a person aged 18 and above. He had also been convicted at one trial before a District Court of 3 or more distinct offences punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more in view of his offences under ss 143, 148 and 326 of the Penal Code. Lastly, the accused turned 16 years old on 22 October 2010 and was convicted on 19 October 2015 where he was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for an offence under s 324 of the Penal Code. This was an offence which is punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years, or with fine, or with caning or with any combination of such punishments.

40     I then proceeded to Stage 2 of my enquiry.

#### (i)   Likely imprisonment term for the underlying offences

41     I next considered the likely imprisonment term that would be imposed on the accused for the underlying offences.

42     In respect of the charge under s 148 of the Penal Code, I had considered the following factors:

> (a)     The accused has similar antecedents under s 147 of the Penal Code for which he was sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment and 15 months’ imprisonment respectively;

> (b)     His co-accused, Haresh s/o Shanmuganathan was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for his role in that incident;

> (c)     The accused was armed with a chopper and a baton at various points and grievous hurt was caused to the victim;

> (d)     The accused was the instigator in this incident. He was the one who had a history of conflict with the victim and significantly, he was the one who armed the co-accused persons.

Based on the above factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused should receive a higher sentence than his co-accused because of his high level of culpability. His likely sentence would have been 60 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

43     In respect of the charge under s 143 of the Penal Code, I had considered the following factors:

> (a)     The accused has similar antecedents under s 147 of the Penal Code as set out at \[42\] above;

> (b)     He was the instigator in this incident. He was the one who had a dispute with the victim and wanted to settle this by fighting with the victim;

> (c)     The accused had committed this offence while on bail;

> (d)     His co-accused persons were sentenced to one to three months’ imprisonment for this incident.

Based on the above factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused should receive a higher sentence than his co-accused persons as his level of culpability was high. His likely sentence would have been six months’ imprisonment.

44     In respect of the charge under s 326 of the Penal Code, I had considered the following factors:

> (a)     The accused has similar antecedents under sections 325 and 324 of the Penal Code. For his s 324 Penal Code antecedent, he was sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane;

> (b)     The victim suffered very serious injuries and this is evident from the victim’s medical report as well as the photographs of his injuries in P60 to P67. The victim was given 31 days of medical leave;

> (c)     The accused was armed with a knife and had caused grievous hurt to the victim;

As the degree of harm caused was serious, his level of culpability was high and his similar antecedents, his likely sentence would have been 54 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

45     In respect of the charge under s 6(1) of CESOWA, the accused was found with a foldable knife measuring about 5cm in length when he was stopped by the police. The accused had committed this offence while on bail. His likely sentence would have been the usual tariff of six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

46     In respect of the charge under s 353 of the Penal Code, the accused had used force on a police officer by pushing his chest twice, with intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such public servant. The accused had tried to intervene as the police were trying to arrest two other men for disorderly behaviour. The accused had committed this offence while on bail. His likely sentence would have been four weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Likely total sentence

47     In my view, the likely sentences for the accused’s three most serious charges under ss 148, 326, and 143 of the Penal Code should be ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 120 months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane for the following reasons:

> (a)     These offences were unrelated and the accused should be punished separately for each of them (see _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\]);

> (b)     Ordering them to run consecutively would not be disproportionate to the totality of the accused’s offending behaviour and would be necessary to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence and would be in keeping with the gravity of the accused’s offences;

#### (ii)   Would the MAS apply to the offender if he were sentenced to regular imprisonment?

48     As the accused’s charges under ss 148, 326, and 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) are listed in the First Schedule of the Prisons Act, he would likely be subject to the MAS for these. He would have been eligible to 40 months of aftercare under MAS after serving 80 months of imprisonment.

#### (iii)   Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate

49     I then proceeded to consider whether the imposition of CT would be unduly disproportionate.

50     Given that the accused would likely receive a sentence of 120 months or 10 years’ imprisonment, a CT term of eight years cannot be said to be disproportionate. I agreed with the Prosecution that a substantial time is needed to ensure that the accused is sufficiently reformed before he is released back into society. The accused has several pro-violent attitudes and had been involved in several fights during even when in custody (see page 5 of the CT suitability report). Nevertheless, I was of the view that a CT term of nine years proposed by the Prosecution would be crushing. A downward calibration to eight years was more appropriate in the circumstances.

51     In addition, the accused is at a moderate-high risk/need of re-offending, belonging to a group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release. Notably, his risk of re-offending was assessed to be in the high range. It was indicated that his plan lacked feasibility and resolve as he plans to only start on changing his behaviour after he completes his current incarceration (see page 6 of the CT suitability report).

52     Based on the above, I was satisfied that a longer term of incarceration was needed both for the prevention of crime and to specifically deter the accused in the interests of his reformation.

### Enhanced sentences pursuant to s 50T Prisons Act

53     I next considered whether enhanced sentences pursuant to s 50T of the Prisons Act should be imposed on the accused. I was guided by the High Court decision in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> which established the sentencing framework for enhanced sentences under s 50T and sentences under s 50Y of the Prisons Act.

54     In determining whether to exercise my discretion to impose an enhanced sentence for each charge, I considered the following factors namely:

> (a)     the gravity of the offence;

> (b)     whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

> (c)     the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

> (d)     all other relevant circumstances.

55     The accused was released on conditional remission on 16 December 2017. His remaining portion of his sentence was suspended from 16 December 2017 to 22 March 2019. He reoffended by committing the s 326 Penal Code offence on 10 March 2018 about _four months_ after release. He then went on to commit a more violent offence under s 148 of the Penal Code _four months_ later on 27 July 2018, thus escalating his behaviour. While on bail over a period of _seven weeks_, he committed the offences under ss 147 and 353 of the Penal Code, s 14(3) of the Societies Act, s 6(1) of the CESOWA and s 6(1)(_a_) of the POHA.

56     His previous convictions were for offences under ss 147, 324 and 325 of the Penal Code which were of a similar nature to the offence for which he was originally sentenced. In fact, his fresh offences under ss 148 and 326 of the Penal Code were for more serious versions of those offences.

57     His reoffending stopped temporarily while he was in remand pending the completion of investigations and the tendering of additional charges. When he was released on bail from 14 November 2018 to 3 January 2019, he went on to commit six additional offences. It was clear that his previous incarceration had not deterred him from re-offending. Hence, I was of the view that an enhanced sentence ought to be imposed for all five of the proceeded charges.

58     I next considered the appropriate enhanced sentence for each of the proceeded charges. I was mindful that in deciding on the duration of the enhanced sentence, the court is required to have regard to the remaining duration of the remission order pertaining to the original offence, the severity of the fresh offence and that it should not be disproportionate to the intended sentence for the fresh offence. I was also mindful that the individual enhanced sentence cannot exceed the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the fresh offence and as multiple fresh offences were committed the enhanced sentences would be consecutive to all other terms of imprisonment imposed.

#### S 326 Penal Code charge

59     In respect of the offence under s 326 of the Penal Code, I found the gravity of this fresh offence to be moderate to high. The fresh offence was a more serious version of his original offence under s 324 of the Penal Code. Further, the fresh offence was committed just four months after his release. The accused had initially claimed trial to this charge and had only pleaded guilty on the seventh day of hearing. In these circumstances, I did not think his prospects of rehabilitation could be viewed as promising. He also has violence-related antecedents under ss 147, 324 and 325 of the Penal Code. This pattern of offending suggests that the accused had not been able to rehabilitate himself yet.

60     For these reasons, I considered the overall severity of the accused’s fresh offence under s 326 of the Penal Code to be high and situate the offence at the mid-point of Band 3. The appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence is 5/6 of the remaining remission period of 378 days as at 10 March 2018 or 315 days’ imprisonment.

#### S 148 Penal Code charge

61     In respect of the offence under s 148 of the Penal Code, I found the gravity of this fresh offence to be moderate to high. The fresh offence was a more serious version of his original offence under s 147 of the Penal Code. As stated earlier, he also had violence-related antecedents. The pattern of offending suggests that the accused had not been able to rehabilitate himself yet.

62     For these reasons, I considered the overall severity of the accused’s fresh offence under s 148 of the Penal Code to be high and situate the offence at the mid-point of Band 3. The appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence is 5/6 of the remaining remission period of 241 days as at 25 July 2018 or 201 days’ imprisonment.

#### S 353 Penal Code charge

63     In respect of the offence under s 353 of the Penal Code, I found the gravity of this fresh offence to be moderate to high. A similar fresh offence committed on another police officer was taken into consideration. Although the fresh offence was not similar to his original offences, nevertheless he had violence-related antecedents. The accused had also committed this offence while he was on bail. His pattern of offending suggests that the accused had not been able to rehabilitate himself yet.

64     For these reasons, I considered the overall severity of the accused’s fresh offence under s 353 of the Penal Code to be of moderate severity and situate the offence at the higher end of Band 2. The appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence is 2/3 of the remaining remission period of 98 days as at 15 December 2018 or 65 days’ imprisonment.

#### S 143 Penal Code charge

65     In respect of the offence under s 143 of the Penal Code, I found the gravity of this fresh offence to be moderate to high. The fresh offence was a similar albeit less serious version of his original offence under s 147 of the Penal Code. As stated earlier, he also had violence-related antecedents. The accused had committed this offence while he was on bail. His pattern of offending suggests that the accused had not been able to rehabilitate himself yet.

66     For these reasons, I considered the overall severity of the accused’s fresh offence under s 143 of the Penal Code to be high and situate the offence at the mid-point of Band 3. The appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence is 5/6 of the remaining remission period of 80 days as at 2 January 2019, or 67 days’ imprisonment.

#### S 6(1) CESOWA charge

67     In respect of the offence under s 6(1) CESOWA, I found the gravity of this fresh offence to be moderate to high. Although the fresh offence was not similar to his original offences, nevertheless he had violence-related antecedents. The accused had also committed this offence while he was on bail. His pattern of offending suggests that the accused had not been able to rehabilitate himself yet.

68     For these reasons, I considered the overall severity of the accused’s fresh offence under s 6(1) CESOWA to be of moderate severity and situate the offence at the higher end of Band 2. The appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence is 2/3 of the remaining remission period of 80 days as at 2 January 2019 or 53 days’ imprisonment.

#### The totality principle

69     The aggregate proposed enhanced sentences for the five charges exceeds the remaining duration of his remission order at the time of his earliest offence _ie_ 378 days. I took a last look and then adjusted the aggregate sentence by “re-calibrating the individual sentences so as to arrive at an appropriate aggregate sentence” (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[47\], \[58\] and \[59\]).

#### The individual adjustments

70     For the s 326 of the Penal Code charge, I reduced the proposed enhanced sentence to 200 days’ imprisonment from 315 days’ imprisonment.

71     For the charge under s 148 of the Penal Code, I reduced the proposed enhanced sentence to 90 days’ imprisonment from 201 days imprisonment.

72     For the charge under s 353 of the Penal Code, I reduced the proposed enhanced sentence to 15 days’ imprisonment from 65 days’ imprisonment.

73     For the charge under s 143 of the Penal Code, I reduced the proposed enhanced sentence to 25 days’ imprisonment from 67 days imprisonment. For the charge under s 6(1) of the CESOWA, I reduced the proposed enhanced sentence to 30 days’ imprisonment from 53 days’ imprisonment.

74     From the above downward adjustments and calibration of the individual enhanced sentences, the aggregate enhanced sentence was 360 days’ imprisonment. This was after having regard to the totality of the offender’s conduct and his level of criminality. As the overall severity of the offences under ss 326 and 148 were high and they were an escalation to a more serious versions of the original charges, there was a need for specific deterrence. I had reflected this by the longer periods of the enhanced sentences for these two charges.

## Conclusion

75     In my view, in light of the accused’s pro-violent attitude that perpetuated his use of violence, he clearly requires a substantial time to ensure that he is sufficiently reformed before he is released back into society. As set out at page 6 of the CT suitability report, his risk of re-offending is assessed to be in the high range. Considering the severity of his actions, his numerous related antecedents, and his high risk of recidivism and reoffending, he should receive corrective training for eight years as it is designed to both reform the accused and to prevent crime. In addition, I also agreed with the Prosecution that as the accused had abused the privilege of being released early by his offending and he would have to recompense for that by serving 95% of the remainder of his remission period.

76     As the corrective training is only in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment or any sentence of imprisonment and fine, I had to impose caning for the offences under s 148 of the Penal Code and s 6(1) CESOWA as it was mandatory. For the charge under s 326 of the Penal Code, in view of the overall severity of the offence and his high degree of culpability, an order of caning was necessary. Although the aggregate number of strokes ordered was 30 strokes, s 328 CPC prescribes the limit that a court can impose. The specified limit is 24 strokes of the cane.
