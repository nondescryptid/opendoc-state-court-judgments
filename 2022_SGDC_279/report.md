### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Ms Ng Hui Yi (“**Ng**”) is 27 years of age. Between September 2021 and April 2022, she committed a spate of offences. The offences included dishonestly obtaining dental services from four different clinics, and using threatening communications against the staff of the clinics when her request for a waiver of the fees was refused; using threatening communications and abusive words against other entities and individuals, including a cousin; and stealing valuables and cash from a neighbour’s home. 14 charges were brought against Ng for the offences.

2       Ng was assigned a counsel under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). A plead-guilty mention was fixed on 7 November 2022 for her to plead guilty. At the start of the plead-guilty proceedings on 7 November 2022, Ng’s assigned counsel applied to be discharged from further acting for Ng. Counsel informed that she had been unable to take instructions from Ng, and that CLAS was withdrawing legal aid and no other CLAS lawyer would be assigned. Ng was thus unrepresented at the plead-guilty mention. She pleaded guilty to six charges, and the remaining eight charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.

3       Ng was sentenced to a total of 9 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to take effect from the date of her arrest on 18 June 2022. She commenced serving the sentence and filed the present appeal against the sentence on 15 November 2022.

4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

5       Ng pleaded guilty to six charges.

6       The first was a charge of theft in a dwelling, under s 380 of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code 1871**”):

> DAC-909995-2022 (1st charge)

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on the 1st day of April 2022, at about 1pm, at \[address of victim\], Singapore, a building used as a human dwelling, did commit theft of \[various items and cash\] with a total value of about S$5,360, in the possession of \[Ang Chye Seng\], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed).

7       Two charges related to obtaining services dishonestly, under s 420A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code (Cap 224)**”).

8       One charge was for (persistently) making threatening communication with intent to cause alarm, an offence under s 3(1)(b) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“**PHA (Cap 256A)**”). This was an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**CPC (Cap 68)**”):

9       Another charge was for failing to comply with an expedited protection order, an offence under s 10(1)(b) of the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (2020 Rev Ed) (“**PHA 2014**”), which was an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“**CPC 2010**”):

> MAC-905271-2022 (12th charge)

### Facts

11     Ng admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The salient facts were as follows (in the chronology in which the offences were committed).

#### 15 Sep – 3 Oct 2021: making threatening communications

12     On 15 September 2021, at about 3 pm, Ng called the landline of the Orchard Wheelock branch of Illumia Medical Pte Ltd (“**Illumia Wheelock**”). The call was received by Chan Yee Teng (“**Chan**”), a customer service staff of Illumia Wheelock. Ng told Chan that Lim Hwee Li (“**Lim**”, who was a director of Illumia), was nice, kind and always did charity, and asked if Lim was kind enough to donate $500 to her. (Ng had apparently read from Google that Lim was a charitable person.) Ng also said that she was poor and had not changed her furniture for 20 years. She requested that Chan pass all the messages to Lim. Ng left her name as “Wong Mei Xin” with contact number XXX before ending the call.

13     Shortly after, Ng called Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly using the number XXX but Chan declined to answer the calls. Ng also sent 15 copies of the following WhatsApp message to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number:

> “YOU TELL KIM LIM IF SHE DOESN'T CALL ME BACK NOW, I WILL DEFAME, TARNISH, RUIN N SLANDER KIM LIM ILLUMNIA REPUTATION,

> KIM LIM IS CRAZY MONEY-CHEATER N MONEY STEALER WHO KEEP ON STEALING CHEATING BILLIONS MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS,

> KIM LIM STOLEN N CHEATED BILLIONS OF MONEY FROM HER CUSTOMERS, KIM LIM USE SHARP KNIFE TO KILLING, MURDERING N STABBING CUSTOMERS TO DEATH UNTIL BLOOD COME OUT, KIM LIM IS CRAZY SERIAL ILLEGAL MONEY-CHEATER N MONEY STEALER WHO HAVE BEEN STEALING N CHEATING MORE THAN BILLIONS OF HER CUSTOMERS MONEY, KIM LIM USE LOUSY CHEAPSKATE EXPIRED FACIAL CREAMS TO APPLY ON CUSTOMER FACES N BODIES UNTIL THEY HAVE INJURIES, ABRASIONS, SCARS N BLOOD ALL OVER CALL 995 SENT TO HOSPITAL N DIED, KIM IS BLOODY CRAZY, INHUMANE N SICK IN HER BRAIN KEEP ON STEALING N CHEATING BILLIONS OF MONEY FROM HER CUSTOMERS, KIM LIM HAVE STOLEN N CHEATED MORE THAN BILLIONS OF MONEY FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS UNTIL THEY PITIFUL BECOME BANKRUPT, KIM LIM KEEP ON STEALING CHEATING MORE THAN BILLIONS OF MONEY FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS UNTIL THEY NO MONEY LEFTI!! EVERYONE MUST BE CAREFUL FOREVER CANNOT GO TO ILLUMNIA ANYMORE, KIM WILL USE FIRE ARSON BURN UR BODIES FACES UNTIL BLOOD COME OUT, THEY USE LOUSY QUALITY PRODUCTS TO DESTROY CUSTOMERS FACES N BODIES, KIM ABDUCT, RAPE N MOLEST CUSTOMERS DUMP THEIR DEAD BODIES IN SEA RIVER, AFTER VISITING ILLUMNIA, EVERY KIM LIM CUSTOMERS SUFFERS FROM SERIOUS STOMACH CANCER, EXCRUCIATING PAIN, HIGH FEVER, COLD SWEAT FLU, CONTAMINATION UNTIL THEY CALL 995 AMBULANCE RUSH THEM TO HOSPITAL N BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALREADY DIED IN HOSPITAL COS KIM LIM APPLIED EXPIRED CHEAPSKATE LOUSY CHEAPSKATE FACIAL CREAMS ON THEIR FACES, KIM LIM USE MANY SHARPEST KNIVES TO KILL N MURDER THEIR CUSTOMERS UNTIL THEIR BLOOD COME OUT TO DEATHIM EVERYONE MUST BECAREFUL NEVER EVER GO ILLUMNIA FOR FACIAL TREATMENT N BUY ANYTHING FROM THEIR STORES, THEY WILL BLOODY CHEAT N STEAL BILLIONS OF MONEY FROM YOU, KIM FORCE CUSTOMERS TO COMMIT SUICIDE JUMP DOWN BUILDING BLOOD COME OUT,”

14     Later that day, Ng went to Illumia Wheelock and requested Chan to follow her to the side as Ng wanted to “show her something”. Chan refused and asked for assistance from her colleague, Low Jia Ling (“**Low**”), a service staff at Illumia Wheelock. Ng then spoke to Low and asked for Lim to give her $500. When Low advised Ng to seek financial assistance from a social worker, Ng replied that she was already receiving $300 a month but that was not enough. Ng said in Mandarin:

> “You’re not scared if I post that Kim Lim used expired products on customers, killing people and stab until blood all come out, first people to jump off building.”

> and

> “You’re not scared that I use a bomb to bomb your clinic”.

15     A staff of Illumia Wheelock alerted the police. Upon realising that the police were on their way, Ng kept repeating the words in Mandarin and English as she walked away. Awhile later, Ng returned and showed Chan the WhatsApp message that she sent to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number. She said to Chan, “You’re really not scared if I post this and I only want S$500”. When Chan replied that the police were on their way, Ng left (and did not return again that day).

16     From 16 September 2021 to 3 October 2021, Ng used nine different mobile numbers to call Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly, calling Lim names and threatening to defame Lim and Illumia. As Chan could not tell if the numbers belonged to a genuine customer or Ng, Chan answered the calls. As a result, Illumia Wheelock’s customers complained about their landline always being engaged.

17     During that period, Ng also used the same nine different mobile numbers to send numerous WhatsApp messages to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number. Chan read the messages and saw that they contained screenshots of various social media accounts belonging to local celebrities, threats to defame Lim and Illumia, and vulgar language. The date, time, number used by Ng and number of messages sent are set out in the table below:

The contents of the messages are attached as an Annex (Annex A1 to Annex A9) to the Statement of Facts.

18     Thus, on 23,247 occasions between 15 September and 3 October 2021, Ng embarked on a course of conduct of making threatening communications, by calling Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly and sending numerous WhatsApp messages to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number, and threatening to defame Illumia Wheelock and Lim, with intent to cause alarm to Lim, and as a result caused alarm to Chan. (MAC-905269-2022)

#### 23 Dec 2021: dishonestly obtaining services ($3,167.20)

19     On 23 December 2021, at about 9 am, Ng went to Orchard Scotts Dental (located at Liat Towers) for a dental appointment. She had a consultation with Dr Kenneth Goh Qing Rui (“**Dr Goh**”). Dr Goh recommended a treatment plan which consisted of teeth whitening treatment (to be done that day) and tooth fillings (to be done a few weeks later). Ng indicated that she was agreeable to the recommended treatment plan and signed on a document setting out the treatment plan and the estimated cost of the treatment.

20     Dr Goh then proceeded to carry out the teeth whitening treatment for Ng. After the treatment was completed, Ng insisted on having her tooth fillings done on the same day as well. She threatened to post bad reviews of the clinic online should Dr Goh decline her request. Dr Goh eventually gave in to her request.

21     The teeth whitening treatment and tooth filings were services worth $3,167.20. The services were made available to Ng on the basis that she would be making payment for the services subsequently. However, Ng did not intend to make any payment. (DAC-911640-2022)

22     After the tooth fillings were completed, Ng presented a credit card for payment, but the card was rejected multiple times. She then claimed that she had inadvertently brought the wrong card from home and asked to return home to retrieve the correct card and to return in an hour’s time to make payment. She was allowed to do so. When Ng did not return in an hour, a staff of the clinic contacted her and agreed for her to come down before the clinic closed at 5.45 pm. However, Ng did not turn up.

23     The following day, a manager at the clinic (“**Hanizan**”) contacted Ng to chase for payment. But Ng replied that her father was in the hospital, she had difficulties making payment and requested that the clinic waive the charges. When Hanizan declined to do so and informed Ng that they would be filing a police report against her, Ng started shouting and saying, “The clinic is the worst”, “The doctor never do a good job”, “The doctor used a knife to poke me and there is blood all over”, and “The doctor keep stabbing her”.

24     Hanizan promptly ended the call; but within the next two to three hours, Ng called the clinic’s front desk landline repeatedly and kept saying the same thing. She also threatened to leave bad reviews of the clinic on Google and to post about her being abused by Dr Goh on Facebook. This persisted for a few hours every morning from 24 December 2021 to sometime in January 2022. (MAC-905266-2022 – TIC charge, at \[45(e)\] below)

#### 23 Dec 2021: dishonestly obtaining services ($5,103)

25     On 23 December 2021, at about 3 pm, Ng went to TP Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd (“**TP Dental**”), located at Ngee Ann City, for a dental appointment. She had a consultation with Dr Hwang Yee Cheau (“**Dr Hwang**”). Ng agreed to have her teeth decay removed, cavity filled, teeth scaled and polished, and braces installed. She was informed of the estimated cost of all the treatment and signed on a document setting out the estimated cost.

26     Another dentist from TP Dental performed the teeth scaling, polishing and cavity filling for Ng, while Dr Hwang did the braces for her.

27     The services, which were worth a total of $5,103, were made available to Ng on the basis that she would be making payment for the services subsequently. However, she did not intend to make any payment. (DAC-911641-2022)

28     After all the treatment were completed, Ng presented a debit card for payment, but the card was rejected multiple times. She then claimed that she had inadvertently brought the wrong card from home and asked to make payment the following day. After noting down Ng’s identity card number, Dr Hwang allowed her to leave the clinic.

29     The following day, the clinic’s receptionist received a call from Ng. Ng claimed that her father was in the hospital, she had difficulties making payment and requested that the clinic waive the charges. Ng threatened that, if the clinic refused to waive the charges, she would tarnish the clinic’s reputation by leaving bad reviews on Google and spreading false rumours that a staff at the clinic had COVID so that no one would visit the clinic. Ng also claimed that Dr Hwang had knocked people down while driving and caused them to die.

30     From that day (24 December 2021) to sometime in January 2022, Ng persistently called the clinic to repeat the threats and to demand a waiver of the charges. (MAC-905267-2022 – TIC charge, at \[45(f)\] below)

#### 16 Feb to 1 Mar 2022: failing to comply with EPO

31     Ng used to borrow money from her cousin (“**Jasmine**”) and Jasmine’s mother, and would harass Jasmine’s family and call up Jasmine’s workplace to ask for more money.

32     On 16 February 2022, Jasmine obtained an Expedited Protection Order (“**EPO**”) under s 13(1) PHA against Ng. Under the EPO, Ng was prohibited from doing the following (among other things):

> (a)     sending to Jasmine threatening, abusive or insulting messages via WhatsApp or any other social media platforms or making any phone calls with threatening, abusive or insulting communication to Jasmine and/or Jasmine’s mother, with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress to Jasmine, and as a result cause Jasmine harassment, alarm or distress; and

> (b)     sending threatening, abusive or insulting messages via phone calls or any other social media platforms to Jasmine’s company or to anyone related to Jasmine such as Jasmine’s mother in a manner which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived by Jasmine such as to cause her harassment, alarm or distress.

Jasmine sent a copy of the EPO to Ng via WhatsApp on 16 February 2022.

33     On 16, 22 and 25 February 2022, Ng failed to comply with the Order without reasonable excuse by sending a total of 28 abusive messages by WhatsApp to Jasmine (which are set out at the SOF at \[35\]).

34     Separately, between 16 February and 1 March 2022, Ng called Jasmine’s workplace on three to four days a week during work hours. On some of those calls, Ng said, “Jasmine Ng is a crazy money cheater and money stealer. She keep cheating and stealing billions of money from Yusen Logistic”. On other calls, she simply called and did not say anything over the phone.

35     Thus, on over 28 occasions between 16 February and 1 March 2022, Ng did embark on a course of conduct of failing to comply with the EPO, by sending abusive messages to Jasmine via WhatsApp and sending abusive messages via phone calls to Jasmine’s company. (MAC-905271-2022)

#### 12 Mar 2022: criminal trespass

36     On 28 February 2022, lawyers acting for Illumia and a few other companies (collectively, the “**Companies**”) sent a letter to Ng. In the letter, it was stated that she had on multiple occasions, over the course of five months, entered the Companies’ premises to request money. The letter placed her on notice that she was banned from entry into all of the premises occupied, leased, or owned by the Companies, and that her presence at any of the Companies’ premises would amount to an act of trespass.

37     On 12 March 2022, at about 1.33 pm, Ng went to Illumia Wheelock (referred to at \[12\]-\[18\] above). Ng approached Low, who was seated at the front desk counter, and asked to speak to Lim in order to ask Lim for money. Low informed Ng that she was not allowed entry at Illumia Wheelock and that the police would be called if Ng refused to leave. Ng left but, shortly after, with the intent to annoy Low, Ng returned and headed straight to the rear end of the clinic to look for Lim. (MAC-904442-2022)

#### 1 Apr 2022: theft from neighbour’s home ($5,360)

38     Ng had a neighbour, Ang Chai Seng (“**Ang**”), who was 61 years of age and lived in a unit on the same floor as Ng. Ng would sometimes go to Ang’s unit to chat with him. In the course of visiting Ang, Ng came to know that he would usually place his valuables inside the top drawer of a small cabinet in his living room, secure the drawer with a key, and place the key on top of the cabinet.

39     On 1 April 2022, at about 7 am, Ng visited Ang at his unit to spend time together. At about 1 pm, Ang went to the toilet. While Ang was in the toilet, Ng took some items from the top drawer of the small cabinet in Ang’s living room without Ang’s consent. The items were:

> (a)     one black ‘Crossing’ wallet valued at $200;

> (b)     one Singapore identity card belonging to Ang;

> (c)     one Singapore driving licence belonging to Ang;

> (d)     one POSB ATM card belonging to Ang;

> (e)     cash amounting to $200;

> (f)     one red packet containing cash of $500;

> (g)     one red packet containing cash of $1,700; and

> (h)     one gold chain valued at $2,760.

Ng then left Ang’s unit with the items. (DAC-909995-2022)

40     Ang subsequently discovered that the items were missing. He also received a WhatsApp audio message from Ng, where she said that she had taken Ang’s valuables. After Ang informed her that he would call the police if she refused to return his items, she indicated that she would return in 15 minutes; she later said she would return by 6 pm that day. Ang then decided to alert the police. At about 3.19 pm, he called ‘999’ to report the theft.

41     Police officers arrived at Ang’s unit. They assisted to contact Ng on her mobile phone and asked her to return the stolen items to Ang. However, Ng ignored their directions and hung up her phone.

42     (At some point earlier that day) Ng had returned the wallet, identity card, driving licence and POSB ATM card to Ang, by leaving them at the staircase landing near Ang’s unit and informing him about it.

43     As for the other stolen items:

> (a)     Ng pawned the gold chain at a MoneyMax pawnshop and obtained cash of $2,386. The gold chain was not recovered.

> (b)     Ng used the stolen cash of $2,400 (referred to at \[39(e)\]-\[39(g)\]) and the money she obtained from pawning away the gold chain to buy a wig. A wig was subsequently recovered from Ng’s home.

44     Ng called her mother on 2 April 2022 to inform her. Ng’s mother subsequently reached an agreement with Ang to pay back a sum of $3,000 to him by monthly instalments of $100 starting from November 2022.

48     The detailed submissions of the prosecution are considered later at \[53\]-\[74\].

### Mitigation plea

49     A handwritten appeal letter was tendered by Ng’s mother (“**Mdm Tay**”). Mdm Tay sought a lower sentence for her daughter Ng on account of Ng’s mental illness. Mdm Tay explained that Ng became like that when she was young, and she came from a broken family. Ng’s father was violent towards Mdm Tay because of money problems. Ng saw it and tried to protect her mother, but was hit by her father. In primary and secondary school, Ng was bullied by her classmates and had to seek treatment for her mental illness at IMH. Ng had apologised repeatedly and regretted her wrongdoing. Ng had been locked up in Changi Prison for 5 months and, during this period, she was very frightened and anxious about her sentence. Ng had suicidal thoughts. Mdm Tay urged for a light sentence for Ng so that she could return home soon and she could look for a job. Letters of apology to the victims of Ng’s offences, to which Ng affixed her thumbprint, were enclosed. Two of the victims wrote letters seeking to withdraw their cases against Ng after Ng’s mental problems had been explained to them.

50     Ng also made an oral mitigation plea.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) She said that her father and mother divorced each other when she was in her mother's womb. Her father did not love her. Her mother kept using “big, heavy bamboo pole”, “big, heavy metal chains”, “big, heavy badminton racket” to beat her severely until she became seriously injured. When she went to primary school, her classmates kept bullying her and torturing her. In secondary school, her classmates also bullied and tortured her. When she went to ITE, her ITE classmates used “big, heavy fire matches” to burn her hair, face, hands and legs and all over her body, until her body was seriously injured. They beat her severely with “big, heavy hands”, “big, heavy badminton racket” and “big, heavy storybooks” until her body was seriously injured and very painful. When she went into adulthood, her “sick brain” caused her to do things she did not want to do. She kept hearing hallucinations. Her “sick brain” kept controlling her and causing her to repeat washing her hands and bathing 20 times a day. She felt depressed, stressed, anxious, unhappy. She forgot to take her medication three years ago, and that was why all her “serious mental illness” came back again. In the past few months, the prison officers had reminded her to take medicine on time, so now her serious mental illnesses had gone away and disappeared. She felt remorseful and regretful for the crimes she committed. She promised that from now on she would be a very good girl and behave well; she had turned over a new leaf. She pleaded to the court to be kind and to forgive her and do give her a last and final chance. She asked that her sentence be reduced and backdated (to the date of her remand).

### Sentencing considerations

#### Dominant sentencing consideration: deterrence

51     In deciding on the sentence, I considered the dominant sentencing consideration to be _deterrence_. Specific deterrence was particularly relevant considering Ng’s multiple antecedents, which included offences of a similar nature such as theft, breach of protection orders and intentionally causing harassment. There also appeared to have been an escalation in Ng’s offending behaviour. Her latest offences included that of obtaining services dishonestly under s 420A of the Penal Code, which are serious offences punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years, fine, or both.

52     Ng was remanded for a psychiatric evaluation following her arrest on 18 June 2022. The opinion of the consultant psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) who examined Ng was that she had a complex longitudinal clinical history characterized by mood and psychotic episodes (working diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder), features of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a background of borderline intellectual functioning and likely dysfunctional personality traits. However, no contributory link was established between the diagnosed psychiatric disorders and the offences.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) Accordingly, Ng’s psychiatric condition did not diminish her culpability and was not a mitigating factor in sentencing. (That said, Ng would benefit from further psychiatric follow up and treatment for her mental health conditions.[^5])

#### Custodial sentences

53     In my judgement, the sentencing submissions of the prosecution were fair, both in the individual sentences and the global sentence sought.

##### (1)   Theft in dwelling

54     An offence under s 380 of the Penal Code 1871 is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and the offender is also liable to a fine.

55     The prosecution sought a sentence of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the total value of all the stolen items was significant ($5,360). Ng also had recent property-related antecedents:

> (a)     On 24 June 2020, Ng was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment for stealing a bottle of mouthwash valued at $3.85 from a store; and 3 weeks’ imprisonment for stealing her mother’s handphone.

> (b)     On 1 June 2021, Ng was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for stealing her mother’s mobile phone; and 2 weeks’ imprisonment for stealing two underwear, a bed spread and a blanket from a neighbour’s clothing rack.

56     Weighing these aggravating factors against the mitigating factors (that Ng pleaded guilty and had made partial restitution), it was submitted that a custodial term of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

57     I accepted the submission of the prosecution. Considering the significant value of the stolen items and cash, for which full restitution had not been made, and Ng’s past theft offences, I decided that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for this offence.

##### (2)   Criminal trespass

58     An offence under s 447 of the Penal Code 1871 is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with a fine which may extend to $1,500, or with both.

59     In seeking a short custodial term for this offence, the prosecution stated that Ng trespassed into a commercial property (as opposed to a residential property, which would have been more egregious); with the intent to annoy (as opposed to with the intent to commit an offence, which would have been more egregious). Taking into account that fines were ordinarily imposed for criminal trespass into residential property with the intent to annoy, it was submitted that a short custodial term would suffice in the present case.

60     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a short custodial term would be appropriate. Ng committed the offence of trespass of the premises of Illumia Wheelock after having committed numerous acts of harassment of the staff of the company (at \[12\]-\[18\] above), and despite having received a letter from the company’s solicitors expressly banning her from entry into the company’s premises (at \[36\] above). Her conduct was wilful, and the custodial threshold was crossed. I considered a short imprisonment term of one week to be appropriate, considering that there was no evidence of significant harm being caused by her act of trespass.

#### (3)    Obtaining services dishonestly

61     An offence under s 420A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) was punishable (under s 420A(2) of the Act) with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, a fine, or both.

62     For the two charges of obtaining services dishonestly, the prosecution submitted that the harm caused was low. Apart from the fact that the amounts cheated were significant, there were no other factors indicative of high actual or potential harm. Culpability was also low. There was a degree of planning in the manner in which Ng went about committing the offences – she had thought of bringing along a card which would be rejected for payment and using it as an excuse to leave the clinics without making payment – but it was not sophisticated. Apart from the two proceeded charges, there were two TIC charges, and the offences were committed over a period from 6 September to 23 December 2021. No restitution was made. Account was also taken of the fact that Ng pleaded guilty and did not have any cheating-related antecedents.

63     In _PP v Abdul Rahman bin A Karim_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 72</span>, one of the few cases that have been prosecuted under s 420A thus far, the offender was sentenced to _32 months’ imprisonment_ for deceiving a sex worker into believing that he would pay her _$1,500_ for two hours of sexual services. That case, however, had more aggravating factors than the present case and did not provide a helpful reference point in sentencing.

64     All in, considering the amounts cheated in the present case in the context of the relatively low harm and low culpability involved, I accepted the submissions of the prosecution that sentences of 4 months’ imprisonment (where the services were valued at $3,167.20) and 6 months’ imprisonment (where the services were valued at $5,103) would be appropriate, with the value of the services dishonestly obtained being a broad proxy for the harm caused.

##### (4)   Making threatening communications

65     An offence under s 3(1)(b) of the PHA (Cap 256A) was punishable (under s 3(2) of the Act) with a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) As the charge was an amalgamated charge pursuant to s 124(4) of the CPC (Cap 68), the offender may be sentenced to “2 times the amount of punishment” (under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC (Cap 68)).

66     The prosecution submitted that the threats issued by Ng were particularly vicious. She threatened to defame the clinic and its director not only for lousy services, but also for causing serious health issues and even death to its customers. She made the threats with dogged persistence. Over 19 days, she spam-called Illumia Wheelock’s landline and sent numerous WhatsApp messages, threatening to defame the clinic and its director.

67     Ng had similar antecedents under s 3(1)(b) of the PHA (Cap 256A). On 1 June 2021, she was convicted and sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for sending an email in her (older) sister’s name to her sister’s colleagues, calling her sister a crazy killer murderer; she was also sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment on another charge for posting her sister’s photograph on a Facebook profile with a caption insinuating that her sister had many affairs and was a murderer.

68     The prosecution submitted that in light of the aggravating factors, an uplift from the previous sentences imposed was necessary, and a custodial term of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. I accepted the submission of the prosecution. Ng’s persistent harassment of the clinic and its director was egregious and warranted a term of imprisonment. Also, an uplift from the sentences she received previously was appropriate on account of the principle of escalation. I decided that a modest escalation to 6 weeks’ imprisonment would suffice. Despite the persistent harassment by Ng, it did not appear that her acts had caused any particularly serious harm, apart from complaints by the clinic’s customers that their landline was always engaged (at \[16\] above).

##### (5)   Failing to comply with EPO

69     An offence under s 10(1)(b) of the PHA 2014 is punishable with a fine not exceeding $5,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both. As the charge was an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the CPC 2010, the offender may be sentenced to “2 times the amount of punishment” (under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC 2010).

70     The prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold had been crossed for this offence. Ng behaved with a blatant disregard for the law. Immediately on the same day of receiving a copy of the EPO from the victim, she embarked on a course of conduct of breaching the order. Her offending was persistent, and she repeatedly breached the EPO on over 28 occasions.

71     Ng had antecedents which showed a poor history of lack of compliance with court orders:

> (a)     On 8 January 2015, she was ordered to undergo treatment under a mandatory treatment order (“**MTO**”) for one year, after pleading guilty to a charge under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter for contravening a Personal Protection Order (“**PPO**”) which restrained her from using family violence against her mother, by slapping her mother on the back of her head. Four other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, three of which related to contravening the PPO in relation to her mother.

> (b)     On 7 January 2016, Ng was again ordered to undergo treatment under an MTO for one year after pleading guilty to a charge of contravening a PPO by slapping her mother twice, on her left and right cheek. One other charge for contravening the PPO was taken into consideration for sentencing.

> (c)     On 24 June 2020, Ng was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for a charge of contravening a PPO by calling her mother and threatening to stab her, sending a doctored photograph of her mother to her mother’s employer and using vulgarities against her mother. Another charge of contravening a PPO in relation to Ng’s sister was taken into consideration for sentencing.

> (d)     On 1 June 2021, Ng was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment for a charge of contravening a PPO which restrained her from using family violence against her (older) sister, by posting her sister’s photograph on a Facebook profile with a caption insinuating that her sister had many affairs and was a murderer. Ng was also sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for another charge of contravening a PPO by making multiple phone calls to her mother, telling her mother to will all her assets to Ng, and that her mother would be knocked down by cars (if she refused to do so).

72     In light of Ng’s history of poor compliance with court orders, and taking reference from the custodial terms previously imposed on Ng for her offences of contravening protection orders under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter, the prosecution submitted for a custodial term of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment. I accepted the submission of the prosecution. In my judgement, a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

##### (6)   Consecutive sentences and global sentence

73     I also accepted the submission of the prosecution that it would be appropriate for the sentences for the theft charge (s 380 Penal Code), the charge of dishonestly obtaining services valued at $5,103 (s 420A Penal Code) and the charge of making threatening communications (s 3(1)(b) PHA (Cap 256A)) to be ordered to run consecutively. These were distinct offences committed against different victims on separate occasions.

74     The global sentence arrived at was thus 9 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment. In my judgement, such sentence would be proportionate to the overall culpability of Ng’s offending conduct and the harm caused, and is not a crushing sentence.

### Sentence imposed

75     In summary, the sentences imposed were as follows:
