### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to two charges:

> MCN 900158/2020

> “_You, are charged that you, on 17 June 2018, at or about 6.50am, around the vicinity of 14 Flower Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Lek Swee Khee, to wit, by throwing punches towards his head and shoulder and hitting him with your helmet, knowing that you are likely to cause hurt to the said Lek Swee Khee, resulting in the said Lek Swee Khee raising his forearms to block the blows from you, falling to the ground and hitting his head against a wall, thereby causing the said Lek Swee Khee to sustain: a. swelling and bruising on his right forearm; and b. fractures of the distal radius and ulnar styloid on his right wrist, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).”_

> MCN 900159/2020

> “_You, are charged that you, on 17 June 2018, at or about 7.00am, around the vicinity of 14 Flower Road, Singapore, with intent to cause alarm to one Lee Sai Peng, did use abusive behaviour towards him, to wit, by shouting towards the said Lee Sai Peng and chasing the said Lee Sai Peng along the vicinity of 14 Flower Road, thereby causing alarm to the said Lee Sai Peng and you have hereby committed an offence under Section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Chapter 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) and punishable under Section 3(2) of the same Act_.”

2       At the conclusion of the trial, the Accused was convicted on both the charges. His sentences were as follows:-

> (a)     MCN 900158/2020 - 12 weeks’ imprisonment

> (b)     MCN 900159/2020 – Fine of $2,000 (in default, two weeks’ imprisonment)

3       The Accused filed an appeal against conviction and sentence.

## Undisputed Facts

4       The offences arose from an incident which took place in the early hours of the morning on 17 June 2018 along Flower Road, Singapore, between one Mr Lek Swee Khee (“Mr Lek”) and the Accused. Apart from several documents which were admitted by consent, these facts were also undisputed[^1]:-

> (a)     At the material time, the Accused was self-employed and driving the motorcycle bearing license plated number FK 7053Y. Mr Lek was a taxi driver, driving motor taxi SHC 5034J;

> (b)     The incident location at Flower Road is a residential area, which includes terraced houses and a kindergarten located at 15, Flower Road. The road along Flower Road is a two-way road with one lane in each direction separated by a centre broken white line;

> (c)     On 17 June 2018 at about 6:50 am, Mr Lek was driving his motor taxi along Flower Road. At the same time, the Accused was riding his motorcycle in the opposite direction . Both the Accused and Mr Lek got into a verbal dispute over their shared use of the road;

> (d)     At about 7:00 am, one Ms May called “999”, informing “_I am staying here. One motorcycle and one taxi having argument and fighting. The motorcycle want to run away. Taxi still here_”. The incident location provided was 12, Flower Road, Singapore 549402[^2].

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       Mr Lek was not called as a witness. He had passed away and a copy of his death certificate was tendered in court[^3]. Two police statements of Mr Lek, recorded under section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68, were admitted into evidence by agreement[^4]. The content of these statements will be dealt with in greater detail in the course of these grounds.

6       Notwithstanding the absence of the late Mr Lek as a witness, the Prosecution’s case contained evidence from three eye-witnesses in the form of residents of Flower Road who saw an encounter between a motorcyclist and a taxi driver that early morning of 17 June 2018. Even though they were unable to identify who the motorcyclist was in court, there was no dispute that the motorcyclist was the Accused[^5]; and the taxi driver was the late Mr Lek.

7       Medical reports and evidence from attending doctors in respect of the injuries sustained by Mr Lek arising from his encounter with the Accused on 17 June 2018 were also presented in court in support of the Prosecution’s case.

### PW 1 Low Ser Mui Margaret

8       The first witness of fact was PW1 Low Ser Mui Margaret (“Mdm Low”), a tour guide of 40-over years and long-time resident at 10G Flower Road, having stayed there for about 63 years.

9       She testified that at about 6 plus am on 17 June 2018 when she was in her house, she heard “_argument voices_” outside. When she went out to have a look, she saw an argument between two men[^6] – one was a taxi driver and the other was one who was riding a motorcycle[^7].

10     Mdm Low testified that the motorcyclist was “_angry and quite aggressive_”[^8]; he spoke in an “_angry tone and was very loud_”[^9], used abusive words whilst the taxi driver was trying to explain to him. She could tell that the taxi driver could not speak very much because he had “_no chance to_”[^10]. Subsequently, Mdm Low observed that the Accused started to be “_physical_” when he used his hands to push the chest of the taxi driver and then hit him[^11]. Mdm Low described the hitting as “_using his hands more like punching_”. Whilst she could not be sure which exact part of the taxi driver’s body was punched, she stated the punches were towards his shoulder and face area, adding that it happened very fast[^12]. She could not describe the force used but noticed that after being pushed and hit, the taxi driver fell on his right side, towards the wall[^13] and hurt his wrist[^14]. She could not see if he knocked his head but she was sure that the taxi driver had injured his wrist as she noticed that he had used his right hand to support himself[^15] and “_his fall with his right hand_”[^16]. She also saw the taxi driver rubbing his right wrist after the fall[^17]. Mdm Low further informed the Court that as the motorcyclist got angrier, he used the helmet which he held with his right hand[^18] to hit Mr Lek on the chest, shoulder area and face[^19]. The taxi driver did not retaliate but raised his arms (particularly his left arm) to defend himself[^20].

11     Mdm Low testified that when she saw that the motorcyclist was starting to get violent, she quickly ran into the house to get her phone. By that time, her male neighbour, one Mr Lee (PW6 Lee Sai Peng) from 12 Flower Road had come out of the house and she felt that she could leave the scene to get her phone[^21]. In the course of her testimony, Mdm Low tendered a series of photographs which she took with the camera on her mobile phone[^22].

12     After Mdm Low came out of her house with her phone, she saw Mr Lee telling the motorcyclist to stop hitting the taxi driver[^23]. However, the motorcyclist was “_still quite aggressive and …arguing with \[Mr Lee\]_”[^24]. Subsequently, Mdm Low heard Mr Lee tell the motorcyclist to wait for the police but the motorcyclist rode off.

### PW6 Lee Sai Peng

13     A similar scene along Flower Road was witnessed by PW6 Lee Sai Peng (“Mr Lee”) that morning. Mr Lee, a fishmonger has been a resident at 12 Flower Road since 1984 to date.

14     He testified that on 17 June 2018 at about 7 am[^25], after he had showered, he heard the sound of a motorcycle and a car on the road. It sounded like “_honkings and it was very noisy_”. At the balcony, Mr Lee saw “_a taxi and a motorcycle having an argument_”. When the argument became louder, he quickly woke his wife (PW5 Wong Chin Yin) and told her to call the police. He then went downstairs and opened the door. When he did so, he saw the “_taxi and motorcycle fighting_”. Mr Lee informed the Court that the taxi driver was punched twice on the head[^26] by the motorcyclist who even used his motorcycle helmet to hit the face of the taxi driver. He described that he saw the taxi driver trying to “_defend his face_”[^27] using his hands. Mr Lee testified that he saw the taxi driver fall to the ground[^28] as a result of being hit by the motorcyclist[^29]. When questioned in cross-examination, Mr Lee added that the taxi driver fell on his side, against the white-coloured low wall seen in Exhibit P5-3[^30].

15     Mr Lee then intervened. He ran over to ask why they were fighting and said to the motorcyclist: “_You cannot hit people, so if there’s anything, we could talk nicely_”.[^31] However, the motorcyclist was unhappy and asked why Mr Lee was being a busybody before scolding him “_Fuck you, please do not be a busybody_”[^32]. He wanted to hit Mr Lee but Mr Lee ran off. The motorcyclist chased him before riding off on his motorcycle[^33].

### PW5 Wong Chin Yin

16     Mr Lee’s account of the incident was corroborated by his wife, PW5 Wong Chin Yin (“Ms Wong”). She was sleeping that morning when her husband, Mr Lee shouted from the balcony of their bedroom on the second level of the house for her to wake up quickly to call the police about an “_argument or fight_” taking place. It was about 7 am[^34]. Ms Wong then called the police[^35].

17     In her testimony, Ms Wong informed the Court that when she went downstairs and out of the door to her house, she saw the “_taxi uncle_” holding on to his hand. She saw her husband telling the motorcyclist not to fight, adding that the motorcyclist was very fierce to her husband. She also saw the motorcyclist “_chasing \[her\] husband_”, and scolding him[^36]. The tone and volume of the motorcyclist was described by Ms Wong to be “_very fierce_” and the motorcyclist “_kept saying something…kept scolding_”[^37].

18     In the course of their case, the Prosecution also tendered medical reports of Mr Lek’s injuries. The doctors who attended to Mr Lek’s injuries were also called as witnesses.

## The Defence’s Case

19     The Accused did not dispute the fact that he was present at the scene that day. He was going home from a friend’s place at Highland Road that morning when an accident occurred between his motorcycle and Mr Lek’s taxi. Both drivers alighted from their vehicles and had a “_face-to-face conversation_[^38]”. Whilst the Accused admitted to using profanities in the course of the “_conversation_”, he denied punching Mr Lek or hitting Mr Lek with his helmet. He claimed that he had merely “_nudged_” or “_pushed_” using his right forearm[^39] which hit Mr Lek’s chest area and it was a “_reflex action_”[^40]. The Accused denied that Mr Lek had fallen down[^41].

20     In respect of the incident involving PW6 Mr Lee Sai Peng, the Accused admitted that he had used vulgarities but they were not directed at PW6 Mr Lee. The Accused also denied chasing PW6 Mr Lee and stated that it was impossible for him to have done so because of an injury to his left leg sustained in 1996[^42].

## Assessment of the Prosecution’s Evidence

### Credible Testimonies of Eye-Witnesses

21     I found PW1 Mdm Low Ser Mui Margaret, PW5 Ms Wong Chin Yin and PW6 Mr Lee Sai Peng to be credible witnesses; their testimonies were reliable. The account of these witnesses were clear, coherent and logical. Their individual accounts were not bereft of details and stood up to cross-examination by Defence Counsel. They were straightforward in the giving of their evidence and were not contrived. The existence of photographs taken by Mdm Low of the scene that morning with her camera phone was an expression of such spontaneity; as were the two calls made to the police by PW5 Ms Wong.

22     There was no tendency to exaggerate the role of the Accused in the incident or what they had seen that morning. None of the witnesses positively identified the Accused in court as the motorcyclist they saw punching or arguing with the taxi driver that morning. PW1 Mdm Low was not afraid to say she was not able to recall events because of the time[^43]; she also candidly admitted that she was not able to recall if she saw Mr Lek hitting his head against the wall[^44]. PW5 Ms Wong was forthright in saying that she did not hear the exchange between her husband, PW6 Mr Lee and the motorcyclist[^45]. PW6 Mr Lee was able to agree that in his conversation with the Accused, the latter had not said anything threatening or intimidating to him[^46]. I was satisfied that these witnesses were truthful witnesses who testified to what they had personally seen and heard.

23     Their accounts were consistent with each other in material aspects. What was materially consistent in the accounts of PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee were the following:-

> (a)     Both these witnesses witnessed the Accused assaulting Mr Lek on the region of Mr Lek’s head/face area;

> (b)     They saw the Accused using his helmet to hit Mr Lek;

> (c)     Both of then observed Mr Lek using his hands to block the Accused’s blows;

> (d)     They both saw Mr Lek fall to the ground.

24     Defence Counsel highlighted certain discrepancies between the evidence of PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee. These discrepancies related to the positions where the Accused and Mr Lek were standing at the time of the alleged assault, where PW6 Mr Lee was when he observed the Accused’s assault of Mr Lek as well as who were the persons with Mr Lek when the ambulance arrived[^47]. However, I was of the view that these were minor discrepancies which did not affect the value and/or credibility of the testimonies of PW1 Mdm Low or PW6 Mr Lee; they were not material in nature. As Prosecution rightly pointed out, the situation along Flower Road that morning was a “dynamic” one, not static in nature such that two witnesses may describe a scene in an exact same manner at any one time[^48].

25     Further, in assessing a witness’ testimony, it is accepted that allowances must be made for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection[^49]. Between witnesses, it would similarly not be unreasonable to expect inconsistencies in their testimonies, particularly if they related to non-material aspects of the incident. I agree with the Prosecution that such minor inconsistencies are themselves reflection of the fact that the testimonies are candid accounts emanating from individuals with imperfect recollection[^50].

26     Based on the evidence, I was satisfied that these three witnesses had a good view of the incident. The encounter between the Accused and Mr Lek took place along Flower Road, near a kindergarten[^51]. PW1 Mdm Low was residing at 10-G Flower Road whilst PW 5 Ms Wong and PW6 Mr Lee were residing at 12 Flower Road – houses which were directly opposite the kindergarten when they were disturbed by the commotion taking place outside their homes. It was from their homes when they stepped out to check what was happening. There was no evidence of any form of physical obstruction in their line of sight to the incident. I had no doubt in my mind that these eye-witnesses would have had a good view of what was going on between the Accused and Mr Lek from where they were that morning.

27     There was no basis for the suggestion that PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee may have had their minds “_coloured_” by Mr Lek such that they had a non-objective recollection of the incident[^52]. In the portions of the transcript referred to by the Defence in the closing submissions, the essence of Mdm Low‘s interaction with Mr Lek whilst waiting for the ambulance appeared to relate to the genesis of the incident and how the Accused had been abusive rather than to the fact of the physical assault. Even if it may be the case that Mdm Low’s understanding of how the incident happened was from what Mr Lek had told her, it did not mean that her account of the physical violence she said she had witnessed must have been coloured by that conversation with Mr Lek. Mdm Low categorically denied that when on the stand[^53].The fact that Mdm Low knew the name of Mr Lek was also not conclusive of any fact.

28     It was the same for PW6 Mr Lee – the fact that Mr Lek had told PW6 Mr Lee that “_his legs turned into jelly_” did not mean that PW6 Mr Lee had not observed the same and/or was merely presenting Mr Lek’s account as his own. Further, the evidence of Mr Lee was on the whole, corroborated by PW5 Ms Wong, who called the police upon being alerted to a situation by her husband, PW6 Mr Lee.

29     These witnesses had no motive to falsely implicate the Accused in the offences and/or to exaggerate his role in the incident whether separately or collectively. Neither the Accused nor Mr Lek were known to these witnesses prior to the incident. In any case, no such suggestion was made by the Defence.

### Statements of Mr Lek Swee Khee

30     Mr Lek was not present in court to testify of the events on 17 June 2018 since he had passed on in November 2019 due to causes unrelated to the incident. In place of Mr Lek’s oral and direct testimony, the Prosecution tendered the police statements of Mr Lek. In considering the weight to be placed on Mr Lek’s police statements, I was mindful at all times that Mr Lek was not present in court to be cross-examined; his evidence remained untested. Defence Counsel highlighted discrepancies between Mr Lek’s first and second police statements[^54] which she submitted was attributable to Mr Lek’s lack of credibility. These discrepancies did not escape me. However, I was not troubled by them.

31     What was clear and consistent in both the police statements was the fact that the Accused had used physical violence on him. This was the crux of his evidence which was maintained in both the statements. In Mr Lek’s first statement recorded on the day of the incident, Mr Lek informed the police that the Accused had “_punched \[him\] on the head multiple times and he even used his helmet to whack me_”[^55]. In a more detailed statement recorded two days later (on 19 June 2018), Mr Lek stated that he was punched on his left cheek and left shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground and hitting his head against the wall of the “_childcare centre_”. Mr Lek further described that the Accused continued assaulting him (“_multiple punches were thrown at me_”) and all Mr Lek could do was to use his hands to protect himself[^56]. The core of Mr Lek’s evidence remained steadfast through both the statements.

32     I was able to place weight on Mr Lek’s police statements. The scene described by Mr Lek in his police statements was similar with the picture painted by the composite evidence of PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee – that of a fierce[^57] and angry[^58] motorcyclist physically assaulting a taxi driver, and who even at one point, used his motorcycle helmet to hit the taxi driver. The use of the helmet by the Accused was clearly mentioned by Mr Lek in the first police statement even though he appeared to be unsure of the fact in his subsequent police statement. However, that did not affect the core and credibility of Mr Lek’s account. Whilst Mr Lek’s police statements on their own may not be reliable or credible since it had not withstood the rigours of cross-examination, the content of Mr Lek’s police statements was amply corroborated by the testimonies of PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee in material aspects.

33     It is true that Mr Lek was unclear in his police statements as to whether a collision had taken place between his taxi and the Accused’s motorcycle. However, I did not find this issue to be material. Regardless of whether there was a collision between the Accused’s motorcycle and Mr Lek’s taxi – what was undisputed (and more crucial) was that both the Accused and Mr Lek alighted from their respective vehicles and a meeting ensued between them. It was at this meeting between the two drivers that an incident took place on which the charges against the Accused had been brought.

34     In a total consideration of the evidence adduced in the Prosecution’s case, even if I were to disregard Mr Lek’s police statements entirely on the basis that these statements contained “_completely contradictory information_”[^59] and thus no weight should be placed on them, there was strong, reliable evidence before the court from other Prosecution witnesses that the Accused had assaulted Mr Lek on the morning in question.

### Medical Evidence

35     Apart from the content of the police statements of Mr Lek and the evidence of independent witnesses, the medical evidence adduced in the trial further corroborated the fact that Mr Lek had been assaulted. The injuries found on Mr Lek by doctors who attended to him after the incident were consistent with the manner in which Mr Lek had been assaulted, as described by himself in his police statements and observed by PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee.

#### PW2 Dr Tan Lin Ling

36     PW2 Dr Tan Lin Ling (“Dr Tan”), a doctor at the Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, testified that she saw swelling and bruising discolouration on the right forearm and the right hand of Mr Lek when she examined him about one hour after the incident on 17 June 2018. There was also tenderness on right wrist movement. The injuries were documented in a medical report dated 28 April 2020[^60]. Mr Lek also complained of giddiness prior to seeing Dr Tan[^61].

37     In her evidence, Dr Tan stated that Mr Lek had informed her that he was assaulted by a motorcyclist outside the vehicle in the morning at around 6:45 to 6:50 am. He was hit “_by fist_” and motorcycle helmet and he fell to the ground a few times with the assault continuing. Mr Lek told her that he remembered hitting his head against the wall and ground. He also blocked the blows with his right arm[^62]. Dr Tan testified that the injuries she observed on Mr Lek were consistent with Mr Lek’s account of how he had sustained the injuries.

#### PW4 Dr Sean Weiren Ong

38     PW4 Dr Sean Weiren Ong (“Dr Ong”) who saw Mr Lek 5 days after the incident at the Hand and Microsurgery Section outpatient clinic of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, noticed swelling and bruising around Mr Lek’s right wrist. X-rays showed fractures of the distal radius and ulna styloid i.e. a wrist fracture. The observations were documented in a medical report[^63]. In a clarification medical report[^64] and in his oral evidence, Dr Ong testified that it was likely that Mr Lek’s injury was caused by Mr Lek breaking a fall with the injured hand, due to the fracture pattern seen on the X-ray[^65]. The injury on Mr Lek thus corroborated what PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee had observed of Mr Lek and what Mr Lek himself stated – that the Accused’s assault on Mr Lek caused him to fall. It was in that process that Mr Lek attempted to break the fall with his right hand.

39     Defence Counsel submitted that the doctors had opined that it was possible for the injury on Mr Lek’s wrist to be caused by a collision between two vehicles[^66]. Even if it was possible, on the evidence presented, I did not find this to be in the least probable. In the first place, it had not even been established that there had been a collision between the Accused’s motorcycle and Mr Lek’s taxi on the morning in question. The evidence surrounding this fact was inconclusive, going by the different accounts of the witnesses, the police and even between the Accused and Mr Lek. In any case, both PW2 Dr Tan and PW4 Dr Ong had testified that such a wrist injury would usually be due to a fall, rather than a collision between vehicles[^67].

40     Taking the Defence’s case at its highest that there was a collision that took place between the Accused’s motorcycle and Mr Lek’s taxi, given the nature of Mr Lek’s injury, Dr Ong was clear in his evidence that such fractures would usually be observed in collisions of high impact and high speed. There was no evidence as to the speeds the two vehicles were travelling at; there was no suggestion that either vehicle was travelling at a high speed along Flower Road which was within a residential area. I found this possible cause of injury to Mr Lek’s hand as put forward by the Defence to be fanciful and highly speculative.

### Section 323 Penal Code Charge

41     On the strength of the Prosecution’s case, I was amply satisfied that the elements of the charge under section 323 of the Penal Code were made out against the Accused.

> (a)     The act of the Accused punching Mr Lek in the head/face and shoulder area and hitting Mr Lek with his helmet was witnessed by PW1 Mdm Low and PW6 Mr Lee. Their eye-witness accounts were consistent with Mr Lek’s description in his police statements. The account of Mr Lek in his police statements was repeated to PW2 Dr Tan and PW4 Dr Ong at or about the time of the incident. The medical reports and testimonies of the doctor were good, objective evidence of Mr Lek’s injuries;

> (b)     In assaulting Mr Lek, the Accused must know that he would likely cause hurt to Mr Lek. The actions of the Accused towards Mr Lek caused Mr Lek to use his arms to block the blows to protect himself, and then falling to the ground and hitting his head against the wall; and

> (c)     The actions of the Accused caused hurt to Mr Lek when he sustained swelling and bruising on his right forearm and fractures of the distal radius and ulnar styloid on his right wrist, amongst other injuries. The hurt suffered by Mr Lek was a direct result of the Accused’s use of violence on Mr Lek.

42     The Accused’s defence was one of denial. Since it was never the Defence’s case that the hurt caused was by accident or that the Accused had acted in the manner described by the Prosecution but did not have the intention to cause hurt and/or the knowledge that he would cause hurt by his actions, I was not troubled by Defence’s submission that the Prosecution had failed to put its case to the Accused[^68].

### Section 3(1)(a) POHA charge

43     As for the charge under section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) charge, PW6 Mr Lee testified that after he had seen the Accused and Mr Lek in an argument from his balcony, he quickly woke his wife up and asked her to call the police. When he was downstairs, PW6 Mr Lee testified that the saw the Accused punching Mr Lek. He then went over to where the Accused and Mr Lek was and told the Accused that he should not hit people. Thereafter, the Accused became very fierce towards him and scolded “_fuck you_” to Mr Lee and told him not to be a busybody. The Accused then chased him along Flower Road before riding off.

44     I found this aspect of PW6 Mr Lee’s evidence to be well-corroborated by:-

> (a)     The police statement of Mr Lek, where he informed the police that the Accused chased Mr Lee and wanted to hit him[^69]; and

> (b)     PW5 Ms Wong, who testified that she saw the Accused being “_very fierce to \[her\] husband and shouted something_”[^70] and then witnessed the Accused chasing her husband along Flower Road.

45     The testimonies of PW6 Mr Lee and PW5 Ms Wong in respect of the POHA charge were reliable, particularly when viewed in the context of how the events that morning developed.

46     From the start of the incident after he alighted from his vehicle, the Accused appeared hostile. Repeated and constant references to the Accused as the one who was “_fierce_”[^71], “_aggressive_”[^72], “_loud_”[^73] were made by these Prosecution witnesses, including PW1 Mdm Low, who heard and saw the encounter between the Accused and Mr Lek. It was essentially such alarming behaviour displayed by the Accused which prompted PW5 Ms Wong to make two calls to the police that morning. When PW6 Mr Lee tried to intervene to calm things down, it was thus not surprising that the Accused turned his hostility to him. I agreed with the Prosecution that PW6 Mr Lee’s account of the Accused’s behaviour towards him was consistent with the evidence of the Accused’s constant aggression from the moment he assaulted Mr Lek[^74].

47     In shouting at PW6 Mr Lee (with words which included vulgarities) and chasing him along Flower Road, I found that the Accused did intend to cause alarm to PW6 Mr Lee, and did cause him to be alarmed. The behaviour exhibited by the Accused may be described as “_abusive_” in the ordinary meaning of the word.

48     I was not disturbed by some inconsistencies as highlighted by the Defence, be it in terms of the positions in which the parties involved were standing, for example how illogical it would be for the Accused to have to “_turn around_” to fight with PW6 Mr Lee[^75], certain aspects of PW5 Ms Wong’s evidence[^76] or how PW1 Mdm Low did not see the Accused chasing after PW6 Mr Lee[^77]. The fact that PW1 Mdm Low did not witness such an incident did not mean that it did not happen. As PW1 Mdm Low herself explained, that event may have taken place at the time when she had re-entered her house to get her camera[^78].

49     In my view, these discrepancies highlighted by the Defence pertained to peripheral matters. It should be reiterated that allowances must be made for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. What was material was the fact that the Accused’s act of chasing PW6 Mr Lee was not PW6 Mr Lee’s lone assertion but it was an event that had been witnessed by PW5 Ms Wong and similarly described in Mr Lek’s statement to the police. I was satisfied as to the truth of the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses.

## Defence’s Case

50     The Defence’s case did not cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s evidence. The Accused’s account of events was against the weight of the evidence.

51     The Accused’s claims that he made contact with Mr Lek only when he had nudged, pushed or shoved Mr Lek in the encounter were notably absent from any of his police statements[^79] recorded under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”). Even the Accused’s long statement[^80] recorded under section 22 of the CPC just three days after the incident was lacking in detail even though it was a perfect opportunity for him to give his version of events. Yet on the stand in the course of trial, three years later, the Accused appeared to be able to give a full and complete account of the incident that morning. I did not accept the Accused’s version of events given in court.

52     The claim by the Accused that he was angry and had uttered vulgarities in the presence of PW6 Mr Lee but had not directed them at PW6 Mr Lee[^81] who was standing right in front of him was not believable. It was clear from the evidence that the Accused was angry and aggressive throughout the entire incident. The Accused admitted that he alighted from his vehicle and walked towards Mr Lek because he wanted to confront him[^82]. At that point, the Accused appeared angry and had already used profanities on Mr Lek[^83]. He was in the midst of confronting Mr Lek when PW6 Mr Lee intervened. Judging by the choice of words used by the Accused – scolding vulgarities and asking PW6 Mr Lee not to be a busybody - it was clear that the Accused meant his words for PW6 Mr Lee.

53     The Accused’s assertion that he had an old leg injury (sustained 25 years ago in 1996) which made it impossible for him to chase after PW6 Mr Lee that morning, was also a bare one. No medical report or doctor’s memo were tendered in support of the Accused’s physical condition despite two operations[^84]. I agreed with the Prosecution that this purported knee injury was a convenient and unsubstantiated excuse[^85] used by the Accused to bolster his defence.

### Police Investigations

54     As part of their case, the Defence highlighted the following matters:

> (a)     The inadequacy in investigations conducted by PW7 IO Ethan Low Kiang Hun (“IO Ethan”), the duty Investigation Officer on duty on the day of the incident[^86];

> (b)     The inadequacy in investigations conducted by PW3 IO Junaidi Bin Abdul Kadir (“IO Junaidi”), the current Investigating Officer of the case[^87].

55     In my view, the Defence had overstated certain positions in relation to the above:-

> (a)     IO Ethan Low may not have recorded a statement from the FIR caller but this was not an issue since PW5 Ms Wong was the FIR caller and had come to court as a witness; her evidence had been duly tested under cross-examination;

> (b)     IO Ethan was also questioned on why he did not obtain an explanation from Mr Lek in respect of discrepancies in his police statement. Whilst the precise wording of the content of the second statement of Mr Lek may not have been recorded in a manner preferred by the Defence, I found that IO Ethan had sought details of the incident from Mr Lek, as was obvious from the length of the second statement. IO Ethan also explained that he had sought a clarification from Mr Lek in respect of the use of the helmet[^88];

> (c)     As for IO Junaidi, he had checked and confirmed that there was no closed-circuit television (CCTV) in the vicinity of Flower Road where the incident had taken place[^89];

> (d)     in respect of the lack of investigations in relation to damage to the motorcycle and taxi and the possibility of an in-car camera footage in the taxi, these investigations, even if undertaken, would likely have been inconsequential. As mentioned, it was immaterial whether a collision had taken place between the Accused’s motorcycle and Mr Lek’s taxi since the scrutiny and focus of the court would be on the conduct of the Accused after he stopped and alighted from his vehicle along Flower Road;

> (e)     I agree with the Prosecution that Defence’s allegation of bias[^90] was a serious one and one which was made without basis. Nothing may be made of IO Junaidi posing a question in the way he did to PW4 Dr Ong since it would be entirely within PW4 Dr Ong’s professional knowledge as well as prerogative to answer the query posed in the affirmative or in the negative.

56     Even if there were lapses in the investigations as put forward by the Defence, I was not overly troubled since I did not find these aspects to be crucial to the crux of the case. The inadequacy of investigations in these areas did not affect the credibility or probative value of the existing evidence produced in court by the Prosecution. In any event, the Prosecution’s case stands (or falls) by the evidence they adduce; it is their burden to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court’s duty would be to assess and weigh all the evidence presented and to arrive at a finding of guilt or innocence at the end of each case, based on the evidence before it.

## Decision of the Court at Close of the Case

57     Having considered the totality of the evidence and the strength of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that that Prosecution had proved both the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore convicted the Accused on both the charges.

## The Sentence Imposed

58     Upon conviction, I sentenced the Accused to:

> (a)     Section 323 Penal Code (MCN 900158/2020) - 12 weeks’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Section 3(1)(a) POHA (MCN 900159/2020) – Fine of $2,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment).

## Sentencing Considerations

### A case of Road-Rage

59     In my view, this was a case of road-rage. There was honking heard by PW6 Mr Lee who was in the house and it was “_very noisy_”[^91] prior to him witnessing an argument between the Accused and Mr Lek. By then, both the Accused and Mr Lek had alighted from their vehicles over a situation involving the use of the road they were both travelling on. It was also an agreed fact that both the Accused and the victim got into a verbal dispute over their shared use of the road[^92]. It was in the course of this encounter that violence was used by the Accused. I agreed with the Prosecution that this was a case of road-rage, following the definition as set out in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span> at \[21\] (“_Lim Yee Hua_”) [^93]:

> _“… an incident of violence should be labelled as an episode of road rage violence only where the facts disclose violence perpetrated by road users as a result of real or perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared use of our roads. The litmus test for whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply for a particular offence of violence is thus whether the violence originates from differences arising through common road use. In other words, the harsh deterrent sanctions for road rage incidents only apply when road Page 2 of 7 users engage in violence specifically over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads. It follows that where incidents of violence happen to break out on the roads, but the cause of the violence has no nexus to the parties’ shared use of the roads, the road rage deterrent sentencing policy should not apply.”_

60     In this case, the violence exhibited had a clear nexus with the common use of the road by the Accused and Mr Lek, for which a deterrent sentence was called for. As highlighted by Prosecution, there is a strong element of public interest in deterring displays of hooliganism on the roads[^94].

### Level of Harm

61     The approach to sentencing was set out in _Lim Yee Hua_. As stated at \[26\] :-

> _In my judgment, the sentence imposed for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code involving road rage violence should be calibrated not only in accordance with the usual considerations that inform the sentencing of s 323 offences (_i.e._, the _harm_ caused by the offence, the _culpability_ of the offender, as well as the applicable non-offence-specific aggravating and mitigating factors), but also with due regard given to the _deterrent sentencing policy_ underlying the sentencing of road rage offences._

62     In the first step of the inquiry, I found that the harm in this case was moderate. Mr Lek received several punches to his head and was also hit with a helmet. When he fell, he hit his head against a wall. His injuries were swelling and bruising on his forearm and fractures of the distal radius and ulnar styloid on his right wrist - injuries which he suffered as a result of the Accused's assault. The victim was on 7 days outpatient sick leave but his hand was in cast for more than a month, with pain resolving only about two months after the incident[^95]. I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm in the case is in the middle range of Band 2.

### Level of Culpability

63     As for culpability, I found it to be high. In the course of the encounter, the evidence showed that the Accused was the aggressor in the incident - he was consistently described as "_aggressive_", speaking in an angry tone and was loud. From the evidence of the neighbours along Flower Road, as the Prosecution pointed out, it was a one-sided assault by the Accused on Mr Lek, who only blocked the blows with his hands. In this incident, there was no provocation from Mr Lek; the Accused’s violence was disproportionate and uncalled for. I shared Prosecution’s view that the Accused exhibited thuggish behaviour throughout his encounter with Mr Lek[^96].

64     Further, the Accused inflicted violence on a vulnerable part of Mr Lek’s body - his head. As if using his bare hands to punch Mr Lek was insufficient, the Accused used his motorcycle helmet as a weapon in the assault.

65     There was some evidence from PW6 Mr Lee that the Accused smelt of alcohol. However, none of the other Prosecution witnesses had indicated that in their testimonies. Mr Lek similarly did not mention it in his police statements. The evidence surrounding the Accused’s possible intoxication was inconclusive and I did not consider this in increasing the culpability of the Accused.

## The Appropriate Sentence

### Section 323 Penal Code charge

66     In _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor_ \[2009\] 1 SLR (R) 115 at \[19\], it was stated that “_in typical cases of road rage where an accused is the aggressor, where the victim’s injuries are not particularly serious and the accused is a first-time offender pleading guilty, the sentences imposed range from one to three months’ imprisonment_”. As earlier mentioned, the harm caused in the case fell in the middle range of Band 2 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework[^97] which was applicable to offences under section 323 of the Penal Code. Band 2 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework provided for an imprisonment term of four weeks to six months.

67     Bearing in mind the sentencing guidelines in the above cases and having considered that the level of culpability of the Accused was high for the reasons stated, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment would be an appropriate and sufficiently deterrent sentence on the facts of the case. I was mindful that the Accused was a first-offender, with no criminal antecedents. However, there were no mitigating factors present in the Accused's favour. He had claimed trial to the charges and was not entitled to a discount in sentencing.

68     I did not place weight on the fact that Mr Lek was a taxi driver in arriving at the appropriate sentence, as submitted by the Prosecution[^98]. Whilst it was true that Mr Lek was a taxi driver and was driving a taxi on the day in question, he was not physically assaulted in the course of his work as a taxi driver. In sentencing, it was necessary to make a distinction between public transport workers who were physically assaulted in the course of their work, whether ferrying passengers in a bus or a taxi, and individuals who were victims of an assault whose occupation was a taxi driver or a bus driver. This is so since the concern was that “_public transport workers provided the larger community with an invaluable and essential service, and they \[had\] every right to work in a safe and secure environment_.[^99]”

69     Defence did not seek a non-custodial sentence. In respect of the length of the custodial term, Defence submitted two precedent cases to show that a sentence of five weeks’ would be the appropriate sentence[^100]_: Public Prosecutor v Sundaraju s/o Munusamy_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 188</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Holman Benjamin John_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 824</span>. However, I did not find these cases persuasive. Apart from the fact that both these offenders pleaded guilty, what was distinctive was that the violence used in these cases were not borne out of road-rage. That was a significant distinguishing factor between the precedents tendered and the current case.

### Section 3(1)(a) POHA charge

70     The punishment provided for this offence is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. I was of the view that a fine of $2,000 would be sufficient on the facts of the case. The Accused had shouted and used vulgarities at PW6 Mr Lee, chased after him. No other aggravating factors were present.

## Conclusion

71     Pending the hearing of the appeal, a stay of execution was granted on the imprisonment term. Accused had paid the fine imposed.
