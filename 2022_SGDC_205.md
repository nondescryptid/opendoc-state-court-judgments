Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Misuse of Drugs Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9162/2022/01.\]

9 September 2022

### District Judge Brenda Chua:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mohamed Aslam Khan Bin Gulab Khan, pleaded guilty to two charges, of which one charge is set out below:

> **DAC-911141-2022** (“**the Charge”)**

> You…are charged that you, on or before **30 March 2022**, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (“**MDA**”), to wit, **monoacetylmorphine**, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 7 May 2002 in Subordinate Court No. 24 vide DAC0011959/2002, convicted of an offence of consumption of a Specified Drug, to wit, Morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under s 33A(2) of the MDA.

> And further, that you, from **25 August 2021** to **24 October 2024**, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“**PA**”) which remission order was subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the PA. While the remission order was in effect you, on **30 March 2022**, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the PA, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **940** Days from **30 March 2022** to **24 October 2024** for this offence.

2       The other charge (DAC-900648-2022) to which the accused pleaded guilty was for an offence under section 28(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Chapter 188, 2010 Revised Edition) punishable under section 28(2)(b) read with section 28(3)(d)(i) of the Moneylenders Act (“the MLA charge”). The accused was liable for enhanced sentences under the PA for both the Charge and the MLA charge.

3       The accused admitted to and consented to two charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charges”). The TIC charges were for a similar offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA punishable under section 33A(2) of the MDA as well as another similar offence under section 28(2) of the Moneylenders Act punishable under section 28(2)(b) read with section 28(3)(d)(i) of the Moneylenders Act.

4       For the Charge, I sentenced the accused to an imprisonment term of nine years and three months and an enhanced sentence of 420 days’ imprisonment. For the MLA charge, I sentenced the accused to two years’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 310 days’ imprisonment.

5       I bore in mind the one-transaction rule and the totality principle as set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span>. The Charge and the MLA charge were committed on separate occasions, unrelated, and involved offences that invaded distinct legally protected interests. I ordered the sentences for the Charge and the MLA charge to run consecutively.

6       The global sentence was an imprisonment term of 11 years and three months’ imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 730 days’ imprisonment. I did not view the sentences as manifestly excessive. The accused is presently serving his sentence.

7       The accused has appealed against the sentence imposed for the Charge. He is not appealing against the sentence imposed for the MLA charge. As such, I set out here my reasons for the sentence imposed in respect of the Charge.

## Facts

8       The accused, a 51-year-old male Singapore citizen, admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. In the Statement of Facts:

> “**FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3rd CHARGE (DAC-911141-2022)**

> 3.    Following his arrest, the accused provided two bottles of his urine which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SG-22-04128-1 MOHAMED ASLAM KHAN BIN GULAB KHAN SXXX” and “C-SG-22-04128-2 MOHAMED ASLAM KHAN BIN GULAB KHAN SXXX” respectively in his presence. On 31 March 2022, the said urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) for analysis.

> 4.    On 5 April 2022, the HSA issued two certificates under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (“**MDA**”):

>> a)    Ng Xue Qin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis of the urine sample marked as “C-SG-22-04128-1 MOHAMED ASLAM KHAN BIN GULAB KHAN SXXX”, issued a certificate bearing Lab No. 2205279-AT-001 stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Monoacetylmorphine.

>> b)    Tan Joo Chin, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis of the urine sample marked as “C-SG-22-04128-2 MOHAMED ASLAM KHAN BIN GULAB KHAN SXXX”, issued a certificate bearing Lab No. 2205279-AT-002 stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Monoacetylmorphine.

> 5.    Monoacetylmorphine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

> 6.    The accused knowingly smoked “Panas”’ (a street name for diamorphine) sometime in early March 2022. On that occasion, he placed some “Panas” on an aluminum foil and used a lighter to heat the underside of the foil until fumes appeared. The accused then used a rolled-up paper to inhale the resultant fumes. Smoking ‘Panas’ using this method is known to the accused as “chasing”. The accused admitted that he had been smoking ‘Panas’ once a week since 1 December 2021. The accused’s urine samples were thus found to contain Monoacetylmorphine as a result of his consumption of diamorphine.

> 7.    The accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume Monoacetylmorphine. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

> 8.    Prior to the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 7 May 2002 in Subordinate Court No. 24 vide DAC0011959/2002, convicted of an offence of consumption of a Specified Drug, to wit, Morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) and punished under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date. The accused shall now be punished under s 33A(2) of the MDA.

> **BREACH OF CONDITIONAL REMISSION ORDER**

> 9.    Further, the accused was, from 25 August 2021 to 24 October 2024, subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“**PA**”) which remission order was subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the PA. While the remission order was in effect, the accused, on 30 March 2022, committed the aforesaid offence, and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the PA, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order. The accused is thus liable to be punished under s50T(1)(a) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **940 Days** from 30 March 2022 to 24 October 2024 for this offence.”

10     The accused also had many drug-related offences in 1992 and 1993, 1995 to 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2015, where he was placed under drug supervision or at the drug rehabilitation centre.

## Prescribed punishment for the Charge

11     The prescribed punishment for the Charge under section 33A(2) of the MDA is set out as follows:

> **Punishment for repeat consumption of specified drugs**

> **33A.**—(2)    Where a person who has been convicted under subsection (1), (1A) or (1B) is again convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(_b_), an offence of failure to provide a urine specimen under section 31(2), or an offence of failure to provide a hair specimen under section 31A(2), the person shall on conviction be punished with —

>> (a)    imprisonment for a term of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years; and

>> (b)    not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

12     Section 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 states that men who are more than 50 years of age at the time of infliction of the caning shall not be punished with caning. This is applicable to the accused, a 51-year-old male.

## The prosecution’s submission on sentence

13     The prosecution sought an imprisonment term of nine years and three months for the Charge. The prosecution highlighted that a six months’ uplift from the accused’s previous LT2 sentence of eight years and nine months’ imprisonment was warranted in view of the accused’s long history of drug-related offending. The prosecution did not ask for additional imprisonment in lieu of caning given that the offence already carried a long minimum term of imprisonment.

14     On the enhanced sentence, the prosecution submitted that the overall level of severity for the fresh offences was high and should be placed in Band 3 of the framework in _Abdul Mutalib Bin Aziman & ors v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> (“_Mutalib_”) at \[47\] and \[87(b)\]. In particular, the offence in the Charge was of a serious nature as it carried a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of seven years. An appropriate enhanced sentence should be between 2/3 to the full remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offence.

15     The maximum length of enhanced sentence that could be imposed on the accused for the LT2 offence was 940 days (section 50T(1)(a) of the PA). The enhanced sentence imposed should ordinarily not exceed the underlying sentence imposed for the fresh offence: _Mutalib_ at \[55\]. The aggregate length of the enhanced sentences should not exceed 1,066 days, as determined based on the date of the earliest offence committed (section 50T(2)(b) of the PA).

## Mitigation

16     The accused stated in his mitigation plea:

> “…As for my LT2 charge, I wish to state that I have tried my very best to refrain from taking drugs and I relapsed because I was influenced by friends around me. I realise that I have made a big mistake in my life and landed myself in prison again. I am very regretful and remorseful for what I have done and the hurt that I caused to my family and my wife. I just got married 5 months ago before I was arrested so I hope for a lighter sentence. I really want to change this time to prove to my family...”

## The court’s decision

17     The accused has a litany of drug-related antecedents. There must be specific deterrence. The Charge was an LT2 offence. The accused was a repeat offender who was convicted for LT2 in 2009 and 2015. The accused’s antecedents demonstrated a continuing pattern of reoffending. The “principle of escalation is aptly named not only because punishments meted out may escalate in severity, but also because it comes into play where the accused person’s antecedents display an escalating pattern of offending”: _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 174</span> at \[61\].

18     Given that this was the accused’s _third_ conviction for an LT2 offence, an uplift of six months from the sentence of eight years and nine months for his 2015 LT2 conviction was not manifestly excessive. Further, the accused had _another_ LT2 charge in this case that was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

19     The prosecution did not ask for additional imprisonment in lieu of caning, given that the offence carried a long minimum term of seven years’ imprisonment. The imprisonment term should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so: _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 215</span> (“_Amin_”) at \[53\] and \[58\]. In the context of a long sentence, an enhancement might have a relatively low deterrent value: also see _Amin_ at \[65\] to \[69\]. I agreed with the prosecution on this, and I did not impose additional imprisonment in lieu of caning.

20     On the enhanced sentence for the Charge, the prosecution submitted that the present case would fall within Band 3 of the _Mutalib_ framework. Taking guidance from _Mutalib_, the accused’s LT2 offence is a serious one of high gravity. The fresh LT2 offence was the same as the LT2 offence for which the remission order was given. Further, the fresh LT2 offence was committed shortly (at about seven months) from the start date of the remission order. This demonstrated the accused’s inclination to reoffend. The accused’s rehabilitative prospects were low. I found that this fell within Band 3 (high degree of severity) of the _Mutalib_ framework, and the appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence was 2/3 to the full remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the fresh LT2 offence.

21     Given the enhanced sentence for the MLA charge, care had to be taken to ensure that the aggregate length of the enhanced sentences for the Charge and the MLA charge did not exceed the maximum length of enhanced sentence which could be imposed on the accused. I calibrated the enhanced sentence for the Charge downwards and imposed an enhanced sentence of 420 days’ imprisonment. This did not exceed the main sentence for the Charge.

## Conclusion

22     Having considered the facts of the case, the prosecution’s submission on sentence and the accused’s mitigation, I imposed an imprisonment term of nine years and three months and an enhanced sentence of 420 days’ imprisonment for the Charge.

23     The accused is presently serving his sentence.
