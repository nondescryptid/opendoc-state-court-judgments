Criminal Procedure and Sentencing - Sentencing - Road Traffic Act - Driving without due care or reasonable consideration

13 April 2020

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, a 45-year-old British National male, was charged with two counts of driving without reasonable consideration under the section 65(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) \[“RTA”\] together with one count of failing to stop after an accident under s84(1)(a) read with s84(7) of the RTA. This was in respect of two separate road traffic accidents which had occurred on the same day on 10 November 2019 within a span of about five minutes and a distance of not more than one kilometre apart.

2       The first accident occurred at around 9.15am along Orchard Boulevard at the junction with Grange Road. The accused failed to keep a proper lookout ahead of him by driving his motor pick-up bearing vehicle no. JPT4189 (“the accused’s motor pick-up”) into the rear of motorcar no. SLF7823Y (“the first victim’s motorcar”), which was at the material time stationary and conforming to the traffic red light signal at the said junction (“the first accident”). Despite the accident, the accused drove off quickly as soon as the traffic light signal turned green.

3       The second accident happened at about 9.21am along Tanglin Road towards Orchard Road, near to the traffic light controlled T-junction with Rochalie Drive (and just after crossing Camp Road). The second victim was driving his motorcar no. SKR747D (“the second victim’s motorcar”) in his lane. Just after he had crossed the T-junction before the traffic light signal turned red, the accused’s motor pick-up suddenly came from the lane in the opposite direction at a high speed and veered into the path of the second victim’s motorcar. This resulted in a head-on collision between the accused’s motor pick-up and the second victim’s motorcar (“the second accident”). The impact caused the second victim’s motorcar to propel backwards for about 20 metres before coming to a stop.

4       As a consequence of his actions, damage was caused to the first victim’s motorcar for the first accident. For the second accident, besides serious damage being caused to the second victim’s motorcar, grievous hurt was caused to the second victim and the accused was therefore liable to a more severe punishment under s65(3)(a) of the RTA.

5       On 25 February 2020, the accused pleaded guilty before me to all the proceeded charges. As this case is the first to be decided under the newly amended s65 provision of the RTA which came into force on 1 November 2019, both the Prosecution and Defence requested for more time to submit on sentence and mitigation. I agreed and the further hearing date was fixed on 12 March 2020.

6       After hearing parties on their submissions on the appropriate sentence and the accused’s mitigation on 12 March, 27 March and 3 April 2020, I adjourned the matter to today to deliver my decision as well as my reasons in coming to my decision on sentence.

### Statement of Facts

8       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 15 February 2020 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offence of dangerous driving reads as follows:

> …

> First Information Report

> 4.    On 10th November 2019 at about 9.31 a.m., a member of the public called ‘999’ to report: “THERE IS AN ACCIDENT HERE NOW. A CAR IS SMOKING AND SOMEONE IS LAYING DOWN ON THE ROAD HERE.” The incident location provided was at Rochalie Drive and Tanglin Road junction. Upon receipt of the call, traffic police officers were despatched to the location and arrived at about 10 a.m..

> 5.    The Police received the following ‘999’ calls as well:

>> a.    At 9.37 a.m.: _I called earlier. Where are your officers? Please ask them to hurry._

>> _b_.    At 9.40 a.m.: _Accident between 2 cars. I think someone is injured_

>> c.    At 9.45 a.m.: _I called earlier. I think driver of jeep is intoxicated. Can you ask your officers to check?_

> Facts pertaining to DAC-900407-2020 & DAC-900408-2020

> First accident along Orchard Boulevard towards Grange Road with motorcar SLF 7823Y

> 6.    Investigations revealed that on 10th November 2019 at or about 9.15 a.m., the first victim, Tang Lee Lee, was driving her motorcar SLF 7823Y along Orchard Boulevard towards Grange Road, Singapore, a 3-lane road. She had just picked up four passengers, consisting of two adults and two children, from Claymore Hill and was driving to send them to their destination at Loewen Road. While she was driving along the leftmost lane of Orchard Boulevard before the junction with Grange Road, she stopped at the junction to conform to the traffic red light signal. Less than 30 seconds later, she felt an impact from the right rear portion of her motorcar. Upon impact, she immediately turned around and saw that the motor pick-up bearing registration number JPT 4189 driven by the defendant had collided into her motorcar. Her front passenger, one Caspar Kazimierz, informed her that the motor pick-up had collided into her motorcar. After ascertaining that none of her passengers (especially the children) was injured, she alighted from her motorcar with the intention of speaking to the defendant to ask for his particulars.

> 7.    Further investigations revealed that after she had knocked onto the front left passenger window of the defendant’s motor pick-up, the defendant wound down the window. She immediately told the defendant that he had collided into her motorcar, to which the defendant replied, “nevermind”. In turn, she asked the defendant to alight for the purpose of exchanging particulars. The defendant said that he would pull over to the side of the road. She told the defendant that he needed to switch on his hazard lights first to warn other motorists that there was an accident and to alight from his motor pick-up. However, as soon as the traffic light signal turned green, the defendant suddenly drove off - he did not alight at all. She had to take a few steps backwards for her safety to avoid being hit. After ascertaining that there was a damage to the right rear bumper of her motorcar, which was not serious, she drove her passengers to their destination. While she was driving along Tanglin Road towards Orchard Road after the junction of Rochalie Drive and Tanglin Road, she noticed that the defendant’s motor pick-up had crashed into another motorcar. Later that day, she made a Police report about the accident. Nobody was injured in this first accident.

> 8.    The defendant, by driving a motor pick-up bearing registration number JPT 4189, on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, by failing to keep a proper lookout ahead and colliding into the rear of motorcar bearing registration SLF 7823Y driven by Tang Lee Lee, which was stationary and confirming to the traffic red light signal on the left-most lane of the three-lane road, has thereby committed an offence under section 65(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) and punishable under section 65(5)(a) of the aforesaid Act.

> 9.    By virtue of the fact that the defendant failed to stop after being involved in an accident despite being requested to do so by Tang Lee Lee for the purpose of providing driver’s particulars, he has thereby committed an offence under section 84(1)(a) read with section 84(7) and punishable under section 131(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

> Facts pertaining to DAC-900409-2020

> Second accident along Tanglin Road towards Orchard Road after the junction of Rochalie Drive and Tanglin Road involving motorcar SKR 747D

> 10.    Investigations revealed that about 5 minutes after the first accident, the defendant was involved in another accident along Tanglin Road towards Orchard Road after the junction of Rochalie Drive and Tanglin Road involving a motorcar driven by the second victim, Leong Wen Sheng, Caleb.

> 11.    Further investigations revealed that the second victim was travelling along Tanglin Road towards Orchard Road after the junction of Rochalie Drive and Tanglin Road , which was a one lane, two-way road divided by single white-line. While the second victim was travelling on his lane, the defendant’s motor pick-up suddenly veered and encroached into his lane by driving against the flow of traffic from the opposite direction at a high speed. The second victim applied emergency brakes but was unable to avoid a collision. The defendant’s motor pick-up truck collided head-on into his motorcar, and the impact caused his motorcar to surge backwards before coming to a stop about 20 metres away. CCTV captured this accident and the relevant screenshots are reproduced below for ease of reference:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image4.png)

> 12.    The following damages were observed on the defendant’s motor pick-up as a result of the collision:

>> a.    Front bonnet dented and scratched

>> b.    Front portion grille ripped off, crumpled and broken

>> c.    Front windscreen was cracked

>> d.    Above the front left wheel sustained dents and scratches

>> e.    Rear left door sustained scratches and dents

> 13.    The second victim’s front bumper was crumpled and its windscreen was cracked:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image6.png)

> 14.    The second victim was conveyed to Singapore General Hospital (SGH). He sustained some pain over his back, was warded for three days (from 10 – 12 November 2019) and given hospitalization leave of 48 days (from 10 Nov – 27 Dec 2019). The medical report (dated 21November 2019) issued by Dr Ng Yeong Huei of SGH indicated that he had sustained a fracture to his lumbar spine (L4 superior endplate acute fracture with mild anterior wedging of L4 due to mild depression in the anterior aspect of the superior endplate). He was treated conservatively for his lumbar spine injury with a lumbar corset.

> 15.    At the time of accident, the weather was clear, road surface was dry and traffic volume was light.

> 16.    Mr Sherwin Beh, a Technical Investigator with LKK Auto Consultants Pte Ltd, in his report, concluded that he was unable to determine whether there was any possible mechanical failure to the defendant’s motor pick-up that may have contributed to the accident.

> 17.    The defendant, who had driven his motor pick-up JPT 4189 on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road by failing to have a proper control of his vehicle and causing it to veer to its right which resulted in a head-on collision with motorcar SKR 747D driven by Leong Wen Sheng, Caleb, which was travelling from the opposite direction, and as a result of the accident, the said Leong Wen Sheng, Caleb, sustained grievous hurt, has thereby committed an offence under section 65(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) and punishable under section 65(3)(a) of the aforesaid Act.

> 18.    The defendant was conveyed to SGH after the accident. He suffered hemoperitoneum, abdominal pain and chest pain as a result of the accident. He claims he was unable to remember what happened after the first accident and could not recall being involved in the second accident.

## SENTENCE

### Antecedents

10     The accused was untraced.

11     He had entered Singapore as a visitor via Tuas Second-Link on 9 November 2019.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

12     Prosecution tendered written submissions on the sentencing position sought by them. This included the victim impact statement (together with supporting documents provided by the victim) signed by the victim dated 3 March 2020.

13     In relation to the offence of careless driving causing grievous hurt under s65(1)(b) and punishable under s65(3)(a) of the RTA, Prosecution submitted for a sentence of three (3) months’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum five (5) years’ DQAC disqualification for all classes of vehicles (“DQAC”)**.**

14     In respect of the offence of careless driving _simpliciter_ under section 65(1)(b) punishable under section 65(5)(a) of the RTA, Prosecution submitted for a fine of $500 - $800 and two (2) months’ DQAC.

15     As regards the offence of failing to stop after an accident under s84(1) of the RTA, Prosecution was leaving sentence to the court.

#### Sentencing objective of the amended Road Traffic Act

16     Prosecution highlighted that s65(3)(a) of the RTA is a new punishment provision which came into effect on 1 November 2019 as part of a suite of extensive amendments to the RTA where Parliament expressed its strong intent to deter irresponsible driving. This was because the previous sentencing norms for irresponsible driving, whether under the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”) or the RTA, were inadequate.

17     Prior to 1 November 2019, the prescribed punishment for s65 of the RTA was “a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both”. In other words, by virtue of the amendments, when compared with the new s65 of the RTA for causing grievous hurt, Prosecution pointed out that the prescribed punishment for careless driving under s65(3)(a) of the RTA was increased by 5 times for fines and 4 times for the imprisonment term.

18     Prosecution drew my attention to the following parts of the Second Reading speech of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill No. 13/2019 by Mrs Josephine Teo, Second Minister for Home Affairs \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (8 July 2019) vol. 94)\]:

> To make our roads safer, _we need stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving._ We will do this by: _(a) enhancing the criminal penalties for irresponsible driving_; and (b) tightening the regulatory regime against irresponsible driving…

> However, _irresponsible driving remains a big concern_…

> Why is this a problem? Because irresponsible driving can have deadly consequences. Even if victims survive the accident, they, or their families, may suffer long-term problems – sometimes, medical; sometimes, permanent disabilities…

> Enforcement, education and road safety infrastructure must certainly continue to be improved. _But we also need stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving…_.

> I will start with our _enhanced approach towards irresponsible driving offences_. Today, irresponsible driving offences are prosecuted in two ways. One way is under the Penal Code, for Rash Act and Negligent Act. Another way is under the RTA, for Reckless or Dangerous Driving, and Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration. The penalties differ.

> For better clarity and consistence, we propose to _consolidate driving offences under the RTA._ We will also streamline the offences into two classes: the first category is Reckless or Dangerous Driving, which I will refer to as Dangerous Driving in the rest of the speech. The second category is Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration, which I will refer to as _Careless Driving_….

> Besides looking at the circumstances of the offence, our enhanced approach will also consider the _level of harm caused_. If the motorist causes more harm, the level of punishment will be higher.

> There will be _four levels of harm_: Death, _Grievous Hurt_, Hurt and Endangering Life. Such tiering of harm is not new in our laws – the Penal Code already has it.

> To summarise, we will enhance our overall approach to _penalise irresponsible driving_ depending on: _(a) the circumstances of the offence_ – whether it constitutes Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving; and _(b) the level of harm caused_ – whether they result in Death, Grievous Hurt, Hurt, or Endangering Life.

> Let me move on to the penalties themselves. Today, our penalties for irresponsible driving offences are generally less severe than on other jurisdictions….

> _We also need to raise sentencing norms for egregious irresponsible driving offences_, particularly those that result in death or some form of permanent disabilities.” \[Emphasis added\]

19     Hence, Prosecution submitted that it is clear from the Second Reading speech that the dominant sentencing consideration for careless driving is deterrence and that Parliament has sought to achieve the objective of deterrence by not merely enhancing the prescribed punishment for careless driving simpliciter, but also prescribing _distinct_ punishment provisions for the different degrees of hurt caused. It provided me with a summary table of the enhanced criminal penalties for careless driving from the Ministry of Home Affairs:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image8.png)

#### Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework for s65(3)(a) of the RTA

20     In coming to its proposed sentencing framework for causing grievous hurt due to careless driving, Prosecution submitted that there are two principal sentencing factors that affect the gravity of an offence punishable under s65(3)(a) of the RTA. They are (a) the nature and extent of grievous hurt caused by the careless driving and (b) the degree of an offender’s culpability for the careless driving.

21     In relation to the nature and extent of grievous hurt caused by the careless driving, Prosecution drew the court’s attention to s64(8) of the RTA which states that the phrase “grievous hurt” in s65 of the RTA has the same meaning as in section 320 (except paragraph (aa)) of the PC. As such Prosecution submitted that the seriousness of the “grievous hurt” underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s65(3)(a) of the RTA. This is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence which can guide the courts in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing: See _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[55(a)\]).

22     Next, s320 of the PC encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt, ranging from a simple fracture, to a victim being unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for 20 days, to privation of any member or joint. Even within a particular type of grievous hurt, there can still be different degrees of severity which is relevant to sentencing – e.g. fracture of the victim’s finger (less serious) compared to fracture of the victim’s spinal column (more serious).

23     As such, Prosecution suggested that the harm caused by the offence might be categorised into one of three levels: e.g., slight, moderate or severe.

24     Apart from the nature and extent of grievous hurt caused, Prosecution further submitted that other indicators of harm (both potential and actual) caused by the careless driving are also relevant in sentencing: See _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span> at \[47\] (_“Stansilas”_). A non-exhaustive list of such indicators include the following:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image9.png)

25     In terms of an offender’s culpability, culpability has been defined as “a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by the offender’s actions and \[is\] assessed chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act”: See _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> (_“Koh Thiam Huat”_).

26     In the context of careless driving under s65 of the RTA, Prosecution was of the view that an offender’s culpability should be assessed based on whether his manner of driving has been particularly careless and that his culpability should be enhanced if the careless driving was committed under aggravating circumstances, such as the following:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image10.png)

27     In cases where there are two principal offence-specific sentencing factors that would affect the seriousness of a crime (typically “harm” and “culpability”), Prosecution highlighted that the courts have usually applied the sentencing matrix approach. This included offences under the RTA: E.g. _Stansilas_ at \[74\], \[78\] (s67 of the Road Traffic Act). Further, as explained by the High Court in _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> (_“Logachev”_); at \[75\]–\[80\], the ‘sentencing matrix’ approach involves the following four steps to arrive at the sentence for an individual charge:

> a.     Identifying the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender’s culpability (**Step 1**);

> b.     Identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range (**Step 2**);

> c.     Identifying the appropriate starting point within that indicative sentencing range (**Step 3**); and

> d.     Adjusting the starting point to take into account aggravating and mitigating factors specific to an offender (**Step 4**).

28     In determining the indicative sentencing ranges under step 3, Prosecution added that the courts have consistently taken into account the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament: See _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> (“_Poh Boon Kiat_”) at \[77\]). This is because as stated at \[60\] of _Poh Boon Kiat_:

> \[60\]…the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence and that the sentencing judge ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament…Put another way, the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is careful explored in determining the appropriate sentence…

29     Following from that, Prosecution proposed a sentencing matrix for offenders convicted under s65(3)(a) of the RTA after trial for the court’s consideration:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image11.png)

30     Prosecution urged the court not to adopt the sentencing framework decided in _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 18</span> (_“Tang Ling Lee”_) even though it was a case which dealt with causing grievous hurt under s338(b) of the PC. Under this provision, offenders who drove negligently and thereby caused grievous hurt to the victim shall be punished with imprisonment, which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both. In essence, the prescribed punishment for s338(b) of the PC is the same as that in s 65(3)(a) of the RTA save for the mandatory disqualification order from driving for at least 5 years for an offence committed under s65(3)(a) of the RTA.

31     In _Tang Ling_ Lee, the High Court had issued a sentencing guideline judgement for s338 of the PC where the offence was committed in the context of a road traffic accident and laid down the following sentencing framework:

32     Prosecution argued that sentencing framework in _Tang Ling Lee_ should not be adopted to s65(3)(a) of the RTA for the following reasons:

> (a)     The offence in s338 of the PC is not confined to road traffic cases only – it covers a very diverse range of scenarios that causes grievous hurt, for instance, “killer litter”, as well as acts endangering the life of (i) a child, (ii) another person during a dispute, a patient during treatment, or (iii) NS men during training: _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (3rd edn) from pp 323 – 328. The prescribed punishment in s338 of the PC must thus cater for the different types of factual scenarios – where there may be a vast range of culpability caused by negligent acts;

> (b)     The diversity of factual scenarios to which the prescribed sentence in s338(b) of the PC had to apply to was expressly highlighted by the High Court when laying down the sentencing framework for road traffic cases in _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[24\];

> (c)     On the other hand, as seen from the Parliamentary debates, s65(3)(a) RTA was introduced to solely tackle irresponsible driving that caused grievous hurt. Put in another way, unlike s338 of the PC, s 65(3)(a) of the RTA applies to _only one_ factual scenario – careless driving that caused grievous hurt for a first offender. For that singular factual scenario, this Court has a duty to ensure that the full spectrum of prescribed punishment in s65(3)(a) of the RTA is utilised in determining the appropriate sentence: See _Ong Chee Eng v Public Prosecutor_ \[2010\] 3 SLR 776 (_“Ong Chee Eng”_) at \[24\];

> (d)     In the circumstances, and as a matter of general principle, the sentencing framework in _Tang Ling Lee_ at \[24\], which relates to a different offence, is not helpful to the sentencing of offences punishable under s65(3)(a) of the RTA: _Logachev_;

> (e)     Further, _Tang Ling Lee_ was decided prior to the amendments to the RTA, before Parliament made clear its resolve to take a firm stance against careless driving causing grievous hurt by prescribing deterrent sentences for such conduct. A perusal of _Tang Ling Lee_ would reveal that the sentencing objective of deterrence did not feature in the High Court’s consideration when laying down the sentencing framework for s338 of the PC.

#### Prosecution’s position on sentence in relation to the accused

33     In coming to its submission on the appropriate sentence in respect of the accused for the offence under s65(3)(a) of the RTA, Prosecution applied its proposed sentencing framework as mentioned above.

34     In terms of the nature and extent of grievous hurt caused, Prosecution submitted that the level of harm caused in the present case should minimally be categorised as _“medium”_. This was because:

> (a)     The accused’s negligent driving has caused the victim’s spine (a vulnerable part of the human body) to be fractured;

> (b)     The accident also adversely impacted his personal and work life as a General Practitioner as he has been made to wear a corset for the past few months. Even performing basic functions such as bending forward to cut his toenails would cause him to experience intense pain. Further, according to the victim impact statement, his injury has impacted his plan to start a family.

35     As for the degree of the accused’s culpability in the present case, Prosecution pegged it as _“moderate”_. The reasons are:

> a.     The accused travelled against the flow of traffic;

> b.     Despite being involved in an earlier vehicular collision, the accused chose to continue driving and collided into a second vehicle a few minutes later;

> c.     Judging from the extent of damages caused to both vehicles, the accused’s vehicle would have collided with the victim’s vehicle at great force, and at high speed.

36     Given the _“medium” harm_ caused and the accused’s _“moderate” culpability_, based on the proposed sentencing framework a suitable indicative sentence for a claim trial scenario should be between 4 – 9 months’ imprisonment.

37     However, as the accused has pleaded guilty to all the charges at the earliest opportunity and has a clean driving history, a discount in sentence may be given. Considering all the factors in the present case, Prosecution was of the view that an adjustment downwards to three (3) months’ imprisonment with the minimum mandatory five (5) years DQAC was appropriate in the circumstances.

### Mitigation

38     Defence tendered a written mitigation plea as well as written submissions on the proposed sentence the accused should receive given the circumstances.

39     On the personal front, the accused is married with two daughters. He is a teacher at an international school in Johor Bahru and is responsible for pastoral care and education curriculum of his students.

40     The accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage, suggesting his genuine remorse and regret. He fully cooperated with the authorities throughout the investigation process. The accused admitted that his actions was due to a one-off aberration and momentary lapse of judgment on his part and this accident would remain as a permanent scar for the rest of his life.

41     Defence sought for a sentence of two (2) months’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum five (5) years’ DQAC in respect of the careless driving causing grievous hurt charge.

42     At the outset, Defence agreed with Prosecution that there is no sentencing guidelines set out for the new s65(1)(b) read with s65(3)(a) of the RTA for which the accused has been convicted of.

43     In support of its submission on sentence, Defence relied on the case of _Tang Ling Lee_, where See Kee Oon J had set out a two-step inquiry in determining the appropriate sentence when a person is charged under section 338(b) of the PC and the accused claims trial:

> a.     Taking into consideration the harm and culpability as a starting point, the court should identity the sentence band within the applicable presumptive sentencing range (at \[32(a)\]);

> b.     Further adjustment should be made to consider the relevant mitigation and aggravating factors (at \[32(b)\]); and

> c.     Taking into account all circumstances of the case, the final analysis of the appropriate sentence to be imposed should be a fact-sensitive exercise of discretion.

44     Defence counsel argued that the new s65(1)(b) read with s65(3)(a) of the RTA for causing grievous hurt by driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road was akin to a negligent or careless driver causing grievous hurt to a person with his act of driving pursuant to s338(b) of the PC. In the circumstances, the two-step inquiry as set out by See J in _Tang Ling Lee_ is instructive in determining the appropriate sentence for an accused under s65(3) of the RTA.

45     Following from there, Defence counsel submitted that in the present case, the harm caused to the victim was between low to medium whilst the culpability of the accused was low to moderate. In terms of both harm and culpability, it was of the opinion that the accused’s case is less serious than in _Tang Ling Lee._

46     This was because firstly, the accused in _Tang Ling Lee_ had made a right turn while driving and collided into the victim who was riding straight and had the right of way at the material time. As such, unlike the accused in _Tang Ling Lee_, who did not keep a proper lookout or stop at the right turn pocket to check for oncoming traffic before executing the right turn, the accused here had made the efforts to check for oncoming vehicles before proceeding ahead.

47     Secondly, the injuries sustained by the victim in _Tang Ling Lee_ was more serious than the victim in the present case. This was because the victim in _Tang Ling Lee_ had suffered a greater number of fractures on several parts of the body, had undergone not only surgery but a number of surgeries, was hospitalised for a longer duration (69 days as compared to 2 days) and was given a longer duration of medical leave after being discharged (5.5 months as compared to 48 days). In the circumstances, Defence submitted that the severity of the injuries suffered by the victim in the present case pales in comparison to that suffered by the victim in _Tang Ling Lee_.

48     Thirdly, unlike the accused in _Tang Ling Lee_, the accused in the present case was untraced. The accused here also did not exhibit any other aggravating factors like drink driving or speeding at the time of the offence.

49     Defence further cited another s338(b) of the PC case of _PP v Ong Heng Chua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 95</span> (_“Ong Heng Chua”_), where it was of the view that the harm and culpability of the accused in that case were both higher than the accused in the present case. In _Ong Heng Chua_, the victim suffered multiple fractures and lacerations. For these injuries, the victim there was hospitalised for 13 days and given 32 days of hospitalisation leave.

50     Defence counsel relied on \[23\] of _Ong Heng Chua_, which states:

> The period of hospitalisation leave or medical leave would be a relevant consideration in so far as it represent a medical opinion as to length of time required for treatment of the injuries and for the victim to resume his daily activities…

It added that the period of hospitalisation and hospitalisation leave would be a “rough and ready proxy for severity of the injuries”.

51     Overall, Defence submitted that the harm caused to the victim in _Ong Heng Chua_, at moderate, was greater than that of the present case.

52     In terms of culpability, the accused in _Ong Heng Chua_ was more culpable too because he had flouted traffic rules and drove against the flow of traffic. He also drove between 2 lanes without any regard to other road users. Despite that, the accused’s culpability in _Ong Heng Chua_ was considered as moderate. In contrast, the accused here had only failed to keep a proper lookout, thus leading to the accident. As such, Defence submitted that based on an overall analysis of the evidence, the accused’s culpability here should be lower than moderate.

53     Defence submitted another case of _PP v Sia Chee Han_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 18</span> (_“Sia Chee Han”_), wherein the accused was convicted and sentenced to a four months’ imprisonment and 12 months’ DQAC for a more serious offence of causing grievous hurt due to a rash act under s338(a) of the PC. In that case, the accused was driving a heavy vehicle and had made an illegal U-turn. This resulted in an accident with the victim’s motorcycle who was travelling straight in the opposite direction and had the right of way. Due to the accident, both the victim and his pillion rider suffered several fractures and were hospitalised. Additionally, the accused was traced for a previous inconsiderate driving offence.

54     During oral submissions, Defence counsel submitted that the harm caused to the victim in the _Sia Chee Han_’s case was at least medium and the culpability of that accused moderate. In any event, both the harm caused and the accused’s culpability were more serious than that of the present case.

55     As Prosecution is seeking for a higher sentence for the s65(5)(a) of the RTA offence from the s338(b) of the PC offence, Defence urged this court to consider the facts and circumstances in _Sia Chee Han_ and the sentence of four month’s imprisonment imposed as a reference point. This will aid the court in coming to its decision on the sentencing framework by calibrating the appropriate sentences based on the various scenarios of harm versus culpability accordingly.

56     Moreover, there remains a dichotomous distinction between “rashness” and negligence”. This means that, in terms of culpability, a s338(a) of the PC offence is a more serious offence than an offence under s338(b) of the PC. In the circumstances, Defence asked the court to further consider the case of _PP v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 171</span> (_Hue An Li_”), which was a case involving cause death with a negligent act in a road traffic accident. This is because the elements in determining “negligence” in the present s65(1)(b) charge for careless driving is similar to the “negligent act” in relation to the s304A(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”) offence.

57     In that case, Sundaresh Menon CJ had reiterated that the starting point for sentencing in a s304A(b) of the PC case in relation to a traffic offence is a short period of incarceration for up to four weeks. This period is liable to be adjusted upwards or downwards: see \[133\]. The courts must still examine all the circumstances of each individual case as well as any aggravating and/or mitigating factors to determine the gravity of a particular offender’s conduct before deciding what the appropriate sentence should be: see \[61\].

58     Following from there, Defence argued that a “starting point” custodial sentence for the offence under the new s65(1)(b) of the RTA should not exceed the sentencing framework as stated in _Hue An Li_ (i.e. a custodial sentence of not more than 4 weeks’ imprisonment). This is particularly so since _Hue An Li_ involved a fatal road traffic accident, where the injuries suffered by the victim had resulted in death.

#### Defence’s proposed sentencing framework for s65(3)(a) of the RTA

59     Based on Defence’s arguments, it came up with a proposed sentencing framework for an accused who pleads guilty for the court’s consideration as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image12.png)

60     Based on the analysis and the cases cited, Defence submitted that the accused’s present case would fall within the low-medium harm and the low-moderate culpability (i.e. falling under the 1-3 months’ imprisonment range).

61     Furthermore, Defence emphasized that the accused has no antecedents. There were no other aggravating factors as he was not drunk or speeding at the material time of the offence. He has already been away from home, his family, friends and work for at least three months since the accident and is currently remanded. A crushing sentence would adversely affect the accused. The accused hopes for his sentence to be backdated.

62     Finally, Defence urged the court not to take into account the severity and the impact of the injuries caused to the victim as stated in the victim impact statement save for what has already been stated in the SOF. Moreover, not all the complaints or ailments indicated by the victim were supported by medical evidence.

63     Taking into account all the evidence as a whole, Defence counsel suggested that a sentence of two months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence.

### Prosecution’s Reply

64     Prosecution replied that Defence’s proposed sentencing framework is not very far apart from that proposed by it. Defence’s proposed table has an additional category of low-medium for harm and low-moderate for culpability. DPP highlighted that if one merges the columns for “low-medium” and “medium” together in Defence’s proposed table, the sentencing range for the Defence is between 3 to 9 months’ imprisonment for a PG scenario whilst the sentencing range for the Prosecution is between 4 to 9 months’ imprisonment for a claim trial scenario.

65     Hence, Prosecution submitted that even if Defence’s proposed table for a PG scenario was referred to, one would still arrive at Prosecution’s submission of 3 months’ imprisonment in respect of the accused’s present case.

### Reasons for Sentence

#### The latest amendments to section 65 of the Road Traffic Act

66     Section 65 of the RTA or what is commonly known as “inconsiderate driving” or “careless driving” was recently amended on 1 November 2019. In relation to the third charge, section 65(1)(b) read with s65(3)(a) and s65(6)(d) of the RTA for causing grievous hurt states:

> **Driving without due care or reasonable consideration**

> 65.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road —

>> (a)    without due care and attention; or

>> (b)    without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, the person (called the offender) shall be guilty of an offence.

>> …

> (3)    If grievous hurt is caused to another person by the driving of a motor vehicle by the offender, the offender shall on conviction of an offence under subsection (1) —

>> (a)    be _liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both_;…

>> …

> (6)    A court convicting a person of an offence under subsection (1) in the following cases is to, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to not order or to order otherwise, order that the person be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a disqualification period of not less than the specified period corresponding to that case:

>> …

>> (d)    for an offender or a repeat offender in subsection (3)(a) or (b) — _5 years_;

> … \[Emphasis added\]

67     There is now a minimum mandatory sentence for the disqualification period to be not less than 5 years if the accused is convicted for an offence under s65(3)(a) of the RTA.

68     As for the first charge for s65(1)(b) punishable under s65(5)(a), where the inconsiderate driving did not cause hurt to any person, “_the offender shall on conviction of the offence be liable to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both_” for a first offender.

#### Rationale for the amendments

69     The rationale for the amendments to the RTA, which came into force on 1 November 2019, was presented during the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2019 \[Bill No. 13/2019\] in Parliament on 8 July 2019.

70     Generally, as highlighted by Prosecution, I agree that the Parliamentary intention to amend the RTA was for the need for a stronger deterrence against irresponsible driving to make our roads safer by enhancing criminal penalties. The enhanced criminal penalties include introducing higher minimum mandatory sentences (including disqualification periods) to keep irresponsible motorists off the roads for a longer period as well as higher maximum sentences as compared to the existing penalties under the Penal Code or the RTA (prior to the new amendments).

71     Another reason for the amendments is to consolidate driving offences previously prosecuted under the Penal Code, like rash and negligent acts, under the RTA. This will enable the offences to be streamlined under the RTA into (i) Reckless or Dangerous Driving under s64; and (ii) Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration (also known as “Careless Driving”) under s65.

72     Besides the manner of driving or circumstances in which the traffic offence is committed, the level of harm caused by the offender is also considered in the overall approach. The four levels of harm are (i) Death; (ii) Grievous hurt; (iii) Hurt; and (iv) Endangering life. Therefore, the greater the harm caused, the level of punishment will be higher.

73     The definition of harm for causing “grievous hurt” is imported from the Penal Code. Pursuant to s64(8) of the RTA, the definition of “grievous hurt” in both s64 and s65 of the RTA has the same meaning as in section 320 (except paragraph (aa)) of the PC. Section 320 (except paragraph (aa)) of the PC states:

> Grievous hurt

> 320.  The following kinds of hurt only are designated as "grievous"-

>> (a)    emasculation;

>> …

>> (b)    permanent privation of the sight of either eye;

>> (c)    permanent privation of the hearing of either ear;

>> (d)    privation of any member or joint;

>> (e)    destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint;

>> (f)    permanent disfiguration of the head or face;

>> (_g_)     _fracture or dislocation of a bone_;

>> (h)    any hurt which endangers life, or which causes the sufferer to be, during the space of 20 days, in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits;

>> (i)    penetration of the vagina or anus, as the case may be, of a person without that person's consent, which causes severe bodily pain. \[emphasis added\]

74     “Hurt” has also been defined under s319 of the PC to mean:

> Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.

75     In essence, the overall enhanced approach envisaged under the new RTA encompasses the harm and culpability sentencing factors (i.e. culpability of the offender versus the harm caused by him to others), which the courts have traditionally considered in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on an offender. In the past, the prescribed punishments for careless and dangerous driving were not specifically calibrated based on the degree of harm caused by the offender.

76     Next, the prescribed punishment for careless driving has holistically increased. For example, the maximum punishment for a first offender in the past for careless driving was a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. Now, the maximum fine for careless driving where no hurt is caused (or what Prosecution terms as a careless driving _simpliciter_) to any person has increased to $1,500 for a first offender. The maximum imprisonment term remains the same at 6 months.

77     Following from there, when hurt, grievous hurt or death is caused and we compare with the respective punishment provisions for rash and negligent acts under the Penal Code, they do seem to be less harsh than those under the new RTA amendments:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image13.png)

78     As can be seen from the table, the maximum sentencing penalties for the provisions under the new s65 and s64 of the RTA are generally higher than the offences for negligent and rash acts under the Penal Code. In fact, s64(2A)(a) and s64(2) of the RTA impose minimum mandatory custodial sentences of not less than 1 year and 2 years respectively. Additionally, a specific minimum mandatory disqualification period must be imposed for causing grievous hurt or death unless for special reasons like a medical emergency.

79     When comparing the present s65(3)(a) of the RTA and s338(b) of the PC, whilst the maximum penalties remain the same, pursuant to s65(6)(d) of the RTA, a minimum 5 years’ DQAC period must be imposed for an offence committed under s65(3)(a) of the RTA save for special reasons.

80     As such, whilst I agree with Prosecution that the prescribed punishment for s65(1) of the RTA have certainly increased to deter irresponsible driving, I am unable to agree that the prescribed punishment for careless driving under s65(3)(a) of the RTA has been increased proportionately by 5 times for fines and 4 times for the imprisonment term. This is because one can only make a fair comparison using equivalent provisions.

81     In the past, in all likelihood, the accused would not have been charged under the former s65(1) of the RTA for causing the second accident in view of the harm caused to the victim. He could potentially have been charged for dangerous driving under s64 of the RTA or s338(b) of the PC for causing hurt by a negligent act.

82     Besides, the punishments meted out under the former s65(1) of the RTA were frequently only appropriate fine and DQ cases. The past cases for the former s65(1) of the RTA will therefore be of little assistance, particularly since the minimum mandatory specific DQ period required under s65(3)(a) of the RTA is five years. As both Prosecution and Defence agree that there is currently no sentencing guidelines set for the new s65(3)(a) of the RTA, what can we do to calibrate the appropriate sentences to be imposed?

#### The appropriate sentences for the first and second charges

83     As the first and second charges are more straightforward, I will deal with them first.

##### The First Charge

84     The first charge under s65(5)(a) of the RTA involves the first accident. There was minor property damage caused to the first victim’s vehicle. Nobody was injured as a result of the first accident.

85     Typically, under the former s65(1) of the RTA, the usual fine range would be between $600 to $800 for a first offender. Since the accused here did not stop in time and collided into the rear of the first victim’s vehicle, which was stationary at the traffic light junction due to the red light signal for some time, I am of the view that the accused’s liability ought to put him on the higher side of the fine range.

86     Moreover, due to the increase in the prescribed punishment from $1,000 to $1,500 for the maximum fine under the new provision, a slight uplift from the previous range is thus necessary. There should also be a corollary increase in the disqualification order imposed. Having considered the circumstances, I impose a fine of $1,000 in default four (4) days’ imprisonment and a three (3) months’ DQAC.

##### The Second Charge

87     As for the second charge, s84(1) of the RTA remains unchanged. The usual fine imposed for a charge under this provision is $600 for a first offender. Accordingly, I impose a fine of $600 in default two(2) days’ imprisonment for this charge.

#### Third Charge: Court’s proposed sentencing framework for s65(3)(a) of the RTA

88     In order to derive a rational sentencing framework for the new s65(3)(a) of the RTA, I agree with Prosecution that the indicative sentencing range ought to be determined with reference to the principal factual elements of each case. As stressed by Sundaresh Menon CJ at \[74\] of _Poh Boon Kiat_:

> In my judgment, some structure would be brought to the law in this area by determining the severity of the offence on the basis of the _principal_ factual elements of the case that are closely related to (a) culpability of the offender in carrying out the offence and (b) the harm resulting from the offender’s actions. These principal facts will then determine the starting point and range of sentences within which the offender ought to be sentenced.

89     As the offence under s65(3)(a) of the RTA is causing grievous hurt by careless or inconsiderate driving, the two principal factual elements in the determination of the severity of this offence are:

> (a)     The level of culpability of the offender in his act of careless or inconsiderate driving; and

> (b)     The degree of grievous hurt caused by the offender due to his act of careless or inconsiderate driving.

90     As for the relevant sentencing considerations that apply in the context of road traffic offences like s65(3)(a) of the RTA, it would be useful to highlight the seminal High Court decision of _Koh Thiam Huat_, which was a case involving a dangerous driving offence. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, the High Court has similarly set out the two principal parameters to which a sentencing court should have regard in evaluating the seriousness of a crime, which is applicable to a traffic offence, and they are:

> a.     harm caused by the offence; and

> b.     the accused’s culpability.

91     See Kee Oon J held at \[41\] that “harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence and “culpability” is a measure of the degree of blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act. Aside from these two principal parameters, regard should also be had to other aggravating and mitigating factors which did not directly relate to the commission of the offence. This would include the offender’s antecedents and his remorse or lack thereof.

92     I now come to the offence-specific factors (i.e. factors which relate to the manner and mode in which the offence was committed as well as harm caused to the victim), these are factors that will go towards the offender’s culpability and harm caused by the offence: See also \[34\] and \[36\] of _Logachev_.

93     In terms of culpability, reference can be drawn from legislative intention. In the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2019 \[Bill No. 13/2019\] in Parliament on 8 July 2019, the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo said:

> Dangerous Driving is more serious than Careless Driving. The two can be differentiated on a case-by-case basis. The three main considerations, among others, are as follows.

> First, whether the manner of driving predictably puts other road users at risk and cause other road users to be unable to react in time. Examples of driving that are considered as dangerous, as opposed to careless, include serving across lanes suddenly and without warning, driving against the flow of traffic and speeding.

> Second, whether the motorist had driven even though he should have known he was not in a condition to drive safely. Examples of behaviour that are considered dangerous include using mobile devices while driving and failing to use visual aids such as spectacles even though he is seriously short-sighted.

> Third, whether the road situation required the motorist to take extra care but he did not. Examples include when he is approaching a zebra crossing, or a junction where other road users have the right of way.

> When determining the punishment, we will look at the circumstances under which the offence is committed. The threshold for Dangerous Driving is higher than Careless Driving; so too the penalties.

94     In the context of the offence of dangerous driving, in _Koh Thiam Huat_, See J further held at \[41\]:

> …the primary factor relating to the harm caused would be the extent of injury or damage caused. _A related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike_. The factors increasing the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. As illustrations, the aggravating factors identified in _Hue An Li_, i.e., speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving, would clearly contribute to this, as would driving while using a mobile phone. In addition, _if the dangerous driving was deliberate (for instance, in “hell riding” cases), this would also indicate a higher level of culpability_. Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence per se. These include (but are not limited to) an accused’s good or bad driving record, as well as his remorse or lack thereof. \[emphasis added\]

95     In the case of _Tang Ling Lee_, at \[27\], See Kee Oon J cited the case of _PP v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span>, where it was held by the High Court (at \[37\]-\[40\] that the factors affecting culpability for dangerous driving offences under s64(1) of the RTA would generally include the:

> (a)     manner of driving i.e. how dangerous the driving was and the extent of danger to road users posed by the offender’s conduct;

> (b)     the circumstances of driving which might have increased the danger to road users during the accident; and

> (c)     the offender’s reasons for driving.

96     See J went on to add at \[28\] that he considered the first two factors, in particular, that are also relevant to s338(b) of the PC offences. At \[28\] and \[29\], he said:

> \[28\]  …In relation to the manner of driving, some examples of situations where culpability would be increased include speeding, drink driving, sleepy driving, driving while under the influence of drugs, driving while using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase or a racing competition or exhibiting poor control of his vehicle.

> \[29\]  Second, the circumstances surrounding the incident should also be taken into account, This would include instances where the offender drives without a licence or while under disqualification. In _Suse Nathen_ (at \[28\]), it was considered that there may be increased risk where the offender drives: (a) during rush hours when the volume of traffic is heavy; (b) within a residential or school zone; (c) a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or (d) where he intends to travel a substantial distance to reach his destination. These circumstances may heighten the danger posed to road users.

97     As for the factors going towards harm caused by the offence, given that Parliamentary intention was for the definition of “grievous hurt” to be imported from the Penal Code into the RTA, the past cases involving road traffic accidents under s338 of the PC are in my view still relevant in determining the severity of harm caused by the offender.

98     This is because under s320 of the PC the types of “grievous hurt”, even after excluding death, is wide-ranging and the different forms have different degrees of seriousness. For example, a simple fracture to the bone will certainly be less serious than the loss of an entire leg. Moreover, given that s65(3)(a) of the RTA only involves grievous hurt caused by a road traffic accident, cases from other Penal Code offences like voluntary causing hurt for example, may not be relevant as the modus operandi in which the offences are committed are entirely different.

99     In _Tang Ling Lee_, See J held at \[26\] that a key ingredient of a s338(b) of the PC offence is that the negligent act must have endangered human life or personal safety. He said:

> The fact that grievous bodily injury has been caused is itself indicative that the harm occasioned to the victim is not slight or minor. In this regard, _the period of hospitalisation leave or medical leave would be a relevant consideration in so far as it represents a medical professional’s opinion as to the length of the time required for treatment of the injures and for the victim to resume his daily activities_. Nevertheless, the period of hospitalisation or medical leave is a rough-and-ready proxy for the severity of the victim’s injuries at best, as the assessment of time required for treatment and subsequent recovery may vary from case to case and may also depend on an interplay of various other circumstances including the opinion of the medical professional as well as the personal characteristics of the victim. \[emphasis added\]

100    In that case, the High Court held at \[34\] to \[36\] that generally, harm at the lower end of the spectrum would be characterised by the lack of very serious or permanent injuries. As the level of harm increases, the injuries become more serious or permanent in nature and which may necessitate significant surgical procedures. At the highest level of harm, the injuries are very serious or permanent in nature and which not only necessitate significant surgical procedures but cause serious long-term implications to the victim such as loss of limb, sight or hearing or paralysis.

101    Before I come to the proposed sentencing framework itself, it is important to bear in mind the two observations made by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Logachev_ at \[73\] – \[74\]:

> \[73\]  First, this framework is intended to apply to offenders who _claim trial_. In this regard, I agree with the following observations in _Terence Ng_ (at \[40\]):

>> …\[W\]e would clarify that the benchmark sentences we are laying down apply to ‘contested cases’ – that is to say, convictions entered _following trial_. There are at least two reasons for this. The first is based on sentencing theory. The mitigating value of a plea of guilt cannot be fixed, but is personal to the particular offender, and it is affected by factors such as the degree of remorse displayed and the extent to which the offender had ‘no choice’ but to plead guilty because he had been caught in _flagrante delicio…_We will elaborate on the proper weight to be ascribed to a plea of guilt later, but it suffices to say for now that it is clear that this makes it difficult to set a benchmark sentence by reference to uncontested cases \[where\] no uniform weight can be attached to a plea of guilt. The second is an argument based on constitutional principle. The law accords every accused person a basic right to plead not guilty and to claim trial to a charge….If the benchmarks were set by reference to uncontested cases, then it would follow that an uplift should be applied where an offender claims trial. This would lead to the ‘appearance’ that offenders who claim trial are being penalised for exercising their constitutional right to claim trial…\[emphasis in original\]

> \[74\]  I note that the court in _Terence Ng_ went on to state (at \[41\]) that its comments as just quoted above did not mean that it would never be appropriate to promulgate a benchmark sentence on the basis of an uncontested case, and that it might be appropriate to do so where, for example, the “typical case” was one where the charge was uncontested. In the context of the offences punishable under s172A(2) of the CCA, given the relatively short existence of this provision (which came into effect only in January 2013), it seems to me too soon to conclude what the “typical case” under this provisions would be. The framework proposed below therefore applies to contested cases, with a guilty plea taken into account as an offender-specific mitigating factor at the fourth step…

> \[75\]  Second, and again flowing from the relatively short existence of s172A(2) of the CCA, the death of sentencing precedents means that the framework which I suggest below should not be regarded as being cast in stone. With the accretion of case law, aspects of this framework may need to be subsequently reconsidered and refined. For instance, I have already emphasised that the sentencing considerations identified in the table at \[37\] above are non-exhaustive (see \[38\] above). As our case law develops, these sentencing considerations may be added to.

102    In essence, bearing in mind that the sentencing considerations in relation to both harm and culpability identified for the offence of inconsiderate or careless driving are non-exhaustive and s65(3)(a) of the RTA is a new provision which only came into effect on 1 November 2019, the proposed sentencing framework is intended to provide some form of guidance given that this will be the first decided case under the new provision for careless or inconsiderate driving. It is therefore not cast in stone and it is subject to reconsideration and refinement as our case law develops. I am also mindful that the types of “grievous hurt” that can be caused covers a wide spectrum.

103    The proposed sentencing framework is intended to apply to offenders who claims trial with adjustments to be made for PG cases by taking into account offender-specific mitigating factors.

104    I will now adopt the five-step approach as set out in _Logachew_ to draw up the sentencing framework.

##### First step: Identify the level of harm and the level of culpability

105    It is helpful to refer to any existing sentencing framework involving the two principal sentencing parameters of harm caused and the culpability of the offender for offences under the RTA. This is because the level of harm caused usually involves physical injury and damage to property and for the level of culpability, the manner of driving by the offender.

106    In _Stansilas_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of drunk driving and consented to another charge of dangerous driving under s64(1) of the RTA being taken inconsideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused had beaten the red light and consequently, caused an accident by colliding into a pedestrian and a motorcyclist, both of whom had the right of way. At the accused’s appeal before the High Court, the issue was the approach to be taken when sentencing a person who has caused damage or injury while committing the offence of drunk driving. In coming to the sentencing guidelines and ranges, Sundaresh Menon CJ held at \[73\]-\[75\]:

> \[73\]  It will not be possible definitively or exhaustively to identify the particular features of cases for which particular types or lengths of sentences will be appropriate. In the final analysis, the appropriate sentence to be imposed will be the product of a _fact-sensitive exercise of discretion_, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. However, generalising from the precedents described above, certain broad features may be observed.

> \[74\]  To begin, it seems to me that in assessing the overall gravity of the offence, it is (as noted above) relevant to consider, _first the degree of harm caused; and second, the culpability of the offender._ In relation to the latter consideration, this will entail consideration of the extent to which the offender’s alcohol level exceeds the prescribed limit as well as the manner of the offender’s driving.

> \[75\]  In my judgment, it is possible to calibrate these factors as follows:

>> (a)    Harm

>>> (i)    Slight - slight or moderate property damage and/or slight physical injury characterised by no hospitalisation or medical leave;

>>> (ii)   Moderate – serious property damage and/or moderate personal injury characterised by hospitalisation or medical leave but no fractures or permanent injures;

>>> (iii)   Serious – serious personal injury usually involving fractures including injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures;

>>> (iv)   Very serious – loss of limb, sight or hearing or life; or paralysis.

>> (b)    Culpability

>>> (i)    Low – low alcohol level and no evidence of dangerous driving behaviour;

>>> (ii)   Medium – moderate to high alcohol level or dangerous driving behaviour;

>>> (iii)   High – alcohol level and dangerous driving behaviour. \[Emphasis added\]

107    In _Logachev_, Sundaresh Menon CJ explained at \[77\] that in _Stansilas_, he had provided a description of each of the four different levels of harm and different levels of culpability. This was possible because the level of harm and the level of culpability were each measurable by reference to only two yardsticks namely:

> (a)     Harm: physical injury and property damage; and

> (b)     Culpability: manner of driving and alcohol level (for the purpose of a drink driving offence)

108    Guidance can also be taken for a s388(b) of the PC case involving a road traffic accident. In _Tang Ling Lee_, the High Court had laid down a sentencing framework into three categories as highlighted by Prosecution in its submissions and in my discussion of _Tang Ling Lee_ earlier. The description of the “harm” for causing grievous hurt in each category is instructive (see \[34\]-\[36\]):

109    Having due regard to the offence-specific factors for careless or inconsiderate driving, without setting out too fine a rule, a suggested working or functional definition in relation to the level of culpability may be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.62%"> <col width="73.38%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Level of Culpability</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Definition</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally, no dangerous driving behaviour exhibited.

110    As for the degree of harm in terms of grievous hurt caused, factors like (i) nature, location and type of injury e.g. fracture/dislocation of the bone; (ii) manner and type of treatment; (iii) duration of hospitalisation or medical leave; and (iv) long term effect of injury to victim’s daily living or permanent disabilities resulting from the injury can be taken into account. Once again, a suggested working or functional definition for each degree of harm caused may be as follows:

111    As emphasised by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Stansilas_ at \[76\], to prevent any guidelines from being misconstrued, the various levels of harm and culpability are indicative categories to assist in our analysis and are to be assessed as a matter of common sense. Each case has to be looked at carefully in the entire analysis of the circumstances as a whole, including taking into account both the factual evidence relating to the accident as well as the medical evidence on the physical injury caused to the victim.

112    As an observation, majority of the road traffic accidents are likely to cause “grievous hurt” in the form of a fracture or dislocation to the bone. This can range from a simple minor closed fracture where the victim’s injury is conservatively treated with a plaster cast to a more serious compound open fracture where surgical intervention is necessary. The four levels of harm seeks to distinguish the varying degrees of “grievous hurt” when such an injury is caused.

##### Second step: Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range

113    Prosecution has urged me not to adopt the sentencing framework or its presumptive sentencing range as set out in _Tang Ling Lee_ when identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range for s65(3)(a) of the RTA as per their five reasons set out in their submissions.

114    It is clear that _Tang Ling Lee_ was decided before the RTA amendments on 1 November 2019. Yet, it is pertinent to note that the definition of “grievous hurt” in s65(3)(a) of the RTA was imported from the Penal Code. It therefore shares the same definition as that in s338(b) of the PC.

115    Next, the High Court in _Tang Ling Lee_ was acutely mindful that the offence in s338(b) of the PC covers a diverse range of scenarios and is not confined to road traffic cases. See J had emphasized at \[24\] of _Tang Ling Lee_ that the suggested sentencing framework set out is intended to apply only to road traffic cases and not the wide variety of circumstances which may disclose an offence under s338(b) of the PC.

116    Thirdly, as mentioned in my earlier comparison table, the maximum punishment for s65(3)(a) of the RTA is the same as that for s338(b) of the PC. The only difference is that under s65(3)(a) of the RTA, there is a minimum mandatory DQ period of 5 years that has to be imposed. This shows that legislative intention is to keep irresponsible drivers off the roads for a longer period.

117    Hence, at the very least, the presumptive sentencing range in _Tang Ling Lee_ is still instructive for our purpose, bearing in mind the legislative intent for the new s65(3)(a) of the RTA, particularly the need for a substantively longer disqualification period of at least 5 years.

118    I can however accept Prosecution’s submissions on the point that under s338(b) of the PC, s65(3)(a) of the RTA applies only apply to one factual scenario – that is a road traffic accident causing grievous hurt by a first offender who had driven carelessly or in an inconsiderate manner. In the circumstances, in order to derive the indicative sentencing range of an offence, the courts have consistently taken into account the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament as stated at \[60\] of _Poh Boon Kiat_ and at \[24\] of _Ong Chee Eng_.

119    In the past, cases involving road traffic accidents prosecuted under s338(b) of the PC might not have been able to take into account the full range of sentences given the diversity in scenarios and it also encompasses the situation where death results due to causing grievous hurt based on the definition under s320 of the PC. Yet, in cases prosecuted under the RTA, the court was able to consider the full sentencing range prescribed by the offence.

120    An example is s64(1) of the former RTA for dangerous driving. Given the range of sentences prescribed by an offence of the RTA, It was held in _Koh Thiam Huat_ that lower end of the spectrum would generally involve fine cases and higher end of the spectrum custodial sentence of a longer duration. At \[42\] of _Koh Thiam Huat_, See J said:

> Given the range of sentences prescribed by s64(1) of the RTA, I would agree that a fine would suffice _where there is a low level of harm caused by the offence (or none at all) and the accused’s culpability is also low…. On the other hand, imprisonment would be warranted where there is a high level of harm caused by the offence and the accused’s culpability is also high_…Situated between these two obvious extremes are myriad cases of varying levels of harm and culpability, and it would not be fruitful to attempt to lay down too fine a rule. It suffices to state that the role of a sentencing court is to appreciate the facts in each case and properly situate the case before it along the continuum of severity, having regard to both the _level of harm and the accused’s culpability, as well as the applicable mitigating and aggravating factors._ \[emphasis added\]

121    Another example is drunk driving under s67(1) of the RTA: See _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span>, where the High Court has set out a sentencing framework for this offence using the full range of sentences prescribe for that offence based on the offender’s alcohol level.

122    Based on Prosecution’s submission to rely on a singular factual scenario, the full spectrum of the prescribed punishment in s65(3)(a) of the RTA must be utilised in determining the appropriate sentence, it divided the full range of prescribed punishment according to the three levels of culpability and three levels of harm respectively. In doing so, it pegged the cases at the lowest end of the spectrum (i.e. low harm and low culpability) to be fine cases. Beyond this category of cases, the custodial threshold will be crossed. At the highest end of the spectrum (i.e. high harm and high culpability), it pegged these cases with custodial sentences to be between 12 to 24 months.

123    Defence however urged the court to consider previously decided cases under the Penal Code for traffic offences when coming up with the applicable sentencing range. Guidance can even be taken from the more egregious offences like causing grievous hurt by a rash act (s338(a) of the PC) and causing death by a negligent act (s304A of the PC) where harsher sentences were meted out.

124    Following from _Tang Ling Lee_, _Ong Heng Chua_ was also a s338(b) of the PC where the accused had failed to follow the directional sign of the road by allowing his taxi to encroach into the opposite side of the road against the flow of traffic at a carpark. As a consequence, the rider, which was travelling from the opposite direction, collided with the accused’s taxi and sustained fractures to her left hand and leg. The accused was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment and 18 months’ DQAC.

125    In _Hue An Li_, the accused had gone for 24 hours without sleep. She collided her car into the back of a lorry along the Pan-Island Expressway when she sought to overtake the lorry but lost control of her car. Nine workers were transported on the lorry. All were thrown out of the lorry as a result of the collision. Eight workers were injured and one died at the scene of accident.

126    The accused in _Hue An Li_ was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment with a DQAC of 5 years for causing death by a negligent act. The High Court held at \[61\] that the default starting position in terms of the punishment to be meted out in a s304A(b) of the PC traffic death is a short custodial sentence of up to four weeks’ imprisonment.

127    In _Sia Chee Han_, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of s338(a) of the PC for causing grievous hurt by a rash act by making an illegal U-turn. As a result, his lorry collided into the motorcycle of the rider, who was riding along the opposite side of the road. Both the rider and his pillion rider suffered serious injuries including multiple fractures. The accused was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment and 12 months’ DQAC.

128    In coming to its decision, the court in _Sia Chee Han_ considered the case of _PP v Sankar Jayakumar_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 190</span>, where the accused was similarly sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for causing grievous hurt due to a rash act by beating the red light at the traffic light junction. I note that in cases submitted by the prosecution in that case, there were cases where a two months’ imprisonment term was imposed. However, the DQ periods imposed in those cases as well as in _Sia Chee Han_ were not helpful.

129    Given that there is still a dichotomous distinction between “rashness” and “negligence”, Defence counsel argued that the starting point sentence for a “negligent act” under s65(3)(a) of the RTA should not be more than a four weeks’ imprisonment. Following from there, it disagreed with Prosecution that a suitable indicative starting sentence for a claim trial scenario for a “medium” harm and “moderate” culpability case should be four months’ imprisonment. It hence calibrated its proposed sentencing framework accordingly.

130    As traffic offences relating to causing death by a negligent act and causing grievous hurt by a rash act will now be brought under the new provisions in the RTA with enhanced penalties (i.e. higher penalties than the current s338(a) and s304A(b) of the PC), I believe the cases under s338(a) and s304A(b) of the PC may have to be relooked again under the new provisions in the RTA when appropriate.

131    Here, this is a situation where a fine balance needs to be made, bearing in mind that the minimum specified period for the DQ is already 5 years.

132    On the one hand, no doubt, in the interest of public safety, there is a greater need to deter irresponsible driving behaviour, particularly in situations where dangerous driving behaviour is exhibited.

133    On the other hand, one must nevertheless be mindful that ultimately, this is an offence of careless or inconsiderate driving, where the offender may have no real intention of committing the offence but did so due to one’s negligence or lack of attention when driving on the roads. Thus, any uplift in penalties should still take into account the distinction between a “careless” or “inconsiderate” act as compared to a “rash” or “reckless” act.

134    Having obtained guidance from the relevant High Court cases as well as considered the tables for the proposed sentencing framework suggested by both Prosecution and Defence, I suggest a sentencing framework in relation to the various extent of grievous hurt caused due to careless driving for an accused who claims trial as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0088_Image/[2020] SGDC 0088_image14.png)

135    With the proposed sentencing framework, I now apply steps one to three on the accused’s case.

##### Third step: Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range

136    For step 1, in terms of the level of culpability, I agree with Prosecution that it is at “moderate”. My reasons are as follows.

137    The collision happened due to a head-on collision between the accused’s motor pick-up and the second victim’s motorcar. This was observable from the video footage.

138    The accident could have happened under two possible circumstances.

139    First, the accused could have flouted traffic rules by swerving his motor pick-up across the single white line and encroaching into the path of the second victim’s motorcar suddenly. When the head-on collision happened, the second victim’s motorcar was travelling along the opposite side of the road and had just crossed the traffic light junction before the light turned red. The second victim clearly had the right of way. Hence, there was nothing the second victim could have done to avoid the collision. By doing so, the accused had travelled against the flow of traffic and failed to comply with directional signs on the road.

140    Alternatively, the accused was speeding or travelling at a speed higher than the road conditions permit at the material time. As he approached the traffic light junction which was located near to a bend, he failed to slow down or even stop. This was despite the fact that the traffic light at the junction had just turned red. As a consequence, the accused lost control of his vehicle and swerved to the opposite side of the road suddenly. This led to the head-on collision with the second victim’s car.

141    The relative speed of travel of the accused’s motor pick-up as compared to the second victim’s motorcar at that time is quite apparent. This is evident from the impact after the collision where the second victim’s motorcar was propelled backwards for about 20 metres before coming to a stop. The damage caused to the second victim’s motorcar and the accused’s motor pick-up were both serious as seen from the photographs annexed in the SOF. Furthermore, from the video, the second victim’s motorcar did not appear to be travelling fast given that it had just manoeuvred the bend before crossing the traffic light junction.

142    It would seem that the accused appeared to be driving in a hurry when he failed to stop after the first accident. The second accident occurred shortly after within a timespan of 5 minutes and about not more than a kilometre from the location of the first accident.

143    Based on either scenario of how the accident happened, the accused’s culpability would clearly fall under the “moderate” level. In the first scenario, he would have had to swerve across the opposite lane suddenly and without warning to drive against the flow of traffic. In the second scenario, he would have been speeding and as a result lost control of his vehicle before swerving across the opposite lane suddenly.

144    As for the degree of harm caused, I agree with Prosecution that it is “medium”.

145    As per the SOF and the medical report of the second victim’s dated 21 November 2019 from the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), the second victim suffered a compression fracture to his L4 lumbar spine (superior endplate acute fracture) with mild anterior wedging due to mild depression in the anterior aspect of the superior endplate. I agree that the spine is a vulnerable part of the body.

146    The second victim was hospitalised for three days at the SGH and treated conservatively with a lumbar corset together with analgesia and ambulatory physiotherapy for his lumbar spine injury. He was given hospitalisation leave upon his discharge from hospital on 12 November 2019 up to 27 December 2019 (about 45 days). During this period, the second victim was unable to work as a general medical practitioner.

147    The lumbar spine injury has also affected the second victim’s personal life. According to the victim impact statement recorded on 3 March 2020, besides being more anxious now when driving on the roads, he still experiences pain or discomfort when carrying loads or bending forward to cut his toenails and has stopped playing tennis for the time being. He has even delayed plans to start a family.

148    Hence, given that the second victim was treated conservatively for his injury, with a short period of hospitalisation and a fair duration of hospitalisation leave of slightly more than a month, I am of the view that the degree of harm caused here is medium. This is even though the second victim did not undergo any surgical procedures for the singular fracture. The lumbar spine fracture is to a vulnerable part of the body and the second victim still presently does experience some form of physical limitation and disruption to some of his daily activities.

149    Coming to step 2, based on the proposed sentencing framework, the applicable indicative sentencing range would be three to six months’ imprisonment.

150    As both Prosecution and Defence are in general agreement that the custodial threshold in this case is crossed, the key issue is to identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range so as to determine the appropriate duration of the imprisonment term to be imposed on the accused.

151    This will be step 3. Having considered all the evidence as a whole earlier, the accused’s sentence should fall at the lower half level of the indicative sentencing range.

##### Fourth step: Make adjustments to the starting point to take into account offender-specific factors

152    I now come to step 4. I am in general agreement with both Prosecution and Defence on the mitigating factors in this case. The accused is untraced. He has pleaded guilty to all the charges at the earliest available opportunity. He has co-operated fully with the authorities. There is no issue of restitution here as both victims’ claims are covered by motor insurance.

153    In fact, both Prosecution and Defence agree that given the mitigating factors in favour of the accused, there should be a downwards adjustment on the duration of the sentence.

154    Prosecution is of the view that the downward adjustment by one month (i.e. from the lower end of the sentencing range of 4 to 9 months’ imprisonment) to three months’ imprisonment is appropriate.

155    Defence is similarly of the view that a downward adjustment by one month (i.e. from the higher end of the sentence range of 1 to 3 months’ imprisonment) to two months’ imprisonment is appropriate. However, I note that the Defence’s proposed sentencing framework is already based on a PG instead of a claim trial situation.

156    All things considered, having regard to all the evidence as a whole, I adjust the sentence for the third charge downwards to Ten (10) weeks’ imprisonment with the minimum specified period for the DQAC at five (5) years from the date of release.

##### Fifth step: Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle

157    As out of the three charges, only one charge involves a custodial sentence and the other two charges being fine cases, the totality principle is not applicable in the present case.

## CONCLUSION

158    The new amendments to the Road Traffic Act seek to discourage irresponsible driving on our roads. This serves as a cautionary note to all motorists to concentrate, be considerate and drive responsibly. The consequences of any distraction can be dire if a serious accident results even if there is no loss of life.

159    To summarise, as aforementioned, the accused was sentenced accordingly:

160    Since the accused has been in remand since 12 March 2020, I backdate his custodial sentence to that date.

161    As the accused is a foreigner, I impose a prohibition order pursuant to s47F of the RTA from driving any motor vehicle in Singapore for the same period as the disqualification order imposed in relation to both the first and third charges.

162    It leaves me to thank both Prosecution and Defence for their assistance on this matter.
