### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is an Indian national who came to Singapore in 2012. He was employed as a “Portfolio Manager – Fixed Income” by the first defendant (“1st Defendant”) from 2 April 2012 until 23 January 2016. In accordance with the licensing requirements of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) applicable to the fund management activities of the 1st Defendant, the plaintiff was registered as a capital markets services representative.

2       The plaintiff held a significant role in the 1st Defendant’s organisation. As the sole manager of all fixed income products, he had a wide discretion and took charge over the investment strategies of the various funds under his control. The plaintiff did well in his career with the 1st Defendant and was rewarded with generous pay increments and bonuses.

3       On 22 December 2015, following an internal disciplinary inquiry, the plaintiff’s employment with the 1st Defendant was, however, terminated on grounds of misconduct. He was given one month’s notice with full payment of his salary and other entitlements up to the last day of his employment. Pursuant to MAS’s licensing requirements, the 1st Defendant filed the necessary report to notify them of the misconduct and cessation of the plaintiff’s employment.

4       From 1 March 2016, the plaintiff took up employment with his current employer, Reliance Asset Management (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“RAMS”), also as a portfolio manager of fixed income products. It is not disputed that RAMS is a competitor of the 1st Defendant. RAMS had communicated with the 1st Defendant to obtain an employer’s reference check on the plaintiff and was informed of the plaintiff’s dismissal on grounds of misconduct.

5       In this suit, the plaintiff claims that he had been wrongfully dismissed from his employment. His case is that he was a genuine whistleblower against the 1st Defendant’s chief executive officer, and as such, was entitled to specific legal protections pursuant to the 1st Defendant’s personnel policy which governed his employment contract. Instead of being accorded such protection, the plaintiff says that the senior members in the 1st Defendant’s management had acted in conspiracy with each other in breach of various provisions of the 1st Defendant’s personnel policy to retaliate against the plaintiff for his whistleblowing allegations and procure his dismissal on grounds of misconduct.

6       The plaintiff seeks a declaration against the 1st Defendant that he was wrongfully dismissed from his employment as well as damages for breach of his employment contract. In addition to his claims against the 1st Defendant, the plaintiff is also seeking specific reliefs in the form of damages and injunctive orders against the second to the fourth defendants, being the senior executives of the 1st Defendant at the material time, for defamation, conspiracy and malicious falsehood in connection with the various actions taken by them consequent to the termination of his employment.

## Background facts

### The parties

7       The 1st Defendant (also referred to herein as “UTI”) is a Singapore-incorporated company which carries out fund management activities and is regulated by the MAS as a capital markets services licence holder[^1]. Its parent company, UTI Asset Management Company Limited (“UTI AMC”), is based in Mumbai, India. The 1st Defendant manages the offshore interests as well as the global marketing function of UTI AMC. UTI AMC is a company incorporated in India pursuant to an Act of the Indian Parliament. UTI AMC is said to be one of India’s largest managers of Indian equities, fixed income and private equity with assets under management worth more than USD 50 billion as at October 2018[^2].

8       Mr Praveen Jagwani, the second defendant (“2nd Defendant”), is the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the 1st Defendant as well as one of the seven directors on its board of directors.[^3] He oversees the general management of the 1st Defendant’s international business which includes its fund management activities, sales and marketing functions, operations and product management[^4].

9       Ms Shobha Menon, the third defendant (“3rd Defendant”), was at the material time also a director of the 1st Defendant.[^5] She was appointed as the 1st Defendant’s Head of Legal and Compliance in 2008[^6] and held that position until she resigned in July 2018 and moved to the United States of America where she is currently based.

10     Mr Muralidaran Narayann, the fourth defendant (“4th Defendant”), served as the 1st Defendant’s Head of Investments from May 2008 to January 2017. He was in charge of the fund management activities of the 1st Defendant and had oversight of its portfolio managers including the plaintiff[^7].

11     Within the organisational hierarchy, the plaintiff' reported directly to the 4th Defendant as his immediate superior. In his role of Portfolio Manager, Fixed Income, the plaintiff' was also required to report to one Mr Amandeep Chopra, the Head of Fixed Income at UTI AMC, who was regarded as his functional head[^8].

12     As the Portfolio Manager of all fixed income products of the 1st Defendant, the plaintiff was also a member of its Investment Committee. The fixed income products[^9] under the plaintiff’s management included the UTI Indian Fixed Income Fund (“UTI IFIF”) incorporated in Ireland which was regarded as UTI’s flagship fund, the UTI Phoenix Fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the UTI Wealth Creator Fund incorporated in Mauritius.

13     In so far as the events leading up to this suit are concerned, the plaintiff had also interacted with the 1st Defendant’s Head of Products, Mr Manish Khandelwal, as well as members of UTI’s sales team which comprised[^10]:

> (a)     Mr Prateek Sinha (handling Asia),

> (b)     Mr Gaurav Maleri (handling Europe), and

> (c)     Mr Sameer Bhatia (handling the Middle-East).

14     At the material time, the 1st Defendant’s board of directors had seven members[^11] – three were based in Singapore, namely the 2nd Defendant, the 3rd Defendant, and one Mr Tan Woon Hum of Shook Lin & Bok LLP; two representatives of UTI AMC based in Mumbai, India, namely Mr Leo Puri and Mr Imtaiyazur Rahman, being the then Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of UTI AMC respectively, one Mr Ian Kelson based in the United Kingdom and one Mr Henry Hagan based in the United States of America. Mr Ian Kelson was the nominee of T Rowe Price Global Investment Services Ltd, a substantial shareholder of UTI AMC. Mr Kelson was the director that the plaintiff had chosen to communicate with in relation to his “whistleblowing” against the 2nd Defendant.

15     As the CEO, the 2nd Defendant is the most senior employee of the 1st Defendant. He is also one of the three directors of UTI IFIF. It is not disputed that the 2nd Defendant had ultimate discretion on matters relating to the plaintiff’s employment with the 1st Defendant[^12].

16     The 3rd Defendant reported to the 2nd Defendant as well as to the 1st Defendant’s board of directors while the 4th Defendant reported to the 2nd Defendant. The 2nd Defendant, the 3rd Defendant and the 4th Defendant were the three most senior members of the 1st Defendant’s management team and comprised the inquiry committee that had found the plaintiff guilty of misconduct on 22 December 2015.

17     The writ in these proceedings was issued against the four defendants on 17 July 2017. All four defendants were initially represented by Shook Lin & Bok LLP which had filed the defence and counterclaim collectively on their behalf in August 2017. In March 2019, the 3rd Defendant opted to engage a different set of solicitors, Gloria James-Civetta & Co, to represent her and obtained leave to amend her defence.

18     For ease of reference, the 1st, 2nd and 4th Defendants (who remain jointly represented by Shook Lin & Bok LLP) will be referred to as “the Joint Defendants” where applicable.

### Timeline of significant events

#### 2012 to June 2015

19     From the time the plaintiff commenced employment with the 1st Defendant in April 2012 up to May 2015, he was recognised as a high performer. He received favourable scores in his performance appraisals and was rewarded with salary increments and performance bonuses as outlined below[^13]:

> (a)     From his starting monthly salary of $5,400, his salary was revised to $6,000 in October 2012 and increased to $8,500 in March 2013. He was also rewarded with a performance-linked bonus of $30,600 in May 2013.

> (b)     In May 2014, his monthly salary was again increased to $8,883 and he was awarded a bonus of $43,860. His salary was further increased to $9,500 in July 2014.

> (c)     In May 2015, he received yet a further increase in his monthly salary to $10,545 and he was awarded a bonus of $45,600.

20     According to the 2nd Defendant, some of the salary increments were given because the plaintiff had asked for them and threatened to resign if his demands were not met. As it was critical to the 1st Defendant to maintain continuity in the management of its key products such as the UTI IFIF, its flagship fund, the 2nd Defendant acceded to the plaintiff’s demands and increased his salary accordingly[^14].

21     In 2014 and 2015, several incidents concerning the plaintiff came to the attention of the 2nd Defendant:

> (a)     Sometime around 27 March 2014, the plaintiff was unhappy with his performance appraisal given by the 4th Defendant. The plaintiff felt that the grade that he was given was too low and he sent an email to the 4th Defendant, keeping the 2nd Defendant in copy. In this email, the plaintiff insinuated that the 4th Defendant was “senile” and knew “almost nothing about the fund”[^15].

> (b)     Sometime around 6 February 2015, Mr Prateek Sinha from the sales team brought to the 2nd Defendant’s attention that the plaintiff had refused to conduct two training sessions for Citibank, one of the 1st Defendant’s clients. Although the plaintiff had been scheduled to conduct the training sessions, he suddenly informed Mr Sinha on the day itself that he could not do so[^16].

> (c)     Sometime around 26 June 2015, Mr Gaurav Maleri, who was based in the United Kingdom, made a written complaint about the plaintiff’s unprofessional conduct – the plaintiff had sent insulting emails to Mr Maleri. In addition, earlier in March 2015, the plaintiff had behaved in an agitated and unruly manner shortly before Mr Maleri and the plaintiff were to have a call with one of the 1st Defendant’s clients[^17].

> (d)     In response to Mr Maleri’s complaint, the 2nd Defendant had urged the plaintiff to retract his unprofessional comment. The plaintiff, however, refused to do so and informed the 2nd Defendant that he would prefer to resign. The plaintiff purported to tender his resignation claiming that the 2nd Defendant and Mr Maleri had “ganged up against (him) for a very minor inter-personal reason”[^18]. The 2nd Defendant had refused to accept the plaintiff’s hasty resignation.

#### Complaint from Prateek Sinha on the “Phoenix Trade” incident[^19]

22     On 15 July 2015, the 2nd Defendant received a written complaint from Mr Prateek Sinha concerning the handling of a trade between a major client, DBS Bank Ltd (“DBS”), and the State Bank of India (“SBI”), Bahrain in respect of the UTI Phoenix Fund. The chronology of events as related by Mr Sinha is as follows[^20]:

> (a)     On or around 6 July 2015, the plaintiff informed Mr Sinha that SBI Bahrain may be willing to offer an interest rate of 2.5% on US Dollar deposits.

> (b)     By way of emails dated 7 and 8 July 2015 on which the plaintiff was copied, Mr Sinha checked with DBS as to whether DBS would be interested in such a deal. DBS informed Mr Sinha that they had an interest for USD20 million to USD25million, and to confirm by 11 July 2015 as their client would transfer the money on Sunday 12 July 2015.

> (c)     On 9 July 2015, SBI Bahrain sent an email to the plaintiff stating that it did not require bulk deposits. The plaintiff failed to inform Mr Sinha of this email.

> (d)     On 12 July 2015, DBS’s client transferred the money to DBS to be deposited with SBI Bahrain. However, when Mr Sinha followed up with SBI Bahrain, he was informed that they had already told the plaintiff that they did not require any bulk deposits at the time and forwarded to Mr Sinha their email to the plaintiff dated 9 July 2015.

> (e)     On 13 and 14 July 2015, Mr Sinha was forced to do a lot of “firefighting” to come up with alternative solutions in order to maintain UTI’s relationship with DBS. This entailed UTI having to waive its fees for two transactions for DBS in the Phoenix Fund resulting in losses totalling USD59,520.

#### Complaint from Gaurav Maleri on suspected disclosure of confidential information to RAMS[^21]

23     Sometime in July 2015, the 2nd Defendant received an oral complaint from Mr Maleri regarding a suspicion that the plaintiff was leaking sensitive company information in respect of a proposed deal with the chief investment officer of a Swiss bank to one Abhijeet Shankar Singh (“Mr Abhijeet”), an ex-employee of UTI and a close friend of the plaintiff. Mr Abhijeet was then already employed with RAMS.

24     The Swiss bank’s chief investment officer was a personal contact of Mr Maleri and had agreed to work on the proposed deal with UTI out of the goodwill shared with Mr Maleri. He was upset when Mr Abhijeet of RAMS approached him to work on a similar deal to raise assets for RAMS in Switzerland and communicated his sentiments to Mr Maleri. Mr Maleri suspected the plaintiff to be the culprit as the proposed deal with the Swiss bank was known to only himself, the plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant.

25     Mr Maleri had again on or around 19 August 2015 communicated with the 2nd Defendant on the possibility of the plaintiff passing on company information to Mr Abhijeet of RAMS.

#### The 2nd Defendant’s investigations into the plaintiff’s conduct[^22]

26     As leakage of sensitive company information was a particularly serious allegation which, if found to be true, would justify termination of the plaintiff’s employment, the 2nd Defendant apprised the senior management of UTI AMC of Mr Maleri’s complaint. He also informed them of the plaintiff’s interpersonal issues with his colleagues on the sales team as well as his immediate supervisor, the 4th Defendant. He had also indicated that he would need to collate some evidence and conduct a disciplinary inquiry before taking any action against the plaintiff. Follow-up action to ensure a smooth transition in the event of the plaintiff’s exit was also discussed.

27     The 2nd Defendant went about to conduct his own internal investigations against the plaintiff including checking on the plaintiff’s emails. Besides the allegations set out in \[22\] to \[25\] above, the 2nd Defendant found that the plaintiff had repeatedly made unauthorised contact with UTI’s clients. It was noted by the 2nd Defendant that despite reminders sent to him, the plaintiff had contacted UTI’s clients without keeping the sales team (including Mr Sinha and Mr Maleri) informed[^23].

28     In August 2015, the 2nd Defendant engaged Shook Lin & Bok LLP to seek legal advice as to the appropriate course of action to be taken against the plaintiff.[^24] On 15 September 2015, upon instructions received from the 2nd Defendant, the 3rd Defendant proceeded to inform the MAS that it had commenced investigations into allegations of misconduct against the plaintiff. This was pursuant to the 1st Defendant’s obligations under the MAS’s Notice on Reporting of Misconduct of Representatives by Holders of Capital Markets Services (“CMS”) Licence and Exempt Financial Institutions issued on 26 November 2010[^25] (“MAS Notice SFA04-N11”). A CMS licence holder was required under MAS Notice SFA04-N11 to report to MAS upon discovery of any type of misconduct resulting in a serious breach of the CMS licence holder’s internal policy or code of conduct which would render the representative liable to demotion, suspension or termination of the representative’s employment.

#### Plaintiff denied permission to travel to Mumbai

29     On 4 November 2015, the plaintiff requested for permission from the 4th Defendant to travel to Mumbai, India to attend the annual investor conference organised by IDFC Securities from 18 to 20 November 2015 as well as meet the managements of portfolio companies and bankers. Permission was initially given by the 4th Defendant in his email[^26] of the same date which was copied to the 2nd Defendant.

30     However, on 6 November 2015, the 2nd Defendant vetoed the approval that the 4th Defendant had given to the plaintiff to attend the conference. The 2nd Defendant’s email to the plaintiff and the 4th Defendant stated that he did not see the business rationale for the trip and that it was not a business requirement at that point in time.[^27]

#### Plaintiff sends “whistleblowing” emails to Mr Ian Kelson

31     On the same date, 6 November 2015, that the 2nd Defendant had denied him permission to attend the IDFC investor conference in Mumbai, the plaintiff sent an email[^28] from his personal email account to Ian Kelson under the heading “In confidence – about UTI International” containing various allegations against the 2nd Defendant. He worded the preamble to his allegations as follows:

>     I write to you in confidence, to bring to your notice a disturbing trend where several decisions and actions of the CEO Praveen Jagwani may not have been in the best intention for the company.

32     This was followed by ten paragraphs in which the plaintiff outlined the “disturbing” acts of the 2nd Defendant as follows:

> (a)     the 2nd Defendant had approved the investment of monies in highly leveraged deposits with Middle Eastern banks for the Phoenix fund. The 2nd Defendant had disregarded the plaintiff’s concern that they did not have credit coverage of Middle Eastern banks and there was no process for active monitoring of the credit worthiness of those banks.

> (b)     the 2nd Defendant, by appointing himself as a member of the Investment Committee, the Risk Committee, and a director on the boards of the fund companies sponsored by UTI, had put himself in a position that allowed him to intimidate and override other “voices of reason”. This had created a conflict of interest.

> (c)     the 2nd Defendant had also marginalised the role of the Head of Investment in Singapore in matters related to compensation and training. Most of the team’s training budget was utilised as a “buffer for P&L” or for marketing activities. While required to tell clients that the plaintiff regularly travelled to Mumbai to meet the portfolio companies and the India team, the reality was totally different as such trips were actually not approved.

> (d)     Under the 2nd Defendant’s full knowledge, funds were used for offsite trips and unrelated activities, with drinks and private recreational activities billed to company accounts whereas the team’s need to keep up-to-date with investment portfolio companies and to meet with the India team was ignored.

> (e)     the 2nd Defendant had routinely overridden the Head of Investment in Singapore in various decisions related to investment and fund operations.

> (f)     On several occasions, the 2nd Defendant had given approval of late trades in respect of the UTI IFIF to lend favours to his key clients.

> (g)     On one other occasion, the 2nd Defendant had instructed to make exceptions for a client by processing a redemption before the timelines stated in the prospectus. This was done without informing the Head of Investment or understanding the consequences of such action.

33     The plaintiff concluded his email by suggesting that the 2nd Defendant should step down from at least one or more of his roles to allow for fair decision making and oversight. He also explained to Ian Kelson why he had directed the email to him as follows:

>     I hope you will understand that I decided to write you as anyone else from UTI would jeopardize my job in the company. I hope you will be able to maintain the confidentiality of my message.

34     Ian Kelson responded to the plaintiff some four days later on 10 November 2015.[^29] In Kelson’ s reply, he stated that the plaintiff had raised very serious allegations and that he had informed the “appropriate parties” so that an independent review could take place.

35     On 19 November 2015, the plaintiff followed up with a further email[^30] in which he enumerated four specific incidents which had culminated in the concerns expressed in his first email. These were:

> (a)      Incident 1: Rainbow H Fund

>> The plaintiff alleged that in a meeting with the distributing bank on 5 May 2011 in Bahrain, the 2nd Defendant had assured a 6% annualised return on the Rainbow H Fund for the bank’s clients despite the fund not being a guaranteed return fund. The portfolio in fact had several distressed or high yield convertible bonds which eventually defaulted. This assurance was documented in the minutes prepared by UTI International.

> (b)      Incident 2: UTI Indian Fixed Income Fund – approval of late trades after cut-off

>> The plaintiff alleged that a subscription of USD10 million was received for processing on 1 December 2014 which according to the dealing timelines should have been accorded the net asset value (“NAV”) of 2 December 2014 at USD9.63. The 2nd Defendant had, however, used his authority as director of the fund to approve the subscription at the NAV of 1 December 2014 at USD9.55 instead. The impact of such an approval had not been discussed with the investment team.

> (c)      Incident 3: UTI Indian Fixed Income Fund – short redemption at client’s request

>> The plaintiff alleged that on 9 May 2014, based on the 2nd Defendant’s verbal instruction, the operations team had instructed the fund’s transfer agent to accommodate an exceptional request to settle a redemption in advance of the settlement date. This was done against the plaintiff’s email advice as the Fund Manager as well as the transfer agent’s.

> (d)      Incident 4:

>> In a March 2015 email, the 2nd Defendant had in response to the plaintiff’s suggestion to use swing pricing and anti-dilution tools, tried to portray him as taking a ‘high moral ground’ and implied that he was being greedy for not soft-closing the fund. The 2nd Defendant had claimed that swing pricing was un-implementable which was incorrect as the fund administrator, State Street, had confirmed otherwise.

36     The plaintiff informed Kelson that the four listed incidents could be verified from documented communications. He, however, sought to retract the previous allegation of misuse of the training budget for off-site expenses and recreational activities as he did not have access to accounting records. He then concluded his email by stating that his intention was to safeguard the performance and reputation of the fund from the “veto” style decision-making of the 2nd Defendant who held multiple roles and also controlled the appraisals.

#### UTI AMC investigates the plaintiff’s allegations against the 2nd Defendant

37     The plaintiff’s allegations were investigated by UTI AMC, presumably upon the referral made by Ian Kelson as intimated in his response to the plaintiff. Three senior officers of UTI AMC separately investigated the different allegations made:

> (a)     Mr Vivek Maheshwari, the Executive Vice-President, Compliance Officer and UTI AMC’s head of the Risk Management Department, investigated into the allegations of late trades, short redemptions, swing pricing and leveraged investments.

> (b)     Mr Surojit Saha, UTI AMC’s head of Accounts, investigated into the allegation of misuse of funds by UTI.

> (c)     Mr Imtaiyazur Rahman, UTI AMC’s then Chief Finance Officer, had investigated into the complaints pertaining to the 2nd Defendant’s false assurance allegedly given to investors of the Rainbow H Fund, allegations of the 2nd Defendant’s acts of marginalising the Head of Investments and denying the plaintiff permission to travel to India as well as the late trades in the UTI IFIF.

38     The investigation report dated 3 December 2015[^31] titled “Allegations against CEO, UTI International (Singapore) P. Ltd” (“UTI-AMC Report”) was signed by Mr Imtaiyazur Rahman and endorsed by Mr Leo Puri, the then Managing Director of UTI AMC. Annexed to the UTI-AMC Report were the findings of both Mr Maheshwari and Mr Saha. The key findings noted in the Report were as follows:

> (a)     In respect of the allegation on late trades, the investigation carried out by Mr Maheshwari found that there were six late trades under the UTI IFIF which had been approved by the 2nd Defendant. The report however concluded that there were “per se no violations”[^32] as all the six trades were carried out in accordance with the provisions of the scheme prospectus**.**

> (b)     In respect of the allegation on short redemption in the UTI IFIF which had been approved by the 2nd Defendant, Mr Maheshwari’s report had also found no violation. The redemption had been carried out in line with the scheme prospectus[^33].

> (c)     As for the implementation of swing pricing in the various funds, Mr Maheshwari’s report concluded that necessary steps had been taken or were being taken to obtain shareholders’ approval for it to be implemented[^34].

> (d)     On the allegation that the 2nd Defendant had approved highly leveraged investments for the Phoenix Fund, Mr Maheshwari’s report referred to the portfolio details that had been sent to him. He found that the Fund had not made any leveraged investments[^35].

> (e)     In respect of the allegation of misuse of funds by the company, Mr Saha’s report found that “_there (was) no evidence of use of Company funds for any private recreational activities of individuals / employees_”[^36].

> (f)     In respect of the allegation that the 2nd Defendant had appointed himself on various committees and fund companies, Mr Rahman found the allegation to be baseless. The UTI board of directors was fully aware that the 2nd Defendant’s presence on the committees was in his capacity as CEO of the company, and had the concurrence of the CEO of UTI AMC[^37].

> (g)     As to the allegation that the 2nd Defendant had routinely overridden the Head of Investment in Singapore in various decisions related to investment and fund operations, Mr Rahman found the allegation to be very vague and without substance. In the absence of any specific detail, there was no scope for further investigation[^38].

> (h)     In respect of the allegation that the 2nd Defendant had denied the plaintiff permission to travel to Mumbai, Mr Rahman’s report stated that this allegation was true. He added that as a director on the board of the company, he was aware that the plaintiff had not been discharging his duties diligently and therefore could not be permitted to travel anywhere to meet clients[^39].

> (i)     In respect of the allegation on the false assurances pertaining to the Rainbow H Fund that the 2nd Defendant had given investors in 2011, Mr Rahman’s report found no evidence to support such an allegation. He had further observed that the plaintiff was not an employee at the material time, as he only joined UTI in 2012. As such, the conduct of the plaintiff in “_raising the issues pertaining to a period before his joining the company appears to be motivated_”, and Mr Rahman recommended that appropriate action be taken against the plaintiff[^40].

#### Plaintiff’s employment suspended pending an internal inquiry

39     On 14 December 2015, the plaintiff was issued a letter signed by the 2nd Defendant titled “Internal Inquiry”. The letter[^41] (“Suspension Letter”) informed him that he was suspended from his duties with immediate effect pending the company’s inquiry into various matters relating to his employment.

40     The plaintiff was required to surrender his UTI-issued electronic devices (including laptop and mobile phones), keys and access cards before leaving the office. He was thereafter prohibited from entering the office premises, accessing his work email account and communicating with clients or counterparties of UTI.

41     The plaintiff was orally informed that a committee comprising the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants (“Inquiry Committee”) would be looking into the various allegations made against him. He was required to provide to the Inquiry Committee a detailed written explanation by 19 December 2015 on the following:

> (a)      _Phoenix trade between DBS and SBI, Bahrain_ – he had withheld from Mr Prateek Sinha the email dated 9 July 2015 from SBI to him purportedly withdrawing its earlier offer to accept deposits at the interest rate of 2.5% pa. This was despite Mr Sinha having informed him that DBS was committed to participating in the transaction in the amount of USD 22 million with SBI.

> (b)      _Unauthorised client contact –_ he had been instructed at the onset of his employment not to initiate or have direct contact with UTI’s clients without giving prior notification to the business development personnel but had done so despite being specifically reminded by way of an email dated 5 February 2015.

> (c)      _Contact with counterparties such as State Street Corporation –_ he had initiated contact with counterparties like State Street without the knowledge of UTI’s Operations Team.

> (d)      _Listing his personal mobile number on the office email signature block_ – he had continued to list his personal mobile number on the office email signature block despite being reminded to desist from such conduct by an email dated 8 September 2015.

> (e)      _Failing to conduct training sessions_ – he did not conduct training sessions for Citibank Private Banking on 5 and 6 February 2015 with respect to the UTI IFIF which he had earlier agreed to do without giving any reason for his absence.

> (f)      _Disclosing confidential information to UTI’s competitors –_ he had on various occasions disclosed to UTI’s competitors information relating to UTI’s clients, and also transferred proprietary company emails and data to his personal email account on many occasions.

42     The plaintiff responded to the allegations on 15 December 2015 in his email sent to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants at 10.09am[^42], and requested a meeting in person. At 1.43pm on 15 December 2015, in reply to the 4th Defendant’s acknowledgment of his earlier email, the plaintiff sent a further email to notify the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants that while he understood that his suspension was supposed to be a confidential matter, one of their competitors, (understood to be RAMS) had contacted him as he had heard about the plaintiff’s suspension from someone in UTI.

43     On the same day, the 2nd Defendant forwarded various emails and documents to the 3rd and 4th Defendants in support of the allegations made against the plaintiff in the Suspension Letter. The 2nd Defendant also responded to the plaintiff’s second email of 15 December 2015 to say that leakage of sensitive company information cannot be tolerated and asked for the identity and contact number of the person from RAMS who had known of the plaintiff’s suspension.

44     On 16 December 2015, the plaintiff again requested to meet the 2nd Defendant[^43]. The 2nd Defendant refused the request and instead forwarded various documents that the plaintiff had requested to see, including the “crucial email” relating to the Phoenix Trade. In addition, the 2nd Defendant had also set out his rebuttals to the points raised in the plaintiff’s 15 December 2015 email to which the plaintiff responded the same night.[^44]

45     From 15 December to 20 December 2015, emails were also exchanged between the plaintiff and the 3rd and 4th Defendants separately on the various allegations made against him. The 3rd and 4th Defendants had in their emails to the plaintiff informed him that he could communicate privately with each of them if he was uncomfortable responding to the group[^45]. This, however, drew the ire of the 2nd Defendant who pointed out to them in his email of 19 December 2015[^46] that they were in a formal inquiry in which “(e)verything needs to be above board and transparent”.

46     Based on the plaintiff’s response in his email of 15 December 2015, the 2nd Defendant had sought the testimonies of Mr Gaurav Maleri, Mr Prateek Sinha and Mr Manish Khandelwal by way of emails to each of them on 20 December 2015. The emails and responses were copied to both the 3rd and 4th Defendants[^47].

47     On 19 December 2015[^48], the plaintiff had, after providing his detailed responses to the allegations in the Suspension Letter, emailed the 2nd Defendant copying the 3rd and 4th Defendants, to request that he be allowed to resume work based on _inter alia_ the fact that he had fully cooperated with the inquiry, his history of dedicated work, good conduct and personal sacrifices that he had made during his tenure and his assurance of continued goodwill to the company. His email also contained an offer to resign in exchange for an unblemished reference in the event that reinstatement was not possible.

48     On 21 December 2015, after having received the responses from Mr Gaurav Maleri, Mr Prateek Sinha and Mr Manish Khandelwal, the 2nd Defendant then emailed[^49] the plaintiff requesting him to attend a hearing before the Inquiry Committee on 22 December 2015 at 10.15am (“Final Hearing”) in the 1st Defendant’s office.

49     Upon receiving the 2nd Defendant’s email to attend the Final Hearing, the plaintiff sent an email[^50] to inform Ian Kelson on an urgent basis of the actions that had been taken against him which appeared to have followed his “whistleblowing actions”. His email sought to clarify that his only reason for highlighting his concerns was to protect UTI’s reputation but it seemed that he was being persecuted for his actions which were made in good faith. He received no response from Ian Kelson.

#### Plaintiff’s employment terminated

50     On the morning of 22 December 2015, the plaintiff duly attended the Final Hearing before the Inquiry Committee where he answered various questions on the allegations made against him. That same afternoon, he received the 2nd Defendant’s email informing him of the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry and that his employment was terminated (“Termination Email”)[^51]. The email contained a summary report of five charges that were said to have been made out against the plaintiff, under the following headings:

> (a)     DBS deposit deal;

> (b)     Unauthorised client contact;

> (c)     Contact with counterparties;

> (d)     Using personal phone; and

> (e)     Dysfunctional behaviour.

51     According to the Termination Email, all other charges were dropped as the evidence was said to be circumstantial and not fully proven. The Termination Email concluded with a statement informing the plaintiff that his employment with the 1st Defendant was terminated with immediate effect, and as per his employment contract, he would be given salary in lieu of one month’s notice. The plaintiff was also informed that he would be contacted on the final settlement.

52     In follow-up emails[^52] sent on 22 December and 23 December 2015, the plaintiff sought another hearing with the Inquiry Committee to review the summary report in the Termination Email as well as to request that the Inquiry Committee reconsider his offer for resignation. The requests were turned down by the 2nd Defendant who replied informing the plaintiff that he had provided no new evidence to merit a further hearing[^53]. The 2nd Defendant’s reply also pointed out to the plaintiff that the nature of his misconduct typically warranted a summary dismissal without any notice or payment of benefits. The 1st Defendant had been extraordinarily generous by allowing the plaintiff to encash his leave as well as paying him for one month’s notice and a 13th month salary.

53     The plaintiff had updated[^54] Ian Kelson on the termination of his employment on 22 December 2015 but received no response from Kelson.

#### The 1st Defendant informs MAS of the termination of the plaintiff’s employment for misconduct

54     Pursuant to the 2nd Defendant’s instructions, the 3rd Defendant had emailed MAS on 22 December 2015[^55] to inform them that the plaintiff’s services had been terminated. Her email stated that the plaintiff’s misconduct related to his dysfunctional office behaviour and not his investment management activities.

55     Subsequently, the 3rd Defendant had on 28 December 2015 also filed a report[^56] on the plaintiff’s misconduct in compliance with MAS Notice SFA04-N11 under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289)[^57]. A document identified as the Disciplinary Inquiry Report[^58] which paraphrased the contents of the Termination Email and bearing the names of the 2ndDefendant, 3rd Defendant and 4th Defendant as members of the Inquiry Committee was also filed as an attachment. The summary of the plaintiff’s misconduct which had been prepared by the 2nd Defendant in the report to MAS stated as follows:

>     Summary of Misconduct

>     Viral was employed with UTIIS in the position of Portfolio Manager for Fixed Income since Mar‘12. While he has had interpersonal issues with some members of the team, these were not considered be of a serious nature. However since early 2015 he assumed an increasingly aggressive demeanour. The primary issue was around client management. Viral was told clearly in writing that he is not supposed to contact clients. His role is to manage money and engage clients only when called by the sales team. However despite warning, Viral continued to initiate contact with clients without involving the Relationship Managers. He also had independent conversations with Administrators & Custodians without involving the Operations team or his supervisor. This was a serious breach of office code of conduct. While no clients suffered as a result, our internal discipline and business efficiency was seriously hampered. No monetary amount was involved. We engaged the law firm Shooklin & Bok evaluate the evidence. They conducted interviews with some of the employees and confirmed a Prima Facie case for Disciplinary Inquiry. A show cause notice was issued to Viral and he was suspended pending the inquiry.

>     The Disciplinary Committee composed of Shobha (Head of L&C, Murali (CIO) and Praveen (CEO). Viral was cooperative during the process. At the conclusion of the hearings, the committee decided to terminate Viral’s employment.

#### The plaintiff is paid his dues

56     On 1 February 2016[^59], the 1st Defendant’s accounts and administrative staff, one Ms Alicia Law, contacted the plaintiff to inform him to collect his cheque and to return his employment and dependant passes.

57     The final amount paid to the plaintiff was computed at $13,097.49 after deduction for tax clearance. The detailed calculation was provided to the plaintiff in a working sheet attached to a letter dated 4 February 2015 signed by the 2nd Defendant as CEO[^60]. The plaintiff signed his acknowledgment of the same and received the payment[^61].

#### The plaintiff’s new employment with RAMS

58     The plaintiff commenced employment with RAMS on 1 March 2016[^62]. MAS approved his appointment as a licensed representative of RAMS on 2 June 2016.

59     It appears, however, that the plaintiff’s appointment as a licensed representative of RAMS was subject to his compliance with the following conditions, namely[^63]:

> (a)     He must copy the CEO on all external communications;

> (b)     He must obtain email clearance from the CEO or Compliance Officer before contacting any client; and

> (c)     He must adhere to RAMS’s Internal Code of Conduct at all times.

The plaintiff was also informed that he would be subject to fortnightly and monthly checks and required to make declarations in relation to his appointment.

#### The alleged defamatory emails sent by the Defendants to RAMS

60     In April 2016, Ms Tasneem Nasrulla (“Ms Nasrulla”), the Head of Compliance at RAMS, communicated orally with Ms Alicia Law to obtain an employer reference check on the plaintiff. She was informed that the plaintiff was rated as “excellent” and his quality of work was “good”.

61     On 12 May 2016, Ms Alicia Law emailed[^64] Ms Nasrulla to clarify that she was not authorised to give any employer reference and directed Ms Nasrulla to contact UTI’s Head of Compliance or the CEO instead. Apparently, MAS had contacted UTI to enquire about the “good” reference on the plaintiff provided to RAMS. It was only then that UTI realised that RAMS had made a reference check by way of Ms Nasrulla’s telephone conversation with Ms Alicia Law.[^65]

62     On the same day, the 3rd Defendant emailed[^66] Ms Nasrulla to inform her that the plaintiff’s employment was terminated on grounds of misconduct. The email under the subject title “Confirmation of Reference Check” is reproduced below:

>     “We would like to inform you that Mr Viral Bhutta's _(sic)_ employment with our company was terminated on grounds of misconduct.

>     There was disciplinary action taken against him for unauthorized client conduct, non-adherence of internal code of conduct and dysfunctional behaviour.

>     A misconduct report has been filed with the regulator, Monetary Authority of Singapore with regard to the fit and proper criteria not been met. We request you to take this email on record, as our reply to your reference check”

63     On 22 June 2016, the 2nd Defendant sent a further email[^67] to Ms Nasrulla stating _inter alia_ as follows:

>     “One of the elements in the investigation against Mr Viral Bhuta, during the term of his employment with UTI, was an alleged leakage of sensitive and confidential information to Reliance Asset Management. Since the case of misconduct against Viral was strong, we did not pursue scrutinize the data theft. However now that he has joined Reliance, we have been advised to reopen the investigation.

>     We will be seeking a court order to obtain access to his telephone and personal email. I am certain you will assist fully in this investigation.”

64     The plaintiff alleges that both emails are defamatory of him.

#### Commencement of action

65     On 10 April 2017, the plaintiff’s solicitors issued a letter of demand[^68] addressed to the defendants as well as Mr Ian Kelson. The writ in these proceedings was issued against the four defendants on 17 July 2017.

### The 3rd Defendant’s claim against the 1st and 2nd Defendants

66     Shook Lin & Bok LLP entered an appearance for the four defendants collectively and filed a defence to the various claims as well as a counterclaim for the 1st Defendant. After the 3rd Defendant had left the 1st Defendant’s employment, she had some disagreement with the litigation strategy employed by the 1st Defendant. She then opted to engage her own solicitors. Through her new solicitors, Gloria James-Civetta & Co, she filed a separate defence to the plaintiff’s claim against her.

67     She also made a third party claim against the 1st and/or the 2nd Defendants for an indemnity in respect of the plaintiff’s claim against her on the basis that she had at all times acted in the course of her employment with the 1st Defendant and/or on the instructions of the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendant had given a letter of undertaking[^69] to indemnify the 3rd Defendant in relation to any damages and costs arising out of and in connection with the plaintiff’s suit. The 3rd Defendant’s claim will also be dealt with in this Judgment.

## Plaintiff’s case

### Breach of employment contract

68     Against the 1st Defendant, the plaintiff’s pleaded claim is for a declaration that he had been wrongfully dismissed in breach of the express and implied terms of his employment contract as well as for damages to be assessed for the wrongful dismissal.

69     He relies in particular on the following provisions of the 1st Defendant’s Personnel Policy[^70] (“Personnel Policy”) which was expressly incorporated into his employment contract by virtue of clause 11 of his letter of appointment as “Portfolio Manager – Fixed Income” dated 28 February 2012[^71] (“Employment Agreement”):

>      **2.19 Business Ethics**

>     ... Any UTI IS employee who has knowledge of a violation of law or a failure to meet ethical standards should report such knowledge to the CEO / Compliance Officer.

>      **4.14 Dignity at work**

>     …No form of harassment, victimisation or bullying will be tolerated or condoned and all complaints of such behaviour will be properly investigated and subject to disciplinary action. If you are being victimised or bullied, you should report the matter in confidence to the Chief Executive Officer.

>      **4.17 Misconduct & Fraud**

>     ...

>     Any employee/Licensed representative who wishes to appeal against any disciplinary action taken against them shall follow the procedure as mentioned in the Employee Grievance procedure in the employee handbook.

>      **4.18 Employee Grievance Procedure**

>     If at any time during his/her employment with the Company an employee has a problem, grievance or complaint, every endeavour should be made to resolve it informally by both UTI IS and the employee. In circumstances where this is not possible there is a formal procedure, which the employee can follow. If an employee needs to use this procedure, it will be conducted in complete confidence as far as possible. Every attempt will be made to listen to his/her case sympathetically and for a mutually satisfactory conclusion to be reached. An employee must take all reasonable steps to attend any meetings held under the procedure.

>     Procedure

>     There are three stages to follow, and because it is important that any grievance be dealt with speedily, certain time limits for the procedure have been set.

>     Stage One

>     The employee should set out his/her grievance in writing and give it to his/her immediate supervisor who will arrange a meeting with him/her within five working days to consider the matter. The meeting will normally be attended by the employee 's immediate supervisor and compliance officer. …The response will notify the employee of the right to appeal to the next stage if they are dissatisfied with the decision and will specify to whom the appeal should be addressed.

>     Stage Two

>     If the matter is not resolved at Stage One, the employee may within five working days of receiving the written response from the UTI IS take the grievance, in writing, to the next stage of the grievance procedure…

>     Stage Three

>     In those cases where the matter remains unresolved, the employee may take the grievance to the final stage of the procedure. This appeal must be submitted in writing within fifteen working days of the receipt by the employee of the decision at Stage Two. The employee will be invited to attend a further meeting, the grievance will be discussed by the immediate supervisor, compliance officer and any other functional head & CEO, which will be held within ten working days of receipt by the UTI IS of the notice of appeal from Stage Two unless there is a good reason for delay. After the appeal meeting, UTI IS will inform the employee of the decision in writing and the decision will be final. If an employee's grievance concerns his/her immediate supervisor, he/she should take the matter up directly either with the Compliance officer. At any interview under this Grievance Procedure, the employee has the right to be accompanied. This includes the right to be accompanied by a colleague or manager of his/her choice from his/her particular Business or if necessary, elsewhere within UTI IS. The companion may act as a witness, take notes of the proceedings, address the hearing and confer with the employee. The companion cannot act as the employee's representative or answer questions on the employee's behalf.

>      **4.19 Whistle Blowing**

>     Violation of Laws and Regulations or UTI IS rules or improper business conduct, the Staff should report to the Head of Compliance. If the allegations relate to legal and compliance or improper conduct related to work conditions or environment, the Staff should report to the Chief Executive officer.

>     The Staff also has the option of reporting locally or directly to the ultimate holding company i.e. UTI Asset Management Company Limited.

>     The report may be made by email. The officer concerned will investigate the same and report to the management of the Company or to the board of directors as the case may be. After implementation of remedial action brought about by the whistle blowing, the officer concerned shall monitor for a period of 6 months or such longer time as deemed appropriate to ensure the whistle blower is not being treated _\[sic\] \[un\]_fairly.

>     For the avoidance of doubt, Management shall ensure the persons conducting the investigation are not subject to retaliation by the alleged wrong-doer or his department or his management.

>      **6 Ethical Concerns**

>     If an employee suspects that any UTI IS employee (or any temporary / contract worker) is violating any or regulation _\[sic\]_, or if an employee has an ethical concern, the employee must report immediately to the Compliance Officer. Situations which may cause concern include any action that is illegal, against the public interest, which could endanger the health and safety of any individual or the environment or which constitutes a potential miscarriage of justice. Every effort will be made to ensure that the communication is held in confidence. UTI IS will prohibit any retaliatory action against an employee for reporting, in good faith, any such information in accordance with the policy. Every matter will be considered and where appropriate, thoroughly investigated…”

70     As for implied terms, the plaintiff pleads that the 1st Defendant was subject to the following[^72]:

> (a)     an implied duty of mutual trust and confidence between them;

> (b)     an implied term that the 1st Defendant as employer would not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between employer and employee;

> (c)     an implied term that the 1st Defendant would treat the plaintiff fairly in the manner of dismissal; and

> (d)     an implied term that the 1st Defendant would not exercise the contractual right to terminate the Employment Agreement in bad faith.

71     With regard to his whistleblowing, the plaintiff avers that he had acted in the best interests of UTI and UTI’s clients by reporting his concerns on _inter alia_ late trades, leveraged deposits, and misrepresentation to investors in confidence to Mr Ian Kelson who was a senior member of UTI’s Fixed Income Steering Committee as well as the Vice-President of T Rowe Price Inc. However, no satisfactory action was taken by UTI to properly investigate his whistleblowing allegations in good faith. Instead, UTI AMC had recommended that action be taken against the plaintiff despite the fact that remedial action had been recommended to improve UTI’s internal processes based on his whistleblowing allegation in respect of late trading and swing pricing. Further, the plaintiff averred that his whistleblowing allegation in respect of late trading was vindicated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) in its letter to UTI on 10 February 2017[^73].

72     The plaintiff’s case is that the manner and timing of the disciplinary inquiry, its decision-making process, the constitution of the Inquiry Committee comprising the 2nd to 4th Defendants (as his whistleblowing allegations were made against them), the termination of his employment, and the rejection of his request for an appeal was unreasonable, wrongful, unfair and/or carried out in bad faith[^74]. He claims that in breach of paragraphs 4.17, 4.18, 4.19 and/or 6 of the Personnel Policy as well as the implied terms of the Employment Agreement, the entire process leading to the termination of his employment was intended to stifle and/or retaliate against his whistleblowing allegations.

73     The plaintiff says[^75] that the Inquiry Committee was controlled by the 2nd Defendant who had intended to retaliate against the plaintiff for his whistleblowing allegations. This was evident from the conduct of the Final Hearing on 22 December 2015 during which:

> (a)     the 3rd Defendant had kept silent throughout and continued to do so despite being asked expressly by the 2nd Defendant to speak; and

> (b)     the 4th Defendant had expressed his sympathy with the plaintiff on some of the issues brought up in the disciplinary inquiry and stating that the plaintiff was not solely to blame.

74     It is also the plaintiff’s case[^76] that Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement, in so far as the 1st Defendant has relied on the same for the termination of his employment, is illegal, null and void under section 8 read with section 10(2) of the Employment Act (Cap. 91 Rev. Ed. 2009). Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement states that:

>     “The Company reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time without assigning any specific reason by giving one month's notice upon confirmation and without any notice during the probation period.”

### Defamation

#### The 3rd Defendant’s email to RAMS (“the Words”)

75     The plaintiff claims that he had been defamed by the email sent by the 3rd Defendant to Ms Nasrulla of RAMS on 12 May 2016 (reproduced at \[62\] above) which was copied to the 2nd Defendant. He pleads that the words used in the email (“the Words”) in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and/or were understood to mean that[^77]:

> (a)     he was a disobedient employee;

> (b)     he engaged in unauthorised client conduct;

> (c)     he did not adhere to UTI’s ‘internal code of conduct’;

> (d)     he is a dysfunctional person and/or is unable to behave or work within social norms;

> (e)     he was dysfunctional at work; and/or

> (f)     his misconduct during his employment with UTI was of such a serious nature that he did not meet the MAS’s fit and proper criteria.

76     The 2nd Defendant had also procured and/or caused UTI to publish the Words or similar words defamatory of the plaintiff to the MAS.

#### The 2nd Defendant’s email to RAMS (“the Additional Words”)

77     The plaintiff further claims that the 2nd Defendant’s email sent to Ms Nasrulla of RAMS on 22 June 2016 (reproduced at \[63\] above) was defamatory of him in the way of his office, profession and/or calling. In their natural and ordinary meaning, the words used in the 2nd Defendant’s email (“the Additional Words”) meant and/or were understood to mean that[^78]:

> (a)     the plaintiff was dishonest and/or a thief;

> (b)     the plaintiff breached his employment duties by leaking confidential information to RAMS;

> (c)     the plaintiff was guilty of very serious misconduct during his employment with UTI;

> (d)     UTI had a very strong case against the plaintiff for misconduct; and/or

> (e)     the plaintiff committed civil and/or criminal wrongs involving data theft.

78     The plaintiff claims further that the Words and/or the Additional Words and/or similar words had also been published to MAS and were calculated to disparage him in his office, profession, calling, trade and/or business[^79].

79     The publications were also made falsely and maliciously with the intent of sabotaging and/or undermining the plaintiff's employment by RAMS, and was part of a deliberate plan by the 2nd Defendant to inflict damage on the plaintiff’s employment by RAMS as well as his employment prospects, as an unjustified retaliation for the plaintiff’s whistleblowing allegations against him[^80].

### The defendants’ unlawful means and/or lawful means conspiracy

80     Additionally, the plaintiff claims damages for conspiracy against each of the defendants. At paragraphs 66(a), 66(c) and 66(d) of the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the plaintiff had detailed the particulars of how the defendants (or any two or more of them together) are alleged to have committed unlawful means conspiracy by:

> (a)     procuring and/or effecting the wrongful dismissal of the plaintiff on 22 December 2015 in breach of the implied and/or express terms of the Employment Agreement and the Personnel Policy in order to retaliate against the plaintiff for his whistle-blowing allegations and/or to stifle any embarrassment that might be caused by a proper investigation into the whistle-blowing allegations;

> (b)     wrongfully lodging a misconduct report with the MAS based on the findings of the internal inquiry; and

> (c)     causing injury or damage to the plaintiff’s personal and professional reputation by publishing the Words and/or the Additional Words.

81     Relying on the same set of detailed particulars in paragraph 66(a) of the statement of claim, the plaintiff has additionally pleaded at paragraph 66(b) that the defendants had conspired and combined together with the predominant intention to injure the plaintiff to satisfy concurrently the elements of a claim for lawful means conspiracy.

## The defence and counterclaim of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Defendants

### Plaintiff not a genuine whistle-blower

82     The Joint Defendants deny that the plaintiff is entitled to any of the reliefs sought in his statement of claim. They deny that the plaintiff was a genuine whistleblower when he made the allegations in November 2015 against the 2nd Defendant, and that he was entitled to any protection under the terms of his Employment Agreement or the Personnel Policy. In fact, they say that the plaintiff had made the various allegations to discredit the 1st and 2nd Defendants; and that even after the termination of his employment, the plaintiff had continued with his campaign to discredit the 2nd Defendant by making allegations of misconduct to the regulatory authorities in Singapore as well as in Ireland. The plaintiff’s allegations were found to be unsubstantiated, and no sanctions were imposed on the 1st Defendant[^81].

### Plaintiff’s employment was lawfully terminated in accordance with the Employment Agreement

83     The Joint Defendants further deny that the termination of the plaintiff’s employment was a retaliation against him for his alleged whistleblowing. Their case is that the plaintiff’s employment was lawfully terminated in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement.

84     The 1st Defendant says that it was entitled to dismiss the plaintiff based on the findings of the Inquiry Committee on the plaintiff’s conduct[^82]. This would appear to be a reference to Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement which states as follows:

>     You will be liable to be dismissed in case you violate any of the terms of employment or any local rules and laws or indulge yourself in any malpractice or are subjected to prosecution.

85     It was also entitled to dismiss the plaintiff for having breached an implied term of the Employment Agreement that he would carry out his duties as an employee with due care and would at all material times act in the 1st Defendant’s interest. In particular, it was alleged that the plaintiff was guilty of serious negligence or gross misconduct in connection with the “Phoenix Trade Incident” which had caused the 1st Defendant reputational and financial loss.

86     Be that as it may, the Joint Defendants say that the plaintiff’s employment was lawfully terminated in accordance with Clause 12 of his Employment Agreement as he had been given one month’s notice[^83]. Clause 12 (see \[74\] above) allows the 1st Defendant to terminate the plaintiff’s employment without assigning any specific reason by merely giving him one month’s notice.

87     In this regard, the 1st, 2nd and 4th Defendants rely on the fact that the plaintiff was allowed to serve his one month’s notice at the end of which the 1st Defendant had paid him his 13th month bonus (even though he was not contractually entitled to such payment) and allowed him to encash his unconsumed leave. The plaintiff had acknowledged and accepted payment of the amounts computed by the 1st Defendant as due to him.

### Justification, qualified privilege and fair comment

88     Concerning the libel claim founded on the publication of the Additional Words set out in the 2nd Defendant’s email to Ms Nasrulla of RAMS, the 1st and 2nd Defendants deny that the Additional Words carry any defamatory meaning. Read in the context of the 2nd Defendant’s email, the Additional Words meant and/or were understood to mean that[^84]:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s employment with the 1st Defendant was terminated on the grounds of misconduct by the plaintiff;

> (b)     the 1st Defendant had concluded that the plaintiff was guilty of the misconduct after conducting the necessary investigations;

> (c)     the MAS had been duly informed of the 1st Defendant’s findings of the plaintiff’s misconduct; and

> (d)     the 1st Defendant had been advised to reopen the investigations into allegations of data theft against the plaintiff.

89     Even if the Additional Words were found to carry any defamatory meaning, the 1st and 2nd Defendants say they are entitled to rely on the defences of justification, qualified privilege and fair comment.

90     In regard to the defence of justification, the Additional Words in their natural and ordinary meaning were true in substance and in fact[^85].

91     The defence of qualified privilege applied to the publication of the “Additional Words” as the plaintiff was a former employee of the 1st Defendant as well as a registered capital markets services representative. The 1st Defendant was required to provide references to the plaintiff’s new employer, RAMS, both at RAMS’s request and at the direction of MAS. The 2nd Defendant’s email was published only to RAMS which was entitled to receive the reference from the 1st Defendant. The 1st and 2nd Defendants had a legitimate duty and/or interest to communicate the Additional Words to RAMS which had a legitimate interest to receive and/or be informed of the same[^86].

92     The defence of fair comment was also available as the Additional Words with the comments or expressions of opinion as pleaded in the statement of claim were fair comment on a matter of public interest, namely the interest of providing a full and accurate reference to the plaintiff’s new employer, RAM[^87].

### No conspiracy by unlawful means; no predominant intention to injure the plaintiff

93     As for the claims in conspiracy levelled against them, the Joint Defendants say that they are not liable as there was no agreement and/or combination amongst them nor any predominant intention to injure the plaintiff. Further, at all times the 2nd and 4th Defendants had been acting in good faith and in accordance with their duties as employees of UTI, and therefore cannot be held liable for the tort of conspiracy[^88].

### Counterclaim

94     The 1st Defendant has also pleaded a counterclaim against the plaintiff for damages in the sum of USD 59,520.00 which it allegedly suffered as a result of the plaintiff’s breach of an implied term of his Employment Agreement and/or his duty at law to carry out his duties with the reasonable skill and care to be expected of a competent Portfolio Manager[^89].

95     The counterclaim is premised on the plaintiff’s failure to communicate the crucial email of 9 July 2015 from SBI Bahrain to his colleagues, resulting in the 1st Defendant having to compensate DBS Bank in respect of the Phoenix Trade Incident as described in \[22\] above.

## The 3rd Defendant’s defence and claim for an indemnity

96     As far as the plaintiff’s wrongful dismissal claim is concerned, the 3rd Defendant’s case is that she was essentially an uninvolved party. She had, at all times, acted as an employee/servant of the 1st Defendant and in accordance with the instructions of the 2nd Defendant as its CEO, and as such, she cannot be held personally liable to the plaintiff. All actions and decisions were taken by the 2nd Defendant without any consultation, agreement or discussion with the 3rd Defendant. Her involvement in the termination of the plaintiff’s employment was limited only to what the 2nd Defendant had chosen to divulge to her[^90].

97     In terms of the communications sent by the 3rd Defendant to MAS, she says that these were done in her capacity as the designated compliance officer of the 1st Defendant who had to ensure that the company and its licensed representatives adhere to the relevant regulations, notices and guidelines, including MAS Notice SFA04-N11.

98     The 3rd Defendant had acted as the 2nd Defendant’s messenger, and according to his instructions, in relation to the report to MAS on the investigation of misconduct against the plaintiff which was carried out as per the regulatory requirements.

99     As for the plaintiff’s defamation claim against her, the 3rd Defendant denies any liability as she says that she had also acted within the scope of her employment when she sent the email dated 12 May 2016 containing the Words to RAMS. At the point of publication, the contents of the email were justified as the plaintiff had been found guilty of misconduct and his employment terminated as a result. This was regardless of whether the 1st Defendant had been right in its findings of misconduct against the plaintiff. In addition to the defence of justification, the 3rd Defendant has also pleaded the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment[^91].

100    Since the 3rd Defendant had always been acting within the scope of her employment, it is her case that the plaintiff’s claim against her for conspiracy must also fail[^92].

101    As against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, the 3rd Defendant claims against them on the principle of vicarious liability, an indemnity to such an extent as the court may find or give in favour of the plaintiff’s claim together with the costs of this action[^93].

102    The 1st and 2nd Defendants deny the 3rd Defendant’s account that she was an uninvolved party in the investigation and termination of the plaintiff’s employment claim. They say that as the Head of Legal and Compliance, she was aware of the investigations carried out against the plaintiff.

103    In defence to the 3rd Defendant’s claim for an indemnity, the 1st and 2nd Defendants rely on the express terms of a letter of undertaking dated 25 July 2017 (“the Undertaking”) signed by the 1st Defendant and accepted by the 3rd Defendant which she had not complied with[^94].

## Issues to be determined

104    From the various claims and defences as pleaded by the parties, the main issues that the court has to decide are enumerated below:

> (a)     Whether the 1st Defendant’s termination of the plaintiff’s employment for misconduct was wrongful and in breach of the Employment Agreement, and if so, what remedies the plaintiff is entitled to (“**Issue 1**”);

> (b)     Whether the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants are liable to the plaintiff for defamation in respect of the Words and the Additional Words (“**Issue 2**”); and

> (c)     Whether the acts of the defendants amount to conspiracy by lawful and/or unlawful means (“**Issue 3**”);

> (d)     Whether the plaintiff is liable to the 1st Defendant on its counterclaim for breach of an implied term of his Employment Agreement and/or negligence arising from his failure to communicate the crucial email dated 9 July 2015 to his colleagues in respect of the Phoenix Trade Incident (“**Issue 4**”); and

> (e)     Whether the 3rd Defendant is entitled to claim an indemnity against the 1st and/or the 2nd Defendants in respect of the plaintiff’s claim and for her costs (“**Issue 5**”).

105    In determining **Issue 1**, the following sub-issues have to be considered:

> (a)     Whether the plaintiff was a genuine whistleblower entitled to protection under the UTI Personnel Policy;

> (b)     Whether the 1st Defendant was entitled to dismiss the Plaintiff for cause under Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement based on the findings of misconduct by the Inquiry Committee;

> (c)     Whether the 1st Defendant was entitled to dismiss the plaintiff with one month’s notice under Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement;

> (d)     Whether the manner of the plaintiff’s dismissal was in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence; and

> (e)     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration and / or damages.

106    In determining **Issue 2**, the following sub-issues have to be considered:

> (a)     Whether the Words and Additional Words in their natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory of the plaintiff;

> (b)     Whether the Words and Additional Words were true in substance and fact, so as to avail the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants to the defence of justification;

> (c)     Whether the Words and Additional Words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege;

> (d)     Whether the Words and Additional Words were fair comment on a matter of public interest, and

> (e)     If the Words and Additional Words are found to be defamatory, whether the plaintiff is entitled to aggravated damages.

107    In determining **Issue 3**, the court would need to consider whether there had been any agreement among the defendants to injure the plaintiff; any predominant intention to injure him; and whether the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants were acting in good faith and in accordance with their duties as employees of the 1st Defendant.

108    In determining **Issue 4**, the task of the court will be to assess if the evidence adduced by the 1st Defendant has proven the breaches of duty pleaded in the counterclaim against the plaintiff, and the losses particularised at paragraph 22 of the Joint Defendants’ Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 3).

109    In determining **Issue 5**, the court will need to examine the scope of obligation of the 1st and 2nd Defendants to the 3rd Defendant under the Letter of Undertaking dated 25 July 2017 provided to the 3rd Defendant.

## Issue 1: Whether the 1st Defendant’s termination of the plaintiff’s employment for misconduct was wrongful and in breach of the Employment Agreement

### Whether the plaintiff was a genuine whistleblower entitled to protection under the UTI Personnel Policy

#### Plaintiff’s case

110    The cornerstone of the plaintiff’s case is that he had been persecuted for his whistleblowing action against the 2nd Defendant culminating in his wrongful dismissal[^95]. He contends that the 1st Defendant’s Personnel Policy, which ought to have guaranteed him protection, had been breached.

111    Specifically, he pleads reliance on Paragraph 4.19 and Paragraph 6 of the Personnel Policy. Paragraph 4.19 requires UTI to monitor the situation for six months after remedial action had been taken to ensure that the whistleblower is not treated unfairly, see below:

>      **4.19 Whistle Blowing**

>     Violation of Laws and Regulations or UTI IS rules or improper business conduct, the Staff should report to the Head of Compliance. If the allegations relate to legal and compliance or improper conduct related to work conditions or environment, the Staff should report to the Chief Executive officer.

>     …

>     … After implementation of remedial action brought about by the whistle blowing, the officer concerned shall monitor for a period of 6 months or such longer time as deemed appropriate to ensure the whistle blower is not treated \[_sic_\] \[un\]fairly.

>     …

112    Paragraph 6 prohibits retaliatory action against an employee who reports the violation of any regulation or ethical concern in good faith, see below:

>      **6 Ethical Concerns**

>     If an employee suspects that any UTI IS employee (or any temporary / contract worker) is violating any or regulation \[sic\], or if an employee has an ethical concern, the employee must report immediately to the Compliance Officer. Situations which may cause concern include any action that is illegal, against the public interest, which could endanger the health and safety of any individual or the environment or which constitutes a potential miscarriage of justice. Every effort will be made to ensure that the communication is held in confidence. UTI IS will prohibit any retaliatory action against an employee for reporting, in good faith any such information in accordance with the policy. Every matter will be considered and where appropriate, thoroughly investigated…”

113    While paragraphs 4.19 and 6 of the Personnel Policy contemplate that a whistleblower would approach the Head of Compliance with his concerns, the plaintiff explained that as Ian Kelson was one of UTI’s directors and the nominee of T Rowe Price, he had perceived Kelson to be the best person to act independently on his whistleblowing which implicated the 2nd Defendant. This was also expressly permitted under Paragraph 4.19 of the Personnel Policy[^96].

114    The plaintiff contends that his right to whistleblower protection under Paragraph 4.19 of the Personnel Policy, unlike that under Paragraph 6, was not contingent on whether the whistleblowing was made in good faith or bad faith[^97].

115    In any case, the plaintiff submits that he was a genuine whistleblower as the concerns which he raised were supported by objective evidence. The UTI- AMC Report had found the existence of late trades and made several recommendations to improve the approval and reporting processes. In respect of swing pricing, the UTI-AMC Report had acknowledged that this mechanism had been overlooked and steps were taken for it to be implemented[^98].

116    As the plaintiff’s whistleblowing report did result in remedial actions being taken, this would suffice to show that the allegations were made in good faith. The letter from CBI had outlined lapses in the UTI IFIF regarding the approval processes and reporting of late trades which had prompted its chairman, Mr Simon McDowell, to propose a policy review[^99].

117    As further illustration of his good faith, the plaintiff’s allegations had highlighted, as an ethical concern, that UTI’s Personnel Policy required its employees to adhere to the Investment Management Association of Singapore (“IMAS”)’s code of ethics and standards of professional conduct (“IMAS Code”)[^100]. It was pointed out that the IMAS Code imposes a blanket prohibition against allowing late trades or subscriptions past the dealing deadline. Even if the directors could grant approval for late trades under the fund’s prospectus, this would still be in breach of the stringent ethical standards of the IMAS Code[^101].

#### Defendants’ case

118    The Joint Defendants say that the plaintiff was not a genuine whistleblower and thus he was not entitled to whistleblower protection. This is because his complaints were not made to advance or protect UTI’s interest but were meant to discredit the 2nd Defendant and besmirch his reputation. The common thread in the plaintiff’s allegations was his bitter unhappiness with the 2nd Defendant for disagreeing with his views[^102]. Further, the plaintiff’s allegations had been fully investigated by UTI AMC and dismissed as seen in the findings made in the UTI-AMC Report[^103].

119    UTI AMC had also referred the plaintiff’s whistleblowing emails to KPMG Services Pte Ltd (“KPMG”) and requested KPMG to consider the matters raised when preparing UTI’s internal audit report for the financial year 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016. KPMG issued its report around 15 August 2016[^104] which had included the question of late trading in its review. The KPMG report did not find any violations that substantiated the plaintiff’s allegations.

#### Was plaintiff a genuine whistleblower?

120    As Ian Kelson was a director of UTI at the material time, I agree with the plaintiff that it was not wrong for him to have approached Kelson with his allegations although Paragraph 4.19 of the Personnel Policy contemplated that a whistleblower would bring his concerns to the Head of Compliance as the first line of reporting.

121    To determine if the plaintiff was indeed a genuine whistleblower entitled to protection under the Personnel Policy, the substance of his allegations and the circumstances under which they were made need to be examined. If it is found that the matters complained of were untrue or merely grievances of a personal nature on the part of the plaintiff, then the plaintiff cannot be regarded as a whistleblower with the consequence that UTI ought to be entitled to take action as appropriate under the terms of the Employment Agreement. If this were not so, then an employee would be entitled to make any kind of complaint no matter how spurious and _mala fide_ and still claim protection under the Personnel Policy which is untenable.

122    A close examination of the various allegations reveals that the plaintiff’s unhappiness appeared to stem from his disagreement with the 2nd Defendant’s approach, especially when the decisions made affected him personally:

> (a)     In respect of the 2nd Defendant’s approval of what the plaintiff regarded as highly leveraged deposits with Middle Eastern banks, the plaintiff’s complaint was that the 2nd Defendant had “_not paid heed to_” to a concern which he had raised that UTI’s lack of credit coverage of those banks.

> (b)     Concerning the 2nd Defendant’s position as the director on the boards of UTI’s fund companies as well as being a member of UTI’s Investment and Risk Committees, the plaintiff’s complaint was that this had allowed him to “_intimidate and override other voices of reason and this creates a conflict of interest_”. It can reasonably be inferred from these remarks that the plaintiff was referring to himself as one of the “_voices of reason_” that the 2nd Defendant had overridden.

> (c)     The complaint that the 2nd Defendant had marginalised “_the role and say of the Head of Investment in matters related to compensation and training and by keeping the decision making process very opaque and subjective_” appeared to be a pointed reference to the 2nd Defendant’s veto of the 4th Defendant’s decision to allow the plaintiff to attend the Mumbai conference.

> (d)     In respect of the allegation on “_late trades_”, the plaintiff appeared to be upset with the 2nd Defendant’s decision as it meant he had to do additional work. The plaintiff explained the impact of the 2nd Defendant’s approval at paragraph 67 of his AEIC as follows:

>>> 67.    The impact of this exceptional approval (the "Credit Suisse Late Trade") affected my sphere of work only the next day, i.e. 2 December 2014, when the exceptional approval had caused the sequence of 'estimated cash flow projection' files to get altered. The estimated cash flow projection files were sent on an ongoing basis via email by State Street after it had processed each day's subscriptions and redemptions which it received from investors such as Credit Suisse, by Fax, SWIFT messaging etc. As the portfolio manager, I would pre-plan my investment activity based on the 'estimated cash flow projection' files received from State Street. A change in this sequence would cause me to re-work my investment plan based on the estimated cash flows in the file sent by State Street.

> The plaintiff’s unhappiness in not being consulted on the approval given by the 2nd Defendant is also evident from his second email of 19 November 2015 wherein he had highlighted that _“(t)he impact of such an approval was not discussed with the investment team_” and “_Praveen took these exceptional steps without discussing with others who might be impacted by this_.”

> (e)     In respect of the allegation on misuse of funds and/or the training budget, it is telling that the plaintiff was again expressing his displeasure with the 2nd Defendant’s refusal to allow him to attend the Mumbai conference. His 6 November 2015 email to Ian Kelson stated that:

>>> “While we are required to tell the clients that I regularly travel to Mumbai to meet the portfolio companies and the India team, the reality is totally different. Such trips are actually not approved..”

>>> …

>>> Tens of thousands of dollars are used for offsite trips (where drinks and private recreational activities of individuals are also billed to company accounts with full knowledge of Praveen) or for unrelated activities such as poker training sessions or for paintball matches. Quite surprisingly though the investment team’s need to keep up-to-date with investment portfolio companies and to meet and interact with the India team was ignored.”

> (f)     As to the allegation on short redemptions (“Incident 3” in the plaintiff’s email of 19 November 2015), the plaintiff’s complaint that _“(t)his was done against the email advice of the Fund Manager (on which Praveen was marked) as well as the Transfer Agent_” was an obvious indication that he was displeased that the 2nd Defendant had yet again acted against his recommendation as the fund manager.

> (g)     On the allegation on swing pricing (“Incident 4” in the plaintiff’s email of 19 November 2015), the plaintiff was clearly unhappy with the 2nd Defendant’s comments in the latter’s email which appeared to disparage him to his colleagues. This can be seen from the plaintiff’s words reproduced below–

>>> “In a March 2015 email response, to my suggestion for using swing pricing and anti-dilution tools, Praveen tried to portray me (while marking other team members on the email) as _taking a 'high moral ground'_ and _implied I was being greedy_ for not soft-closing the fund_.”_

(emphasis in _italics_ mine)

123    In regard to the allegation on the Rainbow H Fund (“Incident 1” in the plaintiff’s email of 19 November 2015), the complaint pertained to the 2nd Defendant’s allegedly unfounded assurance of investment returns given in 2011. As this had happened even before the plaintiff joined UTI, the UTI-AMC Report had concluded that the plaintiff’s complaints in this regard were clearly “_motivated_”. Given that the losses were discovered in July 2012, the plaintiff’s motivation to whistleblow on this matter more than three years later is questionable[^105].

124    What was particularly significant though was the timing of the plaintiff’s emails to Ian Kelson. The chronology of events showed that while his alleged concerns arose from events dating back to 2011 (in the case of the Rainbow H Fund) as well as December 2014 (in the case of the approved late trade from Citibank), his first email setting out his alleged concerns was sent only on 6 November 2015. This occurred almost immediately after the 2nd Defendant had denied him permission to travel to Mumbai:

> (a)     The 2nd Defendant’s email to the 4th Defendant and the plaintiff disallowing the trip was sent out on Friday 6 November 2015 at 8.43pm.

> (b)     The plaintiff’s email to Ian Kelson to “whistleblow” against the 2nd Defendant was sent out on Friday 6 November 2015 at 11.52pm.

125    Just before the plaintiff had sent his second email to Ian Kelson on 19 November 2015 at 7.52am, the 2nd Defendant had acted to curb the plaintiff’s direct communications with State Street by way of his email dated 18 November 2015 sent at 4.00pm. As the plaintiff had been emailing State Street just before this to correct the meeting minutes of the UTI IFIF board of directors (without the 2nd Defendant’s knowledge), he must have been upset by the new instructions from the CEO.

126    Accordingly, I find that the timings of the two emails to Ian Kelson – the first email to raise a “disturbing trend” and the second email to provide specific “incidents” to elaborate on his concerns – were more than just a coincidence. They would appear to be the plaintiff’s knee-jerk reactions against the 2nd Defendant’s actions which curbed his activities.

127    The plaintiff’s allegations had been investigated in considerable detail by the leadership of the 1st Defendant’s parent company and the 2nd Defendant exonerated. The plaintiff, however, had refused to accept this and claimed that it was a mere “whitewashing” exercise. From the evidence, this assertion of “whitewashing” is not borne out:

> (a)      Late trades:

>> (i)       It was clear that the approvals given by the 2nd Defendant were within the window expressly permitted by the terms of the fund prospectus[^106]. As stated in the UTI IFIF prospectus:

>>>> Applications accepted by the Administrator on behalf of the Company and received by the Administrator prior to the Dealing Deadline for any Dealing Day will be dealt with on that Dealing Day. Any applications received after the Dealing Deadline will be dealt with on the following Dealing Day subsequent to the relevant Dealing Day unless the Directors in their absolute discretion otherwise determine. **_Such discretion may only be exercised by the Directors where the application is received subsequent to the Dealing Deadline but before the Net Asset Valuation Point._** No interest will be paid in respect of payments received in circumstances where the application is held over until a subsequent Dealing Day.

(emphasis in **bold** mine)

>> (ii)       The Dealing Deadline was defined in the prospectus as 9am Irish time while the Valuation Point referred to 12 noon Irish time on the relevant Business Day. A Business Day referred to any day that the banks and exchanges in India, Ireland and Singapore are open for business.

>> (iii)       It was also noted in the UTI AMC report[^107] that as regards industry practice, the general practice for Europe is to accept applications for shares

>>> “for which the subscription proceeds are to be received even after 5 – 7 Business Days following the relevant Valuation Date. In other words, an investor can get the NAV of the relevant valuation day by just submitting the subscription form and amount can be transferred after 5 business days..”

>> (iv)       Accordingly, UTI AMC had found that the six reported late trades had been carried out in accordance with the prospectus, and there were _per se_ no violations. Suggestions were made to improve the reporting of late trades to the board of directors to include detail on the specifics and the rationale. It was also noted that one trade had not been reported to the board which should be done at the earliest.

> (b)      Misuse of funds:

>> The plaintiff’s allegation on misuse of funds for private recreational activities with the full knowledge of the 2nd Defendant was investigated fully.

>> UTI AMC had obtained from UTI the relevant accounting documents including the Profit & Loss statements, the expense ledger of operational, business promotion, staff welfare and offsite expenses etc together with the supporting documents. Each item was verified and no irregularity found. From a scrutiny of the documents, UTI AMC found no evidence that company funds were used for private recreational activities of any individuals or employees[^108].

> (c)      Rainbow Fund H:

>> Mr Rahman had looked into the history of the Fund and found that it had been launched without proper due diligence. The 2nd Defendant’s involvement in the Fund was directed by UTI AMC which was to salvage the bad situation that the Fund was in at that material time after the team in charge had been asked to leave the company. Contrary to the plaintiff’s allegation that the 2nd Defendant had assured a 6% return, there was an email from the 2nd Defendant to his team to study all marketing material to ensure that the company had not given investors any suggestion of assured return or protected principal.

> (d)      Swing pricing:

>> UTI AMC had looked into the background and found that at the time of its launch, UTI IFIF had overlooked the swing pricing mechanism. As it was favoured by clients, approval of the inclusion of swing pricing in the prospectus had been sought and given by the board of directors. Thereafter, approval had also been given by CBI to amend the fund’s prospectus. It was anticipated that swing pricing would be implemented once shareholder approval was also obtained.

128    Further, the regulatory authorities had taken no action against UTI or the 2nd Defendant on the allegation of late trades:

> (a)     While the CBI had written to the UTI IFIF to state its observation on the need for more vigilant record-keeping, it had stated that it “does not intend to take any further actions around these matters”[^109].

> (b)     MAS had made several queries to UTI in respect the alleged “late trades” in the UTI IFIF in early 2018. While there was no written conclusion, up to the date of the trial, no action had been taken in respect of the plaintiff’s complaint[^110].

129    In relation to the omission in reporting on one of the late trades, the UTI IFIF board were subsequently informed that this was due to an error on the part of the fund administrator which had caused some embarrassment to the board vis-à-vis CBI. The administrator had been required to provide assurance that such an error would not be repeated[^111]. Hence, there was no ethical or procedural lapse on the part of UTI or the 2nd Defendant as such.

130    As for the plaintiff’s ethical concern on a breach of the IMAS Code, given that he was the appointed fund manager for the UTI IFIF from its inception, he would have surely been apprised of the terms in the Fund prospectus which provide for a more generous definition of a dealing deadline than that in the IMAS Code. In any case, when the 3rd Defendant as Head of Compliance was cross-examined[^112], she had confirmed that there was no breach of process on the part of UTI although the IMAS code of ethics set a higher standard. In fact, MAS had not raised any issue with the six late trades that were flagged[^113]. It seemed to me that the plaintiff was clutching at straws to find some wrongdoing on the part of the 2nd Defendant merely to portray himself as a true whistleblower when this was not the case.

131    Taking into account that a number of the plaintiff’s complaints were totally unsubstantiated (such as misuse of funds for recreational activities and buffer for P&L) and without merit (such as the 2nd Defendant’s self- appointment to various boards and committees), and considering the timing and circumstances surrounding the plaintiff’s two emails to Ian Kelson, the reasonable inference to be drawn is that the plaintiff’s complaints were effectively his personal grievances against the 2nd Defendant. The plaintiff clearly had an axe to grind against his CEO and his complaints to Ian Kelson were his attempts to make trouble for the 2nd Defendant.

132    In conclusion on the first sub-issue, I would agree with the Joint Defendants’ submissions[^114] and find that the plaintiff was not a genuine whistleblower. Consequently, the provisions of paragraphs 4.19 and 6 of the Personnel Policy do not apply to the plaintiff’s situation.

133    For completeness, I should also add that from the chronology of events, as investigations by UTI into the plaintiff’s conduct had begun in July 2015, months before his alleged whistleblowing emails were sent to Ian Kelson in November 2015, the plaintiff’s assertion that his dismissal was in retaliation to his whistleblowing action is not proven.

### Whether the 1st Defendant was entitled to dismiss the plaintiff for misconduct based on findings of the Inquiry Committee

134    It is the 1st Defendant’s case that it was entitled to dismiss the plaintiff for cause under Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement. It relies on the findings of the Inquiry Committee set out in the Termination Email for the various acts of misconduct on the part of the plaintiff to justify his dismissal.

135    The Termination Email issued to the plaintiff had set out five findings of misconduct against him. The plaintiff disputed each of these findings as baseless, concocted and/or concluded in bad faith. He stated that he had given the Inquiry Committee credible and reasonable explanations for each of the allegations made against him.

136    In an action for wrongful dismissal, the question whether an employee had acted in a manner sufficient to justify summary dismissal is to be determined objectively by the courts. The burden of proof is on the employer to prove the misconduct alleged against the employee.

137    In _Aldabe Fermin v Standard Chartered Bank_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 722</span> at \[58\] (“_Aldabe Fermin_”), the High Court relied on the general approach laid down in _Cowie Edward Bruce v Berger International Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 739</span> for determining whether an employee had misconducted himself to justify summary dismissal, namely that :

>     … In each case, **it is a matter of degree whether the act complained of is of the requisite gravity. It has been said that it must be so serious that it strikes at the root of the contract of employment, that it destroys the confidence underlying such a contract:** _Jackson v Invicta Plastics_ \[1987\] BCLC 329 at 344, _per_ Peter Pain J.

>     The relevancy and effect of any misdeed complained of must, it seems to me, be judged by reference to its effect on the employer-employee relationship. It also seems to me that in judging the relevancy and effect of the acts complained of, account must be taken of the habits and attitude of the employer at the relevant time. They cannot be judged totally in a vacuum.

(emphasis in **bold** mine)

138    As the plaintiff has challenged each of the findings of misconduct stated in the Termination Email, they will need to be examined in turn to determine if they are of requisite gravity to justify the termination of the employer-employee relationship.

#### DBS Deposit Deal

139    The Termination Email stated this finding of misconduct as follows:

> 1.    DBS deposit deal

>     According to the testimony collected from Mr Prateek Sinha and Mr Manish Khandelwal, you were fully engaged with the clients and intimately knew the status of the deal’s progress. Your failure to disclose the crucial mail from SBI is at best Gross Negligence and at worst a deliberate attempt to injure the company. UTI International suffered a financial loss in that transaction as well as reputational damage with both SBI, a significant shareholder as well as DBS, our biggest client. Your claim that you were not aware is proven to be false.

140    The Inquiry Committee had found that the plaintiff was fully aware that DBS had intended to place the USD deposits with SBI but had failed to disclose SBI’s email to Mr Prateek Sinha. The defendants’ version of the events was pleaded[^115] as follows:

> (a)     The plaintiff informed Mr Sinha that SBI Bahrain Bank was offering an interest rate of 2.5% on US Dollar deposits and requested Mr Sinha to enquire with the 1st Defendant’s customers if they were “_interested to participate in the transaction_”.

> (b)     On 7 July and 8 July 2015, Mr Sinha sought the interest of DBS in participating in such a transaction.

> (c)     Mr Sinha informed the plaintiff that DBS had expressed its commitment to such a transaction on 7 July 2015.

> (d)     DBS remitted monies directly to SBI Bahrain Bank on 12 July 2015, which was rejected by SBI as it had withdrawn its offer on or about 9 July 2015 and informed the plaintiff.

> (e)     The plaintiff failed and/or neglected to inform Mr Sinha about the alleged withdrawal of its offer on 9 July 2015.

141    In his closing submissions[^116], the plaintiff highlighted that the defendants’ pleaded version was contradicted by the documentary evidence, as outlined below:

> (a)     In the plaintiff’s email of 6 July 2015, he informed Mr Sinha that a 2.5% rate was offered by SBI for retail deposits, but SBI “_may_” be willing to extend to bulk fixed deposits;

> (b)     From 7 to 9 July 2015, Mr Sinha repeatedly chased DBS for a response but DBS did not respond to these chasers. As such, Mr Sinha could not have informed the plaintiff on 7 July 2015 that DBS had committed to the deal;

> (c)     As at 9 July 2015, the prospectus for the intended deal which would have been structured as UTI Phoenix Fund Class A67 had not been finalised. The approval for the prospectus was given by the 2nd Defendant only on 10 July 2015.

> (d)     Further, DBS could not have remitted monies on 12 July 2015 which fell on a Sunday when Singapore banks are closed. The prospectus for the UTI Phoenix Fund Class A67 required that subscriptions and remittances be received on a “Business Day” which was defined to exclude Saturdays and Sundays.

> (e)     The email from DBS on Monday 13 July 2015 requesting UTI to check with SBI Bahrain on the deposit size and rates as well as other branches showed that there was no remittance as yet.

142    During cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant admitted that DBS could not have committed to the transaction as at 7 July 2015 which was the version given to him by Mr Sinha. The 2nd Defendant was unable to say whether the information supplied by Mr Sinha was correct.

143    As far as the “crucial email” of 9 July 2015 was concerned, the plaintiff’s case is that the email was not shared because it was irrelevant as it referred to a deposit acceptance as of 9 July 2015. Since DBS had not responded by the deadline of 9 July 2015, the email was no longer relevant.

144    In his AEIC, the plaintiff had testified _inter alia_ that:

> (a)     While aggressively pitching SBI Bahrain’s deposit rate to DBS between 7 and 9 July 2015, Prateek Sinha had omitted two crucial facts, namely (1) his quoted deposit rate was for retail deposits and not bulk deposits; and (2) the deposit rate was unconfirmed. This was evidenced by Mr Sinha’s email exchanges with DBS.

> (b)     Prateek Sinha knew that SBI Bahrain’s deposit rate of 2.5% for retail investors was valid until Thursday 9 July 2015 as evidenced by the chaser email he sent to DBS on 8 July 2015.

> (c)     DBS responded with an expression of interest on 13 July 2015. Thereafter, between 13 and 14 July 2015, Prateek Sinha and DBS had exchanged emails to confirm the amount and rate of investment. The transaction was completed in which DBS invested USD15million at a deposit rate amicably agreed between Prateek Sinha and DBS.

> (d)     The deposit transaction had not collapsed, nor did DBS remit any monies on 12 July 2015. At no point did UTI pay compensation to DBS.

> (e)     Prateek Sinha had unilaterally offered to waive UTI’s investment management fees on the UTI Phoenix Fund after realising that his overly aggressive pitch to DBS (by omitting qualifying information about the deposit rate) had backfired and UTI’s competitors might use this to their advantage.

145    It appears from the email “testimony” of Mr Sinha to the Inquiry Committee that he had relied on verbal assurances given by the plaintiff (which were denied by the plaintiff) as to the continued availability of the deposit rate from SBI Bahrain[^117]. The 2nd Defendant had also sought the “testimony” of Mr Manish Khandelwal[^118] on the transaction but it appears that whatever information Mr Khandelwal had on the deal made with DBS was told to him by Mr Sinha.

146    Given that the plaintiff had denied informing Mr Sinha of any commitment by SBI Bahrain as to the rate, and given further that the 2nd Defendant had no personal knowledge of what transpired between the plaintiff and Mr Sinha, I have to agree with the plaintiff that the Inquiry Committee’s finding of misconduct on this charge is not proven. The email “testimony” of Mr Sinha and/or Mr Manish Khandelwal to the Inquiry Committee amounts to hearsay and is inadmissible to prove the sequence of events pleaded in paragraph 22a of the Joint Defendants’ Defence and Counterclaim to found the misconduct alleged against the plaintiff.

147    Further, the emails exhibited at “PJ-10” of the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC do not show that:

> (a)     on or around 7 July 2015, Mr Sinha had informed the plaintiff that DBS had committed to participate in the transaction for the amount of approximately US$22 million (as pleaded at paragraph 22a iii); or

> (b)     DBS had remitted the monies to SBI on 12 July 2015 which was rejected by SBI (as pleaded at paragraph 22a v).

> In fact, as at 9 July 2015, DBS could not have committed to any transaction since Mr Sinha was still trying to get a commitment from the officer concerned by his email worded as follows:

>> Hi Alex

>> Tried calling you but the call is not going through.

>> Any interest in the SBI Bahrain deposit from DBS

>> Regds

>> Prateek

148    Notably, while both Mr Sinha and Mr Khandelwal had been listed as witnesses, the Joint Defendants had elected not to procure their testimonies in the present suit. This meant that the court had no reliable evidence adduced by the defendants to justify the Inquiry Committee’s finding of misconduct on the part of the plaintiff in failing to disclose the “crucial” 9 July 2015 email to Mr Sinha. The second-hand accounts of Mr Sinha and / or Mr Khandelwal exhibited in the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC are not admissible evidence to prove the 1st Defendant’s claim that it had suffered losses as a result of the plaintiff’s omission to disclose the “crucial” 9 July 2015 email.

#### Unauthorised client contact

149    The second finding of misconduct was on the plaintiff’s unauthorised contact with clients. The Termination Email stated as follows:

> 2.    Unauthorized client contact

>     On several occasions you have INITIATED contact with clients and failed to inform the sales team, thereby undermining the sales function and the ability of the Sales Person to manage the relationship. You were given an explicit warning to this effect in Feb’15 which you ignored and continued to exclude the sales team from conversations with clients. In one instance you have excluded the sales person Gaurav, in your responses whenever the Client Anais has added him in the exchange. This is an act of wilful disobedience that has disrupted the smooth functioning of the company. It is indicative of malafide intent.

150    The plaintiff’s response[^119] to this finding was that his job scope included client servicing. This was evidenced from his appraisals from 2013 to 2015 in which he had received commendations from the 4th Defendant, his direct supervisor, for his client engagement[^120]. Further, the plaintiff had never been given an “explicit warning” against contacting clients.

151    The evidence adduced at the trial supported the plaintiff’s defence to the charge of engaging in unauthorised client contact:

> (a)     The documentary evidence[^121] showed that the plaintiff had been reimbursed by the 1st Defendant on multiple occasions on his expenses for client meetings.

> (b)     The 4th Defendant, as the plaintiff’s direct supervisor, had conceded at the trial that that it was unfair to accuse the plaintiff of misconduct on this ground as he had encountered many occasions in which the clients had contacted the plaintiff directly, or the 1st Defendant’s sales team, as well as the 2nd Defendant, had requested the plaintiff to service clients directly. The 4th Defendant had attributed this practice to a dysfunctional setup in an organisation where no proper process was followed[^122].

> (c)     The 4th Defendant’s evidence corroborated the explanation given by the plaintiff to the Inquiry Committee on 15 December 2015 where he also explained that he had kept the Sales team informed of his interactions with clients; see below[^123]:

>> “a.    On several occasions I was requested by the Sales team themselves to talk directly to the clients if they have any questions or queries. On some occasions they also told the clients to directly get in touch with me on the phone or for meetings. …

>> …

>> b.    On certain occasions clients initiated direct communication by email (without marking the sales member)/ phone. As per email etiquette I have replied accordingly and then informed verbally or by email where ever \[_sic_\] so requested by the sales member). This trail can be corroborated from my mailbox…

> (d)     The plaintiff had also explained[^124] to the Inquiry Committee the circumstances of his communication with Andrea Alciati, Anais de Bretizel and Emirates NBD (Singapore) as well as other clients to show that he had no _mala fide_ intent in so far as the sales team, in particular Mr Gaurav Maleri, had been unintentionally excluded from being copied on the email exchanges with the client.

> (e)     The email which the 2nd Defendant had sent to the plaintiff in February 2015 when construed in its proper context could not be taken to be an “explicit warning” to the plaintiff against contact with clients that he had wilfully disobeyed to found the charge of misconduct:

>> (i)       The 2nd Defendant’s email sent to the plaintiff on 5 February 2015 was part of an email chain[^125] in which the 2nd Defendant had sought the plaintiff’s assistance to provide information on the UTI IFIF to one Pierre Degagne of DBS whom Mr Prateek Sinha was servicing.

>> (ii)       The plaintiff had then written to tell Mr Sinha (copying the 2nd Defendant) that he had expected Mr Sinha to have approached him directly and that he would want to be copied on all communication with DBS going forward.

>> (iii)       The 2nd Defendant had replied directly to the plaintiff in his email timestamped 21:59 on 5 February 2015 stating as follows:

>>> “Viral, I had a chat with him this morning. I think you should back off a bit too. If you adopt an aggressive tone in your mails, things will get worse. We don’t want that.

>>> Please use charm and tact as a means of managing people.

>>> Prateek is responsible for all Client Contact. In fact if you have any client contact without his knowledge, that is not acceptable. Just as you would not like anyone interfering with investment activity.

>>> Let us be clear about the roles. It is in our common interest to work together to grow the fund.

>>> Please help me to help us.”

>> (iv)       The plaintiff had replied at 10.10pm to the 2nd Defendant as follows:

>>> Interfering??

>>> Am i interfering with sales function??

>> which received the 2nd Defendant’s abrupt response at 10.11pm stating:

>>> As a Portfolio Manager, you cannot insist that you be copied on all communication with DBS!!!

>> (v)       While the words used in the 2nd Defendant’s emails sent on 5 February 2015 did indicate an expectation of the bifurcation of roles within the organisation, the email exchanges read together objectively, could reasonably be construed as being specific to DBS on that occasion only. It did not constitute an explicit or blanket warning to the plaintiff that all client contact without authorisation from his supervisor / CEO was prohibited. In any case, the plaintiff did continue to engage DBS directly – his expenses for meeting them had been approved and reimbursed without any issue which is an indication that the 1st Defendant had acquiesced in the plaintiff’s conduct.

152    As disclosed by the 4th Defendant, there was no proper process to be followed in the 1st Defendant’s setup. There was nothing in the 1st Defendant’s Personnel Policy or in the Employment Agreement which spelt out any standing instruction of prohibition against contact with clients by those not on the Sales team. While a bifurcation of roles would be expected for organisational efficiency, since the boundaries had not been clearly set out and the plaintiff’s contact with various clients in the course of his employment had effectively been encouraged (through the positive appraisals received from his supervisor) it was unfair, and in my view, wrong, to cite the plaintiff for misconduct on this ground to justify his dismissal.

#### Contact with counterparties

153    The third finding of misconduct was on the plaintiff’s contact with counterparties. The Termination Email stated as follows:

> 3.    Contact with Counterparties

>     You have habitually contacted State Street without involving or intimating the sales team / Operations team or your immediate supervisor, creating a risky working environment besides incurring unnecessary cost. As an example, after the Investment Committee had decided to proceed with Swing Pricing for IFIF, you continued to oppose it and sneakily attempt to leverage T Rowe Price and State Street. This recurring behaviour of sending secret mails is the antithesis of a collaborative atmosphere we are trying to create in the company. This misdemeanour is a serious breach of the employment contract.

154    The plaintiff’s case on this finding is that the Inquiry Committee had not questioned him on his alleged habitual contact with State Street (presumably referring to State Street Fund Services (Ireland) Limited), his alleged recurring behaviour of sending secret emails or sneaky attempt to leverage T Rowe Price and State Street. Further, as fund manager, he was expressly and/or impliedly authorised to contact State Street being the entity appointed by UTI to provide administration and custodian services for the various funds under the plaintiff’s charge. The plaintiff had to seek information about swing pricing from all possible sources, including State Street, in order to understand its impact on the fund’s NAV so as to discharge his duties properly[^126].

155    Similar to the charge of unauthorised client contact, there was no documentary evidence of any standing instruction to UTI’s staff prohibiting contact with counterparties until the 2nd Defendant’s email timestamped 18 November 2015 at 4.00pm with the subject heading “Communication with State Street” in which he wrote:

>     I’m disappointed that I have to send this mail again but guys, please understand that State Street charges us for every mail we send them. We cannot control costs if everyone is having independent conversations.

>     Thus from Immediate Effect, ONLY Manish, Gopi, Shu Hua & Germaine are going to engage in any kind of communication with State Street. Everyone else must speak to one of these four for any matter pertaining to SS. Without Exception.

156    In cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant agreed that there had been no warning to the plaintiff prior to his 18 November 2015 email against contact with State Street[^127]. In fact, it appeared from the text of the 2nd Defendant’s email that everyone in the organisation was having communication with State Street and not just the plaintiff, and the 2nd Defendant was concerned with the cost incurred by such communications. While the 2nd Defendant had referred to role clarity during his cross-examination, no documents were shown to the court as to how the plaintiff had been apprised of this prior to the 18 November 2015 email.

157    Further, from the clarification that I had sought from the 4th Defendant on the purpose of the demarcation of roles between portfolio manager and custodian, the 4th Defendant’s answer, as I understood it, was that the segregation of duties was more administrative in nature, and not meant to prevent a conflict of interest[^128]. I note that in the Joint Defendants’ Reply Submissions[^129], they had sought to show otherwise by referring to the MAS Guidelines on Licensing, Registration and Conduct of Business for Fund Management Companies (“FMC Guidelines”). Given that this document had not been referred to the plaintiff at any time during the trial, it would not be appropriate for the court to consider it in the determination of this issue.

158    The plaintiff says that he had in any event complied with the 2nd Defendant’s instruction and communicated with State Street through the Operations team after 18 November 2015. There is no evidence from the defendants to dispute this.

159    As to the charge that the plaintiff had attempted “sneakily” to leverage T Rowe Price as well as send secret emails which together constituted a misdemeanour and a “serious breach” of contract, these allegations were in fact not specified in the Suspension Letter. Hence, it would appear that the plaintiff had not been given a proper opportunity to explain his position to the Inquiry Committee. In any event, he could not have done so given that the defendants were relying on email correspondence that were disclosed belatedly. The contents of the email exchange exhibited in the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC[^130] only go so far as to show the plaintiff’s further queries on the impact of the implementation of swing pricing on NAV. While the 2nd Defendant was understandably irritated by the plaintiff’s engagement with State Street on this issue, the content of the emails do not lend support to the 2nd Defendant’s conclusion that the plaintiff had committed a grave misdemeanour.

160    In the context of the organisational set-up as admitted by the 4th Defendant, it would be unfair to characterise the plaintiff’s acts as a “serious breach” of his employment contract – there is nothing in the Employment Agreement or in the Personnel Policy which refers to contact or communication with counterparties. No document has been shown to the court by way of standing instructions to the staff on prohibiting contact or communication with custodians, administrators and counterparties until the 2nd Defendant’s email of 18 November 2015.

161    As such, the termination of the plaintiff’s employment on the finding of his contact with counterparties cannot be upheld.

#### Using personal phone

162    The fourth finding of misconduct related to the plaintiff’s use of his personal phone for work purposes. The Termination Email stated as follows:

> 4.    Using personal phone

>     Using personal phone for official dealings exposes the firm to grave danger of losing proprietary data as well as prevents the firm from retaining control of clients. There is sufficient evidence that you breached your contractual obligations to the firm on this count. Despite being told that official phone must be used, you disobeyed and continued to proffer personal phone number for official work. This is a clear example of Insubordination - a gross misconduct.

163    The plaintiff’s case[^131] is that prior to 14 December 2015, he had never been warned or reprimanded regarding the use of his personal mobile phone number for work purposes. His personal mobile number was printed on UTI business cards which were issued to him when he commenced his employment. In any event, the Employment Agreement did not prohibit the plaintiff from using his personal phone for official dealings.

164    Even before 14 December 2015, the 2nd Defendant and his functional head, Mr Amandeep Chopra, would regularly call and/or text him on his personal mobile number for work-related matters. Moreover, UTI AMC regularly connected with him via his personal mobile number for official monthly conference calls. The plaintiff claimed that he was unfairly singled out and penalised even though other employees within the UTI Group such as Mr Sameer Bhatia used his personal mobile for work purposes and was not even provided with a business phone as at December 2015.

165    While the finding of misconduct stated that the plaintiff had continued using his personal phone despite being told that official phone must be used, there was no evidence from the defendants that he had in fact received such a warning. Instead, the 2nd Defendant had referred to his email dated 8 September 2015 sent to Alicia Law in response to Ms Law’s email dated 1 September 2015[^132] to various UTI staff (including the plaintiff, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants) notifying them that their mobile contracts were up for renewal and requesting them to indicate their handphone preferences from the stock list available. The 2nd Defendant had replied copying all the recipients of Ms Law’s email, stating as follows:

>     Alicia, can you please confirm that everyone is using the office issued phone number in the official signature.

>     Thanks

>     PJ

166    While the 2nd Defendant as CEO had expected that the recipients would have understood his email to mean that they should only use the office-issued phone number in their official signatures, it would be unreasonable to construe the email as an express instruction that use of the personal phone number was strictly prohibited, especially when the plaintiff had been allowed to use his personal number for over three years by this time. This administrative lapse within UTI was not just confined to the plaintiff as it appears that Sameer Bhatia was also using his personal phone (an assertion by the plaintiff which was not challenged by the defendants) and was another indication that the organisation did not have proper processes in place, as attested to by the 4th Defendant.

167    It should be noted that Paragraph 4.1 of the Personnel Policy merely states that employees would be provided with mobile phone connections to “improve their efficiency in the discharge of their official duties” but no prohibition is mentioned against using personal phones.

168    Viewed against the rather obscure message in the 2nd Defendant’s email of 8 September 2015 to Ms Alicia Law, to label the plaintiff’s continued use of his personal phone as insubordination was, in my view, also a mischaracterisation. The evidence adduced provided no basis to justify the plaintiff’s use of his personal phone for his work as gross misconduct sufficient to terminate his employment.

#### Dysfunctional behaviour

169    The Termination Email set out the Inquiry Committee’s fifth finding of misconduct against the plaintiff as follows:

> 5.    Dysfunctional behaviour

>     You have on many occasions excluded sales people from crucial mails relating to market data or fund performance. By selectively disseminating information you have vitiated the office atmosphere and created interpersonal conflicts. This misdemeanour is a serious breach of the employment contract.

170    The focus of the complaint against the plaintiff in this charge of misconduct was again on his interactions with the Sales team which, according to the Joint Defendants’ pleaded case, had negatively affected the office atmosphere and created interpersonal conflicts with his colleagues. The complaint appeared to be similar to that of the second charge – unauthorised client contact.

171    In response, the plaintiff had pleaded that the Inquiry Committee had not questioned him on any specific incidents of the “many occasions” when he allegedly excluded the sales team from crucial emails. There was also no mention of this charge specifically in the Suspension Letter.

172    The 2nd Defendant’s AEIC, however, had referred to the complaint by Mr Gaurav Maleri on how the plaintiff had in an email chain with one Ms Anais de Bretizel of the Amade Group, deliberately removed him and it was the client who then put him back on when she realised he had been excluded[^133]. The plaintiff had explained in his reply email to the Inquiry Committee that this was a non-deliberate mistake on his part as it was likely that he had clicked “Reply” instead of “Reply-All” when he responded to Ms Anais de Bretizel’s email.

173    In their Closing Submissions[^134] , the Joint Defendants had set out further examples of how the plaintiff had sent market updates to various clients without copying his colleagues from the Sales team. While uncovering these examples might understandably have caused annoyance to the 2nd Defendant, there was no direct evidence given to the court of what inter-personal conflicts had been created by the plaintiff’s failure to simultaneously copy the updates to the Sales team.

174    It should be noted that even for Gaurav Maleri’s example of being excluded in the email chain with Anais de Bretizel, the statements made in Maleri’s email[^135] are hearsay as he was not called as a witness at the trial. Further, the plaintiff had in his 16 December 2015 email explanation to the Inquiry Committee named Prateek Sinha as the Sales team colleague whom he had updated on various occasions after he had had contact with clients. Mr Sinha was not called as a witness to refute the plaintiff’s evidence. Neither did Mr Sinha in his email “testimony” to the Inquiry Committee (which would have been hearsay in any event) challenge the plaintiff’s account. As such, I am unable to agree with the submission at DCS \[111\] that the Inquiry Committee had good grounds to conclude that the plaintiff had _“vitiated the office atmosphere and created interpersonal conflicts_”.

175    The Joint Defendants had also submitted that while such conduct did not fall neatly within any of the categories of misconduct set out at Paragraph 4.17 of the Personnel Policy, the plaintiff’s actions were against the interests of UTI and should therefore constitute misconduct. I am unable to accept this submission. If UTI, as an organisation, did not have written guidelines in place and had all along allowed the portfolio managers like the plaintiff to liaise directly with clients, it was unreasonable to penalise the plaintiff’s behaviour and characterise it as a “serious breach” of the employment contract when their rules were unwritten and unclear. From the 4th Defendant’s testimony set out below[^136], he clearly did not view the plaintiff’s behaviour as such and had conceded that it was unfair to accuse the plaintiff of misconduct:

> A:    As I mentioned earlier, many times the clients went directly to Viral. Many a time, Praveen Jagwani went directly to Viral. Many a time, the sales team went directly to Viral and if you listen to the recording tendered by Shobha, I told very clearly that the fact Viral had been dysfunctional, the organisation played a part in there as well. So, it was a dysfunctional chain of command. It was a dysfunctional setup where there was no proper process followed. In a proper---**in a proper organisation, the people interfacing with the client should be the sales team. And the portfolio manager should only come in when requested by sales team for more difficult queries. Over in this place, it was all over the place which was wrong**… .

>     …

>     I repeat myself again, I did and if you listen to the recording tendered by Shobha, I had told Praveen Jagwani that he was like that because of the---the way the organisation was set up. So, that recording conveyed that I had reservations about this issue because the organisation was to blame as well.

> Q    So, in your view, **this charge should not have been a ground for misconduct, correct**?

> A    Um, in my view, **both parties have had a fault to play**.

> Q    Yes. But if the company and sales team have implicitly authorised this, you will agree with me that you can’t hold Mr. Bhuta responsible for this, correct?

> A    Not completely responsible, yes, you’re right.

> Q    And to go further **to call this gross misconduct to terminate employment, solely on this ground would you agree with me that will be unfair**?

> A     **On this ground, yes. Solely on this ground**.

(emphasis in **bold** mine)

176    In the light of the 4th Defendant’s evidence, and considering the account given by the plaintiff, the fifth finding of dysfunctional behaviour as misconduct justifying a dismissal from his employment simply cannot stand.

#### Conclusion on the findings of misconduct

177    From my analysis above, the findings of misconduct on the five captioned matters by the Inquiry Committee set out in the Termination Email have not been established. While there were other concerns on the plaintiff’s conduct stated in the Suspension Letter (_viz._ failure to conduct training sessions, disclosure of confidential information), these charges were dropped as stated in the Termination Email and need not be considered. Accordingly, I find that the 1st Defendant was not entitled to dismiss the plaintiff for cause under Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement based on the findings of the Inquiry Committee. As such, if the 1st Defendant’s termination of the plaintiff’s employment on 22 December 2015 was effected under Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement for violating the terms of his employment, it was wrongful.

### Whether the 1st Defendant was entitled to dismiss the plaintiff with one month’s notice under Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement

#### Whether Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement is illegal, null and void

178    In the Termination Email, the 2nd Defendant had set out the Inquiry Committee’s findings of misconduct against the plaintiff at the end of which he stated:

>     Taken collectively, a pattern of dysfunctional behaviour has emerged from all of the above. It suggests that you have wilfully attempted to harm the company, its processes, its reputation and/or specific individuals.

>      **Therefore, on behalf of the Inquiry Committee I writing** _(sic.)_ **to inform you that your employment with UTI International Singapore Pte Ltd is terminated with immediate effect. As per your employment contract, you will be given salary in lieu of the one month’s notice.**

(emphasis in bold in original)

179    In their defence and counterclaim, the Joint Defendants had pleaded[^137] that the plaintiff’s employment was terminated in accordance with Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement on the following terms:

> (a)     he was given one month’s notice of his termination; and

> (b)     he was allowed encashment of his leave entitlement.

180    For convenience, Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement states:

>     “The Company reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time without assigning any specific reason by giving one month’s notice upon confirmation and without any notice during the probation period.”

181    The plaintiff had pleaded[^138] that Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement is illegal, null and void under s 8 read with s 10(2) of the Employment Act (Cap. 91 Rev. Ed. 2009) (“the Act”) which are reproduced below for easy reference:

>      **Illegal terms of contract of service**

> **8**.    Every term of a contract of service which provides a condition of service which is less favourable to an employee than any of the conditions of service prescribed by this Act shall be illegal, null and void to the extent that it is so less favourable.

>      **.**.

>      **Notice of termination of contract**

>      **10.**– (1) Either party to a contract of service may at any time give to the other party notice of his intention to terminate the contract of service.

> (2)    The length of such notice shall be the same for both employer and employee and shall be determined by any provision made for the notice in the terms of the contract of service, or in the absence of such provision, shall be in accordance with subsection (3).

182    Clause 16 of the Employment Agreement provides for a different notice period in the event the plaintiff had intended to resign, see below:

>     In the event of your intended resignation or discontinuation from the employment of Company, you will give a clear three months written notice upon your confirmation of appointment and one month written notice during the probation period, to the CEO of the Company indicating your intention.

183    The plaintiff contends that as the notice periods in Clause 12 and Clause 16 of the Employment Agreement are not the same, Clause 12 being a condition of service less favourable to him, it would be rendered illegal, null and void pursuant to s 8 of the Act if he were to come within the definition of “employee” in the Act. In the version of the Act before 1 April 2019, the definition of “employee” excluded any person employed in a managerial or an executive position.

184    The plaintiff relied on the High Court’s ruling in _Hasan Shofiqul v China Civil (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 511</span> (“_Hasan Shofiqul”_) that just because an employee is designated or has the job title of a “supervisor”, this does not mean he is an “executive” for the purposes of the Act. He contended that although he held the title of ‘Portfolio Manager-Fixed Income’, he was nonetheless an “employee” within the Act and entitled to its protection on the following grounds:

> (a)     Clause 4 of his Employment Agreement reflected that his starting work scope was akin to an analyst and was not managerial or executive in nature. His duties as set out therein were stated thus:

>> “Analysing Indian corporate and Government debt. Part of the job scope involves assisting the marketing team with client meetings and such other scope of work as may be assigned by the immediate supervisor.”

> (b)     Although he received tertiary education and a starting salary of $5,400 per month, these factors are not conclusive _per se_. He was not part of the 1st Defendant’s management. He was also not involved in decisions regarding recruitment, discipline or appraisals, nor did he have any subordinates working under him (as seen from UTI’s organisational structure in exhibit “P1”).

185    The question of whether an employee was employed in an executive or managerial position has to be determined by looking at all the circumstances of the case (see _Hasan Shofiqul_ at \[64\]).

186    By way of illustration, the employee in _Hasan Shofiqul_ was not found to be employed in an ‘executive’ position due to the following (see _Hasan Shofiqul_ at \[69\]):

> (a)     While he was a site supervisor, he did not possess any specialised skills or training and did not have a diploma.

> (b)     The tasks he performed (involving “hands-on” supervision in person of his team of workers) did not go beyond regular on-site administration work and did not require any specialised expertise or training beyond the normal and routine.

> (c)     His appointment as a site supervisor was to help with work co-ordination between workers and management.

187    Similarly, in _Brightway Petrochemical Group Singapore Pte Ltd v Ang Lily_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 729</span>, the High Court found that the employee was not employed in an ‘executive’ position because:

> (a)     she had been working under the direct supervision of the finance manager, which was indicative that she played merely a ‘_supportive role_’;

> (b)     her duties were predominantly administrative in nature; and

> (c)     she was a diploma holder, which ‘_fortified’_ the Court’s view that she was not in a managerial, executive or confidential position.

188    I agree with the Joint Defendants’ submission that the plaintiff here cannot be regarded as an “employee” within the meaning of the Act (pre-1 April 2019). While the title of “Portfolio Manager-Fixed Income” by itself would not necessarily mean that he was employed in a managerial or executive capacity, the evidence pointed clearly to the plaintiff executing the duties and responsibilities of someone in a managerial or executive position:

> (a)     The plaintiff was the sole manager of all fixed income products managed by UTI and entrusted with managing all of its fixed income-related investment activities. He was solely responsible for deciding the investment strategies of the funds under his control, and deciding which trades to make in respect of all of UTI’s fixed income products on a daily basis. At the peak of his employment, he was responsible for managing approximately USD 1.3 billion worth of fixed income products on behalf of UTI.

> (b)     He had the following tertiary qualifications:

>> (i)       MBA (Finance) from Northeastern University, Boston USA (2006); and

>> (ii)       Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical Engineering) from University of Bombay (2000).

> (c)     He was registered as a representative under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289).

> (d)     His starting salary with UTI was S$5,400, and he commanded a monthly salary of S$10,545 by the end of his employment.

> (e)     He was also appointed to UTI’s Investment Committee and had an executive role in making investment decisions for all fixed income products of UTI.

189    During cross-examination, the plaintiff had admitted that he had been engaged by the 1st Defendant as a professional. In his role as portfolio manager, he was required to exercise his own professional judgment as to what should be done without reference to any superior or anybody else. He had also admitted that he was a member of UTI’s investment committee and had participated in its board meetings[^139].

190    The plaintiff’s contention that he was an “employee”, entitled to the protection of s 8 of the Act to render Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement “illegal, null and void” was simply unsustainable.

#### Whether 1st Defendant entitled to rely on Clause 12 while citing misconduct as the ground for termination with immediate effect

191    The plaintiff submitted[^140] that the defendants had adopted inconsistent positions regarding his termination, as evident from the following:

> (a)     The Termination Email stated that the plaintiff was terminated with immediate effect (for misconduct) but he would be given salary in lieu of one months’ notice.

> (b)     The misconduct report attachment filed with MAS on 28 December 2015 stated that the plaintiff was terminated with immediate effect in light of his misconduct[^141].

> (c)     Subsequently, on 4 February 2016, the plaintiff was notified that his last day of employment was 23 January 2016 pursuant to a ‘relieving letter’ signed by the 2nd Defendant[^142]. The enclosure to this ‘relieving letter’ stated that the calculation of the plaintiff’s dues set out therein was the final amount due upon “resignation”[^143].

192    The plaintiff further suggested that there were also clear indications of an internal cover-up of his dismissal which resulted in the “relieving” letter stating that he had resigned and a different last day on 23 January 2016, as well as the positive reference given by Ms Alicia Law to RAMS.

193    The plaintiff argued that it would constitute wrongful dismissal for the defendants to rely on Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement – “_The Company reserves the right to terminate your employment_ **_at any time without assigning any specific reason_** _…_” (emphasis in bold mine) – as it is a no-fault contractual termination clause with notice.

194    In response to my question as to whether the 1st Defendant was entitled to rely on the no-fault termination provision in Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement while at the same time citing misconduct as the ground for termination with immediate effect, the plaintiff submitted that the 1st Defendant was not so entitled[^144]. This was because the 1st Defendant had taken out disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff and relied on its ‘misconduct findings’ as the ground for dismissing him “_with immediate effect_”.

195    The plaintiff contended that while a terminating party can subsequently rely on a different ground that would have entitled it to exercise termination, this is “_subject to the qualification that \[the\] party may by its conduct preclude itself from setting up another ground at a later date_” (see _Aldabe Fermin_ at \[48\]). The ruling applied in _Aldabe Fermin_ was applicable here for the following reasons:

> (a)     The plaintiff was not dismissed under Clause 12 since this has to be on a ‘no-fault’ basis.

> (b)     He was dismissed for cause (_i.e._ misconduct) after the 1st Defendant elected to take disciplinary action under the Personnel Policy. This in turn obliges the 1st Defendant to adhere to the contractual processes in the Personnel Policy, namely Paragraphs 4.17, 4.18, 4.19 and 6 which lay out the Employee Grievance Procedure, Whistleblower Protection and Ethical Concerns as well as in the MAS Notice SFA04-N11 (Reporting of Misconduct of Representatives by Holders of Capital Markets Services Licence and Exempt Financial Institutions).

> (c)     All the defendants’ witnesses had agreed that these contractual processes were applicable to the plaintiff as a licensed financial representative.

> (d)     Having elected to adopt a disciplinary process to determine misconduct, the 1st Defendant was bound to the contractual processes in the Personnel Policy (including the contractual right of appeal) before it could subsequently consider Clause 12 for a no-fault dismissal.

> (e)     In any event, the 1st Defendant cannot take a second bite of the cherry by setting up another ground of termination under Clause 12, having already elected to unfairly terminate the plaintiff on the ground of ‘misconduct’ (in a manner which is incompatible with both Clauses 12 and 15 of the Employment Agreement), which is in breach of the Personnel Policy and also MAS Notice No. SFA04-N11.)

196    Accordingly, the 1st Defendant was not entitled to rely on the non-fault termination provision in Clause 12 while at the same time citing misconduct as the ground for termination with immediate effect.

197    The Joint Defendants submitted[^145] that as the plaintiff had been informed that his employment would be terminated with immediate effect, with payment of salary in lieu of one month’s notice, it was apparent that the 1st Defendant intended to terminate the plaintiff’s employment pursuant to Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement. While the Termination Email to the plaintiff had given reasons for the termination, this does not detract from the 1st Defendant’s right to terminate the plaintiff’s employment in accordance with the terms of the contract.

198    It was further submitted that in so far as the plaintiff was challenging the reasons for his termination, the 1st Defendant had good reasons to terminate the plaintiff’s employment for misconduct, and in this regard, it relies also on Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement.

199    As for the plaintiff’s reliance on Paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18 of the Personnel Policy for his right to appeal UTI’s decision to terminate his employment, the Joint Defendants argued[^146] that following the termination of his employment on 22 December 2015, the plaintiff ceased to be an employee of UTI. From the express language of Paragraph 4.17, only an “_employee/licensed representative_” is entitled to appeal against disciplinary action taken against him while Paragraph 4.18 provides that the employee grievance procedure is only available to an employee “_at any time during the time of his/her employment with the Company_”.

200    Once the employment contract is terminated, the ex-employee cannot rely on its terms including those such as the Personnel Policy which are incorporated into the employment contract by reference. The company cannot be expected to keep someone on after serious misconduct just so the grievance procedure can take its course. As such, the grievance procedure cannot apply when an employee is terminated.

201    It was further submitted that an interpretation limiting the application of Paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18 to employees ought to be preferred as this would be consistent with the express terms at Clause 12 and Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement allowing UTI to terminate the plaintiff’s employment either by giving him one month’s notice, or for misconduct. According to the Joint Defendants, adopting the plaintiff’s interpretation of Paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18 of the workings of the Personnel Policy would be uncommercial and against business sense.

#### Decision

202    While the Termination Email had stated that the plaintiff’s employment was “_terminated with immediate effect_”, and that he would be “_given salary in lieu of the one month’s notice_”, the plaintiff was not in fact paid any salary until 4 February 2016. The letter dated 4 February 2016 captioned as a “Relieving Letter” informed the plaintiff that he was “_relieved from the services of the Company from close of office hours on 23rd January 2016_”. The working sheet attached to the Relieving Letter stated that the plaintiff’s “Last working day” was 23rd January 2016 and set out the final amount due to the plaintiff “upon resignation”. The plaintiff had acknowledged and accepted the payment.

203    Hence, although the Termination Email (and also the report given to MAS) had stated that the plaintiff’s services were to be “terminated with immediate effect”, the 1st Defendant had treated the plaintiff’s employment as having subsisted up to 23 January 2016 being his _last working day_.

204    In any event, I have to point out that the Joint Defendants’ pleaded case precludes them from taking the position that the plaintiff was no longer employed from 22 December 2015. Paragraph 9 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 3) states:

>     The Plaintiff was employed by the 1st Defendant as a Portfolio Manager – Fixed Income. He commenced work on 2 April 2012. Following the termination of his employment on 22 December 2015, **his last day of service was 23 January 2016**.

(emphasis in **bold** mine)

As parties are bound by their pleadings, I would have to reject the Joint Defendants’ submission that the plaintiff was to be considered an ex-employee from 22 December 2015.

205    While the 1st Defendant could have resorted to the no-fault termination provision pursuant to Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement, this was not what transpired. The Termination Email expressly stated that the plaintiff’s employment was terminated for misconduct. The further emails from the 2nd Defendant rejecting the plaintiff’s requests for a review had reiterated the misconduct findings. The 1st Defendant’s report to MAS had categorically stated that a disciplinary inquiry was convened and the plaintiff’s services terminated for misconduct.

206    Having elected to terminate his employment for misconduct, I find that the 1st Defendant was, by its conduct, precluded from relying on the no-fault termination provision in Clause 12. Having initiated a disciplinary inquiry process, the 1st Defendant was bound by its Personnel Policy to follow through with the process to its conclusion. This included giving the employee the right of appeal set out in Paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18.

207    Further, contrary to the Joint Defendants’ submission, as the plaintiff’s employment relationship continued in existence until his last working day on 23 January 2016, and Paragraph 4.18 of the Personnel Policy provides that the employee grievance procedure is available to an employee “_at any time during the time of his/her employment with the Company_”, there was no basis to deny him the right of appeal to the next stage of the grievance process.

208    From the evidence[^147] of the 3rd Defendant (who had drafted the Personnel Policy), it was clear that the plaintiff had a right of appeal under the Employee Grievance Procedure in Paragraph 4.18 of the Personnel Policy which right had been denied. The 2nd Defendant’s evidence on this aspect was equivocal – he appeared more concerned with the fact that there was nobody else in UTI that the appeal could have gone to[^148]. The 4th Defendant, who was candid in his testimony, had readily admitted that the plaintiff ought to have been accorded the right of appeal, although he had also noted that the plaintiff was certainly capable of having appealed all the way to the top of the UTI hierarchy[^149].

209    Notwithstanding that the plaintiff could have resorted to self-help as observed by the 4th Defendant, based on the evidence, I have to find that the plaintiff’s appeal requests were denied, and such denials amounted to a breach by the 1st Defendant of Paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18 of its Personnel Policy. While the plaintiff has also submitted that the 1st Defendant had breached MAS Notice SFA04-N11, as this point was not pleaded, I make no finding on it.

### Whether the manner of the plaintiff’s dismissal was in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence

210    The plaintiff had pleaded that the Inquiry Committee’s decision to terminate the plaintiff’s employment and/or reject the plaintiff’s request for an appeal was a breach of the implied terms of the Employment Agreement[^150]. The implied terms were particularised as follows[^151]:

> (a)     an implied duty of mutual trust and confidence between UTI and the plaintiff;

> (b)     an implied term that the employer would not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between the employer and employee;

> (c)     an implied term that UTI will treat the Plaintiff fairly in the manner of dismissal; and

> (d)     an implied term that UTI will not exercise the contractual right to terminate the Employment Agreement in bad faith.

211    As held by the High Court in _Cheah Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 577</span> (“_Luzhou_”), unless there are express terms to the contrary or the context implies otherwise, an implied term of mutual trust and confidence is implied by law into a contract of employment under Singapore law. While the Joint Defendants had not admitted to such a term and simply put the plaintiff to strict proof, there was nothing in the Employment Agreement or in the 1st Defendant’s Personnel Policy that would exclude the application of this implied term in the plaintiff’s contract. From the manner in which the plaintiff had particularised the implied term, it seemed that they were no more than different facets of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence, which work hand-in-hand with the grievance process set out in Paragraph 4.18 of the Personnel Policy.

212    The denial of an appeal from the Inquiry Committee’s findings of misconduct resulting in the dismissal of the plaintiff was as much a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence as it was a breach of Paragraph 4.18 of the Personnel Policy (see _Luzhou_ at \[56\] – duty to provide a grievance procedure).

213    The plaintiff had also submitted that the implied term of mutual trust and confidence was breached when the 1st Defendant and/or 2nd Defendant informed the UTI IFIF Board and the plaintiff’s colleagues that the plaintiff was leaving his employment even before he was given the opportunity to rectify any problems or clarify any misunderstandings (_Luzhou_ at \[102\]). I did not think this applied to the disciplinary inquiry in the plaintiff’s case – he did have the opportunity to respond to the allegations made in the Suspension Letter and at the Final Hearing before the Inquiry Committee although his reasons were not accepted.

### Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration and/or damages

#### Declaration

214    The main relief sought by the plaintiff is for a declaration that he had been wrongfully dismissed[^152]. The plaintiff submits that damages are not an adequate remedy because the plaintiff is regulated by MAS as a licensed financial representative. To obtain his licence with MAS, the plaintiff is required to fill in a declaration form pursuant to the MAS’s Guidelines on ‘Fit & Proper Criteria’. This includes having to answer the following “yes / no” questions:

>      **“(A) Honesty, Integrity and Reputation**

>     …

> (n)    Have you been dismissed or asked to resign from office, employment, a position of trust, or a fiduciary appointment or similar position, whether in Singapore or elsewhere”

> (o)    Have you been subject to disciplinary proceedings by your current or former employer(s) whether in Singapore or elsewhere?”

215    MAS relies on and presumes the truthfulness of the reports (which must be declared to be true by the employer) filed by employers, in order to regulate licensed financial representatives. The main thrust of the 1st Defendant’s misconduct report made to MAS had charged the plaintiff as failing to meet the ‘fit and proper criteria’, which include competency, financial soundness and integrity, as set out in MAS’s Fit and Proper Guidelines. There are also similar ‘fit and proper’ requirements in other jurisdictions such as ‘The Fit and Proper test for Approved Persons) imposed by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as confirmed by the 2nd Defendant at trial.

216    Under the MAS regime, there is, however, no expungement process for wrongfully maligned representatives. There is also no process for licensed representatives to make representations to MAS to remove false or inaccurate misconduct reports filed by vindictive employers.

217    In the circumstances, the plaintiff submitted that declaratory relief is the appropriate remedy to address the controversy, unlike the situation in _Wee Kim San Lawrence Bernard v Robinson & Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 357</span> (“_Wee Kim San”)_ where the employee in question was not subject to any regulatory standards.

218    The plaintiff had also relied on _Vine v National Dock Labour Board_ <span class="citation">\[1957\] 2 WLR 106</span> (“_Vine_”) where the House of Lords had (reversing the Court of Appeal) affirmed the declaration given to an employee who was subject to regulatory standards so that he could continue under the relevant employment scheme of the National Dock Labour Board, as it was not “_the ordinary case of master and servant \[where\] the repudiation or wrongful dismissal puts an end to the contract, and the contract having been wrongfully put to an end to a claim for damages arises_”.

219    In _Vine_, the appellant there was akin to an employee of a statutory board. It was found that the board had acted _ultra vires_ when it wrongfully delegated its power to a disciplinary committee whose dismissal of the appellant had resulted in the removal of his name from the register of dock workers which conferred on him certain rights and benefits under statute. The declaration that the dismissal was null and void was affirmed as it was not an ordinary contract of employment.

220    While the facts in _Vine_ are vastly different from the plaintiff’s situation, I would agree that the plaintiff here is entitled to a declaration that he had been wrongfully dismissed on grounds of misconduct. Even though the misconduct report did not relate to his investment management activities nor connote any illegal or immoral wrongdoing on the part of the plaintiff, the 1st Defendant’s report to MAS fell within the category of misconduct amounting to a failure to satisfy the “fit and proper” guidelines for a licensed representative.

221    The misconduct report filed by the 1st Defendant with MAS has had some negative impact on the plaintiff’s status as a licensed representative. Although he had successfully secured employment with RAMS shortly after he left the 1st Defendant, he had been required to make frequent declarations to his new employer and was subject to periodic checks based on the misconduct report.

222    To the extent that the misconduct report would adversely affect the plaintiff’s status as a licensed representative under the “fit and proper’ guidelines of MAS, an award in money alone would not be adequate compensation. The plaintiff’s case satisfies the legal requirements for declaratory relief (see _Singapore Shooting Association and others v Singapore Rifle Association_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 83</span> at \[121\]) in that:

> (a)     he has a real interest in bringing the action for the declaration;

> (b)     there is a real controversy between the parties to the action for the court to resolve, namely whether he was wrongfully dismissed on the allegations of misconduct made against him; and

> (c)     the declaration sought relates to a right which is personal to him and enforceable against the adverse party to the litigation.

223    Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that he was wrongfully dismissed for misconduct based on the findings set out in the Termination Email.

#### Damages

224    The Court of Appeal in _Wee Kim San_ at \[25\] reiterated that the normal measure of damages in cases of wrongful dismissal is the amount which the employee would have received under the employment contract had the employer lawfully terminated the contract by giving the required notice or paying salary in lieu of notice, subject to mitigation. This rule flows from the established principle that the breach having occurred, damages are to be assessed on the basis of the employer’s least onerous or minimum obligation. While the minimum legal obligation rule would ordinarily apply to limit the employee’s quantum of damages to the minimum notice period under which the employer could properly dismiss him, in cases where the employer has in fact elected to terminate the employment by a route which was not the least disadvantageous to himself, the quantum of damages may not necessarily be constrained by the minimum legal obligation rule but may instead be based on the consequences of his election (see _Aldabe Fermin_ at \[89\]).

225    The plaintiff has submitted[^153] that in the present case, the minimum legal obligation rule would need to take into consideration the likely period needed for the appeal process under Paragraph 4.18 of the Employee Grievance Procedure to run its entire course. Relying on evidence given by the 3rd Defendant at the trial – the plaintiff’s appeal against the disciplinary action to terminate his employment would automatically activate Stage Two of the Employee Grievance Procedure in paragraph 4.18 of the Personnel Policy – the plaintiff submitted that assuming the appeal process was properly adhered to, it would take at least or around 50 working days (equivalent to 2.5 months) to finally dispose of the appeals.

226    Consequently, since the 1st Defendant could only legally terminate the plaintiff’s employment without any reasons assigned after the conclusion of the appeal, the plaintiff would be entitled to a further period of at least one month’s notice. In the circumstances, it would be reasonable to infer that the plaintiff’s termination of employment pursuant to a lawful termination would likely take place around 3.5 months from 22 December 2015, at the earliest. In any event, since the plaintiff had commenced his new employment with RAMS on 1 March 2016, it is not necessary to calculate his hypothetical last day of work pursuant to a lawful termination for the purposes of computing damages.

227    Accordingly, the plaintiff worked out his entitlement to damages for wrongful dismissal for the period from 22 December 2015 to 29 February 2016 as follows:

#### My assessment

228    I cannot agree with the plaintiff’s computation of damages. While the plaintiff was entitled under the grievance procedure to an appeal, as pointed out by the 4th Defendant, since the appeal is against the decision taken by a committee which comprised the CEO, it would realistically have to go one more level up in the organisational hierarchy, namely to Mr Leo Puri and Mr Imtaiyazur Rahman, or to the independent directors. Essentially, this meant the appeal would go direct to Stage 3 in which the meeting had to be arranged within 10 working days of receipt of the appeal. As the plaintiff had appealed on 23 December 2015, by my reckoning the final meeting would have been held no later than 11 January 2016.

229    Applying the minimum legal obligation rule, the 1st Defendant’s exercise of the no-fault termination clause by giving one month’s notice could well have taken effect from 11 January 2016 with the last day of his employment extended up to 10 February 2016. It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant had paid the plaintiff salary up to 23 January 2016 plus another month’s salary as the “13th month” bonus. Based on the 1st Defendant’s minimum legal obligation, however, this bonus would not have been payable. The additional month’s payment (by way of the discretionary 13th month bonus) would, in my assessment, have exceeded the salary covering the extended period of notice up to 10 February 2016 to allow the appeal process to run its course.

230    As such, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to any further payment as damages.

## Issue 2: Whether the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants are liable to the plaintiff for defamation in respect of the Words and the Additional Words

231    The plaintiff’s defamation claim is based on two emails sent by the 3rd Defendant and the 2nd Defendant respectively to Ms Nasrulla of RAMS, the circumstances of which have been outlined at \[60\] to \[63\].

### Whether the Words and Additional Words in their natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory of the plaintiff

232    The three conditions necessary for a defamation action, are namely that:

> (a)     the statement made by a defendant must bear a defamatory meaning;

> (b)     the statement must refer to the claimant; and

> (c)     the statement must have been published to a third party.

It is undisputed that the two emails referring to the plaintiff were sent to Ms Nasrulla, thus fulfilling two of the three conditions.

233    As to what would qualify as a defamatory statement, the High Court in _Golden Season Pte Ltd v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd_ \[2015\] 2 SLR 741 (“_Golden Season_”), had endorsed at \[36\] the succinct summary in Gary Chan Kok Yew & Lee Pay Woan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2011) at para 12.014: A statement is considered to be defamatory if it:

> (a)     lowers the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally;

> (b)     causes the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or

> (c)     exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

234    The defendants have denied that the Words and Additional Words convey the meanings as pleaded by the plaintiff. Instead, they say[^154] that read in the context of the emails dated 12 May 2016 and 22 June 2016, the meanings of the Words and Additional Words are as set out below:

> _The email of 12 May 2016 – the Words_

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.94%"> <col width="50.06%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Contents of Email</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Meaning</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>We would like to inform you that Mr Viral Bhutta’s [sic] employment with our company was terminated on grounds of misconduct.</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The plaintiff’s employment with UTI was terminated on the grounds of misconduct.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>There was disciplinary action taken against him for unauthorized client conduct, non-adherence of internal code of conduct and dysfunctional behavior.</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">UTI had concluded that the plaintiff was guilty of said misconduct after conducting the necessary investigations into his conduct.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>A misconduct report has been filed with the regulator, Monetary Authority of Singapore with regard to the fit and proper criteria not been met.</em></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The MAS had been duly informed of UTI’s findings of the plaintiff’s misconduct</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> _The email of 22 June 2016 – the Additional Words_

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.98%"> <col width="50.02%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Contents of Email</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Meaning</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>One of the elements in the investigation against Mr Viral Bhuta, during the term of his employment with UTI, was an alleged leakage of sensitive and confidential information to Reliance Asset Management.</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Allegations of data theft were made against the plaintiff</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Since the case of misconduct against Viral was strong, we did not pursue scrutinize the data theft.</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">UTI did not investigate the allegations of data theft against the plaintiff</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>However now that he has joined Reliance, we have been advised to reopen the investigation.</em></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">UTI had been advised to reopen the investigations into allegations of data theft against the plaintiff.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

235    To my mind, an objective reading of the 12 May 2016 email would have the following meaning:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s employment with UTI was terminated on the grounds of misconduct;

> (b)     The misconduct found was for unauthorised client conduct, failure to adhere to UTI’s internal code of conduct and dysfunctional behaviour; and

> (c)     A report of the misconduct which pertains to the fit and proper criteria was made to MAS.

As for the second email of 22 June 2016, I thought the natural and ordinary meaning should be:

> (d)     The plaintiff was alleged to have leaked UTI’s confidential information to RAMS.

> (e)     UTI did not pursue the allegation of data theft as it had a strong case of misconduct against the plaintiff, but has since been advised to reopen the investigation.

236    It cannot be seriously argued that the meanings as set out above, or even the lesser meanings pleaded by the defendants, are not defamatory in nature. The Words and Additional Words are defamatory as any allegation of bad behaviour or any form of misconduct would undoubtedly carry a negative connotation in the mind of a prospective employer when considering the suitability of the potential hire in question.

### Whether the Words and Additional Words were true in substance and fact, so as to avail the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants to the defence of justification

237    While the Words and Additional Words are defamatory, at the time that they were published to RAMS, they were true in substance and fact. The defendants had indeed conducted an investigation into the allegations of misconduct against the plaintiff as early as July 2015. The Inquiry Committee had found the plaintiff guilty of misconduct and terminated his employment. A report was made to MAS in accordance with MAS’s requirements. The 1st Defendant was subsequently advised on reopening the investigation on the alleged leak of confidential information to RAMS in light of the fact that the plaintiff had joined RAMS.

238    As justification provides a complete defence to the claim in defamation, the plaintiff’s claim against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants for the publication of on the Words and the Additional Words fails.

### Whether the Words and Additional Words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege, and if so, whether the plaintiff has proven malice

239    The plaintiff accepts that the Words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege as the 3rd Defendant had sent the email in the context of an employer reference. As for the Additional Words, the plaintiff submits that no privilege is attached as the email sent by the 2nd Defendant two months after the reference check by RAMS was unsolicited. In both instances, the plaintiff has alleged that the publications were made maliciously[^155].

240    The particulars of malice alleged consisted essentially the manner of the publications themselves which were said to be in furtherance of the decision to terminate the plaintiff’s employment. It was also alleged that there was no basis for UTI to reopen its alleged case of data theft against the plaintiff given that he had not been questioned about it at the disciplinary inquiry. Moreover, it was the plaintiff who had alerted UTI and the 2nd Defendant that UTI’s competitor appeared to be receiving confidential information. In the circumstances, the publication of the Words and Additional Words were intended to prevent and/or impose restrictions on the plaintiff from working as a licensed representative in Singapore and depriving him of his livelihood.

241    I find that the defence of qualified privilege would extend to both the Words and the Additional Words. The Additional Words were published only to Ms Nasrulla, who as the Head of Compliance of RAMS, was entitled to receive the further reference information on the plaintiff from UTI. Further, the defendants did share a common interest with RAMS in communicating the Additional Words, which served to inform RAMS that they had been advised to reopen investigations into allegations of data theft against the plaintiff.

242    In _Gao Shuchao v Tan Kok Quan & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 115</span> (“_Gao Shuchao_”), at \[37\] and \[38\], the High Court gave a succinct summary of the applicable principles on malice as follows:

> 37    … Malice can be found in two instances: (a) where it can be shown that the defendant had knowledge of falsity or was reckless as to the truth of the defamatory statement; or (b) where although the defendant may have a genuine or honest belief in the truth of the defamatory statement, he had the dominant intention of injuring the plaintiff or some other improper motive (_Lim Eng Hock Peter_ at \[38\]; _Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 751</span> at \[92\]).

> 38    The inquiry as to the statement-maker’s state of mind under instance (a) is a subjective rather than an objective exercise and the threshold to be met is high (_Ezion Holdings Ltd v Credit Suisse AG_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 137</span> (“_Ezion_”) at \[25\]). The high threshold has been explained by Lord Diplock in _Horrocks v Lowe_ <span class="citation">\[1975\] AC 135</span> at 150 (“_Horrocks v Lowe_”), as approved in _Maidstone Pte Ltd v Takenaka Corp_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 752</span> (“_Maidstone_”) at \[48\]:

>> … In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognise the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be ‘honest’, that is, a positive belief that the conclusions that they have reached are true. The law demands no more.

Further, at \[39\], \[40\] and \[43\] of _Gao Shuchao_, the High Court explained that:

> (a)     There is no malice where the defendant is merely careless, impulsive or irrational in believing the statement to be true. It has to be proven that the defendant knew that the defamatory statement was false or was “reckless to the point of wilful blindness” for malice to be found.

> (b)     The high threshold for finding malice is in line with the rationale underpinning the privilege, _ie_, that the defendant has a moral, social or legal duty to disclose the information and the recipient has an interest in receiving it. A defendant should not be penalised for making an honest mistake, where he published statements that he genuinely believed to be true.

> (c)     Evidence of a defendant’s conduct and action prior to the publication of a defamatory statement, at the time of the publication and after the publication including the entire surrounding circumstances, must be viewed in totality in determining whether there was malice.

243    It is trite that the burden is on a plaintiff to prove malice in order to defeat the defence of qualified privilege. I find that the plaintiff has not discharged this burden:

> (a)     In so far as the Words are concerned, the email had been sent to RAMS only when the UTI was notified by MAS to provide an accurate reference pertaining to the plaintiff’ termination of employment. There was nothing factually untrue of the Words at that material time. Further, as the publication was made to RAMS in compliance with MAS’s directive, there cannot be any improper motive nor any dominant motive to injure the plaintiff.

> (b)     In so far as the Additional Words are concerned, the 2nd Defendant clearly had a genuine belief in its truth since he had been advised by UTI’s lawyers at the material time on reopening investigations into the alleged leak of confidential information by the plaintiff to RAMS, and was merely communicating that fact to RAMS. There is no evidence to infer that the dominant intention of that communication was to injure the plaintiff, since the 2nd Defendant had previous information from Mr Gaurav Maleri to suspect the plaintiff of having leaked confidential information to RAMS.

244    Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to the defence of qualified privilege.

### Whether the Words and Additional Words were fair comment on a matter of public interest

245    The Words and the Additional Words are clearly statements of fact and not comment; see \[233\] above and also attested to by the testimonies of the 2nd and 3rd defendants themselves[^156]. It seemed to me that the defendants had merely adopted a “kitchen sink” approach by including the defence of fair comment. There is no basis to regard the two publications as fair comment on a matter of public interest.

### If the Words and Additional Words are found to be defamatory, whether the plaintiff is entitled to aggravated damages

246    Since I have found that the plaintiff’s claim in defamation fails, there is no need to deal with this issue.

### Malicious falsehood

247    For completeness, I should also state that I find no basis for the plaintiff’s claim in malicious falsehood, the elements of which are stated in _Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 866</span> at \[169\]. The publication of the Words, the Additional Words and/or similar words to RAMS and to MAS were made pursuant to the 1st Defendant’s regulatory obligations under the MAS Notice SFA04-N11. They were not falsehoods since the defendants were merely reporting the conclusion of the disciplinary action against the plaintiff, and cannot be said to have been published maliciously as the reporting was pursuant to MAS’s directive.

## Issue 3: The plaintiff’s claim in conspiracy

248    The plaintiff’s claim in conspiracy cover three main heads as set out below[^157] (with the additional element that the relevant defendants had the predominant intention to injure the plaintiff by their combination of acts for the claim in lawful means conspiracy):

> (a)     procuring and/or effecting the alleged wrongful dismissal of the plaintiff;

> (b)     wrongfully lodging a misconduct report with MAS based on the findings of the internal inquiry; and

> (c)     wrongfully publishing the Words and/or the Additional Words.

##### (1)   Procuring and/or effecting wrongful dismissal in retaliation for whistleblowing

249    The plaintiff’s claim is that the four defendants being the conspirators knew or ought reasonably to have known that the plaintiff’s whistleblowing allegations had led to remedial action being taken in respect of the late trades and swing pricing. Further, notwithstanding that the conspirators knew or ought reasonably to have known that the 2nd to 4th defendants were personally implicated in the plaintiff’s whistleblowing allegations, the 2nd to 4th Defendants were appointed to the Inquiry Committee and commenced disciplinary action against the plaintiff. Despite the 2nd Defendant being the primary wrongdoer implicated in the whistleblowing allegations, he was authorised to spearhead the disciplinary action against the plaintiff.

250    By 14 December 2015, the conspirators had pre-determined that the plaintiff’s employment would be terminated in retaliation for his whistleblowing regardless of the plaintiff’s innocence. The conspirators had concocted the allegations set out in the Suspension Letter and subsequent emails from the 2nd Defendant, and intentionally dismissed or ignored the plaintiff’s explanations. The grounds for the termination of the plaintiff’s employment were baseless, premised on findings that were never raised and concluded in bad faith.

251    The conspirators had rejected the plaintiff’s request for an appeal and his offer of resignation in further retaliation of his whistleblowing allegations. The conspirators subsequently procured the lodgement of a misconduct report with MAS in order to compromise the plaintiff’s status as a “fit and proper” person in order to deprive him of his licence to work as a financial representative in Singapore. The conspirators then disguised the plaintiff’s dismissal as a “resignation” by requiring him to acknowledge a “relieving letter” that classified the termination as a “resignation”.

252    The plaintiff contended that the acts of the 2nd to 4th Defendants amounted to personal breaches of their fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of UTI and were also personal breaches of UTI’s workplace rules, policies and procedures.

##### (2)   Wrongfully lodging a misconduct report with MAS

253    It was alleged that the conspirators had conspired and combined together wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff by unlawful means by lodging a misconduct report with the MAS based on the Inquiry Committee’s findings which was known to the defendants to be false.

##### (3)   Wrongfully publishing the Words and/or the Additional Words

254    It was alleged that the conspirators had conspired and combined together wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff by unlawful means by causing injury or damage to his personal and professional reputation by publishing the Words and/or Additional Words.

#### Applicable principles

255    It is settled law that to prove conspiracy, a claimant must establish the following (see _EFT Holdings Inc v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 860</span>):

> (a)     there was a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts;

> (b)     the alleged conspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to the claimant by those acts;

> (c)     the acts were unlawful (for the tort of unlawful means conspiracy);

> (d)     the acts were performed in furtherance of an agreement; and

> (e)     the claimant suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy.

256    Whether company directors may be personally liable for conspiracy to cause a claimant loss turns on it being shown that the directors’ acts were in breach of their personal legal duties to the company. As held by the Court of Appeal in _PT Sandipala Arthaputra & Ors v ST Microelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 818</span> (“_PT Sandipala_”), the principle in _Said v Butt_ \[1920\] 2 KB 497, namely that when a director acted _bona fide_ within the scope of his authority, he was immune from tortious liability for procuring his company’s breach of contract (‘the _Said v Butt_ principle’), should be interpreted to exempt directors from personal liability for the contractual breaches of their company if their acts, in their capacity as directors, were not in themselves in breach of any fiduciary or other personal legal duties owed to the company. This principle operated as a requirement of liability and not a defence, meaning that a claimant has the onus of proving that the directors’ acts were in breach of their personal legal duties to the company.

257    In determining if a director can be held personally liable, the relevant focus of the _bona fide_ inquiry is the conduct of the director _vis-à-vis_ the company and not the third party. As elucidated by Steven Chong JA (at \[66\] of _PT Sandipala_):

>     … the applicability of the principle focuses on the director’s conduct and intention in relation to his duties towards his company, and not towards the third party. This was succinctly explained by Kan Ting Chiu J in his decision in _Otech Pakistan Pvt Ltd v Clough Engineering Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 98</span> (“_Otech_”) at \[25\], where he interpreted the requirement of _bona fide_ in the _Said v Butt_ principle to mean that the defendant was acting in good faith _in the discharge of his office_, and not that he was acting in good faith _in the action complained of_; a director may believe that it is for the good of the company to breach a contract intentionally. …

>     …

>     … the relevant focus of the _bona fide_ inquiry is _vis-à-vis_ the company and not the third party. It is thus insufficient that the director, through the company, directed a breach of contract that would have benefitted the director and the company to the detriment of third parties. **If the director acted in the best interests of the company and not in breach of any of his other duties owed to the company, notwithstanding that he also possessed the intention to injure the third party or to induce a breach of contract as against the third party (as the case may be), he would still be entitled to the protection of the ****_Said v Butt_**** principle.**

(emphasis in **bold** mine)

#### Plaintiff’s claim in conspiracy not proven

258    While the plaintiff had pleaded his claim in conspiracy in copious detail, the evidence adduced in support was considerably lacking. Much of the evidence in his AEIC dealt with his allegations of whistleblowing which were targeted against the 2nd Defendant. The only piece of documentary evidence which the plaintiff pointed to prove conspiracy was an email exchange[^158] between the 2nd Defendant and Mr Amandeep Chopra on transition plans after the plaintiff’s exit as portfolio manager of UTI IFIF, but neither the 3rd nor the 4th Defendant was privy to this email.

259    As for the disciplinary process itself, it was clear from the testimonies of the 3rd and 4th Defendants that there had been no agreement amongst the Inquiry Committee members to cause injury or harm to the plaintiff. The Suspension Letter which was handed to the plaintiff on 14 December 2015 with the charges of misconduct was authored by the 2nd Defendant alone[^159]. The 3rd and 4th Defendants were only informed of their involvement in the disciplinary process on 14 December 2015[^160] itself. The 3rd Defendant in fact asserted that she was only notified of her appointment to the disciplinary committee just 10 minutes before the Suspension Letter was handed to the plaintiff[^161].

260    Both the 3rd and 4th Defendants had exchanged separate emails with the plaintiff after his suspension and invited him to communicate with them privately[^162]. The 4th Defendant’s invitation to the plaintiff to do so had in fact resulted in him being admonished by the 2nd Defendant to which the 4th Defendant had provided a robust response. While the inquiry was clearly led by the 2nd Defendant, there is no evidence to indicate that the 3rd and 4th Defendants had shared a common intention to injure the plaintiff; and even much less so any predominant intention to harm him, for the purposes of satisfying the elements of a conspiracy by lawful means.

261    It was the 2nd Defendant who had single-handedly drafted the Termination Email which was sent to the plaintiff after the Final Hearing. It was also the 2nd Defendant who had determined the contents of the misconduct report which the 3rd Defendant was asked to send to MAS.

262    Contrary to the plaintiff’s pleaded case, there is no evidence to show that 2nd to 4th Defendants knew that they had been personally implicated in the plaintiff’s whistleblowing allegations or that they knew of the remedial actions that were recommended in the UTI-AMC Report to address the issue of late trades and implementation of swing pricing. The 2nd Defendant had testified[^163] that he had no knowledge of the UTI-AMC Report until it was discovered in the present proceedings which serves to debunk the plaintiff’s assertion[^164] that as very senior employees, the 2nd to 4th Defendants knew or ought to have known that the plaintiff’s whistleblowing had led to the remedial action being taken in respect of late trades and swing pricing.

263    The 2nd Defendant had also testified that investigations into the plaintiff’s conduct had begun way back in August 2015 before the plaintiff’s whistleblowing emails were sent in November 2015, and this was corroborated by the 3rd Defendant although she was not privy to the details of the investigation. The assertion in the plaintiff’s statement of claim that the defendants had acted in combination to retaliate against the plaintiff for whistleblowing was no more than a bald allegation.

264    The plaintiff has also adduced no evidence to show that 2nd to 4th Defendants had acted in breach of their personal and fiduciary duties to the 1st Defendant such that they should be held personally liable. The 2nd Defendant had acted in his capacity as CEO to convene the Inquiry Committee, and as the two next most senior employees of the 1st Defendant, the 3rd and 4th Defendants had been co-opted to the Committee. They had each participated in the disciplinary proceedings in the discharge of their office, and as such, cannot be said to have acted contrary to the company’s interest. While the ultimate decision may have harmed the plaintiff, there is no basis in law or fact to deny them the protection under the _Said v Butt_ principle.

265    Similarly, the 3rd Defendant’s notice sent to MAS and the publication of the Words as well as the Additional Words by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were done in their capacities as directors and/or senior executives of the 1st Defendant. As the decision to terminate the plaintiff’s employment had been endorsed at the highest level of the 1st Defendant’s management, as well as by the leadership of its parent company, the inescapable finding is that the actions of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were carried out in discharge of their duties to the 1st Defendant. In the circumstances, it would be unfair to deny them immunity under the _Said v Butt_ principle.

266    Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim in conspiracy fails.

## Issue 4: The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim

267    The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim is for losses that it says were caused by the plaintiff’s breach of an implied term in the Employment Agreement that he would carry out his duties with the reasonable skill and care to be expected of a competent Portfolio Manager[^165]; and/or the plaintiff’s breach of his duty of care in tort owed to the 1st Defendant[^166].

268    The sum claimed of USD59,520 arises from the Phoenix Trade incident (or “DBS deposit deal”) which had also served as one of the findings of misconduct by the Inquiry Committee to justify the plaintiff’s dismissal. Based on my consideration of the evidence (see \[139\] to \[148\] above), I did not find that the charge of misconduct against the plaintiff was made out. In effect, any liability for losses alleged to have been caused by the plaintiff’s failure to disclose the email dated 9 July 2015 to Mr Prateek Sinha has not been proven.

269    The 1st Defendant relies entirely on the evidence of the 2nd Defendant for its counterclaim. This appears in the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC at \[28\], \[73a\], \[73b\] and exhibit “PJ-10”. It is obvious that the 2nd Defendant has no personal knowledge of the events which transpired and had chosen to accept the account of Mr Prateek Sinha over that of the plaintiff. However, the email account of Mr Sinha referred to various oral communications which he had with the plaintiff and DBS which are not documented in any of the contemporaneous emails. In any case, the email account of Mr Sinha is hearsay which is inadmissible for the purposes of proving the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim. No prior notice was given by the 1st Defendant under O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court that it intended to rely on hearsay, and there are no applicable exceptions under the Evidence Act (Cap 97) which make the hearsay written account admissible.

270    Further, the losses claimed are in the nature of fees which the 1st Defendant had voluntarily chosen to waive in order to appease DBS. It is questionable whether causation for the loss has been established merely on the Mr Sinha’s hearsay account of his “firefighting” efforts to appease DBS which caused him to offer the fee waivers. It should also be noted that the documentary proof of such losses had not been furnished in the 2nd Defendant’s AEIC. While they have been included in the Agreed Bundle, the contents of the documents still have to be proven which was not done. See _Jet Holding Ltd & Ors v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 417</span> at \[147\].

271    The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim is accordingly dismissed as it has failed to discharge its burden of proof.

## Issue 5: The 3rd Defendant’s claim for an indemnity against the 1st and/or the 2nd Defendants

272    The 3rd Defendant had issued a Third Party Notice against the 1st and 2nd Defendants to claim an indemnity to such an extent as the court may find or give of the plaintiff’s claim, and the costs of this action, on the grounds that the 3rd Defendant had at all times acted in the course of her employment with the 1st Defendant and/or pursuant to the instructions of the 2nd Defendant.

273    As the plaintiff’s claims in defamation and conspiracy have been dismissed against all the defendants, there is no necessity for me to consider that aspect of the 3rd Defendant’s claim against her former employer. The only remaining issue is whether the 3rd Defendant should be entitled to be indemnified for her costs in defending the plaintiff’s action (“DC 2058”).

274    The 3rd Defendant had admitted[^167] that she had signed a letter of undertaking dated 25 July 2017 (“the Undertaking”) pursuant to which the 1st Defendant had agreed to be liable for all “_legal professional fees, adverse costs orders, adverse orders to pay damages, disbursements and taxes_” incurred in the course of the 3rd Defendant’s engagement of legal representation arising out of and in connection with the proceedings in DC 2058.

275    There was, however, a condition attached to the Undertaking – it was expressly stated to be “_subject always to your seeking and receiving of our prior approval as to the identity of counsel and choice of law firm to be engaged by you in respect of the foregoing”._

276    I agree with the 1st and 2nd Defendants that UTI’s obligation to indemnify the 3rd Defendant arises solely out of the Undertaking, and is a matter of contract between the parties. The 3rd Defendant had chosen not to continue with her representation by Shook Lin & Bok LLP as she did not agree with the 1st Defendant’s litigation strategy. While choice of counsel is clearly a personal prerogative, as she did not seek the prior approval of the 1st Defendant before appointing her new counsel or the firm of Gloria James-Civetta & Co for the purposes of defending DC 2058, the express condition for her to rely on the Undertaking has not been fulfilled.

277    During cross-examination[^168], the 3rd Defendant had admitted that she had not received any express approval from the 1st Defendant on the appointment of her new counsel. The emails disclosed in the 3rd Defendant’s own supplementary AEIC showed that she was informed by the 1st Defendant that she was free to seek independent legal advice, but given that she had not shown cause as to how Shook Lin & Bok LLP had misrepresented her, the 1st Defendant was in no position to pay for extraneous legal advice[^169].

278    As such, the 3rd Defendant’s claim for an indemnity against the 1st and/or 2nd Defendants for her legal costs is dismissed.

## Summary of findings

279    In summary, my decision and findings are as set out below:

> (a)     The plaintiff was not a genuine whistleblower. As such, the plaintiff was not entitled to claim protection under Paragraphs 4.19 and 6 of the 1st Defendant’s Personnel Policy.

> (b)     The 1st Defendant was not entitled to dismiss the plaintiff for cause under Clause 15 of the Employment Agreement based on the findings of the Inquiry Committee as set out in the Termination Email. The findings of misconduct by the Inquiry Committee were not established on the evidence adduced.

> (c)     Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement is not “illegal, null and void” as the plaintiff cannot be considered an “employee” within the Employment Act (Cap. 91 Rev. Ed. 2009) then in force.

> (d)     Having elected to terminate the plaintiff’s employment for misconduct, the 1st Defendant was, by its conduct, precluded from relying on the no-fault termination provision in Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement.

> (e)     The 1st Defendant’s denial of the plaintiff’s appeal against the Inquiry Committee’s findings of misconduct resulting in the dismissal of the plaintiff was a breach of Paragraph 4.18 of the Personnel Policy as well as a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.

> (f)     The plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that he was wrongfully dismissed for misconduct on the basis of the findings set out in the Termination Email.

> (g)     Based on the 1st Defendant’s minimum legal obligation, no damages are payable to the plaintiff.

> (h)     The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants are not liable to the plaintiff for defamation or malicious falsehood in respect of the Words, the Additional Words, or similar words.

> (i)     The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants are not liable to the plaintiff in conspiracy whether by lawful or unlawful means. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants are entitled to immunity under the _Said v Butt_ principle as there is no breach of their fiduciary or personal legal duties to the 1st Defendant.

> (j)     The plaintiff is not liable for the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim for damages for breach of the Employment Agreement or in negligence as it has failed to discharge its burden of proof.

> (k)     The 1st and/or the 2nd Defendants are not liable to indemnify the 3rd Defendant for her costs as the condition in the Undertaking has not been fulfilled.

## Conclusion

280    In conclusion:

> (a)     The plaintiff is granted a declaration that he was wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the 1st Defendant for misconduct on the basis of the findings set out in the Termination Email.

> (b)     The plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant for damages for wrongful dismissal and/or breach of the Employment Agreement is dismissed.

> (c)     The plaintiff’s claims against the 1st to 3rd Defendants in libel are dismissed.

> (d)     The plaintiff’s claims against the 1st to 3rd Defendants in malicious falsehood are dismissed.

> (e)     The plaintiff’s claims against the 1st to 4th Defendants in conspiracy are dismissed.

> (f)     The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff for damages for breach of the Employment Agreement and/or negligence is dismissed.

> (g)     The 3rd Defendant’s cljjaim against the 1st and/or the 2nd Defendant for an indemnity is dismissed.

281    I will hear parties on the issue of costs on a date to be fixed.
