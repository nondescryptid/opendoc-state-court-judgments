### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       It was common for jobseekers, both locals and particularly foreigners, to engage employment agents to help them secure employment in Singapore. This was because the employment agents have the expertise to help them. In turn, the employment agents were expected to discharge their duties with integrity, probity, diligence and skills. Unfortunately, not every employment agent was committed to these values. Some unscrupulous agents took advantage of these vulnerable and desperate jobseekers by charging them exorbitant fees. Some foreigners have even been left stranded in Singapore when these agents reneged on their promises to find jobs, and then disappeared. In order to protect these jobseekers, the Employment Agencies Act (Cap 92, Rev Ed 2012)(“EAA”) was enacted to regulate the activities of employment agencies and agents. All employment agencies and agents were now required to hold a licence to operate.

2       With the advent of the internet, jobseekers could now source for suitable employment online using online job portals such as JobStreet and JobsCentral, without the need to engage employment agents. These online job portals were platforms that links jobseekers with potential employers. All they need do was to visit these portals and find a job that suit their preferences, qualifications and experiences. Under the EAA, such online portals were usually exempted from holding a licence to operate.

3       The Accused in the present case offered such an online job portal. He created an online resume distribution service for jobseekers to seek employment. The question that arose was whether the Accused was exempted from the requirement of holding a licence under the EAA.

## The charge

4       The Accused had claimed trial to one count of s 6(1) punishable under s 6(4)(a) of the EAA. The offence was one of carrying on an employment agency without a licence issued by the Commissioner for Employment Agencies. The period of offence was from 17 February 2016 to 6 June 2017.

5       At the end of the trial, I convicted the Accused and sentenced him to four weeks’ imprisonment and fined $80,000. The Accused had filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. The prosecution had filed an appeal against sentence.

## The trial

### The agreed facts

6       The facts of the case were mainly agreed. I set out the statement of agreed facts which was admitted in court (Exhibit PS1) below -

> 2    At all material times, the Accused was the sole proprietor of JOBSINSG.COM (UEN: 53329962D) (“**JSG**”) and conducted his business at 10 Anson Road #26-10, International Plaza, Singapore 079903 (the “Office”).

> 3    Sometime between 17 February 2016 and 6 June 2017, the accused carried out an employment agency under the business name of JSG. The accused was not a holder of a licence issued by the Commissioner for Employment Agencies

> 4    During the material period, the accused posted advertisements on print newspapers such as the Straits Times and on websites such as Fastjobs.sg. These advertisements purported to provide employment opportunities for jobseekers. These advertisements invited interested jobseekers to send a Short Message Service (“SMS”) of their email address to a hand phone number. **Exhibit P3** contains a sample of an advertisement that was posted by the accused.

> 5    When an interested jobseeker sends an SMS to the stated hand phone number, they received an automated reply inviting them to walk in to the Office. Exhibit **P4** contains a sample of the automated SMS reply that was received by one of the jobseekers.

> 6    Following the above, each jobseeker went to the Office and met the accused for the first time. Typically, the interaction with each of the jobseeker would begin with the accused handing a standard document titled “SERVICE DESCRIPTION (PLEASE READ!)” (the “Form”). The nature of this Form is to promote the accused’s service of resume distribution.

> 7    The jobseeker would then be invited to append his signature under one of the available columns on the Form. **Exhibit P6** contains samples of the Form. At around the same time, the accused would also invite the jobseeker to sign on an invoice with the terms of his engagement in fine prints (the “Invoice”). **Exhibit P12** is a sample of the Invoice.

> 8    After this, the accused would request the jobseeker for payment (usually $350) if they want to engage his services.

> 9    After collecting payment from the jobseeker, the accused would hand over a document containing full information on his service (“Information Slip”). In essence, the Information Slip requires a jobseeker to visit a webpage http://www.jobsingsg.com (the “Webpage”) and create a unique account. The jobseeker is then required to upload his resume onto an application within the webpage. **Exhibit P5** is a sample of the Information Slip.

> 10    The Webpage utilised a software to trawl other online job websites such as “JobsDB” and would send out the uploaded resumes of the jobseekers to those employers based on matching job descriptions.

> 11    On 31 May 2017, arising from a newspaper article on the accused’s nature of business, Jessie Lim (the “IO”), an employment agency inspector from the Ministry of Manpower (“**MOM**”) commenced investigations to establish if there are breaches under the Employment Agencies Act (Cap 92, Rev Ed 2012). To this end, on 7 June 2017, the IO visited the Office and seized the following items:

> 12    Based on the item in s/n 1 of Table A, there were at least 755 persons who engaged the accused’s services during the material period.

> 13    Based on the item in s/n 2 of Table A, the accused received a total of $294,135 from jobseekers during the material period. The details of these payments are enclosed in **Annex A**.

> 14    In the course of investigations, the IO interviewed 14 jobseekers who engaged the accused’s services. All of them revealed that they were not successful in getting a job after engaging the accused’s services. Initially, these 14 jobseekers were not refunded the payments that they made to the accused. On MOM’s intervention, the accused refunded nine of them. The details of these 14 jobseekers are as follows:

> 15    After the accused was charged in court for the offence that he is currently claiming trial to, the accused called the MOM hotline on two separate occasions to enquire if his business model was exempted from holding an employment agency licence. He spoke with Customer Service Officers manning MOM’s call centre. These officers were not employees of MOM. The details of these telephone conversations are as follows:

7       Apart from the ASOF, the MOM prosecutor Mr Riasudeen also called four of the 14 jobseekers to give evidence in relation to the interviews that they had with the Accused in his office. Mr Riasudeen also played the video footages of these interviews. The video footages were recorded by the Accused.

### The case for the prosecution

8       MOM prosecutor Mr Riasudeen submitted that, in offering his website to jobseekers, the Accused had performed an activity for or in connection with the employment of one or more persons. Under s 6(1) of the EAA, the Accused required a licence to perform this activity, unless he was exempted from holding a licence. The provision on exemption was set out in Order 2(a) of the Employment Agencies (Exemption) Order 2011 (the “Exemption Order”). Order 2(a) provided that a person was exempted from holding a licence if he “carrie\[d\] on an employment agency, or perform\[ed\] any work or activity in Singapore for or in connection with the employment of one or more persons in any capacity, _wholly_ using the World Wide Web through the Internet” (emphasis mine).

9       Mr Riasudeen submitted that the Accused did not fall within the exemption. His business model was not fully online as he had physical interactions with the jobseekers in his office. He had lured the jobseekers to his office through advertisements (Exhibit P3) that he had placed in various print media and the automated short messaging service (“SMS”) replies (Exhibit P4) that he sent out to interested jobseekers. The content of the advertisements and SMS replies were crafted such that they gave the jobseekers the impression that the Accused was either going to find them employment or would interview them as an employer. The advertisements did not make any mention of the true nature of the Accused’s services, which was, an online resume distribution service. Mr Riasudeen also submitted that the physical interactions at the Accused’s office was an integral and necessary element of his business model.

### The defence case

10     Mr Riyach submitted that the facts showed that the Accused was exempted from holding a licence. Firstly, he argued that from the inception of the Act, Parliament’s intention was to prevent jobseekers from being cheated and to regulate employment agencies who were actively involved in actual work placement. Therefore, Parliament did not intent to regulate entities that provided wed-based portals as they were not concerned with the actual job placement. Mr Riyach argued that the Accused’s online resume distribution service fell into this category. This was because the actual job placement was performed by the Accused’s web-based portal and not by the Accused himself.

11     The Accused’s web-based portal was structured in such a way that the jobseeker would choose the employment criteria, and then the system would send the jobseeker’s resume to all potential employers via email based on the search criteria. These employers would then contact the jobseekers directly. The physical meetings with the jobseekers at the Accused office were merely for the purpose of receiving payments for the use of the Accused’s web-based portal. Mr Riyach said that the evidence clearly showed that the jobseekers knew this. This was because the Accused had explained to them that they would have to upload their resumes on his online platform and that the prospective employers would contact them directly.

### The issue to be determined

12     The sole issue for determination was whether, on the facts as agreed by both parties, the Accused had carried out an employment agency wholly using the world wide web such that he was exempted from holding a licence.

### Analysis of the evidence

13     I would first set out the chronology of events that were relevant to determine the issue above –

> (a)     Sometime between 17 February 2016 and 6 June 2017, the Accused carried out an employment agency under the business name of JSG.

> (b)     He had an office at the International Plaza building.

> (c)     He posted advertisements in the print media such as the Straits Times and on websites such as FastJobs.sg (Exhibit P3).

> (d)     The advertisements invited interested jobseekers to send a SMS of their email address to a handphone number. The number belonged to the Accused. An automated SMS reply would be sent inviting them to the Accused’s office (Exhibit P4).

> (e)     At the office, the Accused would hand out a standard document titled “Service description, please read” (“Service description”)(Exhibit P6). The jobseeker would have to sign on the Service description. This purportedly ensured that the jobseeker had read and understood its contents.

> (f)     The Accused would then invite the jobseeker to sign an invoice with the terms of engagement in fine print (the Invoice”)[^1].

> (g)     The Accused would then request for payment (usually $350) if the jobseeker wished to engage his services.

> (h)     After collection of the payment, the Accused would hand over a document containing full information about his online service (“Information slip”)(Exhibit P5).

14     The requirement for a licence was set out in s 6(1) of the EAA. It provided that “no person shall carry on an employment agency unless the person is the holder of a licence”. An employment agency referred to “any agency or registry carried on or represented as being or intended to be carried on (whether for the purpose of gain or reward or not) for or in connection with the employment of persons in any capacity, but does not include any registry set up by an employer for the sole purpose of recruiting persons for employment on his own behalf”[^2]. This definition was sufficiently broad to cover a wide range of employment-related activities. This was a deliberate move to ensure that all types of employment-related activities that might give rise to malpractices were covered.

15     Notwithstanding s 6(1) EAA, the Exemption Order exempted a person who carried on an employment agency wholly using the World Wide Web through the Internet. The legal definition of the word “wholly” was “not partially; fully; completely”[^3]. Applying the legal definition, it meant that an employment agency that has part of its operation outside the scope of the internet would not be exempted. The rationale for the exemption was clear. A fully or wholly online employment agency played a passive role in job emplacement. It merely provided a platform for employers to post job opportunities and for jobseekers to search for jobs that suited them. The absence of any physical interaction would obviate the opportunity for abuse.

16     In the present case, I noted that the job placement was done solely online and that the Accused played no active role in this, other than offering his web-based resume distribution service for use. However, prior to this, there was physical interaction between him and the jobseekers at his office. In my mind, this put him squarely outside the condition for exemption under the Exemption Order. This was because, upon closer scrutiny, the physical interactions formed an integral and necessary component of his business model. They were not merely for the purpose of obtaining payment as submitted by Mr Riyach. I agreed with Mr Riasudeen’s submission that this was not a case where the Accused had created the online resume distribution service, and then took a backseat by allowing anyone to use it, like some of the other web-based services available online.

17     The evidence before me showed that the physical interactions at the Accused’s office was part of a series of very deliberate and calculated steps to ensure that the jobseekers used his online resume distribution service. First, he lured them into turning up at his office by putting up the following advertisement –

> “IT SUPPORT/DEVELOPER. $2500-$5K. SMS your email to: XXX.”

The wordings of the advertisement were clear. It advertised job vacancies for the position of IT support/developer with the potential salary ranging between $2,500 to $5,000. Interested persons were urged to SMS their email addresses to the number stated therein. There was nothing in the advertisement that pointed to the fact that the Accused was offering an online resume distribution service. The Accused’s explanation that he had drafted the advertisement in that manner because he had wanted to save cost was both disingenuous and unbelievable.

18     Jobseekers who responded to the advertisement then received the following SMS message –

> “Walk-in from (Mon-Sat: 2pm-4pm) at 10 Anson Road #26-10, International Plaza Building, S(079903) near Tanjong Pagar MRT, Exit C. Refundable fee fr\[om\] $50\*, (NETS/cash only), NETS preferred. NO agent/placement fee. Foreigners welcome, other jobs available. \*T&C apply. DO NOT REPLY.”

Again, similar to the advertisement, the content of the SMS did not make mention of the Accused’s online resume distribution service. I agreed with Mr Riasudeen’s submission that the impression conveyed by the advertisement and SMS reply was that the Accused was either going to find the jobseeker employment as an employment agent or would interview the jobseeker as a prospective employer.

19     The evidence of the four jobseekers, whom the prosecution called to testify to give a sampling of what transpired during the interviews, supported this conclusion. Their testimonies showed that they had been misled by the advertisement and the SMS. PW1 and PW2 thought that they were engaging the services of an employment agent[^4]. PW3 saw the Accused as a “consultant” who would recommend a job to her[^5]. As for PW4, before the meeting at the Accused’s office, she thought she was going to an interview with a prospective employer[^6].

20     I rejected Mr Riyach’s submission that when the jobseekers paid the fees to the Accused, they knew or was aware that the payment was for the use of the Accused’s online resume distribution service. The four video clips of the interviews that were played back in court clearly showed that the Accused had only disclosed his online resume distribution service after the jobseekers had made payment. Prior to payment, the Accused had collected the jobseekers’ resumes and engaged in employment-related communication with some of them. During the communications with the jobseekers, the Accused had deliberately been vague about the services he was offering. His focus was on getting the jobseekers to accept his services and make payment. He did not mention his online resume distribution service at all. This was a deliberate step aimed to mislead the jobseekers into believing that he was going to find jobs for them and thereby induced them into making payment.

21     The Accused only revealed his resume distribution service to the jobseekers after he had obtained payment of the fees. And he would not give refunds until the jobseekers had tried his online service. In fact, whilst on the stand, the Accused himself had agreed that he knew that the jobseekers were not clear about the service he was actually offering them, and that he had only fully explained it to them after the payments had been received by him[^7]. In relation to his refund policy, he had admitted in his statement to MOM that it was merely a gimmick as it was almost impossible for any jobseeker to get a refund (Exhibit P21 at \[7\]) –

> “To date I estimate that I have collected fees from roughly 1000 job applicants. I do not know how many successful placements are there since my main concern is to blast out the resume collected and so we do not maintain such records. Also, I would like to state that based on the criteria set, I have yet to make any refunds to the job applicant since it is quite impossible to have “no clicks” on their resume since it will be blasted out to many companies at one go. Since it is very targeted, of the many employers we sent the resume out, there was bound to be someone who will click on it. The refund stated is mainly a gimmick to attract more customers”.

22     I found that the physical interactions between the Accused and the jobseekers formed an integral and essential aspect of the Accused’s employment agency. The physical interactions greatly improved the uptake of his online resume distribution service. As the Accused himself had admitted in his statement to MOM, he had decided to operate from a physical office and meet the jobseekers because “most candidates \[did\] not feel secure to make payment without meeting up with \[him\]”. He disclosed that after he had rented an office space and met the jobseekers, his online resume distribution service business improved significantly[^8].

23     Significantly, the Accused had admitted in his cross-examination that his business was not wholly carried out on the internet[^9]. However, in re-examination, he tried to clarify that since the job matching and placement was only done online, he was therefore operating the employment agency wholly using the internet. I rejected this argument. The Exemption Order stated that the exemption applied to, _inter alia_, anyone who carried on an employment agency wholly using the World Wide Web through the Internet. Employment agency was defined as any agency or registry carried on or represented as being or intended to be carried on (whether for the purpose of gain or reward or not) for or _in connection with the employment of persons_ in any capacity. It was artificial to divorce the physical interactions done at the Accused’s office from his online resume distribution service. Given that the physical interaction was integral to the Accused’s business, these physical interactions comprised activities “in connection with the employment of persons in any capacity”. Because these physical interactions, including the fee payments, were outside the sphere of the internet meant that the Accused employment agency was not carried out wholly using the internet, and therefore he was not exempted from holding a licence.

24     Lastly, it could be inferred from the evidence that the Accused himself was aware or had reason to believe that he was not exempted from holding a licence. He had admitted as much in his statement to MOM when he said (at \[6\] of Exhibit P21)–

> “Sometime in 2016, I was investigated by MOM operating an employment agency without a licence. I received a warning for that case. I understand that I am required to have an employment licence if I want to continue to perform employment agency related work, which is why I submitted an application to get an employment agency licence in Mar 2017. However, I would like to say that the process is very long and I decided to continue with my business while waiting for the Ministry to process my licence application”.

25     I was therefore satisfied that the prosecution has proven his case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty of the charge and duly convicted him.

## Antecedents

26     The Accused was a first offender.

## The sentence

### The prescribed punishment

27     The prescribed punishment was a fine not exceeding $80,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding two years or both.

### Submissions on sentence

28     Mr Riasudeen submitted that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle in this case. This was clearly Parliament’s intention when the regulatory framework of the EAA was enhanced by the amendments that came into effect on 1 April 2011. During the Second Reading of the Amendment Bill, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, the Minister of State for Manpower stated that “the need for stronger regulations to tackle errant and unlicensed EAs” was the key consideration for the enhancement. He also stressed that the government took unlicensed EAA activities very seriously. To stem the supply of unlicensed agencies, the penalties were raised to ensure that they were commensurate with the potential gains from malpractices[^10]. This was a direct reference to the very lucrative nature of such activities.

29     Apart from Parliament’s intention, Mr Riasudeen also cited _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”). In particular, he submitted that the four considerations set out in _Law Aik Meng_ that generally attracted deterrence were present. These were set out below.

#### The offence-specific factors

##### (1)   The offences were committed against vulnerable victims

30     Mr Riasudeen highlighted that the Minister for State said as much in his speech during the Second Reading. He said that unlicensed EAA activities tended “…_to exploit the vulnerable workers from developing countries by charging them exorbitant fees and \[might\] not give them the promised jobs in return_”[^11]. Mr Riasudeen submitted that even though the accused person had not charged exorbitant fees from the jobseekers (which comprised locals and foreigners), there was nevertheless exploitation of their vulnerability. According to Mr Riasudeen, these jobseekers were misled into believing that the Accused was going to find jobs for them through the advertisements and SMS. He had leveraged on their misinformed state by deliberately failing to clarify the nature of services he was actually offering. The videos of the interviews showed that he had deliberately kept the jobseekers in the dark until they had made payments to him.

##### (2)   Prevalence of the offence

31     The enhancements to the EAA penal provisions was in direct response to the prevalence of persons operating as unlicensed employment agents. This was reflected by the rising numbers of complaints received against licensed and unlicensed employmnt agents. Stronger regulations were necessary to address this[^12].

##### (3)   Detection and/or apprehension difficult

32     The Accused operated undetected for a period of one year and three months, during which time he had served 755 jobseekers. No complaint was made during this time. Mr Riasudeen submitted that this was not surprising as the Accused had cloaked his operation with a veneer of legitimacy by operating from a physical office and had issued receipts. Also, he had inserted a pre-emptive threat to impose a $1,000 sanction on any jobseeker who lodged a police report against him. He called this penal sanction an “inconvenience fee”. The “inconvenience fee” was included as a condition in the payment invoice that he issued to the jobseekers[^13]. The offence was only discovered by MOM after the media ran a story about the nature of the Accused’s business. Mr Riasudeen submitted that if not for the news article, the Accused’s activities would have gone undetected for a longer period.

##### (4)   There were multiple victims

33     At least 755 jobseekers had been served by the Accused. Actual harm was caused to some of them. The 14 interviewed by MOM in the course of its investigations showed that none had succeeded in securing jobs through the Accused. Nine of the 14 had received refunds but only because of MOM’s intervention.

##### (5)   Hefty-profits were made

34     The Accused had made a handsome profit of about $291,135. This was three times the maximum fine prescribed for the offence. A fine alone was therefore inappropriate as it would not sufficiently act as a deterrence. It therefore followed that a custodial sentence with a fine was warranted. The fine was warranted to disgorge the profits which the Accused had made from his illegal behaviour: see _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ \[2014\] 4 SLR(R) 992 (at \[78\]). The fine represented a rough and ready method of confiscating the proceeds of crime: see Koh Jaw Hung v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 516</span> (at \[44\]).

##### (6)   There was an element of dishonesty

35     Mr Riasudeen submitted that an offence under s 6(1) EAA did not require the element of dishonesty. If dishonesty was present on the facts, then this should be treated as an additional aggravating factor: see _Soh Guan Cheow Anthony v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 147</span> (at \[176\]). Mr Riasudeen submitted that there was dishonesty in the Accused’s conduct towards the jobseekers. First, the advertisements and the SMS replies gave the impression that he was going to secure jobs for them. They did not give any inkling about the actual services that he was offering. At the interviews at his office, he did not disclose or volunteer any information about the actual service he was offering. He also did not give them any opportunity to seek clarification about it. It as clear from the video footages of the interviews that the principle aim of the interviews was to extract payment of the fees. After the money was in the bag, only then the Accused disclosed to the jobseekers about his resume distribution service. By this time, as money had already changed hands, the jobseekers had no choice but to use the Accused’s online service. To put their minds at ease, the Accused gave empty assurances that they would get their refunds if they were not successful. Of course, unknown to the jobseekers, the refund policy was merely a gimmick, and that the Accused had designed his online portal such that refunds was almost impossible.

##### (7)   Significant period of offending

36     The Accused’s activity spanned one year and three months. This constituted a significant period of offending.

#### Offender-specific factors

37     Mr Riasudeen submitted that there was no valid mitigating factor present in the case.

#### Case precedents

38     Mr Riasudeen highlighted that on the available information, there were 26 cases of individuals convicted for offences under s 6(1) EAA. Except for _PP v Chua Mei Chern_ (DAC 44047/2011)(“_Chua Mei Chern_”), the sentences meted out were fines which ranged between $20,000 and $60,000. However, Mr Riasudeen submitted that these cases were far less egregious than the present case, and that _Chua Mei Chern_ came closest in terms of egregiousness.

39     In _Chua Mei Chern_, the offender took elaborate steps to carry out an employment agency without a licence. She set up a business styled SSS Employment Services (“SSS”), printed name cards to advertise and promote the business. She recruited another individual, a Filipino national, to source for foreigners looking for jobs here. The offender also actively sourced for job vacancies in companies and facilitated the interview process. She collected a total of $7,835.40 from the foreigners as her fees. Eventually only one jobseeker was successfully emplaced. The others were left in the lurch in Singapore when they were unable to contact the offender. The offender was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

40     The present case was far more egregious. A far greater number of jobseekers were involved. The profits earned was also substantially higher. On the other hand, the jobseekers in _Chua Mei Chern_ had come to Singapore for the sole purpose of finding jobs here through the offender, and they had trusted her to find jobs for them.

41     For the above reasons, Mr Riasudeen submitted for a sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment and the maximum fine of $80,000.

### The mitigation plea

42     Mr Riyach for the Accused sought for the maximum fine of $80,000. He relied on the following factors set out in the paragraph below.

43     Mr Riyach distinguished the Accused’s case from the case precedents. He stressed that the Accused did not undertake any active step to seek job placement for the jobseekers. Rather, the jobseekers had to choose their preference on the Accused’s online platform to seek prospective employment for themselves. The Accused had informed the jobseekers that he was providing a resume distribution service. He maintained a physical office solely for the purpose of collecting the fees for his online service. For these reasons, the Accused’s culpability fell at the lower end of the sentencing spectrum.

44     Mr Riyach cited case precedents where various quantums of fines had been imposed. These were –

> (a)      _International Placements (S) Pte Ltd v PP and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 46</span> (“_International Placements_”).

> (b)      _PP v Boo Tuang Hock Patrick_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 457</span> (“_Boo Tuang Hock Patrick_”).

> (c)      _PP v Lina Khoo Ling_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 58</span> (“_Lina Khoo Ling_”).

> (d)      _PP v Arumugam Kannan_ (DAC 42617/2012)(“_Arumugam Kannan_”).

> (e)      _PP v De Luna Noriza Dancel_ (DAC 47999/2011)(“_De Luna Noriza Dancel_”).

45      _International Placements_ was a claim trial case. The offender earned management fees by arranging for nine foreign students to join the on-the-job training (“OJT”) programme at a company named DDPL. It had sourced for the foreign students, and collected and forwarded their biodata to DDPL. The offender had also arranged for the interviews between DDPL and the foreign students, assisted in the preparation of their work pass applications, which DDPL then submitted to MOM. It also managed the details of their accomodation in Singapore, upkeep and medical treatment, and also facilitated their return to their home countries. The foreign students were not under any contract of service during the OJT programme. They worked at DDPL’s stores, performed retail, management and stocking duties.

46     In sentencing the offender to a fine of $40,000, the trial judge considered the following factors –

> (a)     There was a deliberate intention to circumvent and undermine the regulatory framework under s 6(1) EA (at \[85\]).

> (b)     Culpability was medium given that the quantum of the fees collected and the number of foreign students involved were significant (at \[86\]).

> (c)     Harm was low as all the foreign students had been emplaced, and there was no evidence of exploitation or that they or DDPL had been compromised by the unlicensed activity (at \[87\]).

> (d)     A stronger sentence was justified in view of the difficulty in detecting such offences (at \[88\]).

> (e)     The offender was not entitled to any sentencing discount as it had claimed trial to the charge (at \[89\]).

> (f)     The offender was a first offender (at \[95\]).

47     The offender in _Boo Tuang Hock Patrick_ had provided a suite of services to his client, NVC (S) Pte Ltd (“NVC”). They included offering to procure manpower on NVC’s behalf, sourced for one foreigner to be employed by NVC, arranged and facilitated the interview of the said foreigner with NVC, applied for his S-pass on behalf of NVC and subsequently applied for its cancellation, provided the biodata of another foreigner to NVC, and collated the documentation for both foreigners in relation to their work pass applications, including their security bond documents, for NVC to sign. As a consequence, one of the foreigners was left without any employment and without any means of support in Singapore for four months. He was convicted after a trial and was fined $2,500. However, it should be noted that the prescribed punishment then was a fine not exceeding $5,000 (for a first offender), and a fine not exceeding $10,000, or to imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or to both (for a second or subsequent offender). The offender in _Boo Tuang Hock Patrick_ was a first offender.

48     The offender in _Lina Khoo Ling_ initially possessed a license to run an employment agency. She did not renew the license when it expired in end-March 2011. Nevertheless she continued to act as an employment agent from 1 April to 12 December 2011. She matched potential employees with prospective employers, assisted in the crediting of these employees via GIRO and continued to source potential employers for her clients. She emplaced a total of 38 employees with various employers and was paid agency fees of $1,200 for each successful emplacement. One similar charge was taken into consideration. She was fined $15,000.

49     The offender in _Arumugam Kannan_ was a work pass holder as a construction worker. However, he had acted as an unlicensed employment agent and emplaced some 200 workers, of which only nine were identified. He had collected agency fees both in Singapore and India. He was fined $50,000.

50     In _De Luna Noriza Dancel_, the offender was the holder of an employment agent license for a company named RSD. She set up a second company named NWCD with her husband. NWCD was not licensed as a employment agency. Notwithstanding this, she conducted recruitment activities through NWCD. When investigations were conducted and MOM did not renew her license in relation to RSD, she set up a third company named “Impact” in order to continue with her illegal recruitment activities. She also used another company to make online applications for work passes. A total of 23 persons were emplaced and $31,700 were collected as agency fees. She was fined $50,000.

### The sentence

51     First, I agreed with Mr Riasudeen that the dominant consideration in sentencing an offence under s 6(1) EAA was deterrence. I did not think that Mr Riyach seriously disputed this. The victims in the present case were vulnerable in the sense that they would have been anxious and hopeful to secure jobs for themselves. The Accused had exploited this sense of anxiety and hope by making misleading representations that made them believe that he was going to find employment for them. He leveraged on their misinformed state by deliberately not clarifying what services he was actually offering them, until they had made payment. Once the money had changed hands, although the victims were then told the ‘real deal’, it was too late to back out. Further they were dissuaded from backing out by the empty assurance that refunds were possible.

52     The offence was revealed when an article was run in the print media about the Accused’s activity. This was after he had a good run of one year and three months, wherein he had served 755 jobseekers. This was emblematic of the difficulty in detecting such cases. Usually, disclosure of such activities would come from complaints by the victim or victims to the authorities. But in this case, to the lay person, the Accused’s activity had the appearance of legitimacy, in that, he operated from a physical office and he issued receipts. In addition, he had placed a condition in the contract that threatened anyone who lodged a police report against him with a sanction of $1,000; what he called an “inconvenience fee”. To the lay person, the cloak of legitimacy and the threat of financial sanction would effectively discourage or deter any attempt at making a complaint.

53     The number of victims involved was 755. This was a significantly large number. MOM investigators had randomly selected 14 to assist them in their investigations and to testify in court if and when necessary. The investigations disclosed that all 14 had not succeeded in securing employment through the Accused’s online portal. Of the 14, only nine had received refunds with the help of MOM.

54     The Accused had carefully crafted and planned his activities, from the wordings of the advertisement in the print media to the approach that he took during the physical meetings with the victims at the office. The advertisement was designed to give the impression that the Accused was offering the normal employment agent service, and that interested applicants were to attend an interview at his office. The main aim during the interview was to extract payments from the applicants without clearly explaining the services that he was actually offering them. He used the stack of resumes on his table as a prop to convince the victims of his reliability and generate trust. All these were clear from viewing the video footages of the interviews. It was apparent that these meetings were integral to the Accused’s business model. As he had admitted, he would not have been able to sell his online service as well without these physical interactions.

55     Even when the Accused was under MOM investigations he persisted in his illegal activities. He admitted as much to this. This behaviour pointed to a defiant attitude on his part. It also demonstrated just how lucrative the activity was such that the Accused had baulked at desisting even when he was under investigation for that very activity. To underscore this point, the profit he made in the one year and three months was $291,135.

56     For the above reasons, deterrence required that a custodial sentence be imposed. A fine alone, even if it was the maximum fine of $80,000 would not constitute sufficient deterrence. In addition to a term of imprisonment, a fine was also warranted in order to disgorge the profits made by the Accused.

57     In determining the length of imprisonment, I took guidance from the case of _Chua Mei Chern_ cited by Mr Riasudeen. The cases cited by Mr Riyach were all distinguishable in that the factual matrixes were so dissimilar that they could not be used in any meaningful way as a guide for the present case. Even so, in applying _Chua Mei Chern_ as a guide, I was mindful that there was no written grounds or reasons given by the district court for arriving at the sentence that it imposed. I noted that in _Chua Mei Chern_, the offence involved six victims and the profit earned was $7,835.40. The number of victims and the profit obtained were significantly much lower than in the present case. The period of offence was also half that of the present case; about seven months.

58     However, there were other factors that made _Chua Mei Chern_ more egregious than the present case. The six victims, all Philippines nationals, had come to Singapore at their own expense in reliance of the offender’s representations. However, she could only secure employment for one of them. The other five were left stranded and in the lurch in a foreign country as they were unable to contact the offender or her assistant for updates or help. This was the very scenario envisaged by Parliament when it enhanced the penal sanctions for the s 6(1) EAA offence.

59     Further, the offender in _Chua Mei Chern_ was on the run from the police when she set up her employment agency, SSS. To avoid detection, she had used the Singpass of her ex-girlfriend, one Canny, to set up the agency. She convinced Canny to open a UOB cashplus account to facilitate her employment related activities. She also set up a website and printed name cards to advertise and promote her employment agency services. She had also employed a Filipino named Jeraldine to work as her assistance to recruit jobseekers. Interestingly, Jeraldine had agreed to work for her because the offender had cheated her relatives of $10,000 and had refused to return the money. The offender’s overall conduct showed a high degree of brazenness, recalcitrance and contempt for the law.

60     In the Accused’s case, I noted that there were 755 victims. But in so far as the evidence go, only 14 were proven to have been unsuccessful in securing jobs. There was also no evidence to suggest that the Accused’s online resume distribution service was a sham. There was no evidence that the foreign jobseekers had been lured into incurring hefty expenses to come to Singapore by the Accused and then left in the lurch. For these reasons, I was of the opinion that the present case was less egregious than _Chua Mei Chern_. All considered, I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $80,000 in default two months’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

61     The Accused has lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. The prosecution has also appealed against the sentence. The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal. The sentences of imprisonment and fine were stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.
