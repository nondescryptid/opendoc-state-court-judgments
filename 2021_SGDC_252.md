### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Muhammad Haiman Bin Samad (“Haiman”) had sexual intercourse with a young female aged 14 (“V”). Approximately one week prior to this, Haiman had penetrated the mouth of V with his penis.

2       These penetrative acts amounted to offences pursuant to section 376A(1)(a) of the Penal Code (“PC”), punishable under section 376A(2) of the PC. These acts would be offences regardless of whether V had consented to them or not, as she was under the age of 16. The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with a fine or with both imprisonment and a fine. There is in force, a Gag Order prohibiting the publication or dissemination of any information that may lead to the identification of V.

3       Haiman pleaded guilty before me to one charge under s 376A(1)(a) for the (later) incident involving the penile-vaginal penetration. He admitted to another charge involving the (earlier) act of penile-oral penetration, and consented to this charge being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (the “TIC charge”).

4       The Prosecution sought an imprisonment sentence of 15 months. In the Mitigation Plea (“Mitigation”), the Defence initially submitted that the sentence should be 12 months’ imprisonment. At the hearing before me, the Defence changed their stance and submitted that the sentence ought to be imprisonment for a term of 10 months. After considering the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, I sentenced Haiman to imprisonment for a term of 14 months. Haiman appealed. Haiman is currently serving his sentence.

5       The following narration of the pertinent facts is taken or adapted from the Statement of Facts (“SOF”), to which Haiman admitted without any qualification.

6       On 3 January 2019, V had lodged a police report stating that she had sexual intercourse when she was 13 years of age. Investigations revealed that V had had sexual intercourse with about five males, one of whom was Haiman. Haiman had performed the two penetrative acts on V when V was 14 years of age.

7       V started using WeChat sometime after August 2017 and became acquainted with Haiman sometime in January 2018. In WeChat, Haiman used a moniker, “Raddddy”. Haiman and V started chatting and their conversations later took on a sexual nature. As the conversations progressed, Haiman asked V if she wanted to have sex with him, and she agreed.

8       Haiman and V first met in person sometime in January 2018 at a staircase landing at an HDB block near where V resided. Haiman asked V if she could suck his penis. V agreed. Haiman penetrated V’s mouth with his penis. Haiman later ejaculated on the floor.

9       About a week after the fellatio episode, Haiman asked V if she would like to meet him again. V agreed, knowing that the meeting was for a sexual purpose. This second meeting was also in January 2018. Haiman and V arranged to meet after V’s school hours. V went home to change into home clothes, prior to meeting Haiman. The two of them met and walked to an HDB block somewhere in the west of Singapore.

10     Haiman and V went to a staircase landing at the HDB block and started to chat. After a while, Haiman stood up and asked V if she wanted to suck his penis. V then pulled Haiman’s pants and underwear down to the level of his knees and started to suck his penis. Sometime later, Haiman asked V to stop sucking his penis. Haiman told V to take off her shorts and panties. V complied: she sat on one of the steps at the staircase landing. V then took off her shorts and panties.

11     Haiman then went on top of V and penetrated V’s vagina with his penis, with her consent. Haiman was not wearing a condom at this time. Haiman pulled his penis out from V’s vagina and ejaculated on the floor. Haiman and V then got dressed and chatted for a while before leaving the location. They continued chatting on WeChat for a few days before ceasing contact.

12     From a perusal of the SOF and the Charges, a few points bear noting at this point. Haiman had committed the offences in the month he turned 26. V was a young female aged 14 (well below the age of 16 stipulated in s 376A(1)(a)). There was a significant age gap between the two of them. Haiman was an adult in his mid-twenties, and V was a female of 14 years of age, well below the stated age of 16.

13     Haiman had become acquainted with V through WeChat. I did not hold this against Haiman as there was insufficient evidence to suggest that he had “trawled the Internet” deliberately looking for underaged victims. It is noted that he had used a moniker “Raddddy”, although again this would not necessarily be held against him, given that it is not uncommon for such users to similarly use monikers. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that Haiman was deliberately making himself anonymous to the extent that his identity would have been difficult to detect.

14     What has to be emphasised is that Haiman did not appear to have tried to discover V’s age. In the Mitigation, it was candidly stated that Haiman was unaware of V’s age (at the time of the offences) and only learnt of V’s age in the midst of police investigations against him. In the Mitigation, it is stated that V had “shared with (Haiman) her past sexual experiences with her current and then boyfriends”, leading to the assertion by the Defence that “it was reasonable for Haiman to assume that (V) was an adult since he believed that a minor would not have any sexual experiences”. It is difficult to see how Haiman could reasonably come to this conclusion. News stories of persons running afoul of the law when they engage in sexual activities with persons below the age of 16 are increasingly becoming more common. In any event, it was incumbent on Haiman’s part, to ensure that V was not underaged. He did not even bother to ask V her age, and apparently relied on the fact that age, as a subject, had not arisen in their conversations. Haiman had certainly acted rashly and recklessly, in this regard.

15     As to the sexual acts themselves, it was Haiman who had asked V “if she wanted to have sex with him”; V agreed. Haiman apparently made the “first move”. At their first meeting (in relation to the TIC charge), it was Haiman who had asked V “if she could help him suck his penis”.

16     In relation to the proceeded charge, it was Haiman who had asked V “if she would like to meet him again”. During this occasion, Haiman had asked V if she “wanted to suck his penis”. Whilst V was sucking his penis, Haiman then told her to stop and told her to take off her shorts and panties. After V did so, Haiman penetrated V’s vagina with his penis. Haiman did not use a condom.

17     On both occasions, Haiman had initiated the illegal sexual activity. When they had sexual intercourse (the penile-vaginal penetration), Haiman was not using a condom.

18     I carefully considered the mitigating factors in Haiman’s favour. Haiman impressed as a determined individual who continually sought to better himself, academically, in his employment, and as well on the charitable front.

19     At about the time Haiman committed the offences, he had been grappling with emotional issues brought about by his having problems with his then-girlfriend. As stated in \[15\] of the Mitigation, in order to “cope with all his emotional hurdles, Haiman turned to social applications such as Tinder and WeChat to distract himself and to receive some sort of validation through talking to new people”. This was how he ended up communicating with V. Being in the predicament Haiman found himself in did not give him licence to throw caution to the wind. He ought to have been careful in his dealings with strangers he met on such social “apps”. He ought to have been most circumspect when it came to a stranger’s age, especially in this case, where their interactions turned sexual.

20     As mitigating factors, the Defence sets out that there had not been any sexual grooming. Whilst I accepted that there was no clear evidence of sexual grooming, I did note (above) that Haiman appeared to be the initiator in the various sexual acts between the two. In any event, the absence of sexual grooming was a neutral factor, at best.

21     The Defence asserted that Haiman’s having been unaware of V’s age was a mitigating factor. I could not agree with this assertion. As stated above, Haiman’s behaviour on this point had been reckless and rash, in the circumstances. As it appeared that Haiman had chosen to initiate the sexual acts, it was incumbent on him to ensure that V was not underaged. Committing these offences would be accompanied with a degree of a corrupting influence on V. It was for the sake of V and Haiman himself that he ensured that the offences were not committed: this he had failed to do. It was highly aggravating in the circumstances.

22     I accepted that the other aspects of Haiman’s life amounted to mitigating factors to be seen in his favour. Haiman had decided to turn his life around, and his otherwise good character and his numerous charitable works spoke volumes in showing a man whose creditable efforts and characteristics deserve some recognition. I also took into account that he was untraced and that his remorse could clearly be seen from his intention to plead guilty. I also accepted that there had not been an abuse of trust nor had there apparently been any coercion on Haiman’s part.

23     Against all this, we would have to consider the aggravating factors to be weighed against Haiman. Some of these have been set out in \[12\] to \[17\] above. It also has to be borne in mind that there were two occasions of sexual penetrative activity: the earlier penile-oral penetration (the TIC charge) and the later penile-vaginal penetration. These had occurred on two distinct occasions. How this will be factored into sentencing will be discussed later.

24     Whilst the remorse of Haiman for these offences has been clearly demonstrated, the degree of remorse was somewhat attenuated by assertions made in \[112\] and \[141f\] of the Mitigation. In \[112\], it was asserted that “there (was) no evidence that (V) had suffered an extensive degree of fear and emotional harm due to the offence”. It was further stated that, (referring to what appears to be a slightly different version of the SOF), Haiman was 26 years of age at the time of the offence, and that V had made a police report stating that she had had sexual intercourse “with her boyfriend”. From this, the Defence then concluded that “it is unlikely for (V) to have felt emotional distress from the offences”. This conclusion is repeated in \[141f\] where the Defence states, “While we do not wish to diminish the severity of his actions, we wish to highlight that it is unlikely for (V) to have felt emotional distress from the offences”.

25     There was certainly no basis for the Defence to come to this conclusion. It simply did not follow that since V appeared to have some experience sexually, therefore it may be concluded that she would not feel any emotional distress or suffer any emotional harm from the offences committed by Haiman. This callous attitude demonstrated in the Mitigation was discomfiting. It was for the protection of persons under 16, such as V, who would not have attained a sufficient degree of maturity, that s 376A(1) was enacted. This attitude of Haiman was an aggravating factor, in the circumstances. The potential for emotional harm was definitely present.

26     Unless there was clear evidence that V suffered no harm, it was not open to the Defence to suggest that V had not been harmed in this way. This section, s 376A(1), criminalises such penetrative acts, regardless of whether the victim (the person aged below 16) consented to the acts or not. The potential for such emotional or psychological harm (let alone physical harm) would be one of the evils which this section was enacted to protect against. That Haiman sought to trivialise the potential harm arising from his criminal acts against V ought to be held against him.

27     With regard to sentencing, both the Prosecution and the Defence cited the case of _Yap Lee Kok v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 78</span> (“_Yap Lee Kok_”) in which Vincent Hoong J indicated at \[24\] that the “starting position” for an offence of penile-vaginal penetration under s 376A “should be in the region of 14 – 16 months’ imprisonment”. The case of _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> (“AQW”) was cited in \[24\] of _Yap Lee Kok_ as having held that “the starting point for an offence under s 376A of the Penal Code involving penile-oral penetration of a minor who is 14 years old or above, and absent any pressure or abuse of trust, is ten to 12 months’ imprisonment”.

28     It was held in \[24\] of _Yap Lee Kok_ that as “penile-vaginal penetration is a graver violation than penile-oral penetration” (citing _Pram Nair v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> at \[152\]; and _BPH v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 764</span> at \[62\]), the starting point for penile-vaginal penetration had to be set higher than the ten to 12 months’ imprisonment as a starting point for penile-oral penetration that was set in _AQW_. Thus, the starting point for the offence herein of penile-vaginal penetration was 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment.

29     The Prosecution had prior to the hearing tendered a brief written submission on sentence, citing _Yap Lee Kok_. The Prosecution had also cited three district court cases in which sentences ranging from ten to 12 months’ imprisonment had been imposed for offences involving penile-vaginal penetration. I did not find these three district court cases useful as they were all apparently decided before the High Court case of _Yap Lee Kok_.

30     The Prosecution urged the Court to impose a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution cited the fact that Haiman had not used a condom when he had sexual intercourse with V. The Prosecution also drew attention to the TIC charge. The offence of penile-oral penetration would warrant consideration of a sentence with a starting point of ten to 12 months (as per _AQW_) if this charge was proceeded with. It was pointed out that the two offences had occurred on different occasions and were not part of the same transaction. (In fact, it should be pointed out that on the second occasion, Haiman had penetrated both the mouth and the vagina of V, although there was no separate charge for this second occasion of fellatio.)

31     With a starting point of 14 months (the lower end of the starting position for penile-vaginal penetration as set out in _Yap Lee Kok_), the Prosecution sought an uplift of one month for the TIC charge, to arrive at their final submission of 15 months. I found that the Prosecution’s submission in this regard to be sound and reasonable, at first blush.

32     As stated in \[4\] above, the Defence in the Mitigation (tendered before the hearing) had submitted that the sentence ought to be imprisonment for 12 months. At the hearing, the Defence changed its position. After having had sight of the Prosecution’s brief written submission (which made reference to the aforesaid district court cases which had meted out sentences ranging from ten to 12 months’ imprisonment), the Defence then changed their sentencing position to one of seeking imprisonment of ten months. As stated in \[29\] above, I did not find these district court cases to be useful. Quite clearly, we would have to consider the “starting point” range as set out in _Yap Lee Kok_.

33     I was of the view that the starting point in the present case should be set at the low end of the range set out in _Yap Lee Kok_, hence at 14 months. I found that an uplift of one month as urged by the Prosecution to take into account the TIC charge was not unreasonable. We would thus arrive at the 15 months mark as submitted by the Prosecution. A submission of ten months by the Defence would mean a “discount” (downward variation) of five months; the original Defence submission of 12 months would mean a “discount” of three months.

34     The Defence had also cited six district court cases in the Mitigation. Again, I did not find these cases useful as they were all apparently decided before _Yap Lee Kok_.

35     The material aggravating factors and mitigating factors have been set out above. Haiman had not used a condom during the sexual intercourse: the risks of pregnancy and of possible transmission of infection cannot be ignored. In the final analysis, the downward variation sought by the Defence (five months) could not be supported. Neither would a downward variation of three months (based on the original position of 12 months’ imprisonment) be supported, in the circumstances.

36     After a careful consideration of all the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors, I was of the view that a downward variation of one month from the indicative starting point (of 15 months) in this case was appropriate. Haiman was thus sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 14 months. A term of 14 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in all the circumstances to reflect Haiman’s culpability and the harm caused, and bearing in mind the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors set out above. That there was a TIC charge for another criminal act committed on a separate occasion had to be factored in as well.
