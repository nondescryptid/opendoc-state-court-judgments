28 February 2020

### District Judge Jasbendar Kaur:

The Accused in this case is Davison Tan Kay Yong, a 51-year old Singaporean. He was charged under section 70(4)(a) read with section 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276) for failing to give a breath specimen for analysis by means of a Breath Evidential Analyser Device when he did not have a reasonable excuse. He claimed trial to the charge and chose to remain silent when his defence was called. After considering the Prosecution’s evidence and submissions, I acquitted the Accused as I found that the Prosecution failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. These grounds are issued as an appeal has been filed against the acquittal.

## Screening Breath Test and Arrest at the Scene

2       On 12 April 2018 at about 3.08 am, Ground Response Force officers, Sergeant (3) Sukumaran s/o Sivandarajoo (PW 1) and Inspector Cheong Wei Chieh Jerral (PW 2) were patrolling on foot in connection to another reported incident at Block 282A Toh Guan Road, a multi-storey car park (MSCP), when they spotted the accused sleeping inside his vehicle GBA 1218D (a motor van) in car park lot number 278 at Deck 4B. The vehicle’s engine was still running and the Accused was sleeping in the driver’s seat. The patrol officers approached the Accused’s van and they knocked on the window a few times to check on him. The Accused woke up and he acknowledged the officers by waving his hand at them. As the officers walked away, the Accused drove off from the parking lot, travelling against the flow of traffic. When he attempted to proceed to the lower level using the ramp that was intended for up-going traffic, his vehicle mounted the kerb and hit a pillar/wall on the left side of his van.

3       The patrol officers rushed forward to check on the Accused and upon reaching the van, they instructed the Accused to switch off the engine and to alight from his van. When the Accused had alighted, the officers noticed that he was trembling and that he “smelt strongly of alcohol”[^1]. When questioned, the Accused admitted that he had consumed alcohol earlier[^2] and that he had driven and parked at car park lot number 278 at about 2.30 pm to rest. The officers, thereafter, informed him that he has to undergo a breathalyser test.

4       Before conducting the test, the Accused was instructed on how he should blow into the straw that was attached to the hand-held breathalyser device and that he had to continue blowing until he was told to stop. The Accused agreed to take the test and he was able to provide a proper specimen on his third attempt. As the result indicated red, the patrol officers filed a First information Report (Exhibit P1) that indicated the breathalyser test result and alerted the Duty Traffic Police Investigating Officer. The Accused was shown the result on the device and informed that he would be placed under arrest for drink driving. When the Traffic Police officer arrived at the scene, he was briefed by the patrol officers and after he had conducted his preliminary investigations, the patrol officers transported the Accused to Central Police Station at the Police Cantonment Complex where an arrest report (Exhibit P2) was lodged.

## Breathalyser Test under Section 70 RTA at Central Police Station

5       The breathalyser test that is the subject matter of the charge was conducted at Central Police Station between 4.43 am and 4.53 am. This test was conducted by Sergeant Ting Hai Chiang Paul (PW 4), a trained Breath Evidential Analyser Device operator in the testing room known as the “BEA Room” with the Breath Evidential Analyser Device (“BEA Device”) Drager Alcotest 9510 SG. PW 4 interviewed the Accused before administering the test, during which the Accused admitted that he had consumed alcohol at a pub from 8.30 pm to 2.00 am and that thereafter, he had driven from Bukit Batok to Toh Guan Road. This admission was recorded in the electronic Station Diary and the relevant extract from this diary was admitted as Exhibit P6. PW 4 had also recorded in the electronic Station Diary that the Accused “smelt strongly of alcohol”[^3] during the interview. The Accused did not object to PW 4’s evidence and the admission of Exhibit P6.

6       In total, the Accused made two attempts to provide his breath specimen in two test cycles. The procedure used by PW 4 for the breathalyser test and his observations were documented in the electronic Station Diary. Based on the entries timed at 4.38 am and 4.43 am in Exhibit P6 and PW4’s evidence in court, we can discern that the following took place during the two test cycles:

> ·    PW 4 had informed the Accused during the interview that he had to undergo a breathalyser test.

> ·    The BEA Device was in good working condition as PW 4 had run a test to ensure this before his shift started at 8.00 pm on 11 April 2018 and it had undergone the regular monthly servicing in March and April 2018 \[see Exhibit P7\].

> ·    Before conducting the test, PW 4 had confirmed that the Accused did not suffer from any medical condition that could prevent him from providing a breath sample.

> ·    PW 4 had done a demonstration on how to provide a breath sample by “cupping his mouth over the mouthpiece, and, uh, blowing into it.”[^4]

> ·    The Accused was warned on the consequences of failing to provide a breath specimen.

> ·    PW 4 keyed in the Accused personal particulars, which were confirmed by the Accused.

> ·    The test commenced when the mouthpiece was handed to the Accused to blow to provide his breath specimen.

7       The first test cycle (Test Number 409) started at 4.43 am and it ended at 4.47 am. The test was terminated by the BEA Device after the Accused had blown for 1.3 seconds and it registered a “Mouth Alcohol result - See Exhibit P4. According to PW 4, he had observed the Accused “deliberately blow the air through gaps between his mouth and the mouth piece” during the test.

8       The Accused asked for a second opportunity and before the second test cycle was commenced, the device purged itself and the Accused was warned again of the consequences of failing to provide a breath specimen. The second test (Test Number 410) started at 4.49 am and it ended at 4.53 am. The test was terminated by the BEA Device after the Accused had blown for 1.8 seconds and again, a “Mouth Alcohol” result was registered - See Exhibit P5. PW 4 stated that the Accused “stopped providing his breath halfway resulting in mouth alcohol again and the test was stopped.” The Accused was then informed that he will not be allowed another opportunity and he was invited to sign on all the printed BEA Device result slips (2 sets). The Accused signed accordingly and he was given a set of the print-outs showing the readings.

## The question for decision

9       Section 70(4) provides that it is an offence not to provide a breath specimen, without reasonable excuse, when required to do so after being arrested for driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle or being in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or any public place while under the influence of drink, unless there are medical reasons or if it is reasonably impractical to conduct the test. In this case, the Accused did attempt to provide his breath specimen and in fact, he made two attempts. What he did not manage to do was to provide a sufficient quantity of breath to enable the BEA Device to generate a result indicating the exact concentration of alcohol. To do this, he had to produce about 1.2 litres of air by inhaling deeply and blowing continuously for at least 3 to 5 seconds[^5], which he did not manage to do as the BEA Device had automatically terminated the first test cycle after 1.3 seconds and the second test cycle after 1.8 seconds upon detecting residual mouth alcohol.

10     Therefore, since the Accused did attempt to provide a breath specimen, the question that I had to consider was whether the Accused had failed in his obligation under section 72(2) of the RTA to provide a sufficient specimen of breath to enable the test to be carried out and to provide it in the manner that enabled the objective of the breath test to be satisfactorily achieved and if so, whether he had a reasonable excuse for failing to so this.

## Prosecution’s Theory of Guilt

11     According to the Prosecution, the Accused had contravened section 70(4) of the RTA even though he had blown into the mouthpiece as he had failed to provide a breath specimen that met the objectives of section 72(2) of the RTA. Section 72(2) provides:

> S72(2)    A person is regarded as not providing a specimen of breath for a breath test unless the specimen —

>> (a)    is sufficient to enable the test to be carried out; and

>> (b)    is provided in a way that enables the objective of the test to be satisfactorily achieved.

12     Their argument was premised on two main points. First, the Prosecution argued that the Accused had deliberately not provided an adequate breath specimen when he was blowing through the mouthpiece. This was based on the observations of PW 4 who stated that the Accused did not produce deep-lung air (alveolar air) when giving his breath specimens, he had let his breath escape at the side of the mouthpiece when blowing during first test cycle and he had not blown continuously during second test cycle. According to PW 4, the Accused was not “giving his best during these attempts”[^6]:

> “The accused was in a reasonable condition to provide his breath specimen, and was able to produce a sufficient breath specimen for the handheld breathalyser test administered at the scene at deck 4B of Blk 282A Toh Guan Road Multi-Storey Carpark…Since the accused could blow into the handheld breathalyser set at the MSCP, the accused should have been physically capable of providing an adequate breath specimen for the prescribed breath alcohol device tests less than 2 hours later at Central Police Division. If the accused was capable of giving a sufficient breath specimen, but did not, the necessary inference was that he had not tried his best, and had therefore no reasonable excuse under section 70(4)(a) RTA.”[^7]

13     Second, they argued that the termination by the BEA Device due to the presence of alcohol was attributable to the manner in which the Accused was blowing to avoid producing the minimum breath volume for the breath test. They had also argued that the Court should draw an adverse inference under section 291(3)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code against the Accused for his refusal to testify when his defence was called.

## Accused’s Defence

14     The Accused chose to remain silent when his defence was called but when he was asked to indicate his defence at the start of the trial, he stated that he had cooperated “100%” during the test at Central Police Division and suggested that the testing equipment may have been faulty as it failed to issue a quantitative result when he had consumed alcohol that evening[^8].

## Significance of “Mouth Alcohol” Result and Termination of the Tests

15     As the two test cycles were terminated when alcohol in the mouth was detected, we have to understand why the BEA Device, Drager Alcotest 9510 SG terminated the test when it detected the presence of mouth alcohol.

16     According to PW 5, the BEA Device is configured to terminate the test when it registers the presence of mouth alcohol, usually upon the detection of a rapid peak in ethanol concentration, when the subject who is being tested is blowing through the mouthpiece. The test will be invalidated as the residual alcohol in the mouth may falsely elevate the blood alcohol content level in the body and produce an inaccurate reading[^9].

17     Based on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, mouth alcohol may be detected during a BEA test in the following situations:

> (i)     If a subject had consumed any food or drink or had used a product like a breath freshener or a mouthwash that has alcohol content about 15 to 25 minutes[^10] prior to the test and a short delay to allow the alcohol to dissipate is not observed; and

> (ii)     If the subject has been in custody for more than an hour and had not consumed or used anything with alcohol content while in custody, mouth alcohol may be detected if it is re-introduced by;

>> a.       the subject causing a build-up in the mouth by not blowing consistently and/or by trapping his breath in the mouth during the test; or

>> b.       the subject burping, vomiting, coughing or suffering indigestion 20 to 25 minutes before or during the test – “…as long as there’s air coming back to the mouth.”[^11]

18     As the Accused in this case had been in police custody for more than one hour before the BEA tests and he had not consumed anything after his arrest, it was likely that the mouth alcohol was re-introduced shortly before or during the test. Therefore, what I had to consider was how and when the mouth alcohol was re-introduced that caused the tests to be terminated and whether the mouth alcohol was re-introduced because of Accused’s deliberate act of not providing a proper breath specimen.

## Decision

19     Having considered the evidence in totality, I found that the Prosecution failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, I also found that it was likely that the test during the second test cycle was not conducted in a manner that enabled the objective of the breathalyser test under the RTA to be satisfactorily achieved. I will now explain my reasons for these findings.

##### Findings in relation to the First Test

20     The first test was terminated after the Accused had blown into the mouthpiece for 1.3 seconds when a “discrepancy”, the presence of mouth alcohol, was detected. When PW 4 was asked to describe what he had observed during the first test, he stated that the Accused “deliberately blew air through gaps in the mouth that is covering the mouthpiece”:

> A:    So, uh, the---in his first attempt, it was noted that , uh, that Mr Tan had deliberately blew air through gaps in the mouth that is covering the mouthpiece[^12].

> …That would be correct, Your Honour, but the thing is that it was also the observation of how he has provided his breath sample whereby he---it was observed that he has purposely blew air out with, uh, from the gaps between his mouth because I was holding on to the hose and I could feel that the breath was blowing onto my hand.[^13]

21     What is important is that PW 4 insisted that the Accused had not complied with his instructions as he was “trying ---to get out of actually, uh, having the machine run the test successfully” :

> “Uh, my assessment was that he was not complying with the instructions fully, uh, that he was, uh, trying---to get out from actually, uh, having the machine run the test successfully, lah. Because, uh, he did not cover the mouth---uh, cover ---he did not cover his mouth fully over the mouthpiece. And that he stopped just halfway through on his second attempt.”[^14]

22     In relation to the presence of mouth alcohol, PW 4 first suggested that the “discrepancy” occurred because the Accused had deliberately let the air to escape:

> “Whereby he was supposed to be covering the entire mouthpiece. And the, um, machine also pick up that there was some, uh, discrepancy and it came out with this result, called a mouth alcohol and the test stopped.”[^15]

He later suggested that the test could have been terminated if the Accused had purposely caused a build-up of air inside the mouth by trapping his breath in his mouth instead of blowing consistently. He further stated that this would usually occur when a subject is trying to “so-called play punk” by trapping air in his mouth:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

So it would not make a difference whether you give a better breath, when you already have mouth alcohol or it does make a difference, you will get a proper reading?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Um, this is only my guess but it could have been the situation whereby the subject is building up air within his mouth and not blowing at a rate fast enough. Then, um, whereby the machine picks up and interpret it as there is, um, some residue of alcohol in the mouth, which is ---uh, which is going to affect the result itself, thereby it terminates it. Because if you are consistently blowing, uh, into the mouthpiece, there would not be a build-up of air inside. So when, uh, subject is trying to, uh, so-called play punk then sometimes they may just give you an impression that his mouth is full and he is making an effort, you can see that the both cheeks are all puffed up. And that it could be a situation whereby there’s just air trap inside his mouth.” [^16]

 |

  
  

23     In light of PW 4’s observations, I had to consider whether the Accused had deliberately let the air escape when he was blowing into the mouthpiece _“_to get out from actually, uh, having the machine run the test successfully” and whether he had tried to “so-called play punk by trapping air in his mouth”.

24      _First question: Did the Accused “purposely” let the air escape when he was blowing into the mouthpiece “to get out from actually, uh, having the machine run the test successfully_”? : There was, in my view, insufficient evidence to make the inference that the Accused had allowed his breath to escape in order to avoid providing a breath specimen that could have given a reliable indication on the alcohol in his blood. This was because PW 4’s assessment was based on a brief, almost blink of an eye observation. While I accept that PW 4’s assessment was not entirely based on this short observation as he had interacted with the Accused for over an hour prior to the test, the fact remained that the adverse observation was formed after he felt the air escaping for less than two seconds. Basically, the observation period was simply too short for PW 4 to have made a reliable and firm assessment.

25     Further, there was no evidence to infer that the escaping air had generated the trace amounts of alcohol that caused the test to be aborted and this was confirmed by PW 4’s evidence when he stated that he could not explain why ‘mouth alcohol” was registered during the first test[^17]. Therefore, I was compelled to find that the escaping air had no bearing on the termination of the first test.

26     In any event, the almost immediate termination of the test at 1.3 seconds suggested that the trace amounts of the alcohol were already present in the Accused’s mouth when the test commenced at 4.43 am. This meant that I could not discount the fact that the alcohol in the mouth could have been caused by a natural bodily function like burping, coughing or acid reflux. If these normal involuntary bodily reflex actions had caused the “discrepancy” that terminated the first test, it cannot said that the Accused’s had “deliberately” done something in order to avoid providing a breath specimen that terminated the test.

27     There was some suggestion by PW 5 that the “mouth alcohol” result was caused by the Accused failing to produce deep-lung air as per the instructions:

> “So the machine, uh, does not detect deep le---the deep lung air and then, a person generally takes, uh, uh, just a mouth full of air in--- in his mouth and he blows out that stagnant, uh, air specimen in the mouth. So after some time the machine may detect that it is mouth alcohol.[^18]”

28     I gave little or no weight to this suggestion. First, it was unlikely that the Accused could have trapped his breath in his mouth and retain it until it became “stagnant” within the short period of 1.3 seconds. Second, it would not be reasonable to expect all subjects undergoing a breath test to be able to correctly produce deep-lung air in the first second on their first attempt. This must be why the Police allow subjects undergoing the breath test five attempts in one test cycle to provide a proper breath specimen[^19].

29      _Second question: Did the Accused try to “so-called play punk by trapping air in his mouth_ ”: I found that there was no evidence to suggest that the Accused had tried to “play punk” during the first or second test cycle. In fact, when PW 4 was asked if he had seen the Accused tapping air in his mouth to give the impression that he was making an effort, he stated that he had not observed this - “Uh, no it doesn’t ---it did not come to a situation whereby the whole cheek was puffed up.”[^20]

30     Based on the reasons stated above, I did not think that it would be fair to infer that the Accused was avoiding the breath test when he did not manage to blow properly the first time. All in all, I found that the Prosecution were unable to prove that the Accused had deliberately failed to provide a breath specimen during the first test cycle in order to hinder or obstruct the testing process.

##### Findings in relation to the Second Test

31     The second test was terminated by the BEA Device within 1.8 seconds due to the presence of mouth alcohol as well. According to the Prosecution, the “mouth alcohol” result was registered because the Accused had stopped blowing before being told to stop. PW 4 observed that the Accused was not able to provide a proper breath specimen as he was not “genuinely trying” and it was for this reason that he had decided not to give him another opportunity after the second test was terminated[^21]. PW 4 explained that he formed the opinion that the Accused was not genuine because of the low blowing volume and the blowing duration:

> A:    …But in this case when I see that the um, blowing volume and the blowing time is only at 0.5 as well as the duration is rather short, So that is why I draw ---I ---I draw the, um, conclusion that he was not ge---genuinely trying his best.

> Q:    So, Sergeant Ting, your assessment of this subject not being genuine is based---and one of the main factors would be based on what you said earlier was the blowing time and the blowing volume, am I right?

> A:    That would be correct. [^22]

32     As PW 4’s observation was over 1.8 seconds, I had to consider whether he had sufficient time to make a reliable assessment and find that the Accused was not making a “genuine” attempt when he provided his breath specimen. In addition, as the first test had indicated the presence of alcohol in his mouth, I had to consider if the second test should have been administered immediately after the first test.

33     In relation to first issue, PW 4’s assessment that the Accused had not made a “genuine” attempt to provide a proper breath specimen was based on his observation of less than 2 seconds. Similar to my earlier findings, this observation period was simply too short to make a reliable assessment and to do so based on a single breath lasting 1.8 seconds. In any event, the act of not blowing consistently would not in the normal course cause the BEA Device to terminate the test and PW 4 confirmed this when he stated that the BEA Device would have terminated the test even if the Accused had produced sufficient breath if there was mouth alcohol:

>   
| 

Court :

 | 

…Are you telling me that as long as not enough breath is actually given and the machine detects alcohol in the mouth, it will terminate itself?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

That is to what my un---my understanding of --- of it is.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

But if they provide enough breath it will not terminate the test?

 |
| 

A :

 | 

No, it would not.

 |
| 

Court :

 | 

Even though there’s alcohol in the mouth?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

No, if there’s alcohol in the mouth it would then the ---it will still terminate even though if there’s in the breath.

 |
| 

Court :

 | 

so even if he had blown for 8 to 12 seconds, it will ---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Mmm

 |
| 

Court :

 | 

terminate the test?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Um, to my understanding if blo—mo---mouth alcohol is detected it would terminate.[^23]

 |

  
  

34     The fact is that a subject would usually be allowed five attempts to provide a “sufficient specimen” and this would happen even when he is not blowing or is not able to blow properly. This means that the Accused would have been allowed to continue blowing after he had stopped if the second test was not terminated after 1.8 seconds[^24]. It would not, therefore, be fair to infer that the Accused had not made a genuine attempt after one failed attempt; especially when the obligation under section 72(2) of the RTA is to provide sufficient quantity of breath to enable the test to be carried out and not to provide sufficient breath on the first attempt.

35     The second issue concerned the appropriateness of the testing process where the second test was conducted two minutes after the first test. The question was whether there should have been some delay between the two tests after mouth alcohol was detected during the first test.

36     Based on the Prosecution’s evidence, residual alcohol can remain in the mouth for about 15 to 25 minutes before dissipating and this is why their protocol requires a delay of 20 to 30 minutes after the last drink before commencing a breath test for subjects who are arrested for drink driving. This is done to ensure that the presence of mouth alcohol does not cause a false high reading during the test. If observance of this delay is necessary at the start of the first test cycle, by necessary implication, it must follow that a similar delay ought to be observed at the start of the second test cycle to allow for any distorting influence to disappear or dissolve if a “mouth alcohol” result is registered during the first test. This means that PW 4 should not have commenced the second test after two minutes and he should have allowed for 15 to 25 minutes to elapse before commencing it.

37     The significance of this lapse is that the Accused would not have been able to provide a proper breath specimen even if he had done his best to inhale deeply and blow continuously and evenly into the mouthpiece. This was because the BEA Device would have also automatically aborted the second test due to the presence of mouth alcohol, the same mouth alcohol that was detected during the first test. Because of this, the Accused would not be allowed another opportunity to provide a breath specimen to enable the test to be carried out should he fail to provide sufficient quantity of breath on his first attempt[^25]. As this had in fact taken place during the second test cycle, I was compelled to find that the second test cycle was not administered in a manner that would have enabled the objective of the breath test under the RTA to be satisfactorily achieved and that consequently, the Accused was not able to satisfy the requirements of section 72(2) of the RTA to provide sufficient quantity of breath to enable the test to be carried out.

38     This raises the question of whether the terminations by the BEA Device during the two test cycles afforded the Accused the reasonable excuse defence as provided under section 70(4) of the RTA. In **Madiaalakan s/o Muthusamy** **_v_** **Public Prosecutor** \[2001\] 3 SLR (R) 580, the High Court had ruled that this defence is only open to those who have tried their best and are physically or mentally unable to provide a breath sample or if the testing process poses a substantial risk to their health_._ I was also aware that in **Lim Eng Guan Derek v PP** \[2004\] 1 SLR (R) 221, the High Court had stated that an accused cannot simply say that he did his best to rely on the reasonable excuse defence by making a bare assertion:

> 30    An accused is not entitled to circumvent s70 of the RTA by simply saying: “I tried my best, but I just couldn’t do it”. The question of whether an accused has tried his best is to be determined by the court: _Madiaalakan s/o Muthusamy v PP_. It must be based on a strict and meticulous examination of the facts. In the present case, the only evidence that Derek had tried his best was his own assertion that he had done so. Such a bare assertion could not establish a reasonable excuse under s70 of the RTA.

39     In this case, it was not a question of whether the Accused had tried his best to provide an adequate breath specimen as the tests were automatically aborted by the BEA Device as he was attempting to blow. He could not continue to blow during the first cycle and he was not allowed more attempts during the second cycle as the tests were aborted. This forced cessation, in my view, afforded him the reasonable excuse defence as he was “physically” unable to provide an adequate breath as per his obligation under section 72(2) of the RTA.

## Should any adverse inference be drawn

40     I will now deal with the Prosecution’s submission that the Court should draw an adverse inference under section 291(3)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”) against the Accused for not taking the stand to give his defence as the evidence “warranted an explanation from him, rather than the bare assertions he gave during questioning that he was cooperative.” – see Paragraph 24 of their Closing Submissions (Exhibit P8):

> :...The evidence raised had already cast serious doubts on the accused’s allegations, and therefore warranted an explanation from him, rather than the bare assertions he gave during questioning that he was cooperative. This is a case where “evidence which has been given calls for an explanation which the accused alone can give, then silence on his part may lead to the inference that none is available and that the evidence is probably true” (Took Leng How at \[43\]). Thus, in the absence of any explanation, we urge this Court to draw the inference that the accused was able to provide a proper breath specimen on 12 April 2018, and deliberately chose not to provide a breath specimen to PW4 without reasonable excuse.

41     Section 291(3)(a) of the CPC provides that the Court may “draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper” if an accused who has been called on by the court to give evidence refuses to do so under oath or affirmation “in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence”. What is important is that case law tells us that it is not necessary to draw an adverse inference in every case where an accused elects to remain silent and that court should only do so in appropriate circumstances and this “is a question to be decided by applying ordinary common sense” – **Haw Tua Tau v PP** \[1981-1982\] (R) 133 at paragraph 21. When considering the Prosecution’s application, I also bore in mind the guidelines as provided by the High Court in **PP v Kong Hoo (Pte) Ltd and another appeal** <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 421</span> on when it would be appropriate to draw an adverse inference under the section 291(3):

> 53    Section 291(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) provides that if an accused has been called on by the court to give evidence but refuses to do so under oath or on affirmation, the court, “in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper”. In _Haw Tua Tau_ (\[4\] _supra_), the Privy Council opined that the proper inferences to be drawn would “depend on the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary principles” (at \[21\]). The following guiding propositions can be distilled from the authorities:

>> (a)    An adverse inference would properly be drawn where the “facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give” (see the decision of the House of Lords in _Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 WLR 1</span> at 11, _per_ Lord Slynn, cited with approval by the Singapore Court of Appeal in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[82\]).

>> (b)    An adverse inference may justifiably be drawn where the circumstantial evidence is such as to demand that the accused proffer some explanation, even if the objective evidence does not itself establish guilt (see _Oh Laye Koh_ (\[5\] _supra_) at \[15\]).

>> (c)    In appropriate cases, the proper inference to be drawn is that of guilt itself (see the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in _Took Leng How v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 70</span> (“_Took Leng How_”) at \[42\]). In other cases, an adverse inference is an “additional factor to consider in assessing whether the appellant’s guilt had been established beyond reasonable doubt” which can lend weight to an assessment of the accused’s culpability and, when considered cumulatively with the other evidence, be sufficient to establish guilt (see _Oh Laye Koh_ at \[17\]).

>> (d)    An adverse inference cannot be drawn solely for the purpose of bolstering a weak case; there must be basis for a drawing of an inference and it “cannot fill in any gaps in the prosecution’s case; it cannot be used as a make-weight (see _Took Leng How_ at \[43\], citing the decision of the High Court of Australia in _Weissensteiner v R_ (1993) 178 CLR 217).

>> (e)    An adverse inference cannot be drawn if it appears to the court that the accused’s “physical or mental condition makes it undesirable for him to be called on to give evidence” (see s 291(6) of the CPC).

42     Applying these guiding principles, I decided that it would not be appropriate for me to draw an adverse inference for the following reasons:

> (i)     the evidence adduced by the Prosecution did not call for an explanation from the Accused on why he was not able to produce a proper breath specimen as the two tests were automatically terminated by the BEA Device due to the detection of mouth alcohol and it was not conclusive that this was caused by the manner in which the Accused was blowing; allegedly, to avoid producing the minimum breath volume for the breath test;

> (iii)     it was not appropriate to draw an adverse inference when the Prosecution did not manage to prove that the testing process during the second test cycle was properly administered; and

> (ii)     it was not appropriate to draw an adverse inference if it is done to fill gaps in the Prosecution’s case to “bolster a weak case” – In **Took Leng How v PP** <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 70</span> at paragraph 43, the Court of Appeal stated that it would be a grave error to draw an adverse inference “if such an inference were used solely to bolster a weak case”.

## Conclusion

43     When assessing the evidence in this case to ascertain if the Accused had failed to provide a breath specimen without reasonable excuse, I bore in mind that it was the Prosecution’s burden to prove the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I was left in doubt as to the Prosecution’s case against the Accused for the following reasons:

> (i)     the Accused did not refuse to provide a breath specimen and he was blowing into the mouthpiece during the two test cycles when the tests were terminated by the BEA Device;

> (ii)     the tests would have terminated even if the Accused had not allowed the air to escape during the first test cycle or if he had blown continuously during the second test cycle;

> (iii)     there was no evidence to infer that the Accused had intentionally done anything to cause a build-up of his breath in his mouth that re-introduced alcohol in his mouth;

> (iv)     the observation periods for both test cycles were too short for PW 4 to have made any conclusive and reliable observations;

> (v)     the Accused was not able to able to provide a sufficient breath specimen to enable the test to be carried out during the second test cycle because of the failure on the part of PW 4 to observe a short delay before commencing the second cycle to allow for the residual mouth alcohol to dissipate; and

> (vi)     it was not appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the Accused for electing to remain silent when his defence was called.

44     For the reasons stated above, I found that the Prosecution were not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused did not have reasonable excuse for failing to provide a sufficient breath specimen and accordingly, I acquitted the Accused on the charge DAC 921158/2018.
