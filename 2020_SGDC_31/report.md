### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The accused person in this case, Hossan Billal (“the Accused”), is a Bangladeshi national. He was charged with one count under s 15(3A) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A) (“the Act”). Midway through his trial, he travelled to Bangladesh, after having obtained the court’s permission to leave the country.

2       The Accused had two colleagues (collectively referred to as “the Sureties”) who posted bail on his behalf:

> (a)     Low Geok Min, Adelin (“Adelin Low”), who posted the initial bond amount of $10,000 at the start of court proceedings against the Accused; and

> (b)     Thean Sow Foon, Wendy (“Wendy Thean”), who posted an additional bond amount of $10,000 as a condition for the Accused to travel to Bangladesh.

3       The Accused failed to return to Singapore, upon which the Sureties were directed to show cause as to why the bond amounts should not be forfeited.

4       After hearing the Sureties, I ordered forfeiture of the entire bond amounts. The Sureties, being dissatisfied with my decision, have appealed.

## Facts

5       On 25 July 2016, three Bangladeshi employees of Environmental Landscape Pte Ltd (“the Company”) descended into an underground storage tank to do cleaning. The storage tank contained flammable gas that ignited when one of the workers tried to turn on a halogen lamp within the tank. All three workers sustained burn injuries. Two of them suffered serious burns on extensive parts of their bodies, including the face.

6       Following the incident, the following parties were charged:

> (a)     The Company was charged with one count[^1] under s 12(1) of the Act for failing to take reasonable measures to ensure the safety and health of its employees.

> (b)     The Company’s Director, Wong Shang Ling (“Wong Shang”), was charged with one count[^2] under s 12(1) (read with s 48(1)) of the Act for failing to take reasonable measures to ensure the safety and health of the Company’s employees.

> (c)     The Accused was charged with one count[^3] under s 15(3A) of the Act for performing a negligent act which endangered the safety of his fellow employees.

#### How the Sureties came to post bail for the Accused

7       During the show cause hearing before me, Counsel for the Sureties explained[^4] that the Company was a one-man company, with the Director Wong Shang effectively being the same entity as the Company. Counsel informed that against this backdrop, the Prosecution had decided to:

> (a)     Proceed with the charge against the Company; and

> (b)     Release Wong Shang with a stern warning.

The Company pleaded guilty[^5] to the charge under s 12(1) of the Act and was fined[^6] $220,000. As for Wong Shang, the Prosecution sought a discharge amounting to an acquittal.[^7]

8       Meanwhile, the charge against the Accused remained. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused, being a senior employee of the Company, had directed the three Bangladeshi employees to descend into the underground tank when it was unsafe to do so. The Accused claimed trial to the charge.

9       Adelin Low, an administrative clerk with the Company,[^8] posted bail for the Accused in the sum of $10,000. Separately, the Company financed the expenses incurred for the Accused’s legal representation. In doing so, the Company gave instructions to the Accused’s defence lawyers.[^9]

10     The first tranche of the trial was heard on 22-26 July 2019, during which the witnesses who testified included the three Bangladeshi employees who had sustained burn injuries. The second tranche of the trial was scheduled to commence in February 2020, at which the Prosecution proposed to call its fire experts to testify.

11     In early August 2019 (_ie_, after conclusion of the first tranche of trial and prior to commencement of the second tranche), the Accused applied for permission to travel to Bangladesh to see his mother, whom he claimed was ill. On 3 September 2019, the learned District Judge at the Pre-Trial Conference Centre granted the Accused permission to travel to Bangladesh, from 7 September 2019 to 7 November 2019. The permission was subject to additional bail of $10,000 being posted.

12     Wendy Thean, a Business Development Officer with the Company,[^10] posted the additional bond amount of $10,000. This, coupled with the initial bond amount of $10,000 from Adelin Low (who did not object to the Accused’s request to leave the jurisdiction[^11]), brought the total bond amounts to $20,000.

13     On 4 September 2019, the Accused used Wendy Thean’s mobile phone to forward an image of his flight ticket to the Investigation Officer. According to the ticket, the Accused would fly to Bangladesh on 9 September 2019 and return to Singapore on 6 November 2019. In his message to the Investigation Officer, the Accused also provided his Bangladeshi contact details.[^12]

14     On 9 September 2019, the Accused flew to Bangladesh.

#### WhatsApp messages to and from the Accused while he was in Bangladesh

15     During the show cause hearing, Counsel tendered snapshots[^13] of WhatsApp messages captured on the Company’s mobile phone (“Company Phone”), to demonstrate the steps that taken to keep in contact with the Accused while the latter was overseas. The bulk of the messages sent to the Accused were from Wong Shang. As regards the rest of the messages sent to the Accused that had not been expressly signed off by Wong Shang, Counsel explained that it was not possible to confirm if they had been sent by Wong Shang or by some other employee (such as the Sureties). Given that Wong Shang brought the Company Phone home every evening,[^14] the messages sent from it at night would likely have been from Wong Shang, while the messages sent during office hours may or may not have been from him.[^15]

16     The WhatsApp messages sent from the Company Phone to the Accused, as well as those sent from him to the Company Phone, are extracted below:

> (a)     On 7 September 2019, _ie_, two days before flying off, the Accused sent a message to the Company Phone complaining of pain. Wong Shang replied to the Accused, advising him to take medication:[^16]

> (c)     Close to a week later, on 14 September 2019 (_ie_, well after the Accused was in Bangladesh), the Accused replied to say that he had reached home safely. Wong Shang had then asked him to send Wong Shang’s regards to the Accused’s family:17

> (e)     Thereafter, the communications from the Accused ceased for slightly over two weeks. On 18 October 2019, there were four attempts made on the Company Phone to call the Accused.[^19] However, these failed because the Accused had either switched off his phone or his village had no reception.[^20]

> (f)     Communications with the Accused resumed only on 19 October 2019, when Wong Shang successfully sent the Accused a message stating that he would call the Accused.[^21] The Accused acknowledged this message the next day, on 20 October 2019:[^22]

> (h)     The Accused had intimated in his message extracted immediately above that he wanted to call Wong Shang and speak to him. In response to this, there was a message from the Company Phone asking the Accused for the proposed time at which the Accused would call Wong Shang. However, the Accused failed to provide a reply to this.[^26] On 1 November 2019, at 8.32am, a message was sent from the Company Phone to the Accused, stating:[^27]

>>> “please call me tomorrow 10.00am”.

The Accused responded that same day to insist that he needed time to resolve the dispute. This time, the Accused indicated that he required his leave to be extended by _3 months_. Wong Shang responded that if such an extension was needed, the Accused would have to apply for it in the State Courts, failing which the court would fine Wong Shang again.

#### Actions taken when the Accused failed to return to Singapore

17     On 6 November 2019, _ie_, the date of the Accused’s flight back to Singapore, he failed to return. Wong Shang, who was supposed to pick the Accused from the airport, filed a police report that same afternoon. According to the police report, Wong Shang’s purpose in filing it was so that he could cancel the Accused’s work permit.[^31] That same evening, Adelin Low sent the Accused a text message from her phone, asking about his failure to return:[^32]

> Hi Billal, I found out that you did not arrive at airport yesterday[^33] when boss went to fetch you at 2.40pm. Please let me know when will you come back to Singapore. I need to know as I’m your bailor and will be liable if you don’t come back.

> Awaiting for your reply.

18     The next day, on 7 November 2019, Wendy Thean also sent the Accused a text message from her phone, voicing her concerns about his failure to return:[^34]

> Hi Billal, you have not returned to Singapore. Shang went to the airport yesterday and found you were really not on the flight. Now we understand you need more time. As your bailor, I have to answer for you and risk forfeit of bail money. If you need more time you could have informed. Now we try do what we can to extend your time, so please let me know how much more time you need. You are putting yourself in more trouble like this. Please let me know quick.

> Sister Wendy.

That same day, _ie_ on 7 November 2019, a message was sent from the Company Phone to the Accused, voicing disappointment at the Accused’s failure to return:

> Billal, I am very disappointed that you did not turn up at the Changi airport T1, This matter is now in the hands of State Courts and you have \[the rest of the message was truncated\]

19     On 9 November 2011, Wendy Thean filed a police report, stating that she and Adelin Low were sureties for the Accused and that he had failed to return.[^35] Even after the police report was filed, both Sureties continued to send messages to the Accused, persuading him to return. Counsel tendered snapshots of the WhatsApp messages from both their mobile phones, which I have set out below.

20     The last message from the Accused tendered by the Sureties was that sent on 25 November 2019, extracted immediately above, where he asked Adeline Low when he could come back.

## Parties’ Submissions

21     On 6 and 9 January 2020, the Sureties appeared before me to show cause as to why the bond amounts posted by them should not be forfeited.

#### Submissions by the Sureties

22     Counsel for the Sureties began by pointing out that in May 2018, when the Accused was still under investigations (but before he was charged[^38]), he had travelled to Bangladesh to get married. Thereafter, he still returned to Singapore[^39] (where he was subsequently charged).

23     Thereafter, the Sureties made sure that the Accused turned up for all his court events and meetings with defence counsel. They ensured that his work schedule allowed him to honour all of these engagements.[^40] Specifically:

> (a)     Wendy Thean shouldered the responsibility of ferrying the Accused to and from court. She even sat in at court proceedings and meetings with the Accused’s lawyers.[^41]

> (b)     Adelin Low organised the Accused’s work schedule in a manner that would allow him to attend all his court-related matters.[^42]

24     Counsel also highlighted that Wong Shang had a close relationship with the Accused. As seen from the WhatsApp messages between him and the Accused on 7 September 2019 (at paragraph 16(a) above), Wong Shang even addressed the Accused as “my son”.[^43] Counsel explained that Wong Shang had assisted the Sureties by leveraging on that closeness to entreat the Accused to honour his bail obligations.

25     Counsel submitted that if the court was still minded to order forfeiture despite the actions taken by the Sureties, their financial circumstances would militate against forfeiture of the full bond amounts.[^44] Specifically:

> (a)     Adelin Low is a 60-year-old widow who earns only $1,300 a month. She has to supplement her income with pay-outs from CPF Life as she does not have much savings. She also has to look after her 92-year-old father who is showing signs of dementia and may need to be admitted to a home. Her 35-year-old son is married and works as an insurance agent.[^45]

> (b)     Wendy Thean is 57 years of age and earns only 2,500 a month. She does not own a property and lives in rented accommodations, so much of her salary goes towards paying for rent. She too has little savings. She is not married and has no dependents but needs to care for her two dogs.[^46]

Given their respective situations, Counsel argued that forfeiture of the full bond amounts would cause undue financial hardship to both Sureties.[^47]

#### Prosecution’s submissions

26     The Prosecution submitted that the Sureties had failed to show sufficient cause against forfeiture. They failed to maintain daily communications with the Accused.[^48] There was also no evidence of the Sureties expending every effort to look for the Accused after he went missing.[^49] The Sureties sent the Accused text messages but, other than that, did nothing to locate the Accused and secure his attendance.[^50] Furthermore, the police report by Wendy Thean was lodged on 9 November 2019, _ie_, more than 24 hours after the last day on which the Accused was permitted to be out of Singapore.[^51] The police report also contained no useful information that would have assisted the authorities in tracing the Accused’s location.51

27     The Prosecution also submitted that were no exceptional circumstances to merit forfeiting anything less than the entire bond amounts.[^52] The Sureties’ financial situations did not justify deviating from the default position that the full bond amounts should be forfeited.[^53]

## Decision

28     Our courts have consistently stressed the gravity with which a surety’s obligations are regarded, re-iterating time and again that these obligations are of cardinal importance and carry serious legal consequences: see _Cher Ting Ting v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 13</span> (“_Cher Ting Ting_”) (at \[19\]).

29     Within statute, the duties of a surety are encapsulated in s 104(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68) (“CPC”), which states

> A surety must —

>> (a)    ensure that the released person surrenders to custody, or makes himself available for investigations or attends court on the day and at the time and place appointed for him to do so;

>> (b)    keep in daily communication with the released person and lodge a police report within 24 hours of losing contact with him; and

>> (c)    ensure that the released person is within Singapore unless the released person has been permitted by the police officer referred to in section 92 or 93 (as the case may be) or the court to leave Singapore.

As regards what the surety is expected to do to “ensure that the released person surrenders to custody … or attends court” (as required by subsection (a) above), this has been elaborated upon by case law.

30     In the relatively recent High Court case of _Cher Ting Ting_, Chan Seng Onn J provided an exposition of the law governing a surety’s obligations. In essence, the surety bears the burden of satisfying the court that sufficient cause against forfeiture exists. The surety discharges that burden by adducing sufficient evidence demonstrating want of culpability on his part.[^54] The court, in deciding whether to order forfeiture, then considers the matter in two stages:[^55]

> (a)     Stage 1: the court considers whether the surety has shown sufficient cause against forfeiture of the bond amount.

> (b)     Stage 2: If the surety has failed to show sufficient cause, the court will, in its discretion, determine the proportion of the bond amount to be forfeited.

31     I have proceeded in accordance with the two-stage framework above. In doing so, I find that the Sureties:

> (a)     failed to show sufficient cause against forfeiture; and

> (b)     failed to show why the court should forfeit anything less than the full bond amounts.

I give my reasons below.

#### Stage 1: Have the Sureties shown sufficient cause against forfeiture?

32     The key consideration in determining if sufficient cause against forfeiture exists is whether the surety exercised reasonable due diligence in discharging his duties.[^56]

33     While this is a highly fact-specific inquiry,[^57] one of the factors that the court often looks at (in ascertaining if due diligence was exercised) is whether the surety took the trouble to look for the accused person after losing touch with him. That this is an important responsibility of the surety is seen in the case of _Cher Ting Ting_, where Chan J held:[^58]

> … When the accused goes missing, passively waiting and hoping for the accused to return does not amount to compliance with a surety’s obligations … . It is relevant to consider **_whether the surety expended effort to look for the accused after the accused has gone missing_**. \[emphasis added\]

The same view was echoed in the earlier case of _Public Prosecutor v Ram Ghanshamdas Mahtani and another action_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 288</span> (“_Ram Ghanshamdas Mahtani_”), where Yong Pung How CJ held:[^59]

> Furthermore, **_the bailors had not satisfied me that they had expended every effort to search for \[the Accused\], when he did not return on the specified date_**. All that \[one of the bailors\] had done to search for \[Accused\] was to contact \[the Accused’s\] family in Singapore. \[emphasis added\]

34     The relevant question in the present case is whether the surety’s responsibility to look for the accused person (should the latter go missing) abates once the court allows the accused person to go overseas. Having examined the authorities, I am of the view that it does not.

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v An Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 182</span> (“_An Wei_”), the surety stood bail for his colleague, who was a Chinese national. Although the accused person’s passport was impounded, he still managed to abscond. In ordering forfeiture of the bond amount, the learned District Judge held (_inter alia_) that the surety failed to discharge his duty of due diligence. In arriving at this finding, one of the observations made by the District Judge was that:[^60]

>>> … no efforts were undertaken by the Surety to look for the accused after he was not contactable, apart from a visit to the accused’s apartment on the same day. **_The Surety did not try to go to China, where the accused was from, to look him_**. \[emphasis added\]

> (b)      _An Wei_ is not the only case where the court took account of whether the surety looked for the accused person in the foreign jurisdiction concerned. In _Sabri Bin Suboh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 57</span> (“_Sabri Bin Suboh_”), the accused person had absconded to Johor Bahru. His brother, who stood as surety, went to Johor Bahru and successfully brought the accused back to Singapore. The court thus exercised its discretion to refund part of the bond amount, holding as follows:[^61]

>>> Ordinarily this would have entailed a full forfeiture. However, \[the surety\] **_did something which was very significant. He went to Johor Bahru and brought his brother back_** who was eventually sentenced. Due weight must be given to this effort of his otherwise his brother would still have been at large. \[emphasis added\]

The High Court in _Cher Ting Ting_ had cited both _An Wei_[^62] and _Sabri Bin Suboh_[^63] in support of various propositions pertaining to the due diligence expected of a surety.

35     I am mindful that unlike in _An Wei_ and _Sabri Bin Suboh_, the Accused in the present case had express permission to travel (_ie_, rather than absconding _to_ the foreign jurisdiction, he absconded while he was legitimately _in_ the foreign jurisdiction). However, I did not think that this detracted from the Sureties’ responsibility to look for him in the foreign jurisdiction concerned. In fact, the onus on the Sureties to do so was arguably greater in this case than, say, in a situation where the accused person left Singapore illegally. In the latter, the surety might say that it was never within his contemplation that the accused person was going to end up being at large in the foreign jurisdiction concerned. In the present case, the Sureties _knew in advance_ that the Accused was heading to Bangladesh. Yet, they continued to post bail.

36     Counsel objected to the notion that sureties are expected to travel overseas to extricate the accused person. He argued that sureties who take matters into their own hands and try to forcibly bringing accused persons back to Singapore risk committing an offence in the foreign jurisdiction concerned.[^64] With respect, Counsel’s argument was misconceived. No one is suggesting that sureties must forcibly bring accused persons back from the foreign jurisdiction. However, at the very least, one would expect the surety to try and locate the accused person in the foreign jurisdiction concerned. Upon ascertaining where the accused person was, the surety could try to persuade him to return to Singapore. If that failed, the surety could relay the information pertaining to the accused person’s exact whereabouts to the authorities in Singapore, to facilitate cross-border enforcement efforts. I do not express any firm views on whether these steps, taken alone or in combination with one another, necessarily amount to sufficient due diligence. Nor do I venture to suggest whether the surety must personally travel to the foreign jurisdiction to take such steps, or whether he can do so by proxy (_eg_, by retaining counsel or engaging a private investigator in the country concerned). This is because what constitutes sufficient due diligence is a highly fact-specific exercise. As observed by Chan J in _Cher Ting Ting_:[^65]

> The determination of whether sufficient cause against forfeiture exists in each case is, of course, an intensely fact-specific inquiry. Accordingly, unless the factual matrices present striking similarities, a case-for-case comparison may therefore be of limited utility in providing guidance for ascertaining the appropriate outcome in a given case.

Suffice to say that in the present case, the Sureties undertook _no steps whatsoever_ to search for the Accused in Bangladesh (whether by proxy or otherwise).

37     Counsel’s position was that it was overly onerous to expect the Sureties to track the Accused down in Bangladesh. There are two responses to this:

> (a)     Firstly, as alluded to above, a surety is expected to look for the accused person after the latter goes missing. Whether the surety does so is a fundamental consideration to be taken into account when deciding if he exercised reasonable due diligence (see paragraph 33 above). In cases where the missing accused person remains within local shores, no one could seriously gainsay that the surety has this responsibility. To argue that the responsibility to look for the accused person suddenly evaporates once the accused person is allowed to travel overseas (during which the risk of flight is greater) gives rise to the perverse outcome where the standard of due diligence required of a surety is _lower_ in the face of a scenario where the flight risk is _higher_.

> (b)     Secondly, if the surety lacks the wherewithal to look for the accused person in the foreign jurisdiction, this is something that the surety should have thought about before agreeing to post bail. As Chan J observed in _Cher Ting Ting_:[^66]

>>> … as a general proposition it does not assist the surety for him to say that he could not possibly have placed the accused under close surveillance all the time in order to ensure his attendance in court. The surety should have considered, at the time when he was approached to be surety, whether he was in a position to carry out sureties’ duties before agreeing to take on those onerous responsibilities.

38     Counsel also argued that the court, in granting permission to the Accused to leave jurisdiction, must have made an assessment that the flight risk was within acceptable bounds. This, argued Counsel, was something which the Sureties were entitled to take comfort from.[^67] I did not find this argument to be persuasive. Before the court allows an accused person to leave the jurisdiction, it will ordinarily require a substantial increase in the bond amount. This enhances the pull of bail, thereby counteracting the heightened risk of flight inherent in allowing an accused person to travel overseas. In posting that increased bond amount, the surety in effect seeks to convey the impression that the pull of bail is now tightened, so as to give the court a greater sense of security when it weighs the flight risk and decides whether to allow the accused person to leave the jurisdiction. If the accused person were to abscond after that, the surety cannot then toss the buck back to the court and say that because the court (in allowing the accused person to travel) had assessed the flight risk to be within acceptable bounds, the surety is now entitled to enjoy a less rigorous standard of diligence. One of the key factors that lulled the court into judging that the flight risk was acceptable in the very first place would have been the impression created by the surety.

39     Even if I am wrong in my conclusions above and the Sureties had no obligation to look for the Accused in Bangladesh, what the Sureties actually did in this particular case still fell far short of the requisite standard of due diligence expected of a surety. In essence, the two primary measures relied upon by the Sureties to demonstrate their purported exercise of due diligence were:

> (a)     exchanging WhatsApp messages with the Accused during his absence; and

> (b)     filing the police report after the Accused failed to return.

40     As regards the WhatsApp messages, these were tendered by the Sureties presumably to show that active steps were taken to maintain contact with the Accused. In this respect, the messages to and from the Accused during his scheduled period of travel were primarily transmitted via the Company Phone. A perusal of the Company Phone’s messages (extracted at paragraph 16 above) gives rise to the following conclusions:

> (a)      The Sureties made little effort to personally contact the Accused:

> The vast bulk of the messages sent from the Company Phone to the Accused emanated from Wong Shang and **not** the Sureties. As regards the remaining messages that were not explicitly signed off by Wong Shang, I had checked with Counsel whether they were similarly sent by Wong Shang or if they could have been sent by the Sureties. Counsel was not able to confirm either way.[^68] Under such circumstances, I found it extremely difficult to discern any tangible effort by the Sureties to personally stay in touch with the Accused while he was in Bangladesh.

> (b)      There were large gulfs of time during which communications from the Accused ceased:

> I also note that the messages sent _from the Accused_ to the Company Phone were highly sporadic in frequency:

>> (i)       Firstly, there was a **five-day** break in communications between 9 September 2019 (when the Accused flew off to Bangladesh) and his first message from Bangladesh on 14 September 2019 (see paragraph 16(c) above).

>> (ii)       Thereafter, there was a break of **19 days**, before the Accused messaged Wong Shang on 3 October 2019 (see paragraph 16(d) above).

>> (iii)       After this, communications from the Accused ceased once again. In fact, multiple attempts were made to call the Accused on 18 October 2019. The Accused eventually responded only on 20 October 2019, _ie_, **17 days** after his last message (see paragraph 16(f) above).

>> (iv)       This was followed by yet another hiatus in communications, with the Accused responding only on 31 October 2019, _ie_, **11 days** after his last message (see paragraph 16(g) above).

>> (v)       On 1 November 2019, a message was sent to the Accused from the Company Phone asking the Accused to call back. However, the Accused responded with a message only **two days** later, on 3 November 2019 (see paragraph 16(i) above).

>> Counsel explained that communications had been intermittent as the Accused lived in a village outside of Dhaka, where he had to move to spots with reception before he could send and receive messages.[^69] I did not find this to be a sufficient explanation. Section 104(1)(b) of the CPC (extracted at paragraph 29 above) requires that the surety “_keep in daily communication with the released person_”. If there had truly been problems with reception, it behoved the Sureties to instruct the Accused to make whatever arrangements necessary to facilitate communications on a daily basis. There was no evidence of the Sureties having done that. Counsel sought to downplay the wide gaps between the communications as a “technical breach” of s 104(1)(b) of the CPC that ultimately occasioned no harm, given that contact was always re-established after each hiatus.[^70] I rejected this argument. The onus of maintaining daily communications is something _explicitly_ required by statute −and for good reason. That the Sureties could dismiss their blatant breach of that statute as merely “technical”, blissfully content to go for days on end without receiving any communications from the Accused, underscored just how cavalier their attitude had been towards their obligation to stay in touch with him.

41     The other measure which the Sureties relied upon to demonstrate their purported exercise of due diligence was the the police report[^71] filed by Wendy Thean. The full text of the police report is reproduced below:

> On 07 November 2019 I was informed by my company director that one of our worker, namely \[the Accused\] did not return back from his home leave. He was scheduled to return back to Singapore from Bangladesh on the 6th November 2019 at 1440 hours (Flight Number BG84).

> My friend namely \[Adelin Low\] and I act as bailors for \[the Accused\].

> \[The Accused\] was granted home leave on 4th September 2019 until 7th November 2019, to visit his mother who was very sick.

> However, on 5th November 2019, \[the Accused\] messaged our director Mr Wong Shang Ling informing that he cannot return and needed more time. A check was also made by our director on the flight \[the Accused\] was supposed to be on, however, he was not on that flight.

> \[The Accused\] is no longer responding to our messages. I am lodging this report for my record purpose and court follow up actions.

A reading of the police report yields the following observations:

> (a)     Firstly, it was bereft of any details that would have assisted the authorities in tracing the Accused’s whereabouts. Rather, it was expressed as having been made for “record purpose”. This calls to mind the observations made by Yong Pung How CJ in _Ram Ghanshamdas Mahtani_:[^72]

>>> As for the police report which \[the bailor\] lodged … on \[the Accused’s\] “disappearance”, **_it was stated to be made for record purposes only_**. In any event, it was not thought that when an accused on bail went missing, **_the mere making of a police report would be sufficient to excuse the bailor. Otherwise, the bailor would be able to escape from the obligation that he had entered into by simply saying to the court “I am sorry that the accused cannot be found but I have already made a report to the police and hopefully they will be able to trace his whereabouts”_**. This could not be right. In the circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that the bailors had not shown sufficient cause as to why the entire amount of the bail should not be forfeited.

> The same sentiments are also apposite in the present case. The mere filing of a police report by the Sureties, particularly one that was this bald and unhelpful, was insufficient in and of itself to constitute the due diligence that the law requires of sureties.

> (b)     More importantly, the police report was filed **_three days_** after the Accused failed to turn up at the airport on 6 November 2019. By then, the gravity of the situation must have dawned upon the Sureties. Their continued tardiness in filing the police report was thus inexplicable. This was also a clear breach of s 104(1)(b) of the CPC, which requires the surety to “_lodge a police report within 24 hours of losing contact with the \[released person\]_”.

42     Given the Sureties’ failure to maintain daily communications with the Accused, their delay in filing the police report after his disappearance and the lack of any attempt to look for him, they could not possibly be said to have exercised reasonable due diligence in discharging their obligations.

#### Stage 2: Whether the court should forfeit only part (rather than the whole) of the bond

43     When a surety fails to show sufficient cause against forfeiture, the _prima facie_ position is for the court to forfeit the entire bond amount. If the surety wishes the court to refund part of the bond amount, he bears the burden of proving exceptional circumstances. That burden is not an easy one to discharge: see _Cher Ting Ting_ (at \[41\]).

44     As explained at paragraph 25 above, Counsel relied on the financial circumstances of the Sureties as a ground for seeking a refund of at least part of the bond amount.

45     In _Cher Ting Ting_, Chan J held[^73] that a surety’s plea that he lacks the financial means to suffer the consequences of forfeiture is generally _not_ a sound reason to reduce the amount forfeited. In so holding, Chan J cited[^74] the following passage from Lord Widgery CJ’s judgment in _R v Southampton Justices, ex parte Corker_ (1976) 120 SJ 214 (“_Corker_”) to explain why entertaining such an argument would undermine our bail system:

> It would defeat the whole system of bail, I think, if it became generally known that the amount payable was strictly limited according to the surety’s means and that anybody who had no means would not have to pay. Imagine the relish and speed with which persons would accept the obligation of surety if they were penniless and knew that that was a total answer to any kind of obligation on the recognizance.

Furthermore, the surety would have been well aware of his own financial circumstances at the time of posting bail. If he still decided to proceed nonetheless, he cannot then use those circumstances as an excuse to shy away from the full extent of his responsibility should the accused person abscond. In _Corker_, Lord Widgery CJ addressed this point:

> … it cannot be the law, I venture to think, that a surety can escape entirely by saying that he was not culpable and was penniless. These are matters which he should have some regard to before he enters into his recognisance …

46     Even then, the court in _Cher Ting Ting_ accepted that the surety’s financial circumstances are _still_ relevant when the determining what proportion of the bond to forfeit. However, those financial circumstances must be exceptional before they warrant departure from the _prima facie_ position that the full bond amount should be forfeited.[^75] In this respect, Chan J contemplated the scenario where a surety’s financial difficulties had yet to come to light when bail was being posted, but arose only _after_ that. In such a situation:

> (a)     The financial difficulties may still **not** amount to exceptional circumstances if:[^76]

>> (i)       they came to light _before_ the accused person absconded; and

>> (ii)       the surety still saw fit to passively let the bail bond stand, instead of proactively bringing the accused person to court and applying to have the bond discharged.

> (b)     However, where the financial difficulties came to light only _after_ the accused person absconded (when it was too late for the surety to apply for a discharge of the bond), the question of whether this could amount to exceptional circumstances appears to be open.[^77]

The present case was not one where the Sureties’ respective financial circumstances arose only after they had posted bail. At least, Counsel did not make that submission. As such, those circumstances must be taken to have been within the Sureties’ knowledge when they posted bail. They cannot now rely on those circumstances to say that they would be hard done by forfeiture.

47     Counsel also alluded to the impact which forfeiture would have on parties depending on the Sureties. Specifically, Adelin Low had an aged father to support while Wendy Thean had two dogs to take care of. However, I note Chan J’s observations in _Cher Ting Ting_:[^78]

> … In almost every case, the loss of the bond amount will have an impact on the family finances, sometimes even causing hardship and a trickle-down effect on the lives of the surety’s children and other dependents. These are matters which the surety should have foreseen and considered, either at the point where he agreed to stand as surety or subsequently when he had the opportunity to apply for the bond to be discharged. I do not say that such consequences will never be relevant considerations for the court in the exercise of its discretion. But it would erode the pull of bail if sureties are consistently allowed to point to the hardship that might be suffered by their family as an entire answer to the question of forfeiture. That would be a thoroughly unsatisfactory result for the general administration of criminal justice. Accordingly, save in exceptional circumstances and where fairness and justice so demand, the balance tips in favour of a restrictive approach to pleas of familial hardship.

In my opinion, the circumstances raised by Sureties are not sufficiently exceptional as to justify deviation from the _prima facie_ position that the full bond amount should be forfeited.

#### Some ancillary observations

48     I had set out above[^79] how, on 3 November 2019 (_ie_, three days before the Accused’s return flight to Singapore), the Accused sent a message to the Company Phone alluding to the possibility of his return to Singapore being delayed. That same day, Wong Shang responded to the Accused to caution him that the his failure to return could result in Wong Shang’s guarantee being taken away by the State Courts and Wong Shang being fined again:

> Therefore you need to apply new leave and **_my guarantee S$15’000 for you will be taken away by the State Courts. I will be fine by Court again_**. Do consider this very carefully … \[emphasis added\]

Wong Shang’s message raised a question mark: If the bond amounts came from the Sureties, why would Wong Shang suffer any pecuniary penalty from the Accused’s failure to return?

49     During the show cause hearing, I asked Counsel if the bond amounts were in fact funded by Wong Shang or by the Company (which, according to Counsel, was in effect the same entity as Wong Shang[^80]). Counsel assured the court that the funds from the bail bonds were personal to the Sureties.[^81] He explained that Wong Shang’s message of 3 November 2019, as extracted in the preceding paragraph, was couched as such merely to leverage on Wong Shang’s close relationship with the Accused. As seen in the messages set out at paragraph 16(a) above, Wong Shang had even addressed the Accused as “my son”. By postulating the prospect of financial harm to someone close to the Accused (such as Wong Shang), it was hoped that this would reinforce the Accused’s sense of moral obligation to return.[^82] For completeness, I also note that there were some messages from the Sureties to the Accused where they indicated that they (and not Wong Shang or the Company) would be liable to pay the bond if the Accused absconded.

50     Still, I found Counsel’s explanation for Wong Shang’s message of 3 November 2019 to be somewhat inadequate. While Wong Shang had addressed the Accused as “my son”, I also note that both Adelin Low and Wendy Thean were known to the Accused as “Sister Adelin”[^83] and “Sister Wendy”. [^84] If familial terms were indeed reflective of close kinship, this would suggest that the Accused similarly had a close relationship with the Sureties. It was thus not clear to me why the prospect of financial harm to the Accused’s “sisters” was not a sufficient a disincentive for him to jump bail, such that Wong Shang had to misrepresent to the Accused that Wong Shang would suffer financial harm from the bail bond’s forfeiture.

51     Counsel sought to further assuage my concerns by saying that the Company’s finances had already been depleted, as a result of the Company having to pay for:

> (a)     The $220,000 fine imposed pursuant to its conviction under s 12(1) of the Act;[^85]

> (b)     The medical bills of the employees injured in the incident;[^86] and

> (c)     Legal expenses. [^87]

The haemorrhage of funds from the Company thus meant that neither it, nor its alter-ego Wong Shang, were now in a position to fund the bond amounts.[^88]

52     However, as the Prosecution rightly pointed out, the Sureties did not offer any documentary proof to show that the Company’s finances were indeed exhausted.[^89] Furthermore, the picture painted by Counsel of an entity sapped of its funds was at odds with reality. The Company was still in a position to finance the legal fees for the Accused’s defence. Those fees would have continued to accrue had the Accused not absconded and the second tranche of his trial proceeded in February 2020 −there was no suggestion of the Company being unable to continue funding these expenses.

53     In the circumstances, I did not have the confidence to completely rule out Wong Shang’s financial involvement in the funding of the bail bonds, particularly in light of his WhatsApp message to the Accused on 3 November 2019. If Wong Shang had indeed been the one underwriting the bonds, it would explain why most of the messages sent to the Accused from the Company Phone (during the Accused’s trip to Bangladesh) emanated from Wong Shang and not the Sureties. It also would also explain why the Sureties had personally expended so little effort to stay in touch with the Accused.

54     In any case, regardless of whether Wong Shang was the one financing the bail bonds, my conclusion remains that the bond amounts should be forfeited on account of the lack of reasonable due diligence by the Sureties.

## Conclusion

55     Given that:

> (a)     the Sureties failed to demonstrate sufficient reasonable due diligence in the discharge of their obligations as sureties; and

> (b)     there were no exceptional circumstances justifying the refund of any part of the bond amount,

I ordered that the entire bond amounts posted by both Sureties be forfeited.
