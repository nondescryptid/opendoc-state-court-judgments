Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Escalation Principle

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9180/2022/01.\]

2 September 2022

### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Yan Jun, claimed trial to two charges:

> (a)     Taking part in a public assembly for which no permit had been granted (“public assembly charge”): s 16(2)(a) punishable under s 16(3)(b) of the Public Order Act 2009, and

> (b)     Behaving in a disorderly manner in a public place by shouting in a loud voice (“disorderly behaviour charge”): s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 punishable under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

2       All things considered, the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. He was convicted on both charges.

3       He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, an enhanced sentence of 53 days, and a fine of $5000 i/d 6 months’ imprisonment. He has appealed against conviction and sentence.

## Charges

4       The Accused faced two charges:

> You, on 12 June 2022, at or about 2:17 pm, in front of the Embassy of the United States located at No. 27 Napier Road, Singapore, did take part in a public assembly in respect of which no permit had been granted, to wit,

>> (a)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the US government with the words “Protest against CIA agent David Roach for spying on me in Changi Prison!”;

>> (b)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the US, Singapore and Canadian governments with the words “President Biden, PM Lee and PM Trudea: Justify the Roach espionage scandal!”

>> (c)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the Singapore Judiciary with the words “Singapore’s Legal System is totally corrupt!”;

>> (d)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the People’s Republic of China government, with the Chinese characters “抗议中国政府无视新加坡政府在华间谍活动!”, which means “Protest against the Chinese government for ignoring Singapore’s government's spy activities in China!” in English;

>> (e)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the Hong Kong government, with the Chinese characters “抗议香港政府在装甲车阴谋事件中出卖中国主权!”:, which means “Protest against the Hong Kong government for betraying the sovereignty of China in the armoured vehicles conspiracy!” in English;

>> (f)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the People’s Action Party Singapore government with the words “PAP: Justify the Roach espionage scandal before the GE!”;

>> (g)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the Parliament of the United Kingdom with the words “Boris Johnson no-confidence veto is a conspiracy!”

>> (h)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the People’s Action Party Singapore government with the words “Referendum on the legitimacy of the PAP government!”

>> (i)    by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the Singapore Prison Service with the words “CHANGI PRISON IS A SLAVE CAMP!”;

> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 16(2)(a) of the Public Order Act 2009;

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were, on 03 February 2022, in State Court 10B, vide MAC-906299-2021, convicted of an offence punishable under s 16(2)(a) of Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed), and sentenced to a fine of $5,000 (in default five (5) months’ imprisonment), which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby liable for enhanced punishment under s 16(3)(b) of the Public Order Act 2009.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> You, on 12 June 2022, at or about 2.17 pm, at the walkway along Napier Road, Singapore, which is a public place, did behave in a disorderly manner, to wit, by shouting in a loud voice, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906.

> And further that you, before committing the said offence, were, on 03 February 2022, in State Court 10B, vide MAC-907326-2021 had been convicted of an offence punishable under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184 and sentenced to 10 months imprisonment, which conviction and punishment had not been set aside, and you are therefore liable for enhanced punishment under the enhanced limb of Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906.

> And further, that you, from 25 May 2022 to 30 August 2022, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act 1933 which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect you, on 12 June 2022, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 79 Days from 12 June 2022 to 30 August 2022 for that offence.[^2]

## Issues to be determined

5       The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     Whether the public assembly charge was made out (“Issue 1”);

> (b)     Whether the disorderly behaviour charge was made out (“Issue 2”); and

> (c)     Whether the Accused had a valid defence (“Issue 3”)?

## Issue 1: Whether the public assembly charge was made out?

6       The principles governing the public assembly charge under s 16(2)(a) punishable under s 16(3)(b) of the Public Order Act 2009 (“POA”) are as follows:

> (a)     The offence is one of strict liability;

> (b)     It has two elements:

>> (i)       The accused person has taken part in a public assembly; and

>> (ii)       No permit has been granted for that assembly.

7       As both elements were satisfied, the public assembly charge was made out.

8       Using placards prepared in advance, the Accused took part in a public assembly, by demonstrating opposition to the actions of various groups, including the US, Singapore, Chinese and Canadian governments, on 12 June 2022 at about 2.17 p.m. in front of the US Embassy.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) The area in front of the US Embassy is a public place, which members of the public have access as of right.[^4] The Accused’s actions were captured in the police officers’ video footage from the body-worn camera (“the BWC footage”);[^5] I accepted their eye-witness testimony.[^6]

9       Prior to the assembly:

> (a)     On 12 June 2022 at 12.08p.m., the Accused had publicised his plan to protest outside the US Embassy by emailing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (copied to the media and others), which stated that “I am writing to inform PM Lee of my protest outside the US Embassy on Jun 12, 2022 at 1pm. The purpose of this protest is to stand by my espionage claim against CIA agent David Roach…”.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

> (b)     On 12 June 2022 at 1342 hours, the Accused also made a First Information Report, which stated “I am protesting for my espionage. Arrest me. I am protesting against Lee Hsien Loong”.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

10     No permit had been granted for the assembly.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

## Issue 2: Whether the disorderly behaviour charge was made out?

11     I turn next to the disorderly behaviour charge under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 punishable under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

12     The disorderly behaviour charge was supported by the police officers’ eye-witness testimony[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) and the BWC footage.[^11]

13     Taken together, the evidence showed that the Accused behaved in a disorderly manner by repeatedly shouting in a loud voice, despite being asked by police officers to calm down and stop what he was doing[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) on 12 June 2022 at or about 2.17 p.m. at the walkway along Napier Road, which is a public place.

14     The disorderly behaviour charge was made out.

## Issue 3: Whether the Accused had a valid defence?

15     The Accused had no valid defence.

16     The Accused had previously applied for a permit to conduct a public assembly in 2016, which was rejected.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) It stands to reason that he knows how to apply for a permit. And he is aware that a permit is needed before a public assembly can be held. Yet, he had deliberately proceeded with the protest on 12 June 2022 without applying for a permit.[^14] Accordingly, the Accused did not avail himself of the defences available under s 17(1) of the POA, namely, that he did not know, suspect, or have any reason to suspect, that no permit had been granted for the assembly or procession or that no such permit is in force.

17     The Accused asserted that it was pointless to apply for a permit as the police are corrupt.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) I was unable to accept this argument. In this connection, I agreed with the learned District Judge’s views in _Public Prosecutor v Yan Jun_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 24</span> at \[36\]:

> “Essentially these contentions are a non-starter. The High Court has in a number of decisions made it clear that arguments such as an application for a licence or permit was wrongly rejected or that the authorities would not have granted a licence or permit do not provide a defence. If a person were to apply for a licence or permit and this was rejected, the recourse for persons unsatisfied with such exercise of discretionary administrative powers is judicial review (see _Ng Chye Huay & anor v PP_ \[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 268 at \[39\]).”

18     Finally, the Accused alleged that police officers had arrived late to his protest, and that they should have come earlier to stop him from protesting.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) He also asserted that it was their fault (not his) that the protest took place.[^17] I agreed with the Prosecution that:

> (a)     These claims are irrelevant to the charges and misconceived.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (b)     At least 4 police officers reacted fairly promptly and arrived at the scene after the Accused had lodged the First Information Report.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

## Verdict

19     Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. He was convicted on both charges.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed punishment

20     The prescribed punishment for s 16(3)(b) of the Public Order Act 2009 for a repeat offender is a fine not exceeding $5000.

21     The prescribed punishment for s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 for a second or subsequent conviction, is a fine not exceeding $5000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

22     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment set by Parliament: _Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 684</span> at \[44\] (Benny Tan, _Assessing the Effectiveness of Sentencing Guideline Judgments in Singapore Issued Post-March 2013 and A Guide to Constructing Frameworks_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1004</span> at \[46\]).

23     The court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence, _viz._ Completeness principle: _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\] and _Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 265</span> at \[152\]-\[154\].

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

24     The Prosecution sought the following sentences:

> (a)      MAC 904285 of 2022 (public assembly charge): maximum fine of $5000.

> (b)      MAC 904286 of 2022 (disorderly behaviour charge): maximum custodial sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and enhanced sentence of 53 days’ imprisonment.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

### Mitigation plea

25     The Accused offered no mitigation.

### IMH report

26     The Institute of Mental Health report dated 23 June 2022 by Dr Lim Cui Xi[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) stated as follows at \[17\]:[^22]

> (a)     The Accused has “Delusional Disorder, Persecutory Subtype with Narcissistic and Paranoid Personality traits. While his persecutory delusions contributed to the offence, it is his narcissistic and paranoid personality traits that led him to repeatedly reoffend despite being aware he would be persecuted”.

> (b)     He was “not of unsound mind at the material time”.

> (c)     He is “fit to plead in the court of law”.

> (d)     He “refuses treatment for his Delusional Disorder”.

### Decision on sentence

27      Claiming Trial. Although claiming trial is not an aggravating factor, no discount would be given to offenders who elect to claim trial: _Kreetharan s/o Kathireson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 91</span> at \[37\] (see also _Lim Hong Boon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 200</span> at \[31\]-\[32\]) (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[20.147\]).

28      Antecedents. The Accused has the following antecedents:

29      Escalation Principle. The Escalation principle is no more than a reformulation of the longstanding principle that specific deterrence may justify a longer imprisonment term being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents, if these reflected a tendency for repeat offending or a marked proclivity toward criminal offending: _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span> at \[56\].

30     The appropriateness of escalation requires a scrupulous assessment of the particular factual matrix: _Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[34\]. This is by no means a mechanical exercise. The court is required to assess whether the objective of preventing reoffending is in fact met by the use of escalation: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[66\].

31     Applying the Escalation principle incorporates the safeguard of proportionality. Hence, before a court imposes an uplift on an accused person’s previous sentences, there must be a careful comparison with his previous offending: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[74\].

32     Ultimately, the assessment for the Escalation principle is necessarily a fact-specific and contextual one, requiring a judgment of experience and discernment: _Low Ji Qing_ at \[81\].

33     In the present case, the overall sentence should reflect his total culpability, when viewed as a whole, for the various offences arising from what was essentially one incident. These offences were committed by the Accused under similar circumstances as his previous convictions with no significant increase in harm or culpability.

34     That said, the Accused had reoffended a mere 18 days after starting his remission order on 25 May 2022,[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) occasioning the present set of offences. In fact, he chose the exact same location for his protest.[^24] The Accused has a slipstream of similar antecedents — this was the 9th occasion that he was being convicted for similar offences within the past 5-6 years.[^25]

35     For the public assembly charge, the fact that the imprisonment terms imposed in default of payment of the maximum fine[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) for his previous convictions have increased, has not deterred the Accused from not paying the fine. He had previously indicated that he would not be paying the fine imposed: _Public Prosecutor v Yan Jun_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 19</span> at \[125\]. He had not paid the fines for any of his past convictions. The Accused did not say that he was impecunious or unable to pay the fine. He offered no mitigation, despite repeated opportunities afforded to him.

36     In the circumstances, an increase from the default imprisonment term imposed for the last conviction on 8 October 2021 was necessary as the last default term of 5 months’ imprisonment had not deterred him from not paying the fine (see also Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[26.075\]).

37     I was mindful that default terms of imprisonment are not to punish those who are genuinely unable to pay, but are intended to prevent evasion of the payment of funds imposed: _Low Meng Chay v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 1 SLR(R) 46</span> at \[13\] and _Wu Tze Kok v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 350</span> at \[10\] (Tan Yock Lin and S. Chandra Mohan, _Criminal Procedure_ (LexisNexis: 2019; Binder 3, Chapter XVII: Sentencing) at \[2154\]).

38     The Accused’s conduct during trial was also aggravating, for example:

> (a)     He repeatedly made the bare assertion that Singapore’s legal system is totally corrupt.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> (b)     He repeatedly stated that he wanted to quit the trial,[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) describing it as a a “performance”,[^29] a “game”[^30] and a “play”.[^31]

> (c)     He repeatedly contended that the court was biased towards the prosecutors, police officers and Dr Lim Cui Xi[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32).[^33]

> (d)     He attacked Dr Lim Cui Xi’s[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) professional integrity by claiming — without any logical basis — that she was incompetent.[^35]

> (e)     He wanted to summon to court the Police Commissioner, Attorney General and Chief Justice on the basis that he had emailed them.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

39     On balance, the above points militated in favour of the Escalation principle applying.

40     My view was fortified by the fact that the Accused had previously been put on notice about receiving the maximum sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for a disorderly behaviour charge if he persists in offending under similar circumstances: High Court in _Yan Jun v Public Prosecutor_ (_Ex Tempore_ Judgment, 3 February 2022, MA 9235 of 2021) at \[7\]:

> “\[H\]aving regard to the considerations articulated by the DJ as mentioned earlier, I am of the view that a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment each for the s 37 POA and s 20 MOA charges is appropriate. **However, it should be made clear to the \[Accused\] that if he refuses to cease his errant ways and persists in offending under similar circumstances, he should expect to receive the maximum term of imprisonment of 12 months**” \[emphasis added in bold\].

41      Section 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act 1933. I agreed with the Prosecution that the enhanced sentence under s 50T of the Prisons Act 1933 for s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 falls within the higher end of Band 2 of the framework (_viz._ 2/3 or 66.7%) in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> as:

> (a)     The gravity of the offence is moderate. The Accused faced the maximum term of imprisonment for this offence due to his persistent reoffending.

> (b)     The offence is of the exact same nature for which the remission order was originally imposed.

> (c)     The Accused reoffended a mere 18 days after starting his remission order on 25 May 2022.

> (d)     Given the Accused’s extensive reoffending over the past 5-6 years, he demonstrated low rehabilitative prospects.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

42      Sentence. All things considered, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

43      Totality Principle. The sentence is in line with both limbs of the totality principle: _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (see _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 941</span> at \[150\]).

44      Proportionality Principle. I kept in mind the proportionality principle in sentencing: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[30\]. Under the proportionality principle, the sentence to be imposed must not only bear a reasonable proportion to the maximum prescribed penalty, but also to the gravity of the offence committed (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, Second Ed, 2019) at \[06.091\]-\[06.093\]).

## Conclusion

45     All things considered, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused. He was convicted on both charges. He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, an enhanced sentence of 53 days, and a fine of $5000 i/d 6 months’ imprisonment.

46     The Accused has appealed against conviction and sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.
