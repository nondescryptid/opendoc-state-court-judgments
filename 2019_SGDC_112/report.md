\*Both imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently.

2       The Accused also consented to two other charges[^2] against him being taken into consideration (“TiC”) for the purpose of sentencing. Both TiC charges relate to offences under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act[^3] (“PHA”).

## Facts

3       On 2 December 2018, at about 9.00pm, the Accused was attending a birthday celebration with his (then) girlfriend and the latter’s aunt (“the aunt”).

4       The Accused grew intoxicated after drinking with his friends and began shouting and making a lot of noise. At around 10.40pm, the aunt thus asked the Accused’s girlfriend to bring him out of the house. The Accused responded by slapping the aunt’s left cheek, twice. This is the subject of the charge under s 352 of the Penal Code:

MAC 902522/2019

… you on the 2nd day of December 2018 at or about 10.40pm, at Blk 351 Ang Mo Kio Street 32, #XXX …, used criminal force on one Lim Annie, to wit, by slapping her on her left cheek twice, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 352 of the Penal Code ….

The slap did not cause any physical injuries to the aunt. Nevertheless, she called the 999 hotline for police assistance.

5       At about 11.06pm, Voluntary Special Constabulary Woman Staff Sergeant Lim Choon Hiang (“WSSgt Lim”) and Sergeant Tan Ching Lin (“Sgt Tan”) arrived at the scene. They interviewed the Accused, who was drunk and uncooperative.

6       In the course of the interview, the Accused grew violent, despite several warnings to him to calm down. At about 11:35pm, the Accused threw a punch at WSSgt Lim. However, she managed to block the blow, with the result that the contact landed on her hands. This is the subject of the charge under s 353 of the Penal Code:

DAC 939942/2018

… you, on the 2nd day of December 2018 at or about 11.35pm, at Blk 351 Ang Mo Kio Street 32, #XX …, used criminal force on one Lim Choon Hiang, a public servant, to wit, throwing one punch with intent to deter the said public servant from discharging her duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

WSSgt Lim did not suffer any visible injuries arising from the punch.

7       The Accused also uttered expletives at both WSSgt Lim and Sgt Tan. These formed the subject of the two TiC charges under s 6(3) of the PHA, of which:

(a)     one related to the vulgarities hurled at WSSgt Lim;

(b)     the other related to that hurled at Sgt Tan.

## Antecedents

8       The Accused has no prior criminal records.

## Mitigation

9       In his mitigation plea, the Accused said that he is very sorry for what happened and that he does not wish to lose his job.[^4]

## Sentence

#### Section 353 of the Penal Code: Use of Criminal Force Against WSSgt Lim

10     The Accused’s act of throwing a punch at WSSgt Lim gave rise to an offence under s 353 of the Penal Code, which reads:

**353**.     **Using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty**

Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both.

11     For offences involving physical attacks against police officers, the lower courts have been guided by the recent decision in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon, Jeffrey_ (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”). _Jeffrey Yeo_ involved a drunken offender who slapped the cheek of a police officer who had approached him. The offender subsequently pleaded guilty to one charge under s 332 of the Penal Code (voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty) and was sentenced to one week in prison. On appeal by the Prosecution, a three-judge bench of the High Court enhanced the imprisonment term to 10 weeks. In doing so, the High Court explained the rationale for a stiffer sentencing position:

49    Attacks against police officers can have several undesirable consequences at a societal level. First, the incidents of attack, if left unchecked, could undermine public confidence in our police officers as authority figures in society and compromise their effectiveness as a symbol of law and order. Second, with manpower constraints resulting in an already lean police-to-population ratio in Singapore, the continued abuse of police officers will have an adverse impact on the SPF's recruitment efforts. In the long term, this will have repercussions for the operational effectiveness of the police and will affect the country adversely as a whole. Third, challenges to the authority of the police pose a real risk of defensive policing. It would be unfortunate and undesirable if our police officers feel the need too easily and too often to draw their weapons or to use force in reaction to any perceived danger. All these issues are compounded by the increasingly complex and uncertain security environment with which modern-day policing is presented in a densely populated country, where emergency situations could arise at any time with dire consequences for the public.

50    Police officers must therefore be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. In that light and coupled with the fact that police officers were often the target in the cases prosecuted under s 332 of the Penal Code, it is appropriate to have a sentencing framework which reflects society's opprobrium of such offences. This will aid especially the State Courts in sentencing in such cases and help maintain uniformity in the sentences.

12      _Jeffrey Yeo_ involved a more serious penal provision than in the present case before me −the charge in _Jeffrey Yeo_ was under s 332 of the Penal Code (which requires that hurt be caused). The present case involves a charge under s 353 of the Penal Code, which only requires use of criminal force.[^5] Nevertheless, the sentencing rationale expounded in _Jeffrey Yeo_ as regards protecting our law enforcement officers is of equal relevance to other offences involving physical violence against the police.

13     Additionally, the High Court in _Jeffrey Yeo_[^6] indicated that the sentencing framework which it sought to lay down extends to, _inter alia_, members of the Special Constabulary (of which WSSgt Lim is a member).

14     There is a myriad of physical attacks to which our law enforcement officers could potentially be exposed. These include attacks with body-to-body contact (e.g. pushing or punching), those which are calculated to demean (e.g. spitting), or both (e.g. a slap to the face). Some attacks also carry risk of infection to the victim (e.g. biting). While sentencing precedents can be found for most of these categories, I was of the view that those which involve _pushing_ the victim are most apposite here. As regards the other categories:

(a)     Precedent cases involving punches are less relevant to the current factual matrix. While the Accused in the present case threw a punch, the blow failed to connect with its mark as WSSgt Lim managed to block it with her hands. In any event, I found a dearth of precedents involving punching of law enforcement officers where the charge was one under s 353 of the Penal Code (i.e. the provision at issue here).[^7] However, the fact that contact in this case arose from the throwing of a punch tends to render the Accused’s actions more aggravating than a mere push −this is alluded to at paragraph 16(b) below.

(b)     I also placed less emphasis on precedents involving attacks calculated to demean, such as spitting or slaps to the face, where the added dimension of indignity and humiliation suffered by the victim may warrant further nuancing of the sentence.

15     From a sampling of three relatively recent cases where the offenders _pleaded guilty_, one sees that the High Court has imposed (or affirmed) sentences typically ranging between 3 to 5 weeks:

16     Reverting to the present case, the following observations can be made about the Accused’s culpability:

(a)     The manner of the Accused’s attack was more aggressive than just a push −he had thrown a punch. While that punch failed to hit home, this was not due to any restraint on his part but rather because WSSgt Lim had stopped the blow with her hands.

(b)     As with the three precedent cases above, the Accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence. The High Court has repeatedly held that this is an aggravating factor: see _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ [^12] and (more recently) _PP v Holman, Benjamin John_ .[^13]

(c)     The Accused’s actions as reflected in the two TiC charges, i.e. using expletives against both WSSgt Lim and Sgt Tan, also served to enhance his culpability.

Bearing the above factors in mind, the Accused’s culpability appears to be as high as, if not higher than, that in the three precedent cases cited above.

17     Nonetheless, there are some factors militating against upping the sentence beyond that the 3-5 week range:

(a)     First, the harm caused by the Accused was low −the strike at WSSgt Lim ultimately did not result in any visible injuries.

(b)     Second, as with the three precedent cases cited in the table above, the Accused pleaded guilty, thereby demonstrating some measure of remorse.

(c)     Third, the Accused had a completely clean record, unlike in two of the three precedent cases above.

18     All things considered, I pegged the Accused’s sentence at **4 weeks’ imprisonment**.

#### Section 352 of the Penal Code − Use of criminal force against the aunt

19     Section 352 of the Penal Code states:

**352**.     **Punishment for using criminal force otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation**

Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,500, or with both.

20     The actions of the Accused giving rise to the offence under this provision were rather aggravating:

(a)     Given the ruckus that he had been creating at the birthday celebration, the aunt did not act unreasonably in asking the Accused’s girlfriend to bring him out of the flat. The Accused’s reaction in slapping the aunt (who was 30 years his senior) was not only uncalled for but far more demeaning than in cases where criminal force is applied to less sensitive parts of the body (where a fine may typically be imposed). In terms of offensiveness, the mode of attack was thus of a higher order.

(b)     Furthermore, he slapped her on the cheek not once but twice.

(c)     Finally, as alluded to at paragraph 16(b) above, the fact that the Accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence is an aggravating factor.

This charge would thus merit either the maximum fine, or possibly a very short custodial sentence.

21     Nevertheless, the close proximity between the Accused’s slapping of the aunt and his subsequent attack on WSSgt Lim afforded me some cause to treat both offences as part of one transaction, even if some distinction could be drawn between the legally protected interests infringed by each offence. I thus imposed a short custodial sentence of **1 week’s imprisonment** for the charge under s 352 of the Penal Code and ordered this to run concurrently with the 4-week imprisonment term imposed for throwing the punch at WSSgt Lim.

## Conclusion

22     The Accused was thus sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 4 weeks.

23     On the Accused’s application, I allowed him to defer the commencement of his sentence by 3 weeks, so that he could put his affairs in order before going to prison. The Accused has filed an appeal against sentence during the period of deferment.
