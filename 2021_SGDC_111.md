### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Ng Aik Leong (Male, 59 years old), was found guilty after a trial and convicted of the charge in _DAC 933005/2019_ for the offence of Voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon under Section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). He was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment. The Accused has filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence and is currently on bail.

## Charge

2       The Charge in _DAC 933005/2019_ reads as follows:

>     “That you, on 11 December 2018, on or about 4:20pm, at the Singapore Islamic Hub, located at BLK 273 Braddell Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Mr Jahidul (“the victim”) by means of a metal scraper with a wooden handle, an instrument which if used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death, _to wit_, by scratching the victim twice on his abdomen and hitting him on the head with the metal scraper, causing the victim to suffer:

>> (a)    Pain;

>> (b)    Cephalohaematoma measuring 2cm in diameter over the left parietal scalp:

>> (c)    10cm linear red mark over the left upper abdomen; and

>> (d)    2mm abrasion over the central upper abdomen:

>     and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

## Prosecution’s Case

3       The Accused was the employer of the Victim. The Victim was a foreign worker from Bangladesh. The Accused employed the Victim in his company HYL Enterprises Pte Ltd as a general worker. The Victim arrived in Singapore on 14 October 2018 to work for the Accused.

4       The Victim testified that in the afternoon of 11 December 2018, he was at the Singapore Islamic Hub (“the Hub”) performing cleaning work of an overhead ventilation duct. In the course of the work, while the Victim was standing on a ladder, the Accused became upset with him and took a metal scraper (which has a wooden handle) and thrusted it toward the Victim, causing minor injuries to his abdomen. The Accused also used the scraper to hit the Victim’s head once, causing a bruise on the left side of his scalp.

5       Evidence on three incidents prior to the commission of the offence was also led by the DPP on the basis that these incidents provided the background leading up to the offence showing the threats of violence. The DPP submitted that they were relevant to the state of mind of the Accused and this is provided for under Section 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act, Chapter 97 (1997 Rev Ed). The DPP cited the illustrations at (o) to s 14 and (b) to s 15 in support.

6       The DPP also clarified that the evidence of these prior encounters was adduced to refute the various claims of the Accused that the Victim had given consent and had willingly subjected himself to being disciplined physically.

## Defence’s Case

7       The Accused elected to give evidence in his defence.

8       It is not entirely clear what the defence of the Accused is. At times, he seemed to allege that the Victim gave him consent to hit him as a form of teaching and learning, to help the Accused remember his mistakes. At other times, the Accused seemed to say that he did not injure the Victim and that the Victim was exaggerating what had happened. The Accused claimed that he had faked punches and there was no contact with the Victim’s body. If he had really used the scraper to injure the Victim, his injuries would have been worse.

## Findings

9       The following are my findings of fact which led to the conviction of the Accused as charged.

10     I accepted the evidence of the Victim on how he was assaulted by the Accused with the metal scraper. The Victim was able to describe what had happened on the day of the incident clearly. He came across as an honest witness with the straightforward answers he had given in the course of the trial.

11     More significantly, the version testified to by the Victim was corroborated by documentary, medical and photographic evidence. The minor injuries suffered by the Victim was carefully and contemporaneously documented by the attending doctor in the medical records. The post-incident CCTV footages showed exactly what happened leading to the attendance at the scene by the security officers.

12     The Victim testified that the Accused was annoyed with him when he was still standing on the ladder leading up to the ventilation duct. The Accused took a wooden plank and threw it at the Victim, but he was not hit by the plank. The Accused took a plastic pail and threw it at the Victim, hitting the Victim’s buttocks. The Victim came down from the ladder by which time, the Accused had taken a metal scraper with the wooden handle and thrusted it toward the Victim twice and injured his stomach. Following that, the Accused hit the left side of the head of the Victim with the scraper.

13     The Victim was shocked and frightened. He managed to take out his hand phone to record what was happening. The Accused pushed away the phone and the both of them tussled over the scraper. The Accused fell down in the midst of pulling and pushing and the Victim managed to snap a photo of the Accused showing him holding onto the scraper with his hand (this is shown in Exhibit P6). The Victim took the opportunity to leave the work area and go to the canteen where he called for the police.

14     Before the arrival of the police, the security personnel at the Islamic Hub had heard the Victim crying and responded to the situation at the canteen. The CCTV footages showed that the Victim was holding onto his head, as well as the Accused holding onto the metal scraper. The Victim informed PW12 that he had been assaulted by his employer. PW12 informed his supervisor PW1 who proceeded to the canteen.

15     The Victim told PW1 that he had been hit by his boss and showed him the injuries on his head and abdomen. PW1 took some photos of the injured areas of the body. While PW1 and PW12 were talking to the Victim, the Accused told PW1 that the Victim “doesn’t know how to do work” and “the worker is stupid”. Subsequently, the police arrived and took over the case.

16     The Victim was conveyed to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the doctor PW7 attended to the Victim. PW7 observed a 10cm linear scratch and a 2mm abrasion on his abdomen. There was also a haematoma (a raised bruise caused by bleeding in the soft tissue) on the left side of the scalp.

17     As can be seen, the evidence of the Victim is consistent with the corroborative medical, photographic and post-incident CCTV evidence and the evidence of the security and police officers who attended to the incident at the scene.

18     On the other hand, the Accused’s version was tested by the Prosecution during the cross-examination and the Accused was shown to be an unreliable witness. The various defences and at times ludicrous claims of the Accused were meticulously taken apart by the DPP and shown to be false and inconceivable. I cite a few examples here:

> (a)     The Accused claimed that the Victim had suggested to him to beat the Victim, in order to help him avoid repeating his mistakes at work. However, the audio recordings of incidents prior to the commission of the offence showed that all the references to the signing of such an agreement came from the Accused and not the Victim.

> (b)     The Accused claimed that he was joking when he suggested the Victim give him permission to beat the Victim in order to teach him. The audio recordings showed that the Accused was not joking at all. The Accused admitted that he was angry and scolding the Victim “because I was teaching him”.

> (c)     The Victim could be heard in the audio recordings to be in evident distress when the Accused vented his frustrations and anger at the Victim, resulting in the Victim responding with “_Why you Boss like this you…_” (voice 2 crying) and “_you send back me_”. (_sic_)

> (d)     The Accused recognised that it would not be right even if the Victim had purportedly agreed to be beaten and signed the “agreement” for the Accused to use physical violence to teach him when he made mistakes at work. The Accused had answered in cross-examination that “_even if he did sign, I would not have hit him_.”

> (e)     The Accused claimed that he had “thrusted” the scraper at the Victim “at least 10 times”. This was inconsistent with what he had told various witnesses after the incident that he did not assault the Victim with the metal scraper.

> (f)     The Accused claimed that he had used the scraper to “_hit \[the Victim’s\] backside … similar to a father using a cane to hit their child” and that it was “more like a discipline cane … of a mother_.” This was another example of how ludicrous the Accused could be. Such was the extent of his frivolous claims to which the Accused would resort to, in his attempts to deny the commission of the offence.

19     The Accused’s version of what had happened during the incident was shown by the DPP to be internally inconsistent from what the Accused had told PW3, the police officer who had attended at scene. The Accused first told PW3 that he did not hit the Victim before claiming that there was a scuffle, implying accidental injury, and finally claiming that the Victim had allowed him to use violence. PW3 testified that he was baffled by the accounts given by the Accused as these claims were inconsistent. As the DPP rightly observed, these three versions of the Accused were mutually at odds.

20     The Accused had also claimed that the Victim had set him up and was trying to frame him. The DPP had dealt with this aspect of the defence comprehensively in his closing submissions at Paragraphs 54 to 60 and there is no need to repeat them here.

21     In the light of the assessment of the Victim and the Accused as witnesses and their testimonies against the circumstances as adduced by all the witnesses during the trial, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed the offence of Voluntarily causing hurt using a metal scraper with a wooden holder under Section 324 of the Penal Code.

## Antecedents

22     The Accused has a previous conviction for the offence of Voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code and was sentenced with a fine of $3,000 on 5 April 2012.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

23     The DPP cited the case of _Ng Soon Kim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1097</span> (“_Ng Soon Kim_”) which laid down the sentencing framework in relation to Section 324 of the Penal Code. The DPP submitted for a sentence of imprisonment of ten months and put forth the following factors in support:

> (a)     The Accused had failed to treat the Victim with any semblance of decency. Over a period of nearly two months, the Accused persisted with verbal and psychological abuse threatening the Victim.

> (b)     Although the harm caused was low, the Accused had a high level of culpability. While the Victim was still on the ladder, the Accused threw a wooden plank at him which missed. He then threw a plastic pail which hit the buttocks of the Victim. After the Victim had gotten down from the ladder, the Accused thrusted the scraper at his stomach twice followed by a hit on the head of the Victim, which was a vulnerable part of the human body.

> (c)     The scraper was an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death. The scraper had a sharp metal part which was rusty. The Accused had used it to cause the injuries on the stomach of the Victim. The Accused has also used the scraper to hit the head of the Victim. Although the harm caused turned out to be low, the potential harm of the weapon was high.

> (d)     An uplift of at least six months of imprisonment was warranted as the metal scraper was at least as dangerous as the ignited aerosol in _Ng Soon Kim_, if not more dangerous.

> (e)     The Accused is traced for an offence of causing hurt in 2012.

### Mitigation

24     The Accused was unrepresented. A written plea in mitigation (“Mitigation”) was submitted. In it, the Accused explained the circumstances of his last conviction in 2012 as well as the circumstances of his charge that was stood down. He wanted to show that he was not a violent person. The Accused also repeated his Defence. There was no mitigatory element in the submissions.

## Sentence

25     The offence under Section 324 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment of up to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. The offence of causing hurt using a weapon is a serious offence. There were aggravating factors for the offence committed, therefore a substantial custodial sentence is justified.

26     The applicable sentencing framework is found in the case of _Ng Soon Kim_ where the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon laid down a 3-step approach. Following that approach, I found myself in agreement with the DPP’s proposed sentence of imprisonment of 10 months. I fully accepted the submissions by the DPP in support of his proposed sentence and will not repeat them here. Instead, I will set out the significant reasons which more than justify the sentence imposed.

27     The harm caused was low but the potential harm was high. The harm factor would have placed this in the first broad band of the sentencing bands for hurt cases in _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span>. This broad band caters to the low harm of minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions. Since there were injuries to both the abdomen and the head (a vulnerable part of the body), the sentence ought to be at the higher end of the band and I assessed it to be one month. This is before factoring the weapon used and other offender-specific factors.

28     The weapon used was a metal scraper with a wooden handle and the uplift should be at least six months of imprisonment. The metal scraper was sharp and rusty. An uplift of at least six months would be reasonable. In fact, an eight-month uplift might be more appropriate.

29     The Accused had not shown any remorse and was convicted after a trial in which he had made all sorts of incredible allegations against the Victim and cast aspersions on the investigating officers. The Accused also had a similar previous conviction of a violent nature and therefore the sentencing principle of Specific Deterrence was relevant. These offender-specific factors easily justified an additional one to two months of imprisonment. Therefore, the sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment suggested by the Prosecution was fair and was passed as the sentence against the Accused.

30     The Accused was also ordered to compensate the victim a sum of $3,300 and in default to serve 3 weeks of imprisonment for the failure to pay. The compensation is for four months of lost wages and for the Victim’s pain and suffering from the injuries caused. The lost salary amounted to $2,800 based on $700 salary per month. The injuries were two lacerations on the abdomen and a bruise on the head and a sum of $500 compensation is in order. The Accused had already paid for the medical fees of $120 incurred by the Victim.

## Conclusion

31     The Accused had shown no remorse and was totally unrepentant despite the clear evidence against him for which there was no reasonable doubt and he had no defence. The total sentence of 10 months of imprisonment was imposed in view of all the sentencing factors submitted by the Prosecution for which I had fully accepted. The imprisonment and the payment of the compensation sum have been stayed pending the appeal. The Accused is currently on bail.
