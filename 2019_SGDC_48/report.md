### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) and the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) of the Singapore Police Force were conducting investigations into cases of fraudulent claims submitted under the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme (“PIC Scheme”) administered by IRAS. These fraudulent claims were submitted to IRAS by companies (applicants) which had purportedly purchased goods or services from vendors.

2       The PIC Scheme is a government subsidy open to all Singapore-registered companies to improve productivity by utilizing Information Technology (IT) and automation equipment. Applicant-companies would be able to purchase items or services from vendors of IT solutions, such as computer software, and apply to IRAS for cash payouts under the PIC Scheme.

3       The Accused is Lim Chit Foo. He is also known as Chester. He has no official capacities or registered connections with the various applicant-companies and vendors involved in the applications submitted to IRAS for the cash payouts under the PIC Scheme. He is not listed as a director or shareholder or officer of any of these companies – whether they be the purported vendors or suppliers, or the purported purchasers of the IT packages or products listed in the applications submitted to IRAS for the release of the funds under the PIC Scheme.

4       The Accused has been charged with many Cheating and other offences in connection with the applications submitted to IRAS for the cash payouts. However, he was tried in this Court only on four charges:

•    One charge of intentionally perverting the course of justice under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“the Penal Code”).

•    Three charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code.

The Accused is alleged to have perverted or attempted to pervert the course of justice by causing or instigating persons being investigated to give false information to the police.

5       For the purposes of this trial on the four charges, the persons implicated in the suspicious PIC applications, being probed by IRAS and CAD, were Stephanie Tan Mui Shan (PW1 “Stephanie”) in **DAC 942275/2016**, Maurice Tan Wei Qiang (PW4 “Maurice”) in **DAC 942276/2016**, Wong Kwong Weng (PW6 “Wong”) in **DAC 942278/2016** and Tom Lee Teng (PW3 “Tom Lee”) in **DAC 946998/2016**.

6       The four charges against the Accused in this trial are:

**\[DAC 942275/2016\]**

“You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 1 November 2016, in Singapore, did intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you caused one Tan Mui Shan, Stephanie, to falsely inform the police in a statement recorded on 1 November 2016 that, in respect of Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout applications submitted by companies which the said Tan Mui Shan Stephanie was director or shareholder of, she knew that one “Wu Hai Jun” had sold computer software to these applicant companies, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

**\[DAC 942276/2016\]**

“You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 1 November 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you instigated one Maurice Tan Wei Qiang to falsely inform the police that in respect of Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout applications submitted by companies which the said Maurice Tan Wei Qiang was a director or shareholder, one “Wu Hai Jun” had instructed Maurice Tan Wei Qiang to incorporate these applicant companies, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

**\[DAC 942278/2016\]**

“You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 8 November 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you instigated one Wong Kwong Weng (“Wong”), a director of Bao Tech Pte Ltd, to falsely inform the police that Wong knew that, in respect of Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout applications submitted by applicant companies, Bao Tech Pte Ltd sold computer software to these applicant companies and Wu Hai Jun was the programmer of the said computer software, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

**\[DAC 946998/2016\]**

“You, Lim Chit Foo, on or before 30 October 2016, in Singapore, did attempt to intentionally pervert the course of justice, _to wit_, you instigated one Tom Lee Teng, to falsely inform the police that, in respect of a Productivity and Innovation Credit cash payout application submitted in respect of MICBO REMIX JAY PTE. LTD. (“the company”), dated 4 November 2015, which application was based on a cash purchase of Customer Relationship Management Software from Technetronic Pte Ltd, Lee had bought such software and had seen such software used in the company, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.)”

7       The Accused was convicted of all 4 charges and sentenced to a total imprisonment term of 40 months on 16 January 2019. The Sentence was backdated and ordered to take effect from 11 November 2016. The Accused has filed an appeal against Conviction and Sentence on all the 4 charges. Since the Sentence was backdated, the Accused had completed his sentences for these 4 offences on 31 January 2019 and is presently remanded in prison, awaiting the trial of more than 400 remaining charges of Cheating and other offences against him.

## The Prosecution’s Case

8       The 4 offences were committed in October and November 2016 and occurred during the investigations by IRAS and CAD into suspected fraudulent claims made by applicant-companies under the PIC Scheme.

9       Stephanie, Maurice and Tom Lee were registered directors of different applicant-companies. Wong Kwong Weng was a registered director of a few vendor companies. Stephanie, Maurice and Wong took instructions, directly and indirectly, from the Accused. Tom Lee was a business partner of the Accused.

10     The key aspects of the Prosecution’s Case are summed up as follows:

a.      _Charge related to PW1: Stephanie Tan Mui Shan_

i.       Stephanie had falsely informed the police in her statement (P2) to CAD on 1 November 2016 that she knew that one “Wu Hai Jun” had sold computer software to companies in which she was a director or shareholder.

ii.       Stephanie testified that she did not know and had neither met nor been introduced to Wu Hai Jun. Her knowledge of such a person called Wu Hai Jun came from the Accused. She had heard the name Wu Hai Jun for the first time from the Accused about 3 months prior to 1 November 2016.

iii.       After Stephanie had been interviewed by IRAS on 5 October 2016, the Accused caused Stephanie to mention Wu Hai Jun instead of the Accused when questioned by the police, namely CAD, on 1 November 2016.

iv.       Stephanie said that her answers about Wu Hai Jun to CAD on 1 November 2016 were not based on her personal knowledge of Wu Hai Jun but were based on what she was given to understand by the Accused. She had mentioned Wu Hai Jun instead of the Accused’s name as she wanted to cover up for the Accused. She regarded the Accused as her “boss”.

v.       The Accused’s asking Stephanie around 23 October 2015 to enhance her “stories” (Exhibit P5C) by adding references to Wu Hai Jun, and his subsequent arrangement for Stephanie to affirm a Statutory Declaration exonerating the Accused, clearly demonstrated his intention to pervert the course of justice.

b.      _Charge related to PW4: Maurice Tan_

i.       This is a charge for an attempt to pervert the course of justice by instigating Maurice to falsely inform the police that Wu Hai Jun had instructed Maurice to incorporate the applicant-companies which had submitted claims to IRAS.

ii.       Maurice testified that the Accused was the one who had arranged for him to register companies or take over companies. These companies were subsequently used in the submissions of claims to IRAS for cash payouts. Maurice testified that he had handed over to the Accused the approval and rejection letters from IRAS for the PIC applications. Several of these IRAS letters were sent to the residential address of Maurice because his residential address was used as the registered address of these companies.

iii.       Maurice said that the Accused had told him to say that it was Wu Hai Jun who was responsible.

c.      _Charge related to PW6: Wong Kwong Weng_

i.       This is a charge for an attempt to pervert the course of justice by instigating Wong to falsely inform the police that the company Bao Tech Pte Ltd had sold computer software to applicant-companies and that Wu Hai Jun was the programmer of those software.

ii.       Wong testified that he was not aware that he had been registered as a director of Bao Tech Pte Ltd. He did not know of the existence of such a company and whether the company carried out any business activity.

iii.       Wong did not know the Accused personally and had never been introduced to him. However, Wong did take instructions via the telephone numbers of xxx from an unknown person he addressed as “Boss”. This person would pay him $1800 for being the registered director of a construction company known as Techne Engineering Pte Ltd (“Techne”) and share half the profits from each worker provided by Techne to subcontractors or main contractors. Wong gave “Boss” his SingPass details.

iv.       Wong was called up by IRAS on 5 October 2016 and questioned about the company Bao Tech Pte Ltd and other companies involved in PIC applications for cash payouts. Subsequent to this interview by IRAS, Wong called up “Boss” to question why “Boss” had used his SingPass details for fraudulent PIC applications.

v.       Wong was instructed by “Boss” via phone communications to take the blame and to mention Wu Hai Jun as a software programmer. These communications were done firstly through the phone number xxx and subsequently through the phone number xxx. Evidence of these communications between Wong and “Boss” are found in P24, P25 and P26.

vi.       The registered subscriber of the phone number xxx was Bernard Ng (PW2) who gave evidence that he had sold the hand-phone with this number to the Accused.

d.      _Charge related to PW3: Tom Lee_

i.       Tom Lee and the Accused were business partners in the running of a fashion apparel store under the company Stage Group (S) Pte Ltd (“Stage”). Tom was the registered director of Stage.

ii.       Tom took charge of the daily operations and the Accused took charge of issues related to government agencies such as tax matters for IRAS and manpower issues with MOM and CPF. Tom had provided the Accused with his SingPass details for these purposes. Tom Lee Teng was a TV artiste and travelled overseas often for his assignments.

iii.       In 2015, another company Micbo Remix Jay Pte Ltd (“MRJ”) was incorporated to deal with products associated with the Mando-pop artiste Jay Chou. The same arrangement of Tom being in charge of the sales operations and the Accused taking care of liaising with the government agencies was to be adopted. However, this business did not take off.

iv.       Despite there being no business for MRJ, it transpired that an application for PIC funds was submitted online based upon a purported purchase of a piece of software for the company. Tom was not aware of such an application for MRJ although it was done using the SingPass details of Tom on 4 November 2015. The application was subsequently approved by IRAS and funds were dispensed in the form of cash payouts to the company.

v.       When investigations into fraudulent PIC applications were carried out by IRAS, Tom was interviewed in October 2016 by IRAS and was asked about the purported software purchase by the company MRJ. Tom was not aware of the PIC application made in his name and the payout to the company.

vi.       Tom decided to call the Accused and secretly recorded their conversations. Tom sought to obtain the Accused’s explanation on why IRAS was looking into the company matters. In the recorded tele-conversations between Tom and the Accused, the Accused instructed Tom to tell the investigators that Tom had bought the software for MRJ and had seen it being used in the office. The Accused then sent details of the Customer Relationship Management Software from Technetronic Pte Ltd to Tom.

11     The Prosecution’s case is that, at all material times, Stephanie, Maurice and Wong were taking instructions from the Accused. Their testimonies corroborated each other regarding how the Accused had sought to influence them to falsely inform the investigators about the involvement of Wu Hai Jun, in an attempt to deflect investigations from the Accused. These witnesses were involved as directors in either the applicant or the vendor companies, which had submitted the PIC claims, which were the subject of the investigations by IRAS and CAD.

12     According to Stephanie and Maurice, there was no involvement of the person named as Wu Hai Jun in the transactions for the incorporation of the applicant-companies and the buying and selling of software.

## The Defence’s case

13     The Accused’s defence was manifold, ranging from attacking the credibility of the Prosecution Witnesses, to saying that there were no falsehoods in what he had told the witnesses, and that the enforcement agencies were pressurizing the key witnesses to finger him as the mastermind.

14     Specifically, the following is the gist of the Accused’s testimonies on the various aspects of his defence in this case:

a.      _Charge involving PW1: Stephanie Tan_

i.       Stephanie was not working for him. The Accused admitted that he had paid her to run errands. The Accused testified that he would give her “transport allowances” for tasks he had asked her to undertake on his behalf. However, he was not her employer. He did not pay her CPF contributions.

ii.       The Accused said that Stephanie knew Wu Hai Jun and she had bought software from him. The Accused alleged that Stephanie was involved in the software business with Wu Hai Jun and that she herself would have known that Wu Hai Jun was distributing or providing software.

iii.       Stephanie was running a travel agency “Peace Journey Travel Pte Ltd” when the Accused introduced Wu Hai Jun to her. The Accused found out that Wu Hai Jun and Stephanie had set up a company called O2O Pte Ltd and that Wu Hai Jun was supplying software to Stephanie.

b.      _Charge involving PW4: Maurice Tan_

i.       Maurice was not working for him. The Accused admitted that he had paid him to run errands. However, he was not his employer. He did not pay CPF contributions for Maurice.

ii.       The Accused did not instigate him to lie to the authorities that it was Wu Hai Jun who had told Maurice to incorporate the companies. The Accused never mentioned the word “police” when talking to Maurice.

c.      _Charge involving PW4: Wong Kwong Weng_

i.       The Accused did not know Wong Kwong Weng.

ii.       The Accused did not send those messages instigating Wong to give false information to the police.

d.      _Charge involving PW3: Tom Lee_

i.       He did not tell Tom to lie to the authorities.

ii.       Tom was aware of the PIC application by MRJ. Tom had seen the software.

iii.       He did ask Tom to direct IRAS to refer any queries to the Accused as the Accused was more familiar with the software. This showed that the Accused never intended to deflect any investigations of the PIC application for MRJ away.

e.      _Evidence about Wu Hai Jun_

i.       The Accused said that he knew Wu Hai Jun as Lao Wu in 2014. This Lao Wu was in the construction industry and had told the Accused that he was able to provide customized software.

ii.       He said that Lao Wu showed the software to him and he had spoken with Stephanie about it. It was only in 2016 that the Accused found out that Lao Wu’s name was Wu Hai Jun.

## Evaluation of the Evidence

15     The evidence in this case has to be seen holistically to be appreciated and assessed properly. In order to understand the nature and significance of the various parts of the evidence and the import of the different characteristics of the witnesses, my evaluation will not begin with the evidence of **PW1 Stephanie** who was the one working most closely with the Accused. Instead, I will start with the evidence of **PW6 Wong Kwong Weng**, the one who testified that he had never met the Accused face to face.

16     Before launching into the corpus of the analysis of the evidence, I am mindful of the point emphasized by the Defence that all the 4 key witnesses named individually in the respective charges were either accomplices or have self-interests to avoid criminality. Therefore, their evidence need to be “subjected to close and relentless scrutiny”, citing Justice VK Rajah in the case of _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_ .

17     Having said that, a close comparison of the evidence of Wong Kwong Weng and the evidence of the Accused would reveal that Wong was not an accomplice for the suspected fraud involved in the PIC applications. Wong testified that he did not know of the 94 fraudulent PIC applications made to IRAS involving Bao Tech as the vendor. Wong had not heard of Bao Tech or knew that he had been registered as a director of the company. The Accused testified that he did not know Wong and had no dealings with Wong. In this light, it is strictly not incumbent upon this Court to treat Wong’s evidence with caution under Section 116 illustration (b) of the Evidence Act, Chapter 97. Nevertheless, as can be seen in the following evaluation, this Court had subjected his evidence to a detailed examination.

### The Instigation of Wong Kwong Weng

18     The evidence of the Accused instigating Wong to pervert the course of justice is the most damning for the Accused and for which the Accused tried his best to distance himself from.

19     Wong testified that his “boss” instigated him to give false information to the police. Part of the instigation is evidenced by a series of messages over the mobile phone. These are found in Exhibits P24, P25 and P26. The exchange of messages between Wong and his “boss” was irrefutable evidence that the messages were clearly an attempt to pervert the course of justice. Wong testified that he communicated with “Boss” through the phone numbers xxx and subsequently through the phone numbers xxx.

20     Wong was paid by “Boss” $1,800 monthly salary for being the registered director of a construction company Techne Engineering Pte Ltd (“Techne”). Wong testified that Techne was a company which supplied construction workers to subcontractors or main contractors. “Boss” had told him over the phone that Wong would get half of the profit that is earned from the construction workers deployed.

21     Wong testified that the bank account for Techne was opened when Stephanie (who was also known as “Zi Ning” to Wong) called him and told him that the “boss” wanted Wong to follow her to the bank to open an account for Techne. This was corroborated by Stephanie’s testimony.

22     Wong provided “Boss” with his SingPass password via phone SMS. In fact, Wong had changed his SingPass password on one occasion which resulted in “Boss” not being able to log-in. “Boss” asked Wong and Wong provided him with the new SingPass password. Other than phone calls, he and “Boss” had communicated via WhatsApp and SMS but not through Email.

23     Wong testified that he was interviewed by IRAS on 5 October 2016 when they came to his house and was told that he was the registered director of Bao Tech Pte Ltd (“Bao Tech”). Wong was surprised as he was not aware of the company Bao Tech. He was told that many applications for PIC funds were made to IRAS and Bao Tech was named as the vendor providing the software to these applicant-companies. In total, there were 94 applicant-companies which had named Bao Tech as the vendor providing the software to them.

24     Wong testified that he did not know anything about the business activities of Bao Tech. He did not know when it was incorporated. He had no idea that he had been registered as a director of Bao Tech. When IRAS informed him and asked him questions about the various applicant-companies and about a person named Chester Lim Chit Foo, he told them he didn’t know anything about the companies or the named person.

25     After the IRAS interview, Wong called “Boss” and spoke to him angrily. Wong questioned him and asked him if he had used Wong’s NRIC number and SingPass details to cheat the government. “Boss” responded to Wong saying that it was not a problem and gave the impression that he will be able to fix it.

26     On the next day, 6 October 2016, there was an exchange of phone messages between Wong and “Boss”. Wong testified that “B” in the phone was the short form for “Boss”. The relevant message which occurred just before midnight of 6 October 2016 (as seen in Exhibit P24 photo 2) is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="30%"> <col width="70%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>Dun block my call, i do Sui Sui for u go change statement already also, now Ah Leong want take commission is not from me mah, we agreed $3000 i go take blame mah</em>” (message time: 23:54, 2016/10/6)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

This message clearly showed that Wong was to be given $3000 to be the scapegoat. Wong testified that “Boss” wanted him to take the blame for the IRAS case. A perusal of this message and other messages in Exhibit P24 would reveal many things and more, when these messages are placed side by side and read together with messages in Exhibit D29 of the relevant time-frames between Wong and Leong and Exhibit D30 between Wong and Stephanie.

27     In relation to the bribe of $3000 for Wong to be the scapegoat, Wong ultimately acknowledged receiving $2710 in the messages. This is arrived at by working through the series of phone messages in Exhibit P24 and Exhibit D29. Wong decided to let Leong take $260 as commission and another $30 for “makan” (see exchange of messages at photo 4 of P24 and page 1 of D29).

28     There were numerous such exchanges of messages interspersed throughout and it would be too cumbersome to cite them all. Therefore, in this Grounds of Decision, I would only make specific references to the most pertinent ones. I was mindful always to read these messages in context.

29     The next set of relevant messages occurred on 10 and 11 October 2016 (seen in P24 photos 6 and 7). There was one message sent by Wong at 8.19pm on 10 October 2016 and 4 messages between them on 11 October 2016 the following day, between 4.11pm and 4.15pm as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="35%"> <col width="65%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>Call me bro, i want to know whats happening, why need lawyer already, they going to charge me?</em>” (message time: 20:19, 2016/10/10)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">----------------- (the next day) ----------------</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“Boss”:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>U know what we call cover back side</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 16:11, 2016/10/11)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>What u mean?</em>” (message time: 16:11, 2016/10/11)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“Boss”:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>Find lawyer is help u dun talk much okay, I wun bring u into trouble</em>” (message time: 16:13, 2016/10/11)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>Ok bro, i trust u</em>” (message time: 16:15, 2016/10/11)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

These messages showed that Wong was informed of needing a lawyer. The response by “Boss” indicated that a lawyer was being engaged to keep Wong out of trouble. Wong testified during EIC (Examination-in-Chief) that “Boss” said that he will find Trident law firm to deal with it.

30     In the midst of the messages between Wong and “Boss” around the period after 5 October 2016, which is the date of the IRAS interviews, and before 1 November 2016 which is the day of the CAD statements, other messages and events happened as well. These involved Wong, Stephanie, Leong and Maurice. A perusal of all the phone messages from 6 to 11 October 2016 between Wong and “Boss” (in Exhibit P24) and between Wong and Stephanie (in Exhibit D30) would reveal the following:

a.     Wong kept asking “Boss” for his salary of $1800. “Boss” asked Wong to call Stephanie. In the afternoon of 8 October 2016, Wong contacted Stephanie via phone messages and she finally transferred his salary of $1800, as promised by “Boss”, via ATM (Automated Teller Machine) around 9pm at night, after finishing her housework.

b.     On 11 October 2016, Wong and Stephanie went to the Trident law firm at Peninsula Plaza. Wong was given the address and name of the law firm: _111 North Bridge Road Peninsula Plaza #11-04 Trident Law Corporation_ (see page 5 of Exhibit D29). A series of phone messages between Wong and Stephanie on Tuesday, 11 October 2016 in Exhibit D30 at pages 3, 4, 5 and 6 confirmed that they went to the law firm at around 2pm on that day. Wong testified in EIC that Maurice was at the law firm as well. Wong spoke to the lawyer at the firm about what he had told IRAS on 5 October 2016. Subsequently in the same afternoon of 11 October 2016, the following exchange of phone messages took place (as cited earlier):

31     From a further perusal of subsequent phone messages between Wong and “Boss” on 14 October 2016, it can be seen that “Boss” was very unhappy with Wong for revealing at the law firm that “Boss” was an investor. Wong told “Boss” that he was only echoing Stephanie’s version given at the law firm:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="30%"> <col width="70%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>I not the one say you invest, Zining say u invest so i follow, call me can</em>” (message time: 9:17, 2016/10/14)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

32     A few days later, on 17 October 2016, in an exchange of phone messages between Wong and Stephanie the following was revealed (at Page 7 of D30):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="34%"> <col width="66%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>I dun want who to find &amp; what to say, u must guide me la</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 11:14, 2016/10/17)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Stephanie:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>U every time big mouth who guide also no use..

From the aforesaid exchange of messages, it is significant to note that Stephanie had mentioned at the law firm that Chester was an investor and Wong had followed suit. This development had angered “Boss”.

33     The subsequent messages between Wong and “Boss” showed that “Boss” wanted Wong to make an SD (Statutory Declaration) at the law firm as can be seen from the following on 25 October 2016 (at P24 photo 18):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2" colsep="1" frame="none" rowsep="1"><colgroup><col width="31%"> <col width="69%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>Boss, the lawyer at trident have not call me yet for the SD, pls kindly help to ask, thank u</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 10:14, 2016/10/25)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“Boss”:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>I settlw</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 13:15, 2016/10/25)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">Wong:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>U say I need to do the SD then u would gv me my salary?</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 13:17, 2016/10/25)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>I never told the lawyer i amend my statement at IRAS, i think thats not their business to know</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 13:19, 2016/10/25)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">“<em>To tell u the truth, i never expect Zhining &amp; Ah Leong brother to say u are investor, i no choice but to follow</em>”</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="QuoteList-Table-1">(message time: 13:15, 2016/10/25)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

There is therefore clear evidence here, based on the exchanges of messages and the reactions therein, that “Boss” was named by Wong, Stephanie and Leong as the investor and that “Boss” was Chester.

34     Finally, we move onto Exhibits P25 and P26. Exhibit P25 shows the phone messages exchanged between Wong and “Boss” even though the phone number of “Boss” is different from the phone number reflected in Exhibit P24. This inference is based on the nature of the phone messages exchanged, as well as based on the persons and entities referred to in the messages. The contents of the messages in P24 and P25 showed a continuation of the communications between Wong and “Boss” using first the phone number xxx and later the phone number xxx. Wong testified that the person he was communicating with for these two numbers was “Boss”.

35     Exhibit P26 contained pictures, sent by “Boss” via WhatsApp, of the passport and the work permit card of Wu Hai Jun. The personal particulars and details of this person, together with the photo of Wu Hai Jun, can be seen in the transmitted pictures. This clearly showed, as testified by Wong, that Wong had previously not known and had no idea who the person named Wu Hai Jun was. Wong testified that “Boss” told him Wu Hai Jun was a programmer of software for Bao Tech and if CAD asked, Wong can say that to the police officers at CAD. “Boss” clearly wanted Wong to push everything to Wu Hai Jun.

36     In the defence of the Accused, on the charge involving Wong, the Defence Counsel kept harping on the fact that Wong did not know who the “boss” was and argued that the Accused must therefore be acquitted. However, the connection or linkage to the Accused was inescapable. Furthermore, the telephone numbers xxx used by “Boss” is also linked to the Accused, when it was shown by the Prosecution that Bernard Ng (PW2) had sold the hand-phone together with that number to the Accused.

37     In my assessment of Wong as a witness, he is definitely not a babe in the woods. He is a wily and shrewd man who knows his way around. In the way that he tried to seek financial gain from “Boss” for having made use of him as the registered director of Bao Tech in the PIC fraudulent applications, Wong had demonstrated that he is not a trustworthy character. Nevertheless, that did not mean his evidence cannot be accepted as reflecting the truth, when that truth is firmly grounded in contemporaneous phone messages confirming Wong’s testimony.

38     After having scrutinized Wong’s testimony and assessing it together with the objective evidence of the series of phone messages, not only in the communications with “Boss” but also cross-checked against the messages with Stephanie, corroborated by her testimony that the Accused was their “boss” and he had instructed her to bring Wong to open a bank account for Techne, there is every reason to find that “Boss” is the Accused - Chester Lim. The Accused could offer no more than his bare denial in the face of the totality of the evidence.

39     The charge against the Accused for instigating Wong is therefore proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

### The Instigation of Maurice

40     PW4 Maurice Tan testified that he started to work under the Accused by running errands for him in his foreign manpower supply business. Maurice would bring foreign workers to do medical check-ups and thumb-printing for the collection of work permits. Initially, Maurice would be paid based on the number of workers and trips. Subsequently, the Accused would pay him a monthly sum of $1,800.

41     In time, the Accused asked Maurice to become the director and shareholder of several companies. Maurice agreed to do so as the Accused was his boss and the Accused had told him it would be a temporary arrangement until the companies could be sold off or closed down. Maurice was told that these companies were dormant _i.e._ not carrying on any business. Maurice would receive $2000 to $3000 for re-packaging and re-sale of companies. The Accused used Maurice’s SingPass details to carry out the registration of companies. Maurice had passed his authentication dongle to Stephanie. Maurice also collected the Easy Access Code from IRAS for these companies.

42     The upshot of all these is that it was the Accused who had involved Maurice in the setting up of these business entities or the taking over of companies. It was not anyone by the name of Wu Hai Jun.

43     DPP Stacey Fernandez took Maurice through the documents for the application for PIC claims of companies in which Maurice was a named director. It was obvious that Maurice initially had no idea that these PIC claims were being made. Subsequently, Maurice received letters from IRAS about the outcomes of the PIC applications. A few of these companies were involved in the applications for PIC claims and Maurice got to know about them when he received these letters from IRAS. He would inform the Accused. For the first few letters, the Accused would ask him to open and read out the letters. Subsequently the Accused just asked for the letters and Maurice would hand them to the Accused or Stephanie.

44     On 5 October 2016, IRAS visited Maurice at his residence and was brought to IRAS for investigations. Two weeks prior to this day, Maurice had stopped working for the Accused as they had some disputes over remuneration payments – actually the dispute was over the payment of the “company car” with his “salary”. After being interviewed by IRAS, Maurice contacted his close friend Thomas Mah and told him about being investigated by IRAS. Thomas had also done work for the Accused. The Accused came to know about Maurice being interviewed by IRAS and tried to contact Maurice. Maurice refused to accept his calls but the Accused finally managed to speak to Maurice after getting Thomas to call Maurice and the Accused taking over the call.

45     The Accused had wanted to find out what IRAS had asked Maurice. The Accused asked Maurice to meet him but Maurice refused. The Accused then told Maurice that he wasn’t the one who had done those things. The Accused tried to explain to Maurice how the problems with IRAS came about. The Accused said to Maurice that if anybody were to ask, just tell them the truth, it’s Wu Hai Jun was the one who was doing it (sic).

46     About 2-3 weeks before 5 October 2016, _i.e_. before being called up by IRAS, Maurice had lunch with Thomas. A man which Maurice had not met before by the name of Wu Hai Jun was also at the lunch. That was the only time he knew of such a person and such a person had no dealings with Maurice at all. It was Thomas who told Maurice that Wu Hai Jun was a construction worker working for one of the Accused’s construction companies. Maurice also confirmed that he had met one Lao Wu before. Maurice testified that Lao Wu was a construction worker but Lao Wu is not Wu Hai Jun \[_page 12, 15 November 2017 NE_\]. He had met Wu Hai Jun with Thomas at the food court once only.

47     Maurice was called up by CAD on 1 November 2016 for investigations. Subsequently, on 11 November 2016, Maurice went with Thomas to a law firm to make a Statutory Declaration (Exhibit D1).

48     The evidence on the instigation of Maurice is encapsulated in the following testimony during the EIC of Maurice:

Q:All right. So when Chester told you, “If anybody were to ask, just tell them the truth, it’s Wu Hai Jun was the one who was doing it.” Now, “if anybody were to ask”, what did you understand by this “anybody”?

A:I could only assume IRAS, the government authorities, that would ask me regarding this matter.

Q:And then when he said “it’s Wu Hai Jun who was the one who was doing it”, what do you understand “doing it” referred to?

A:The application, the paperworks, the necessary transferring of the names for the company, or the process by which they were discussing for the companies, the buyover and selling.

49     The Defence Counsel stressed that there was no mention of the police by the Accused. That is a valid observation, however, that is not the end of the matter and the Accused cannot thereby be acquitted. Obviously, such statements given in the EIC and in the course of a trial cannot be seen or read or understood in isolation.

50     The Defence Counsel’s submissions on the insufficiency of the evidence of Maurice vis-à-vis the charge are appealing only if the evidence is seen in isolation and without context appreciation. The Defence Counsel argues that there was no mention of the police and there was no discussion of the PIC applications. Giving credence to these arguments put forth by the Defence would be taking a very narrow view of what was really happening in that telephone conversation. It would require the Court to overlook the entirety of what had transpired in Maurice’s dealings with the Accused for the various companies named in the PIC cash payouts.

51     Maurice had handed over all the letters concerning the PIC applications and outcomes from IRAS for these companies to the Accused. This was not challenged by the Defence. One cannot be blinded to the larger picture that the Accused had specifically mentioned to Maurice the name of Wu Hai Jun during that telephone conversation with the clear intent of pushing all the blame to Wu Hai Jun. The phrase “if anybody were to ask” may appear very general and non-specific but within the context of the telephone conversation, it was not some throwaway lines or words uttered thoughtlessly.

52     Maurice had testified that he was angry at the Accused for causing the problems he was encountering with IRAS. Maurice did not inform the Accused about being hauled up by IRAS but he informed his close friend Thomas. Maurice refused to take the calls from the Accused. Subsequently, it was through Thomas’ phone that the Accused managed to speak to Maurice.

53     It is not disputed that it was a brief telephone conversation and the Accused clearly wanted to pacify Maurice from getting all worked up. The Accused wanted to meet up with Maurice to explain everything but Maurice appeared to be having none of it. In that light, the Accused seized upon the chance he had finally gotten to speak to Maurice, via Thomas’ phone, to mention the name of Wu Hai Jun and to emphasize that Wu Hai Jun was behind everything. So, the words “if anybody were to ask” were meant not just to refer to IRAS but to other investigative or enforcement agencies as well. That was what Maurice understood and that was what the words meant. Those words could not have been meant by the Accused to refer to some busybody or irrelevant people.

54     The Accused was obviously anxious for Maurice to inform the authorities that it was Wu Hai Jun and not himself. Counsel for the Accused raised the argument that it was not unlawful for the Accused to tell a witness to speak the truth. This begs the rhetorical question to be asked: Maurice had to be told “the truth” because Maurice did not know “the truth”? The truth for Maurice, which he had clearly testified, was that it was the Accused and only the Accused who had instructed him to register the companies, amongst other tasks. No one else. Maurice did not take any instructions from the person named Wu Hai Jun, to incorporate companies or to do anything related to companies.

55     Significantly, Maurice testified and clarified in response to the question by DPP on the roles of the Accused vis-à-vis the companies involving Maurice (at Page 48 NE 14 November 2017):

Q:And why did you not follow what Chester had told you in relation to telling people, if you are asked, that the truth is Wu Hai Jun was the one who was doing it?

A:Before that, I have never liaised with Wu Hai Jun before. Not even see him. Only see him that once only. But the person who came to talk to me regarding the companies, everything all, was Chester. So all along, I had said as Chester -- my thinking was Chester was the one who had been doing it all along so - - that’s why I never add in the why thinking - - I never said it was done by Wu Hai Jun what. From my understanding is Chester is the one, because he is the one who has been liaising with me all along.

Q:When you say liaising with you, liaising with you to do what?

A:Setting up the company, those new companies that I am the director, or take over.

56     Rounding up the findings for the evidence of Maurice, the last significant piece of evidence turned out ironically to be an exhibit tendered by the Defence. That was the very first piece of evidence put in by the Defence and marked Exhibit D1. D1 is a Statutory Declaration made by Maurice on 11 November 2016. It was a strange declaration in that it was highly self-incriminating for Maurice to make such a declaration. It is clear from a perusal of the contents of the Statutory Declaration that its purpose was to exonerate the Accused. The thrust of that Statutory Declaration was for the benefit of the Accused and cast aspersions on the CAD officers investigating the PIC fraud. Maurice said that Thomas did most of the talking when making the Statutory Declaration.

57     In view of an objection by the Defence that the Accused did not mention “police”, the Court might have amended the charge from “police” to “IRAS” since the situation was that Maurice, Stephanie, Wong and the Accused were being investigated by IRAS for PIC fraudulent claims. However, it is well within the contemplation of the Accused that the police would be one of the investigative agencies when he said to Maurice: “If anybody were to ask.” Therefore, I found no necessity to amend the charge against the Accused for the instigation of Maurice.

### The Completed Offence involving Stephanie

58     PW1 Stephanie is a co-accused for the cheating charges, in that she has been named as an accused person in a few of those cheating charges together with the Accused. Therefore, her evidence needed to be carefully scrutinized before being accepted.

59     The elements of the Section 204A Penal Code charge involving Stephanie, which the Prosecution has to prove in order to establish the offence against the Accused, are:

a.     Stephanie had falsely informed the police that she knew that one “Wu Hai Jun” had sold computer software to companies in which she was a director or shareholder. It is a completed offence of perverting the course of justice.

b.     It was false that she knew that one “Wu Hai Jun” had sold computer software to companies in which she was a director or shareholder.

c.     The Accused had caused Stephanie to inform the police of this falsehood, which is that she had personal knowledge of “Wu Hai Jun” and what he had done.

d.     The Accused had the intention to pervert the course of justice in doing so. In this case, it was to deflect the attention of the police in their investigations into the alleged fraudulent PIC claims away from him and onto one Wu Hai Jun.

### The Causation for Stephanie giving a false statement to CAD

60     Stephanie testified that she had lied to the CAD on 1 November 2016. She had given false information in her first statement, Exhibit P2, to the CAD officers when she was questioned about the software purchases listed in the fraudulent PIC applications to IRAS. In particular, she had falsely named Wu Hai Jun as the middleman of these software purchases. She had also falsely informed the CAD officers that she had handed payments to Wu Hai Jun for those software purchases.

61     She testified that the truth was that she had transferred to the Accused the monies received from IRAS. These were payments received by her companies for the PIC claims. She did not know Wu Hai Jun and she did not buy software from him or his sources. The reason for her lying to CAD was to keep the fact of the involvement of the Accused away from the CAD investigators. (It is to be borne in mind that she could keep out the involvement of the Accused because the Accused was not officially connected to any of the companies involved.)

62     Stephanie testified that the Accused was her “boss” and she took instructions from him. Before Stephanie knew the Accused, she was working at a company called I-Card Solutions. It was at this place she got to know PW4 Maurice. At that time when she knew Maurice, he told her that he was working for the Accused. Subsequently, around May 2013, Maurice introduced her to work at a company selling bedsheets. After two months, Stephanie went to work at a company called Kim Interior. Although the registered director of the company was one Kendrick, Stephanie came to know later that the Accused was the boss of Kim Interior through Maurice. After Kim Interior, Stephanie worked for the Accused at Teo Con Pte Ltd in late 2013. Again, the Accused was not a registered director of Teo Con Pte Ltd. Stephanie carried out administrative duties at Teo Con Pte Ltd. Her salary at Teo Con Pte Ltd was initially $1,200. It was raised to $1,300 after Stephanie asked the Accused for a raise of $100.

63     Since late 2013, Stephanie had been taking instructions from the Accused. Amongst the instructions given to her were to incorporate companies. Prior to 2014, Stephanie was not involved in any incorporation activities. Between 2014 and 2016, upon the instructions and directions of the Accused, she became directors and shareholders of many companies. One of her main roles was the collection of the cash payouts from the PIC Scheme in the form of IRAS payment cheques and banking them for the Accused.

64     It has to be borne in mind that Stephanie is not the employee of the Accused in the sense that she only works for a company of his and he is her employer paying her a monthly wage and making CPF contributions for her. It is to be understood properly from her evidence (and the totality of the evidence of the other witnesses such as Maurice and Wong) that she was taking instructions from him and following his leadership in the various activities such as incorporating or registering business entities, receiving directions on collecting payments, banking them or delivering documents. For example, Stephanie had brought Wong to open a bank account for the company Techne upon the instructions of the Accused. This was corroborated by Wong’s testimony. Stephanie summed up her idea of the Accused being her boss as: “Chester. He’s the boss behind this. He was the paymaster. He was the main investor.” \[NE 21 August 2017 at page 37 line 20-21\]

65     On 5 October 2016, IRAS brought Stephanie, Maurice Tan, DW5 Thomas Mah to IRAS for investigations. They were all interviewed by IRAS officers and released. A few days later, Stephanie was told to meet at a law firm by the Accused. The Accused had also called Thomas and Kas to go to the law firm, which was the Trident law firm. The Accused, Stephanie, Thomas and Kas met the lawyers at the law firm and they talked to the lawyers about what had happened at IRAS.

66     A few days after the meeting at the Trident law firm, the Accused called Stephanie and mentioned to her that he had dealings with Wu Hai Jun for the purchase of software. Stephanie understood the Accused to be trying “to pacify us that there was someone selling the software to us”. \[NE 23 August 2017 page 8 line 9-12\]

67     On 23 October 2016, Stephanie sent an email (Exhibit P5) to the Accused with an attachment. The attachment (Exhibit P5C) was a written account of events related to the IRAS investigations which the law firm had requested. Stephanie had sent it to the Accused as he had requested to look at it before it is sent to the lawyer. The Accused told Stephanie that she might overlook some details and he might have to remind her. After Stephanie had sent the written accounts to the Accused, the Accused called her. Stephanie’s testimony on this was: “he called and said that he had mentioned Wu Hai Jun which had to be added to the details” \[NE 23 August 2017 page 18 line 2-3\] and “Things like we bought software from this person.” \[NE 23 August 2017 page 18 line 5\] After the details about Wu Hai Jun were added to the written accounts by Stephanie, the Accused told her to proceed to send them to the lawyer and she did so.

68     I understand the Prosecution’s case for the charge against the Accused of causing Stephanie to lie to CAD on 1 November 2016 to refer to the series of acts of the Accused calling her after the meeting at the Trident law firm to tell her about the involvement of Wu Hai Jun selling software to them and again telling her to add the details that they had bought software from Wu Hai Jun into the written accounts before sending them to the lawyer. By these series of acts, after the IRAS interview on 5 October 2016, the Accused had caused Stephanie to lie to CAD on 1 November 2016.

#### Impeachment and ruling: Stephanie

69     The Defence applied to impeach the credit of Stephanie by using Exhibit D10 which was a statement given by Stephanie to CAD on 4 May 2017. In this statement, she said that the contents of her SD of 3 November 2016 were true. In Court, she had said that some of the contents of the SD of 3 November 2016 was not true. Stephanie tried to explain that actually, she did not see the SD after it was made but believed it should be true. But subsequently, when she saw the contents of the SD shown to her by the authorities, there were some parts that she was not aware had been included and which were not true.

70     Similarly, the Defence Counsel referred to Exhibit P4 which was a police report lodged on 13 February 2017 in which she said that the SD of 3 November 2016 was a false statement and that she was pressurized by her boss the Accused. However, in Court, she said that she had made the SD of 3 November 2016 for her own protection. Stephanie’s explanation for this is that she was both pressurized by her boss the Accused, as well as the SD was done for her own protection.

71     My ruling on the impeachment proceedings is that Stephanie’s credit had been impeached. Her explanations for her inconsistencies were rather weak. In fact, it is not difficult to see that Stephanie is prone to change her stance and be manipulated. Therefore, her testimony in this trial must be carefully analysed and corroborated by objective evidence or other witnesses before it can be accepted as truthful evidence.

#### Findings from Stephanie’s evidence

72     After a careful analysis of Stephanie’s testimony and the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that the Accused had caused her to lie to CAD.

73     Throughout the Examination, Cross-examination and Re-examination of Stephanie in the course of this trial, together with the testimonies of the rest of the witnesses in this trial, it is clear that Stephanie was deeply involved in the PIC applications of the applicant-companies and the receipt of the payments from IRAS for the successful claims. Stephanie was the registered director and shareholder in many of the applicant-companies. She had received the approval letters from IRAS for the PIC claims. Payments of the cash payouts from IRAS to the successful applicant-companies had been banked in by her into the companies’ bank accounts. Therefore, Stephanie’s evidence on what transpired from the PIC transactions were based on what she had personally and directly seen, heard and done.

74     Stephanie’s testimony about her taking instructions from the Accused is corroborated by the evidence of Maurice and Wong. Stephanie’s evidence that she had channelled the PIC cash payouts to the Accused was not challenged in the Cross-examination of Stephanie. Stephanie said that she was paid $1,000 commission for each cheque deposited and the monies withdrew by her. \[NE 21 August 2017 page 48 lines 4-6\] The Accused took the position that there were indeed software purchases and whatever Stephanie received from the PIC cash payouts were given to him. He would purportedly pay Wu Hai Jun and other software vendors.

75     I accept Stephanie’s testimony that she did not know a person called Wu Hai Jun, that she did not purchase any software from such a person and that her knowledge of this person came from the Accused. I am fortified in this finding in view of the subsequent developments. Soon after the interviews of Stephanie, Maurice and the Accused by IRAS at the beginning of October 2016, several events took place.

76     The first was the Accused asking Stephanie and Wong to go to the law firm Trident on 11 October 2016. This is evidenced by the phone messages on that day in P24, D29 and D30.

77     Thereafter, Stephanie in preparing the written accounts to the lawyer of what transpired at IRAS, she had to run those drafts by the Accused. This is evidenced by P5 and P5C. The Accused told her to include Wu Hai Jun in the details for the written accounts.

78     And soon after the CAD interviews of Stephanie, Maurice and Thomas on 1 November 2016, further events took place. The Accused got Stephanie and Thomas to head to the law firm at Peninsula Plaza to make SDs against the CAD investigators and to exonerate the Accused. Furthermore, the Accused sent the photo and particulars of the person Wu Hai Jun to a chatgroup consisting of Stephanie, Thomas and Maurice for them to be able to identify the person. Although there was no documentary proof of the Accused sending such a message to this chatgroup, there was evidence in the mobile phone of Wong showing the existence of the photo and passport particulars sent to Wong by the Accused.

79     These events were highly significant to show the mind-set of the Accused around the time of October and November of 2016 in the midst of the IRAS and CAD investigations. The instructions to meet up with lawyers on more than one occasion, the making of the SDs against the CAD investigators and the retraction of statements incriminating the Accused. These acts showed the manipulation behind the scenes by the Accused and proved that it had been the Accused’s intentions all along to orchestrate the events to protect himself. The Accused was indeed the mastermind and puppet master. The Accused was aptly referred to as the “boss” by Stephanie and Wong.

### The Instigation of Tom

80     The instigation of Tom Lee is proved by way of a voice recording of a tele-conversation between Tom and the Accused.

81     Tom and the Accused were business partners in the running of a fashion apparel store under the company known as Stage Group (S) Pte Ltd (“Stage”). Tom was the registered director of Stage. The Accused was not a registered director or shareholder of this company. Nevertheless, the Accused took charge of issues related to government agencies using Tom’s SingPass details, with his consent. Their involvement in Stage was around 2012 to 2014.

82     In 2015, MRJ was incorporated and the same arrangement of Tom being in charge of sales and operations while the Accused took charge of liaising with government agencies was adopted. Despite there being no business for MRJ, an application for PIC funds for MRJ was submitted to IRAS on 4 November 2015 using Tom’s SingPass details. The application was approved and cash payouts were given to MRJ.

83     In October 2016, when investigations were carried out by IRAS into fraudulent PIC claims, Tom was called in for an interview by IRAS officers and asked about the purported software purchase by MRJ. Tom was not aware of the PIC application made in his name and he did not know that the cash payouts had been given.

84     Tom decided to call the Accused and secretly recorded their conversation. Tom sought to obtain the Accused’s explanation on why IRAS was looking into the MRJ claim of PIC funds. The relevant parts of the transcript P13 of the tele-conversations are as follows:

85     In the above series of exchanges of conversation over the phone, the Accused told Tom to tell the investigators that Tom had bought the software for MRJ and had seen it being used in the office. Following the tele-conversations, the Accused sent to Tom a hyperlink via WeChat to a software purportedly bought by MRJ and this is reflected in Exhibit P14B, s/n 46 to 51.

86     I agree with the Prosecution’s submissions for this charge that the aforesaid incontrovertible evidence of an audio recording of the tele-conversation between the Accused and Tom and the WeChat hyperlink to the purported software bought by MRJ, proves the Accused’s instigation of Tom to intentionally pervert the course of justice. Tom was asked to say that he had bought the software and that it had been used in the MRJ office when in fact he had not bought any software for MRJ and he had not seen the software being used in the office.

#### Impeachment and ruling: Tom

87     The Defence attempted to impeach the credit of Tom as a witness by reference to Tom’s statement to CAD marked as D22 recorded on 30 November 2016.

88     The Defence Counsel prepared a table to show the inconsistencies and this was marked D23 containing 12 alleged inconsistencies but after some clarification in court, the number of inconsistencies was pared down to 4:

(a)     Tom told CAD that a phone number given in the PIC forms belong to the Accused when in fact it belonged to Tom.

(b)     Tom told CAD that he was not aware of the PIC claim by MRJ when he testified that he knew of the claim but not the context.

(c)     Tom told CAD that he was not aware of a PIC claim by Stage on 23 April 2015 but he testified that he was aware that a grant had been approved for Stage in 2015.

(d)     Tom told CAD that he did not know that IRAS had approved a PIC claim by MRJ submitted on 4 November 2015. However, one of Tom’s WeChat exchanges with the Accused (D20 page 146), showed that Tom was aware of a PIC payout for MRJ.

89     I agree with the Defence that Tom’s credit has been impeached. Tom was not able to adequately explain the material inconsistencies. Therefore, as in the case of Stephanie, Tom’s evidence needed to be scrutinized before any part of it could be regarded as reliable evidence.

#### Findings from Tom’s evidence

90     After a careful analysis of Tom’s testimony and the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that the Accused had instigated Tom to give false information to the police. Tom was aware of the PIC grant paid out by IRAS but he was clearly not aware of the details of the online PIC application. Tom had not bought any software for MRJ or seen its use in the office.

91     The testimony of Tom on the Accused’s attempt to pervert the course of justice by instigation is incontrovertibly corroborated by the proof of the audio recording which clearly showed:

(a)     Tom asking the Accused if the Accused had submitted the MRJ claim using Tom’s name. The Accused replied to say it was Danny.

(b)     Tom asking the Accused what to say if he was asked by the authorities and the Accused replied that Tom was to tell them Tom had bought the software.

(c)     Tom said that he did not know about the software and the Accused told Tom to say that he had seen the software being used in the company. The Accused further added that he will provide Tom with all the necessary documents to show to them.

(d)     The Accused confirmed that Tom did not know anything and what the situation was like for MRJ because Tom was overseas at the relevant time.

92     Regardless of the credit of Tom having been impeached in the course of the trial, Tom’s testimony of his lack of personal knowledge of the purported cash purchase of a Customer Relationship Management software from Technetronic Pte Ltd is corroborated by the Accused’s responses in the telephone conversation when Tom called him to explain why IRAS was looking into the MRJ claim of PIC funds.

93     Tom’s not knowing of the existence of the software and its purported use in the company of MRJ is also confirmed by the Accused’s instructions to Tom during the telephone conversation to tell the investigators falsely that Tom had seen the software and it being used by the people in MRJ. Furthermore, the Accused found it necessary to send Tom a hyperlink via WeChat to access the software. The inevitable conclusion has to be that Tom was being instigated by the Accused to give false information to the authorities investigating the matter.

### Evaluation of the Accused’s Defence

94     The Accused elected to give evidence.

95     In gist, the Accused is asking the Court to disregard the testimonies of Stephanie, Maurice, Wong and Tom which incriminated him. For the reasons I have given when analysing the evidence of Stephanie, Maurice, Wong and Tom, the material parts of their evidence against the Accused, though not flawless, were more than sufficient to be accepted as proved facts.

96     The Accused is also throwing accusations against the enforcement authorities of fabricating evidence and pressurizing witnesses to point to him as the mastermind. I have found no basis for these accusations.

97     In evaluating the Accused’s evidence in court, there were the following pertinent aspects of his evidence which stood out and which have led this Court to disbelieve his defence:

(a)     The Accused denied that he was the boss of Stephanie and Maurice. This denial flies in the face of the overwhelming evidence and clear testimonies of both of them that proved they were taking instructions from him and were paid by him. A few prime examples would illustrate this point:

(i)       Stephanie worked for the Accused at Teo Con Pte Ltd and when she wanted a raise, she asked the Accused and was granted a monthly increase of $100 from him, even though he was not officially her employer.

(ii)       Stephanie would receive the cash payouts from IRAS for the applicant-companies and deposit the cheque payments into the bank accounts of the applicant-companies. She would subsequently withdraw cash amounts of these payments and give them to the Accused. The Accused did not deny receiving these amounts but claimed that he would pass the monies to the vendors. Stephanie would receive commissions of $1,000 from him.

(iii)       Maurice had testified and this was not challenged, that the Accused had asked him to incorporate or take over companies for resale. Maurice also testified that he would receive approval or rejection letters from IRAS. Initially, he would open up the letters before handing them over to the Accused. Subsequently, such IRAS letters were just handed over to the Accused.

(b)     The Accused’s bare denial of knowing Wong and communicating with him via phone messages was not credible. The links with Stephanie and the use of the phone number xxx traced back to the Accused as being “Boss” to Wong. The nature of the phone messages and the specific details such as the timings, the activities such as being asked to see the lawyer at Trident law firm, the sending of the particulars of Wu Hai Jun, point inexorably to the conclusion that Wong was taking instructions from the Accused.

(c)     The Accused realised that he could not deny telling Maurice that everything was the doing of Wu Hai Jun, decided to minimize the nature of his explanation to Maurice when he finally managed to contact Maurice through the phone of Thomas. The arguments of the Defence zoomed in on the brevity of the Accused’s attempt to shift the blame to Wu Hai Jun and to say that the Accused was only asking him to speak the truth. Maurice understood that the Accused clearly meant for him to point everything to Wu Hai Jun. Maurice knew this was not true as it had always been the Accused who had interacted with Maurice on the matters which the authorities were conducting investigations on.

(d)     The Accused’s twisted interpretations to the tele-conversation he had with Tom in which he had instigated Tom to lie about the MRJ claim for PIC cash payouts deserve short shrift. It was patently absurd for the Accused to claim that he was discussing applications made by Stage instead of the application of MRJ. No more need be said about this.

98     I found the Accused to be an evasive witness in the course of his Cross-examination by the DPP. There are many examples of his prevarications cited by the Prosecution throughout their closing submissions on his answers given in respect of the individual charges and I won’t repeat them here.

99     Throughout the trial I have also observed another facet of his defence. There is a blatant attempt by the Accused to deny any connections to him whenever he could, be it phones or email account. When it suited the Accused, he would play down the instructions he had given to Stephanie and Maurice or simply gave a bare denial. The preponderance of evidence in the testimonies of Stephanie and Maurice of their frequent communications with the Accused had not been challenged. The fact of their close working relationships with the Accused is clear and not seriously in doubt. The Accused did not deny working with them, even if he denied being their boss. The questions posed to them in Cross-examination also revealed an intimate knowledge on the part of the Accused of how they operate at work. The evidence of their interactions with the Accused, their testimonies of receiving instructions and directions from the Accused via the emails and phones, are undeniable and can be accepted as facts.

100    I agree with the submissions of the Defence Counsel that the Accused’s credit cannot be impeached based on an inconsistent one-liner or a single facet. Therefore, I am not able to rule that his credit has been impeached by the Prosecution in the impeachment proceedings. However, the Accused does not need to be successfully impeached for the Court to disregard his evidence on the material points or find his evidence to be against the weight of the totality of the evidence, and find that the Prosecution’s case has been sufficiently proven against him.

### Testimonies of the Defence Witnesses

101    DW2 Teo Chek Siew, DW3 James Owyong, DW4 Edward and DW6 Ravinderpal gave evidence which were fairly neutral. Their evidence was not open to doubt but I found that their evidence was not germane to the material issues at hand. One aspect stood out from the evidence of DW3 and DW6 in that it was the Accused who had engaged them to deal with the SDs to be made by Stephanie, Thomas, Maurice and Kas. This is not surprising since the main thrust of their SDs was to exonerate the Accused and cast the CAD investigators in negative light.

102    The evidence of DW5 Thomas Mah was in the main in support of the Accused and sought to discredit Stephanie. Thomas gave evidence that he had met Wu Hai Jun and knew him as Lao Wu. I found Thomas’ evidence of his interactions with Wu Hai Jun to be bare assertions. Other aspects of his evidence were also much tailored to suit and dovetail with the Accused’s evidence. The credit of Thomas as a witness was also impeached by the Prosecution. Therefore, his evidence ought to be accepted only after close scrutiny and with corroboration, for which I found none.

103    The Prosecution successfully impeached the credit of DW5 with the many inconsistent statements he had given in the course of investigations and in court. In his statements to the CAD, he identified the Accused as his boss but denied this in court. In his CAD statements, Thomas identified the Accused as the person who was the mastermind but he seemed to suggest that either Stephanie or Stephanie’s boss, who is not the Accused, was the person involved in the fraudulent applications to IRAS for the PIC funds. The Prosecution had listed the various inconsistencies of Thomas testimony and his CAD statements in Table 3 of their Closing Submissions which I found to be more than sufficient to show the unreliability of Thomas as a witness.

104    I accept Prosecution’s submissions that Thomas was not able to explain the many material inconsistencies and he was simply trying to “cover up” for the Accused. In view of the absence of corroborative evidence to give credence to Thomas’ versions of events and in the light of the totality of evidence tendered in the course of this trial, which contradicted much of what Thomas is testifying to, I reject the evidence of Thomas.

## Summary of findings leading to the Convictions

105    Defence Counsel was right to submit that we cannot cherry-pick the evidence in favour of the Prosecution and ignore the evidence unfavourable to the Prosecution. The evidence and testimonies and credibility of the witnesses must be examined specifically and also assessed holistically. I agree we need to scrutinize the evidence carefully but at the same time we need to stand back and see what was really going on. We cannot miss the wood for the trees.

106    The consistent testimonies on material aspects of Stephanie, Maurice and Wong touching on the perversion of the course of justice by the Accused corroborated each other. Their evidence pointed to the Accused being the one who had instructed them to attribute involvement in matters and companies related to the highly suspect PIC applications to one “Wu Hai Jun”. Objective evidence such as emails exchanged between Stephanie and the Accused, text messages between Wong and the Accused, all supported these material witnesses’ testimonies. The directions given by the Accused for Stephanie, Wong, Maurice and Thomas to go to the Trident law firm on different occasions, principally to retract CAD statements pointing at the Accused as the mastermind, and to make SDs exonerating the Accused revealed a clear intent to thwart CAD investigations by the Accused.

107    As for the lines of Defence being run by the Accused in this trial, the thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was that, on the one hand, the Accused is suggesting to these people to say that one Wu Hai Jun was responsible and the Accused was uninvolved beyond being a conduit. Yet, at the same time, the Accused is trying to say that the PIC claims might not be fraudulent at all. This is where these two inconsistent strands of the defence mounted by the Accused collapsed like a house of cards when properly weighed and considered.

108    If the PIC applications were not fraudulent, why was there a need to push the blame to a PRC national called Wu Hai Jun? Why not take ownership of the situation and just comply with the investigative processes and let the truth be out? It is all the more intriguing to note that the Accused had no official capacities in these companies and was not a registered director or shareholder. There was no reason for anyone to say that the Accused was involved unless the Accused was deeply involved. And there was no reason for the Accused to push any blame to anyone else if the applications had arisen from legitimate business transactions of the hundreds of companies involved.

109    There was a suggestion by the Defence to look at the Accused’s conduct only in the month of October 2015 and not before or beyond. In my view, it is too narrow and not in sync with realities to confine the _analysis_ of the acts of perverting the course of justice within just the month of October 2015. Of course the offences must be shown to have occurred within the time of investigations or at least within the time of contemplation of investigations. However, any prior conduct or communications and any subsequent conduct and communications must be relevant as well, to give a complete picture of what was going on. For example, the sending of the photo of Wu Hai Jun to the chat-group comprising Stephanie, Thomas and others, which occurred after 1 November 2016, betrayed the Accused’s intent - an intent to push the blame to Wu Hai Jun, a PRC worker who had already been convicted of some other offence and repatriated.

110    The buying or selling of the software in this case is not an essential element of Prosecution’s case. The DC’s attempt to say that the truth of the transactions and the involvement of Wu Hai Jun, if true, would exonerate the Accused, were “red herrings” and a failure to understand what the Section 204A charges were really about. The gravamen of the charges, involving Stephanie, Maurice and Wong, is the intent to cover up the involvement of the Accused and to deflect investigations away from him by the acts specified in those charges. The purpose was to send CAD on a different investigative trajectory, in the direction of Wu Hai Jun. Even if Wu Hai Jun had some part to play in the alleged scam, the crux of the matter was that the Accused was getting them to deflect attention away from his involvement. The post-offence events also reinforced this. The SDs were intended to protect the Accused.

111    Wu Hai Jun was a convenient person for the Accused to misdirect investigations to. Wu Hai Jun was a construction worker supplied by the Accused to contractors. Wu Hai Jun was no longer in Singapore as he had been repatriated due to offences he had committed and the Accused knew full well these facts. The Accused had Wu Hai Jun’s passport and work permit particulars and could furnish them to Stephanie, Maurice, Thomas and Wong.

112    Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the 4 charges were established beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on all the charges he was tried on.

## Submissions on sentence

113    The Prosecution sought a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for the completed offence of Section 204A of the Penal Code and 10 months’ imprisonment each for the 3 attempted offences of Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code. The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of imprisonment of 30 months because they were of the view that only two sentences needed to be run consecutively.

114    The Prosecution’s submissions of the individual sentences were based on the following factors:

(a)     There is a need to send a strong signal that such offences of perverting the course of justice cannot be condoned. General deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle.

(b)     The Accused’s acts in misleading the CAD in its investigations were deliberate, pre-meditated and conducted over a period of time.

(c)     The Accused’s criminal antecedents showed that he was a recalcitrant offender. He had been convicted previously of abetment of the giving of false information to the Ministry of Manpower. Therefore, specific deterrence is another relevant sentencing principle in this case.

115    The Prosecution submitted that the sentences for the offender in the case of _PP v Yeo Jiawei_ (“_Yeo’s case_”) should provide the reference for the sentencing of the Accused. In _Yeo’s case_, the offender was convicted of 3 charges under Section 204A read with Section 511 of the Penal Code (the 3 attempted offences) and one count of Section 204A read with Section 116 of the Penal Code. _Yeo_ was sentenced to a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment each for the 3 attempted offences.

116    The Prosecution highlighted the similarities and the differences for _Yeo’s case_ and for our case to arrive at the proposed sentences for the Accused. _Yeo’s case_ and our case involved an offender attempting to pervert the course of justice through frustrating CAD’s investigations by asking witnesses to give false information to the police regarding the involvement of the offender. Both _Yeo_ and the Accused claimed trial. Yeo had no criminal antecedents but committed the offences whilst on bail. The Accused did not commit the offences whilst on bail but he has previous convictions (similar in nature but not identical) for the abetment of giving false information to MOM. The Prosecution also acknowledged that the primary offences under investigations in _Yeo’s case_ were of a larger scale. The Prosecution proposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for the 3 attempted offences for which the Accused had been convicted of and an imprisonment term of 20 months for the completed offence involving Stephanie.

117    In mitigation, the Accused put forth the argument that the Accused’s culpability was low as the Accused did not use any improper means such as bribery, coercion or threats. This submission is not correct in respect of the charge involving Wong where there was bribery. The Defence Counsel also submitted that the harm caused in this case was low and therefore, in comparison with _Yeo’s case_, the Accused’s sentence should be much lower.

## The appropriate sentence for each conviction

118    The dominant sentencing principle in this case is General Deterrence with a further consideration to be given to Specific Deterrence in view of the Accused’s fairly recent and similar but not identical criminal antecedents. I broadly accept the reference made by both the Prosecution and the Defence to _Yeo’s case_ as a relevant sentencing precedent, bearing in mind the similarities and differences highlighted by the DPPs and DCs.

119    The offence under Section 204A of the Penal Code is punishable with up to 7 years’ imprisonment or with fine or both. An attempted offence of Section 204A being read with Section 511 of the Penal Code would carry only a maximum of half of the length of imprisonment provided for that offence, which would be 3½ years.

120    A perusal of the sentencing precedents for an offence under Section 204A of the Penal Code would show that they cover a wide spectrum of factual circumstances and different types of specific acts. These acts could range from destroying evidence to suborning witnesses. In the light of this, _Yeo’s case_ appears to be a good reference point when considering the question of sentence. Both cases involve tampering with witnesses to affect CAD investigations.

121    For a start, a custodial sentence is warranted in view of the seriousness of the acts of the Accused in trying to thwart CAD investigations into the large-scale suspected fraudulent conduct. This alleged fraud is being perpetrated against a public agency _i.e_. IRAS and concerns the disbursements of large sums of public funds. The predicate offences are offences of Cheating and Forgery under the Penal Code as well as offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A.

122    Other offence-specific factors were the immense efforts of the Accused in gathering several key persons together, rather than just one single person, to come up with a common story to deflect the attention of the investigators away from him. The offences were also not one-off, spur-of-the-moment acts but a sustained and deliberate course of action over a period of time. There was also the employment of carefully thought-out strategies of using lawyers and SDs to craft “stories” or “versions” which cast aspersions on the integrity of investigative authorities.

123    As for the offender-specific factors, the one consideration that stood out was the Accused’s lack of remorse. In the present case, the Accused had claimed trial to the offences. He had also made serious allegations that the Prosecution witnesses were liars and had fabricated evidence against him. Another offender-specific factor was the criminal antecedents of the Accused for offences of abetment of giving false information to the Ministry of Manpower for which he had been incarcerated. The first conviction was in October 2011 for which he was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment for a single offence. The second occasion was in February 2012 for which he was sentenced to a total imprisonment of 8 months on 11 counts with 44 counts taken into consideration for sentencing. The Accused was clearly undeterred from perpetrating falsehoods. As for mitigating factors, there were none.

124    Weighing all the aforesaid sentencing factors, I was able to accept the calibration suggested by the Prosecution of an imprisonment term of 20 months for the completed Section 204A offence and an imprisonment term of 10 months each for the 3 attempted offences. However, I was unable to agree with the DPP’s submissions that only two of the sentences of imprisonment would suffice to run consecutively, namely, the sentence of 20 months for the completed offence and one of the 10-month sentences of imprisonment for the 3 attempted offences.

## The approach for the running of the sentences

125    Under the law, where there are more than 2 sentences of imprisonment imposed, at least 2 of them will have to be run consecutively. Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap. 68, provides that where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively. This, of course, does not mean that the Court is constrained to run two sentences consecutively and not more.

126    In my mind, to run only 2 of the imprisonment terms consecutively for this case would ignore the spirit behind and the clear principles enunciated in the High Court case of _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ (“_Raveen’s case_”). Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon held in _Raveen’s case_ that: “… _as a general rule, a multiple offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively_.” Admittedly, in the present case, all 4 offences, that the Accused had been convicted of, protect the same legal interests _i.e_. that of safeguarding the public interests in the proper administration of justice. However, there were clear differences to be drawn in the commission of at least 3 of these offences which made them distinct.

127    The two offences involving Stephanie and Maurice respectively could be placed together in that both of them assisted the Accused directly in the alleged fraud and he was getting them to say Wu Hai Jun was behind everything, although in a strict sense, they were not part of the same transaction for the one-transaction rule to apply. The two offences of perverting the course of justice were based on verbal discussions that the Accused had with each of them independently.

128    The offence involving Wong was clearly different and distinct in that it involved bribery. The Accused offered to pay Wong $3000 and Wong did receive a major portion of that sum in agreeing to furnish false information to the authorities. Furthermore, it was difficult to discover the identity of the Accused being the person instigating Wong as the Accused managed to remain anonymous throughout the instigation of Wong by the use of phone messages which were not directly traceable to the Accused.

129    Finally, the offence involving Tom was obviously a different transaction altogether. They were business partners. The Accused had either by himself or through a person called Danny submitted the application to IRAS for the PIC claim. The instigation of Tom was verbally carried out via the phone conversations the Accused had with Tom and was unrelated to the other 3 witnesses of Stephanie, Maurice and Wong.

## Conclusion

130    From the above findings of fact and for the reasons enunciated as concisely as I could, I was satisfied that the 4 charges were proven beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused accordingly.

131    Based on the sentencing factors taken into account and cited above in passing the sentence for each of the 4 offences, the global sentence imposed was 40 months’ imprisonment.

132    According to Prisons, the Accused had completed serving his sentence for the 4 convictions on 31 January 2019.
