### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The accused, Kam Aik Soon, is a 27-year-old male Singaporean. Yet despite being a relatively young adult, he is already a serial offender, having been convicted three times previously – in 2012, 2013 and 2016 - for theft and housebreaking related offences. Before me, he pleaded guilty to three charges under the Penal Code (PC) for committing the following offences:

> (1)     Two charges (DAC-927860-2018 and DAC-906477-2019) punishable under (p/u) s 457 PC for lurking house-trespass/house-breaking by night in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment. In light of his previous convictions for similar offences, the accused was also liable to caning under section 458 PC for these offences; and

> (2)     One charge (DAC-906478-2019) punishable under s 379 PC for theft.

2       As all the offences set out in the proceeded charges were committed while he was subjected to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014), the accused was deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and was thus liable to be punished under section 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of up to 321 days (in light of the offence in DAC-927860-2018).

3       In addition to the three proceeded charges, another five charges were taken into consideration for sentencing (TIC charges).

4       After the accused had pleaded guilty, at the urging of the Prosecution and pursuant to section 304(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), I called for a corrective training (CT) report to consider his physical and mental condition and suitability for CT.

5       Thereafter, having considered the facts of the case, the circumstances of the accused, the CT report, the relevant precedents, the TIC charges, as well as the submissions of both the Prosecution and the Defence, I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 6 years' CT, 6 strokes of the cane, and an enhanced sentence of 321 days' imprisonment. The sentence for each charge is set out below.

6       The sentence of 6 years’ CT was also ordered to run concurrently with the enhanced sentence (under the Prisons Act) of 321 days of imprisonment, with both sentences ordered to commence from 8 August 2018, which was the date that he was first remanded.

7       The accused being dissatisfied has filed an appeal against his sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## (3)   Statement of Facts

9       The details of his offences for the proceeded charges were set out in the Statement of Facts (SOF), the contents of which he admitted to without qualification. The SOF is largely reproduced below, with some parts underlined for emphasis.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>STATEMENT OF FACTS</u></b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(incorporating 3 charges)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1. The accused is Kam Aik Soon, male, 27 years old, NRIC No. S92XXXXXX</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS IN RELATION TO 5TH CHARGE (DAC-927860-2018)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. Sometime in May 2018, at about 12.00 AM, the accused went to Nam Ann Siang Theon, a Buddhist Temple at 36E Paya Lebar Crescent. The accused had gone to the temple with the intention of stealing cash from a donation box which was in the possession of the owner of the temple. He had been to the temple to pray in the past.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. Prior to entering the temple, the accused checked the surroundings and noted that there was no one inside the temple compound. As the main gate was locked, he made his entry into the temple by climbing over the wall beside the main gate. He walked around the temple and noticed two donation boxes. However, he could not open them as they were secured with a dial lock.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. The accused thereafter entered the main building of the temple by opening and climbing through a toilet window, which was a passage of entry not intended by anyone other than the accused himself for human entrance. This building was used as a place for the custody of property. The accused had entered the building with the intention to commit theft, between 7.00 pm and 7.00 am. In the building, he found two more donation boxes which were secured by pad locks. <u>For this purpose, the accused had brought along a screwdriver which he used to open both boxes</u>. He took all the cash that were in both the boxes, and placed them in his bag.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. The accused then left the building and the temple premises in the same manner he had entered by. The cash the accused had taken added up to about SG$300.00 in total.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. By reason of the above, the accused has committed an offence punishable under section 457 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. Prior to the commission of the aforesaid offence, the accused had, on 8 April 2016, been convicted of an offence under Section 457 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 under charge number (DAC/937665/2015), which conviction has not been set aside. He is thereby liable to be punished with caning under Section 458(A) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. Moreover, from 15 February 2018 to 16 April 2019, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev Ed 2014) (the “PA”) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50(1) of the PA. The accused committed the aforesaid offence in May 2018, which would fall into the relevant time period. Upon conviction and imposition of a sentence, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order. He is thereby liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 321 days, from 31 May 2018 to 16 April 2019 (31 May 2018 being the latest possible date the 5<sup>th</sup> Charge could have been committed).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS IN RELATION TO 4TH CHARGE (DAC-906477-2019)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. Sometime in August 2018, the accused went to Shuang Lin Chen Huang Temple at 184 Jalan Toa Payoh, Singapore. <u>He wore a cap to help hide his face so as to avoid detection, and brought a screwdriver along as a tool to commit theft</u>. The temple was a building used as a place for the custody of property.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10. At or about 1.00 am, the accused did commit housebreaking by night, in that he effected his entry into Shuang Lin Chen Huang Temple by crawling underneath the main gate of the temple which he was able to fit through to enter the temple building. This was a passage of entry that was not intended by any person other than the accused for human entrance. The accused made this entry with the intention of committing theft, between 7.00 pm to 7.00 am.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. While he was still walking around the temple, he was spotted by a security officer on duty, Yim Fook Keong. The accused lied to the officer that he was there to drink water. The officer led him to the washroom for him to get a drink of water. The security officer then escorted the accused out of the temple, after warning him that there were a lot of CCTVs in the temple and that he should not do it again.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. By reason of the aforesaid, the accused has committed an offence punishable under section 457 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. Prior to the commission of the aforesaid offence, the accused had, on 8 April 2016, been convicted of an offence under Section 457 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 under charge number DAC/937665/2015, which conviction has not been set aside.

On 8 July 2018, at around 1.30 am, the accused was walking when he spotted the Fo Guang Shan Temple. He noticed that its gate was locked. He walked around the temple to scout out if there was anybody inside its premises. The accused entered the premises by jumping over the side gate. At or about 2.58 am, the accused came upon a donation box and proceeded to move the donation box from its originals position to another spot, in order to avoid the view of the CCTV camera. In order to pry open the box which was locked internally, the accused used a screwdriver he had brought along for such a purpose. He managed to force it open and took almost all the cash inside. The accused closed the donation box and jumped over the same side gate he had entered by in order to leave. According to the accused, the amount he had taken added up to about $700.00.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17. Only $30.00 was eventually found left behind in the donation box.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18.

Out of the $700.00 taken, only $34.65 was eventually recovered.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19. By reason of the above, the accused has committed the offence of theft, which is punishable under section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## (5)   The CT report and Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

13     It was stated in the CT report that the accused was found suitable to undergo the CT regime, and that the accused has a “moderate risk of reoffending within two years of release”.

14     Following the production of the CT report, the Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 6 years’ of CT, and 7 strokes of the cane for all the proceeded charges, with an additional enhanced sentence of 321 days of imprisonment for the accused’s breach of the basic condition of his remission order. The DPP also initially argued for the CT sentence and enhanced imprisonment sentence to run consecutively. Subsequently, upon further review, the Prosecution submitted that any enhanced imprisonment sentence to be imposed for the accused’s breach of the remission order, can run concurrently with the CT sentence that is imposed, and that both sentences can be backdated to the commencement date of the accused’s remand i.e. 8 August 2018.

15     In this respect, in arguing for a sentence of CT to be imposed, the Prosecution essentially applied the sentencing framework laid down in _Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another appeal_ \[2016\] 5 SLR 9361 (“_Sim Yeow Kee_”). Specifically, the DPP pointed out that:

> (1)     The technical requirements for a CT sentence under section 304(1)(a) of the CPC were made out (see \[86\] of _Sim Yeow Kee_) in that:

>> (i)       The accused is at least 18 years old (being already 27 years old);

>> (ii)       The present offences under s 457 and s 379 PC are punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more; and

>> (iii)       Since reaching the age of 16 years old, the accused has been convicted with offences punishable with 2 years’ imprisonment or more at least twice.

> (2)     In accordance with the considerations in _Sim Yeow Kee_ at \[103\], it was also appropriate to sentence the accused to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of further crime, as assessed according to the following factors:

>> (i)       The likely imprisonment term for the present offences would have been at least 6 years’ imprisonment;

>> (ii)       The accused was not eligible for the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS); and

>> (iii)       The sentence of 6 years’ CT was not unduly disproportionate to the aggregate imprisonment term that would likely have been imposed on the accused.

> (3)     The Prosecution also pointed out that the accused is heavily traced for property-related offences, and that he had undergone imprisonment on 3 previous occasions. For the last 2 occasions, he was imprisoned for significant imprisonment periods of 2 years and 6 months, and 3 years and 6 months respectively.

16     As for the additional sentence of caning, the DPP submitted for a total of 7 strokes arguing that:

> (1)     This would be an appropriate uplift from the accused’s most recent antecedents involving the s 457 PC p/u s 458A charges (DAC-937090-2015 and DAC 937665-2015), where he had been sentenced to 2 strokes of the cane for each of the two charges, making a total of 4 strokes. The DPP submitted that an uplift was necessary in the present case to give effect to the need for specific deterrence due to the accused having acted in a recalcitrant manner, and having reoffended notwithstanding the previous sentences imposed.

> (2)     Specifically, for the 4th charge, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 3 strokes (i.e. an additional 1 stroke uplift from his previous 2 strokes) was sufficient, since the accused’s intention to commit theft did not eventuate.

> (3)     As for the 5th charge, where $300 was stolen, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 4 strokes (as uplifted from his previous 2 strokes) was appropriate.

17     Finally, in arguing for an enhanced imprisonment sentence to be imposed for the accused’s breach of his remission order, the Prosecution submitted that this was necessary for deterrence. Further, the accused should be sentenced to the full period of 321 days of enhanced imprisonment in light of his antecedents, his repeated re-offending, the fact that for the present offences he had employed the exact same modus operandi as was used for his previous offences, and as the offence in DAC- 927860-2018 (which was the first of his present series of offences) was committed very shortly (within 3 months) after his release from his previous jail term.[^1]

## (6)   Mitigation Plea

18     In mitigation, counsel highlighted that the accused has had an unfortunate and unhappy childhood, having been abandoned at an orphanage, and that he has been stealing from young. He was sent to a Boys’ Home when he was in 15 years old, and was without family support or any form of adult guidance in his life. Nevertheless, he managed to enrol for a course in the Textile and Fashion Industry Training Centre, and was working towards a Diploma in Fashion Design when he committed the present offences. Counsel stated that the offences were committed out of desperation by the accused to support himself, as he had used up all the money he earned from his internships to pay for his school fees, and was not able to obtain help through legal channels.

19     Counsel submitted that given the accused’s antecedents, an imprisonment sentence of between 3½ to 4 years’ imprisonment for each of the two s 457 PC charges would be fair and reasonable, and that these sentences should run concurrently. As for the s 379 PC charge, an imprisonment term of 1 week was fair and sufficient, as he was a first offender for such an offence, and the amount involved was only $700. Further, counsel argued against the imposition of CT, on the basis that:

> (1)     The minimum 5-year term for CT was excessive and oppressive given:

>> (i)       The accused’s young age (27 years old),

>> (ii)       His offences were non-violent and did not involve any ‘personal’ victim;

>> (iii)       The harm caused was low as the total amount stolen was less than $1,000;

>> (iv)       The offences were committed out of desperation; and

>>> (a)       The accused was just 2 months away from completing his diploma, which would have increased the likely prospect of his being self-sufficient, and that a long imprisonment /custodial term would be crushing to his progress. He would also have to start his life all over again upon release.

> (2)     The term of 6 years’ CT sought by the Prosecution, together with an enhanced sentence of 321 days’ imprisonment for his breach of the basic condition of his remission order, meant that accused would be facing a custodial term of 6 years plus 321 days. As there was no guaranteed remission for the CT regime, since only 25% of inmates are granted remission, there was a high probability that the accused would have to serve out the full custodial term, and that this would be too crushing.

> (3)     The Defence further argued that CT has been imposed only in cases which involved many more charges than faced by the present accused (such as in _PP v Murugason s/o Mutthiah_ (MA 182/2006) where the offender was sentenced to 8 years of CT and 12 strokes of cane for one hundred and ten (110) charges (which included two charges of housebreaking and theft by night), and against the appellant, Loi in _Sim Yeow Kee_, where Loi, was sentenced to six years of CT for committing a total of 173 previous offences in slightly over a decade.

20     Alternatively, the Defence argued that if CT should be imposed, the length of the CT sentence should not exceed the minimum period of 5 years, in light of the following:

> (1)     Despite his antecedents, the accused has shown progress over the years. Moreover, it had been stated in the CT report that the accused “_subscribes to more conventional values_” after his last release, and “_he actively took steps to acquire a set of vocational skills to help him achieve financial independence_”. The report also noted that he “_had prosocial friends and did not have any criminal associates_” and that he “_used his leisure time constructively_” (spending most of his time in the library).

> (2)     A long custodial term (be it CT or regular imprisonment) would exacerbate the situation and cause the accused to be caught in a vicious cycle.

> (3)     His case compared favourably with the case of _PP v Choo Zhiwei, Adrian_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 221</span>, where the offender was sentenced to 6 years of CT. In _Choo Zhiwei, Adrian_:

>> (i)       The offender’s CT report stated that he “_appeared to present with a willingness to resort to criminal means for his own benefit_”;

>> (ii)       His LS/CMI score placed him in the “High Risk/Need” level of criminal reoffending with a 70.2% probability of recidivism;

>> (iii)       It was also Choo’s fourth conviction for property offences; and

>> (iv)       Choo had re-offended almost immediately after serving his first 5-year CT sentence.

> (4)     Thus, counsel argued that as the present accused was not as recalcitrant as Choo, a 5-year CT term would be sufficient.

21     Further, in the event that CT should be imposed, together with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a breach of his remission order, counsel argued that both sentences should run concurrently, and be backdated to the date of commencement of his remand term.

22     Finally, in addition to the custodial term, as caning was mandatory for both the s 457 PC charges in light of his previous similar convictions and the operation of s 458A PC, counsel argued that, a minor uplift to a total of 5 strokes from his previous global sentence of 4 strokes of the cane (2 strokes for each of the two charges) was reasonable.

## (7)   The court’s decision on sentence

### (a)   Considering the sentence of corrective training (CT)

23     In _Sim Yeow Kee[^2]_, the High Court had taken note of the developments to the CT regime, in particular “the absence of any “qualitative” difference between CT and regular imprisonment”, and opined that “…the previously-decided cases on CT must be viewed with circumspection in so far as they place reliance upon the understanding that there is a “qualitative” difference in this regard.” In light of the developments, the High Court also set out a new sentencing framework to be adopted in considering cases involving CT.

24     This framework involves a two-stage inquiry:

> (1)     Stage 1: Does the offender satisfy the technical requirements for CT to be imposed? This inquiry involves considering whether the accused satisfies the technical requirements under s 304(1) CPC for CT to be imposed.

> (2)     Stage 2: Is it expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime? This involves a further three-step inquiry:

>> (i)       Step 1: What is the imprisonment term that would likely be imposed on the offender for the underlying offence?

>> (ii)       Step 2: Would the MAS apply to the offender if he were to be sentenced to regular imprisonment?

>> (iii)       Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

25     In the present case, as regards Stage 1, both parties were in clear agreement that the technical requirements in s 304(1)(a) CPC were made out (see \[14(1)\] above).

26     Moving on to Stage 2, this involves a three-step inquiry.

##### First Step: What is the likely imprisonment term for the accused?

27     At \[99\] of _Sim Yeow Kee_, the High Court made it clear that for this step of the analysis, the court should consider the sentence that it would actually have imposed for the offence(s) if it decides not to sentence the offender to CT. The High Court stated:

> “In this regard, the court should take into account the following:

>> (1)    The principle of escalation could justify a _longer_ imprisonment term being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents (see _Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[14\]). **This may be especially significant if a subsequent sentence for an offender who has already committed the same sort of offence needs to be escalated in order to specifically deter him from committing further offences of that nature** (see _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[43\] and _Public Prosecutor v Ng Bee Ling Lana_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 448</span> at \[13\]).

>> (2)    Further, as noted in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (at \[81(j)\]), in respect of an offender who is convicted of and sentenced to imprisonment for two or more distinct offences at the same trial, the court should, in exceptional cases, consider whether more than two sentences should be ordered to run consecutively. This will be especially relevant where the offender is shown to be a persistent or habitual offender, where there are extraordinary cumulative aggravating factors, or where there is a particular public interest. For convenience, we refer to this as “the consecutive sentence exception”.

\[emphasis added\]

28     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that if imprisonment had been imposed, the global term would have been significantly higher than that imposed for his 2016 convictions. My reasons are set out below.

29     First, while the accused is still a relatively young offender at 27 years old, he has shown himself to be very much an old hand at engaging in criminal activities. In fact, his criminal records showed that he had committed many similar offences in the past, all within a short space of a few years between 2012 and 2016.

> (1)     In this regard, in September 2012, while only 20 years old, he had already been sentenced to imprisonment for an “aggravated” theft offence under s 381 PC.

> (2)     Barely a year later in November 2013, the accused was sentenced to two considerably longer (concurrent) terms of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months each for housebreaking charges under s 457 PC. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing on that occasion.

> (3)     Yet again within a short period of his release for this second term of imprisonment, in April 2016, he was convicted of yet another two housebreaking charges under s 457 PC, again with two other similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. On this occasion, he was given a sentence uplift of an additional one year imprisonment per charge, resulting in two higher (concurrent) imprisonment sentences of 3 years and 6 months per charge.

30     Further, as all his previous convictions (including the aggravated theft charge under s 381 PC and house-breaking charge under s 457 PC) were for similar offences, for which he was last sentenced in 2016 to a global sentence of 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane, the principle of escalation expounded in _Sim Yeow Kee_ clearly operates to require that appropriately higher sentences should be imposed for his most recent offences.

31     Second, all of the accued’s offences were committed relatively soon after his release from prison for his previous set of offences. This was the case not only for the proceeded charges, but also for the TIC charges. Thus, quite aside from the fact that this consideration would trigger the operation of the Prisons Act because of the remission order that had separately been made (see \[45\] below), this factor also shows the accused to be a habitual offender, for whom the previous imprisonment terms of 3½ years were clearly insufficient.

32     Third, from the details of the proceeded and TIC charges, what was particularly alarming was not only that the accused had continued committing theft and housebreaking offences, but the fact that he had expanded his repertoire and apparently moved on to more diverse criminal activities. This could be seen from the increase in the numbers (total of 8) and in the variety of charges that were tendered against him in the present proceeding (including charges under s 47(3) Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act and charges of criminal misappropriation (see \[8\] above)).

33     Fourth, I also had to consider the nature of the TIC charges that he faced, and the possible effect of the TIC charges on the sentences to be imposed for the proceeded charges. In this regard, the words of the Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal) in _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGCA 35</span> are particularly apposite. At \[38\], his Honour had stated:

> “… **But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased** (see Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. **This would a fortiori be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature**…”

\[emphasis added\]

34     In the present case, the TIC charges were all for property-related offences and hence, would be particularly relevant to the sentences to be imposed for his proceeded charges.

35     Finally, I noted that the offences were not crimes committed on the spur of the moment. Instead, there was clear planning and premeditation involved in his offences, since the SOF revealed that the accused had prepared for his criminal operations by bringing along screwdrivers to pry open the donation boxes, and also a cap to cover his face (for the offence in the 4th charge). Moreover, the accused had deliberately targeted the temples because from his “…prior experience robbing temples, he knew they were easy targets.” (\[15\] of the SOF).

36     Thus, it was clear that if a sentence of imprisonment had to be imposed for each charge, the final global imprisonment term would be well in excess of the 3½ to 4 years’ (plus 1 week’s) imprisonment sought by the Defence. This was particularly so when one considers that the 3½ years’ (concurrent) imprisonment terms imposed in 2016, have had practically no effect in preventing him from re-offending. If anything, as noted above, the accused’s criminal tendencies and behaviour have worsened since his last conviction.

37     As for the accused’s counsel’s claim that his offences were committed out of desperation, allegedly because he could not get “legal” means of obtaining funds to support himself, with respect, these bare claims were not substantiated by any evidence. For one, there was nothing put forward to show any effort made by the accused to obtain financial assistance from governmental or welfare bodies, or that he had been unsuccessful in any such attempt (if any had even been made). Nor was that anything presented to show how he, an able bodied 27-year-old man, was not able to find suitable part-time employment. Neither was any evidence provided that the accused had no time to do any kind of work in order to earn money to sustain himself. In short, the accused’s claims, while convenient, were neither convincing nor corroborated.

38     In light of the above, had imprisonment been imposed on the accused, the following sentences would have been appropriate:

> (1)     For DAC 906478-2019 (3rd charge) under s 379 PC: An imprisonment sentence of 1 year, bearing in mind the above sentencing considerations, and the fact that the modus operandi for this theft charge was largely the same as that he used for the housebreaking charges. The sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment would be appropriate as the maximum prescribed imprisonment term was 3 years.

> (2)     For DAC-906477-2019 (4th charge) under s 457 PC: A sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment. In this regard, I was of the view that even though nothing was successfully stolen by the accused, this was only because he was stopped by a security guard in time, and not through any change of mind, or any redeeming or altruistic act on his own part. Indeed, but for the intervention by the security guard, taking into account the accused’s past successes in stealing money from the donation boxes of temples with a screwdriver, which was what he was equipped with on this occasion as well, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused would almost certainly have succeeded in stealing from the donation box entering the temple premises. I was also of the view that for this charge, a heavier punishment than his previous sentence of 3 ½ years’ imprisonment should be imposed on the basis of the principle of escalation, although the uplift would not be so high as it would have been had there been actual loss caused to the victim. All things considered, a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment would be fair for this charge.

> (3)     For DAC-927860--2018 (5th charge) under s 457 PC: In light of the sentencing considerations highlighted above, as well as the fact that actual loss had resulted in this case (unlike for the 4th charge), I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate. This sentence would also have taken into account the overall effect of the TIC charges.

39     Following my determination of the individual sentences, and in line with the totality principle, the sentences for the 3rd and 5th charges would have been ordered to run consecutively for a global sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment. In short, the imprisonment term would have been 6 years, if imprisonment, rather than CT, was imposed.

##### Step 2: Would the MAS apply to the offender if sentenced to regular imprisonment?

40     Moving on to Step 2 of the analysis, the Court in _Sim Yeow Kee_ had stated at \[100\] that “(b)y reason of s 304(1) of the CPC, the court must consider the expediency of imposing a CT sentence having regard both to the offender’s reformation and to the prevention of crime.”. Further, at \[101\], the court accepted that “…the question of whether it is expedient to impose CT should therefore involve a consideration of whether the offender qualifies for the MAS. We consider that this should form part of the second step in the analysis”.

41     In the present case, it was not disputed that in light of section 50U(1) read with the First Schedule of the Prisons Act, as the accused does not have any drug related antecedent, he does not qualify for the MAS in respect of his charges under s 457 and s 379 PC. As such, this consideration did not operate against the imposition of CT[^3].

##### Step 3: Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?

42     As I had determined that an appropriate sentence of imprisonment would have been 6 years’ imprisonment, an appropriate term of CT should at least be an equivalent term of 6 years. This also meant that a 6-year CT term would not be a disproportionate sentence.

43     In addition, while I could have imposed a 6-year term of imprisonment instead of 6 years of CT, I was not minded to do so. In this regard, I had considered that:

> (1)     The accused had continued to re-offend despite the sentences of imprisonment being increased each time he was convicted;

> (2)     He had also re-offended during the period of remission granted for his previous imprisonment sentence which was given to him “…virtually as a matter of right for most regular prison inmates”[^4]. Hopefully, in the case of a CT sentence with a more limited prospect of being granted early release, he would learn to treasure such an opportunity (if granted) more, and be less likely to re-offend in the future; and

> (3)     Based on the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _Sim Yeow Kee_, a sentence of CT was clearly an appropriate punishment to impose. It was also a sentence he qualified for (as per the CT report), and one which suited his circumstances.

44     It is the hope of this court that the different regime of CT, would be a more effective form of punishment for the accused, and that this “…would be expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime” within the meaning of s 304(1) CPC.

### (b)   Determining the appropriate number of strokes of the cane

45     In light of the operation of s 458A PC, I had to impose caning on the accused for his two latest repeat housebreaking offences. In this regard, as he had previously been sentenced to 2 strokes per charge when he was convicted for the s 457 PC offence (also punishable under s 458A PC as those were also repeat offences), I was of the view that a slight uplift to 3 strokes per charge – making a total of 6 strokes of the cane - would be sufficient.

### (c)   Enhanced imprisonment and the commencement date of the sentences

46     As the accused had committed his offences when the remission order was in force, he had thereby breached the terms of his remission order and was thus liable to punished under s 50T of the Prisons Act to serve an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order i.e. 321 days of imprisonment (calculated from the date of his earliest offence which was set out in DAC 927860-2018)).

47     In the present case, having considered the factors in section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act, including the gravity of his present offences, the similarity of these offences to the offences that he was earlier sentenced for, and the short duration (about 3 months) for which he did not commit any offence after being released under the remission order, and also bearing in mind that all his offences (including those in the TIC charges) were committed during his period of early release when the remission order was in force, I agreed with the Prosecution that this was clearly a case where it was not only appropriate to impose an enhanced sentence for the breach of his remission order, but one in which the full length of his enhanced sentence i.e. 321 days’ imprisonment, should be imposed in relation to the offence in DAC 927860-2018.

48     However, while imposing the enhanced sentence was appropriate, I agreed with the position that rather than having this enhanced sentence run consecutively with the 6 years’ sentence of CT, in line with the totality principle and the rationale for imposing a CT sentence, the CT sentence and the enhanced imprisonment term can and should run concurrently, and that both sentences can commence from the start date of the accused’s remand i.e. 8 August 2018. This effectively meant that the total custodial period that the accused was liable to serve would not exceed 6 years.

## (8)   Conclusion

49     In summary, the sentence I imposed on the accused was 6 years' CT and an enhanced sentence of 321 days' imprisonment, both sentences to run concurrently from 08 August 2018. In addition, I imposed an additional sentence of 6 strokes of the cane.

50     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his sentence. As no stay of execution has been sought, the accused is currently serving his sentence.
