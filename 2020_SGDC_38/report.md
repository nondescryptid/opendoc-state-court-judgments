3       Three other charges (attempted housebreaking to commit theft under section 457 read with section 511 Penal Code, rash act under section 336 Penal Code, another harassment charge under the Moneylenders Act) were taken into consideration in sentencing.

## Facts

4       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution without qualification. The essence of the charges were captured in the charges themselves. I need only to highlight the following facts.

#### Remission Order

5       At the time of the commission of DAC 929869/2018 (housebreaking in order to commit theft) and DAC 940951/2018 (attempted mischief), the Accused was subjected to a remission order. The period of the remission order was 9 December 2017 to 3 October 2018. Hence, when the Accused committed the offences on 2nd and 3rd September, he had breached a basic condition of his remission order and was thus liable to be punished with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of 32 days and 31 days on each of the charges respectively.

#### DAC 940951/2018 – Attempted Mischief by fire

6       Investigations revealed that after the Accused was caught unlocking the victim’s front gate using the stolen spare keys (attempted house-breaking charge in DAC 940950/2018 which is taken into consideration), the Accused had gone home feeling frustrated with the victim. The Accused then took a bottle of thinner and wrapped it up with a cloth and returned to the victim’s unit. He set the cloth on fire and placed it in front of the victim’s unit, intending for the bottle of thinner to explode and to cause damage to the victim’s unit. However, he was unsuccessful. Feeling agitated, the Accused left the victim’s unit and went back home. At about 4.00 a.m., the victim smelt something burning outside his unit. When he opened his main door, he discovered that there was a bottle of thinner with a cloth burning on top of it and he immediately put out the fire. No one was injured and no property damage was caused.

7       The Accused was working for one “Henry” in respect of his four harassment charges. Investigations revealed that the Accused had chanced upon an advertisement for a loan on Facebook, and indicated his interest to borrow $800 for settle his personal expenses. One ‘Henry’, an unlicensed moneylender, subsequently contacted him, and offered him a job opportunity instead. The job would require the Accused to assist in harassment against debtors, which would involve locking the homes of debtors. The Accused was offered $100 for harassing each unit, which he accepted. The Accused carried out each act of harassment as reflected in the charges, as instructed by “Henry”. The offences were committed on 3 August 2019 (2 counts) and 5 August 2019 (2 counts) when he was on court bail.

#### DAC 933329/2019 – Theft in Dwelling

8       Investigations revealed that the Accused had been employed as a cleaner by Platinum Cleaning Solutions, and deployed to work at the Uniqlo store. The Uniqlo store was also running a charity campaign at the material time, where customers could donate used clothing. These used clothing were stored at the stock room of the Uniqlo store. On 26 July 2019, one of the staff working at the Uniqlo store noticed the Accused behaving suspiciously in the stock room of the Uniqlo store, and alerted the store manager of Uniqlo, one Koen. Koen reviewed the CCTV footage, and observed the Accused removing a plastic bag from a pile of donated clothing. The said plastic bag of clothing contained one pair of jeans valued at S$29.99. The Accused brought the plastic bag to the back of the Uniqlo store, and transferred the pair of jeans into a separate “IKEA” bag. The Accused then left the Uniqlo store with the “IKEA” bag

## Sentencing Considerations

#### DAC 929869/2018 - House-breaking in order to commit theft

9       The maximum sentence prescribed for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. Since the Accused had already been convicted of a similar offence in 2016 (house-breaking by night under section 457 of the Penal Code), he was also liable to caning under section 458A of the Penal Code.

10     The sentence of 18 months imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane on this charge was not manifestly excessive. This was a sentence well within the range of sentences imposed in the precedents tendered by the Prosecution, most of which ranged from 12 to 24 months imprisonment. In coming to the sentence, I also bore in mind the following factors:

> a)     On the facts, the Accused had taken steps to break into the victim’s unit when he pried open and removed three window louvers which he knew had been fastened by the victim against such entrance. The Accused entered into the unit by climbing through the window. It was not opportunistic on the part of the Accused. Thereafter, he stole personal items, including an international passport and even a 32-inch television, with a total value of $600;

> b)     A day later, the Accused returned to the same unit in an attempt to break-in with house keys he had stolen the day before. This charge under section 457 of the Penal Code read with section 511 of the Penal Code (DAC 940950/2018) was taken into consideration in sentencing;

> c)     The Accused had antecedents for offences under section 379 Penal Code (simple theft) in 2012, followed by a global imprisonment term of 2 years and 6 months in 2016 for a string of house-breaking by night offences and a more serious theft offence under section 380 Penal Code. The period of incarceration did not appear to have any effect on the Accused and he committed a similar offence after he was released on a remission order. Specific deterrence was necessary.

11     Further, as this was an offence of a similar nature to the offence for which he was previously sentenced for and placed under a remission order, it was appropriate that the Accused should bear the full brunt of the enhanced sentence of 32 days, which formed the remaining duration of the remission order.

#### DAC 940951/2018 – Attempted Mischief by Fire

12     The punishment prescribed for this offence was an imprisonment term which may extend to 3.5 years (this was an attempt charge), and the offender shall also be liable to fine.

13     In the table of precedents, the sentences imposed for completed acts of mischief by fire ranged from 3 to 6 months’ imprisonment. Whilst I was mindful this the Accused’s act was only an attempt, with no property damage caused and no persons hurt in the process, I noted that the offence was motivated by the Accused’s vindictiveness; borne out of revenge. He had deliberately returned to the victim’s unit after his foiled attempt to break into the victim’s unit earlier, with a bottle of thinner wrapped in cloth, in the hope that the bottle of thinner would explode and burn the victim’s unit after he set fire to it. The potential for harm to both property and lives was great. I was of the view that a stiff sentence was warranted and I imposed 4 months’ imprisonment accordingly.

#### DAC 923347/2019, DAC 924009/2019, DAC 924010/2019, DAC 926472/2019

#### Harassment under UML

14     The benchmark sentence for such offences is 8 to 12 months imprisonment[^1]. The common act of harassment in these four charges comprise of locking the gate of the units, with metal chain and padlock or bicycle lock. For some units, the Accused had also pasted a debtor’s note. One other similar charge was taken into consideration. No mention was made of any property damage caused by the Accused’s acts of harassment; hence the benchmark sentence of 12 months imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane did not apply[^2].

15     I imposed 11 months’ imprisonment for the following reasons:

> a)     The facts and mitigation did not project the Accused as one who had to commit these acts of harassment due to an inability to repay loans taken from loan sharks out of a genuinely desperate financial need[^3]. Instead, the Accused took on the job to earn $100 for each unit he harassed[^4];

> b)     Apart from causing annoyance, the act of harassment by locking the units from the outside was dangerous since it jeopardized the personal safety of occupants[^5], particularly in the event of an emergency;

> c)     The Accused had committed these offences whilst he was on court bail for his house-breaking and attempted mischief charges.

16     A sentence in the higher end of the benchmark was appropriate in the circumstances and I imposed the same sentence in each of the 4 harassment charges. There was no basis to make a distinction in sentence amongst these 4 charges.

#### DAC 933329/2019 - Theft in Dwelling

17     Despite court convictions for similar theft offences in 2012 and 2016, the Accused continued to persist in committing these offences, in this case, stealing clothing donated for charitable causes when he was deployed as a cleaner at Uniqlo. It was aggravating that the Accused committed this offence whilst he was on court bail for serious property-related offences. I was mindful that the value of the item stolen was not large but in the Accused’s case, there was a need for a fair measure of specific deterrence in the sentence and I imposed a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment on this charge.

## Global Sentence

18     I ordered the sentences in four charges to run consecutively, namely:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="5.86%"> <col width="22.78%"> <col width="36.56%"> <col width="34.8%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 929869/2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 457 p/u section 458A, Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Enhanced sentence of 32 days</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 940951/2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 435 r/w section 511, Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 923347/2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 28(2)(a) Moneylenders Act</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 933329/2019</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 380 Penal Code</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     The total sentence was 36 months’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane, and an enhanced sentence of 32 days.

20     I considered the global sentence to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. The Accused faced a total of 10 charges when he came before me; with Prosecution proceeding on 7 charges when the Accused chose to plead guilty. These were serious charges of house-breaking, mischief by fire and harassment on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders. The only mitigating factor in this case was the Accused’s plea of guilt, which I have duly taken into account.

21     Further, the conduct of the Accused in this entire period demonstrated his blatant disregard for the law and a troubling lackadaisical attitude towards his re-offending. He committed serious offences of house-breaking (in order to commit theft) as well as attempting to burn a unit down, towards the end of his remission order. After being charged in court for those offences and whilst on court bail, the Accused committed a series of harassment offences under the Moneylenders Act; he also continued stealing.

22     The four charges, in which the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, were all distinct in nature and each offence was committed on a different occasion. Together, they accurately represented the culpability of the Accused and the level of criminality demonstrated in this case. Given the gravity of the offences and the circumstances surrounding the commission of these offences, the aggregate sentence is proportionate to the criminality displayed in this case and is not a crushing one.

23     The imprisonment term was backdated to 16 August 2019[^6]. The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
