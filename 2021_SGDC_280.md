### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused is Mr Lee Xuan Shen, a male Singaporean, who was 23 years of age at the time of his arrest on 5 December 2018. He had claimed trial to a charge under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”):

> are charged that you, on 21 October 2018, at about 2.47am, at Level 2 of Orchard Towers at 400 Orchard Road, did use criminal force to Sergeant Kubendiran of the Singapore Police Force, a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, to wit, by pushing him at his chest area while he was trying to detain a Chinese man, with intent to prevent the said Sergeant Kubendiran from discharging his duty as a police officer, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, as I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, I convicted the accused on the charge in DAC 933055-2019.

3       The matter was adjourned to 19 October 2021 for the Prosecution to prepare the address on sentence and for the Defence to prepare the written plea in mitigation. On 19 October 2021, I sentenced the accused to three weeks’ imprisonment.

4       The accused is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence on 19 October 2021. On 25 October 2021, the Prosecution filed a cross appeal against sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. A stay of execution was granted for the sentence of imprisonment.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full.

## Circumstances leading to his arrest and charge

6       In the early hours of the morning on 21 October 2018, the accused was with his group of friends at Club Gaga located at level 2 of Orchard Towers at 400 Orchard Road. Sometime before 2:47am, the accused and his friends stepped outside the club and were standing at the area outside the club.

7       At about 2:47am on 21 October 2018 at the area outside Club Gaga, an altercation occurred between one of the accused’s male Chinese friends and a male Chinese in a white T-shirt. This resulted in a commotion between the accused’s friends and the friends of the male Chinese in the white T-shirt as they tried to separate the two men. From the Orchard Towers’ security CCTV footage, the accused was seen with his arms outstretched on both sides of his body as part of the group effort to separate the two men.

8       Shortly after, the victim, Sergeant Kubendiran (PW1) and his partner Sergeant Chia Kai Tiak (PW2) arrived at the scene at level 2 of Orchard Towers attired in their police uniform as part of their routine patrol. Upon their arrival at level 2 of Orchard Towers, they heard a commotion and found a crowd of about 20 persons gathered in the vicinity. Both police officers quickly moved towards the source of the commotion.

9       The accused who standing close by was aware that the victim and his partner were at the scene in the execution of their duties as police officers. As the situation was chaotic, the victim’s partner shouted out orders for those present not to fight while the victim shouted for those present to move aside. Despite the earlier efforts from the accused’s friends and the friends of the man in the white T-shirt, the man in the white T-shirt continued to engage members of the accused’s group. As the two police officers were trying to disperse the crowd, the accused’s friend Gerald attired in a black T-shirt threw a punch at the male Chinese in the white T-shirt. This resulted in a physical altercation between the two men.

10     The two police officers immediately moved in the direction where the assault had occurred. The accused similarly moved in the same direction as the victim. At the same time, one of Gerald’s friend managed to push and separate Gerald from the man in the white T-shirt. The victim then moved towards Gerald and the accused’s friend. Shortly after, the accused made physical contact with the victim when he was standing between the victim and his friends. Gerald then left the scene together with the accused’s friends leaving the accused as the only person facing the victim. The accused was seen in the CCTV footage with his arms still outstretched on both sides of his body in front of the victim. The victim then moved to the accused’s left side and walked past him.

11     When confronted by the victim, the accused repeatedly apologised for pushing him and stated that he had wanted to stop the fight. He further denied knowing the person who was involved in the physical altercation and was subsequently placed under arrest.

## Prosecution’s case

12     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had used criminal force on the victim, a police officer in the execution of his duty with intent to prevent the said police officer from discharging his duty.

## Defence’s case

13     It was the Defence’s case that the accused’s physical contact with the victim was unintentional as he was unaware that the victim was behind him when he extended his arms behind him.

## Elements of the offence

14     To prove its case on the proceeded charge, the Prosecution must establish all the elements of the present charge namely:

> (a)     The use of criminal force on the victim, a police officer by pushing him in the chest area;

> (b)     The victim was in the course of executing his duty as a police officer;

> (c)     The accused was aware that the victim was executing his duty as a police officer and

> (d)     The accused intended to prevent the victim from discharging his duty as police officer in trying to detain a Chinese man involved in an assault.

## Issues

15     The issue before me was whether the accused had intentionally pushed the victim in his chest area to prevent the victim from detaining his friend Gerald who was involved in an earlier assault.

16     As the accused was aware that the victim is a police officer who was executing his duties, the trial turned on whether the physical contact by the accused on the victim was deliberate or accidental.

17     In the present case, the Prosecution had relied on the direct evidence from the victim, a recording of the Orchard Towers CCTV security footage of the area outside Club Gaga as well as footages from the body worn camera (“BWC”) of the victim and his partner, PW2 to prove its case.

#### PW1’s evidence

18     The victim testified that in October 2018, he was a Sergeant 2 with the Ground Response Force (“GRF”). On 21 October 2018 he was deployed to perform patrol duties along Orchard Towers and to attend to any incident at the entertainment outlets. He further testified that his shift started at 2:30am and his partner was Sergeant Chia Kai Tiak (PW2). At the material time, he was attired in his police uniform and had a gun. The items he wore included his police lanyard, BWC, his utility belt, his MATRA set pouch, his handcuff pouch, his taser holder and a straight extendable baton. PW2 was similarly attired and equipped at the material time.

19     He gave evidence that on 21 October 2018, there was an arrest report relating to an incident at 1 Claymore Drive, Orchard Towers, Singapore 229594 at level two outside Club Gaga (P1). He further gave evidence that on that day as he was approaching Orchard Towers 2 from the connecting bridge from Orchard Towers 1 with PW2, he heard a commotion. He further gave evidence that he and his partner went over to the scene to de-escalate the situation.

20     The victim testified that while they were trying to de-escalate the situation, he noticed that a person had thrown a punch. He tried to detain the person when the accused pushed him and barricaded him from reaching out to detain the person who had thrown the punch. According to the victim, the accused was facing towards him and used both his hands to push him at his chest area.

21     PW1 also testified that the accused stopped him from moving forward by using his body to block him. This lasted for about one to two minutes until the person who threw the punch made out from the scene. According to the victim, there were three or four persons who had formed a barricade around the person who had thrown the punch. He gave evidence that what set the accused apart from them was that the accused was the only one who had pushed him.

22     The physical contact between the accused and the victim was not captured by the victim’s own body worn camera. When asked why the starting frame from about 2:48am of his BWC footage was angled to capture his face, he testified that he believed his BWC might have been displaced during the scuffle and the camera might have rotated towards him. He then re-adjusted the BWC which began recording from the starting from 2:48am.

#### PW2’s evidence

23     PW2 testified that in October 2018, he was a Police National Service officer bearing the rank of Sergeant and posted to Tanglin Division, Kampung Java NPC. He further testified that from 20 to 21 October 2018, he had been deployed to patrol the area around the clubs and within Orchard Towers.

24     PW2 gave evidence that while he was patrolling within Orchard Towers with the victim, he saw a crowd in front of him. They wanted to de-escalate the situation by dispersing the crowd but there were a few commotions. He further gave evidence that there were people shouting and screaming as well as some pushes around the area outside the club. PW2 told them not to fight and for those not involved in the pushing to leave the scene. According to PW2, the crowd gradually dispersed.

25     PW2 testified that while he was dispersing the crowd and telling the people not to fight, he was separated from the victim. He further testified that he had not witnessed the physical contact between the accused and the victim but was informed by the latter that he was pushed by the accused. PW2 gave evidence that the victim instructed him to keep an eye on the accused while also dispersing the remaining crowd. The victim also informed PW2 that they needed to arrest the accused for deterring a police officer from his duties.

#### Footage from PW2’s BWC

26     The initial portion of PW2’s BWC footage (P4) showed both police officers conducting foot patrol and conducting checks in the vicinity of Orchard Towers. At about time stamp 2:47:13 of PW2’s BWC, as they approached the level two area outside the entertainment outlets, a commotion in the form of multiple raised voices could be heard. Both the victim and PW2 were seen moving in the direction of the commotion. At about time stamp 2:47:39, they were seen placing themselves in between the group of people involved in the commotion with PW2 shouting orders for those present not to fight while the victim shouted for those present to move aside. From PW2’s BWC, the accused who had worn a grey T-shirt could be seen on the right side of the footage standing close by amongst the crowd as the two police officers moved in.

27     As the victim and PW2 were shouting orders to contain the situation along the common corridor, at about time stamp 2:47:46 a man in white shirt was seen engaging in a scuffle with two others in black T-shirts, one of whom was the accused’s friend Gerald. Both the victim and PW2 immediately moved towards them. At about timestamp 2:47:53, Gerald was seen throwing a punch at the man in the white T-shirt. Immediately after, he was seen being pushed away by the other man in the black T-shirt from the man in the white T-shirt and against the side wall of a shop unit. At about the time stamp 2:47:54, the victim was seen approaching Gerald and the other man. At the same time from his BWC, PW2 was seen attending to the man in the white T-shirt who was confronted by a female in a black floral outfit while calling for police backup.

28     From PW2’s BWC footage, at about time stamp 2:47:54-56, at the left side of the footage the victim was seen being blocked by other men as he went towards Gerald. The accused was seen facing the accused and lunging forward towards the victim with his arm stretched out, blocking the victim from moving towards the right. The victim’s body was seen moving backwards abruptly. At about time stamp 2:48:02, Gerald could be seen moving away and leaving the scene.

29     At the same time from PW2’s BWC, he could be seen de-escalating the situation with other individuals and was seen moving away from the area where the scuffle had occurred. PW2 only returned to where the victim was at about time stamp 2:49:45. From PW2’s BWC, the victim was seen talking to the accused. At about time stamp 2:49:49 the victim could be heard instructing PW2 to arrest the accused.

#### Orchard Towers CCTV security footage

30     The recording of the Orchard Towers security footage (P2) showed an overhead view of the passageway at level 2 of Orchard Towers where the physical contact between the accused and the victim occurred. Shortly before the physical contact occurred, the security footage showed two females trying to hold back a man in white T-shirt from engaging with a man in a black T-shirt. The footage also showed several individuals including the accused wearing a grey T-shirt similarly holding back the man in the black T-shirt. Two men in dark jackets who appeared to be security officers from an entertainment outlet could be seen attempting to separate individuals from both groups from engaging with one another.

31     Soon after, both the victim and PW2 were seen appearing in the security footage trying to disperse the crowd. When a physical altercation occurred between the man in the black T-shirt and the man in the white T-shirt, the two police officers immediately moved to where the assault had occurred. The accused was seen following closely behind the victim at the far end of the footage. The blinking lights from both police officers BWCs could be seen from the footage amidst a group of individuals who had gathered closely at the location of the assault.

32     From the footage, the victim could be seen being blocked by several individuals including the accused and the accused’s friend Gerald leaving the scene shortly after. The accused was next seen facing the victim with both his hands in the air and subsequently outstretched at his sides blocking the victim until the crowd surrounding dissipated leaving him alone facing the victim. The victim could be seen walking around the accused with the latter following closely behind thereafter. Shortly after the victim was seen detaining the accused when he tried to leave with his group of friends after the crowd had cleared.

#### The accused’s evidence

33     The accused testified that on 20 October 2018, he and five of his friends had gone to Club Gaga between 11:00pm to 12:00am on 21 October 2018 for drinks. He was then serving his National Service and was nine days away from his Operationally Ready Date (“ORD”). He further testified that while he was outside Club Gaga with his friends, a man in a white shirt as shown in the security footage used Hokkien vulgarities to provoke them.

34     He gave evidence that the man in the black T-shirt wanted to confront the man in the white T-shirt. As he did not want them to fight or anything to happen, the accused raised his hand to stop him from doing so and asked him to go back to the club. He further gave evidence that when he saw that the police had arrived, he wanted to go back to Club Gaga. He then heard somebody quarrelling and when he turned his head to look, he saw the man in white T-shirt and his friend Gerald about to fight.

35     The accused testified that he went towards Gerald and grabbed him in order to pull him away. He grabbed him from the front and swivelled Gerald to his right as he did not want any fight to take place. He further testified that he felt someone kept pushing him from behind. He struck his arms backwards and denied pushing the victim from the front.

36     He gave evidence that he then heard someone from behind him shouted ‘Oh why did you block me?’ When he turned around and saw that it was a police officer, immediately he raised his hands and stood at the side. He also gave evidence that he knew it was an offence to push the police and that his ORD may be delayed.

## Analysis of the evidence

37     The present case had occurred along the passageway outside Club Gaga which was located at level two of Orchard Towers. The victim and his partner were clearly outnumbered by the crowd present along the passageway when they made their way through to attend to the commotion. The entire incident from the time the male Chinese in the white T-shirt was first seen in the security footage engaging members of the accused’s group until the time of the physical contact between the accused and the victim had lasted for about two minutes. It was clear that the situation had escalated due to the persistence of the male Chinese in the white T-shirt in provoking the accused’s friends despite the effort made by others present to separate them.

38     From PW2’s BWC, it was evident that the situation was chaotic as the two police officers had to deal with several individuals in close proximity who were not only shouting and screaming but were also physical with one another. To disperse the crowd and to contain the situation, the victim and his partner had to repeatedly shout out orders for those present not to fight and for those present to move aside.

39     When Gerald punched the male Chinese in the white T-shirt, the two police officers immediately went their separate ways as the victim’s went towards Gerald and PW2 towards the man in the white T-shirt. It was plain that the two police officers did so as part of their law enforcement duties and that the detention of the persons involved in the assault is a likely outcome.

40     That being the situation, in my view, there was no need or justification for the accused to follow suit and ingratiate himself in the ongoing physical altercation as the police officers were in the midst of performing their duties. Furthermore, he would have been aware of the orders shouted out by the victim for those present to move aside. Yet, despite this order by the victim, the accused quickly did so as shown in the CCTV footage when he clearly had no business to interfere with the police officers’ performance of their duties.

41     In the present case, I found that the accused had followed suit and went in the same direction as the victim as he was trying to prevent the victim from detaining his friend Gerald who was involved in the assault, as part of his duties as a police officer. I also found that he had placed himself between the victim and Gerald out of blind loyalty to prevent Gerald from being detained for assaulting the male Chinese in the white T-shirt. I rejected the Defence’s contention that he had run up to them as he wanted to stop Gerald to deescalate the fight. It is more likely that he was worried about the repercussion should the police detain his friend Gerald for his role in the assault.

42     The physical contact was not captured by the victim’s own BWC nor was it witnessed by PW2 as his attention was focused on the man in the white T-shirt. Although from the security footage, the lights on PW1’s BWC could be seen blinking when he went towards Gerald and the male Chinese in the white T-shirt, there was no footage available from the victim’s BWC of the events from the time he attended to the commotion until the time the physical contact took place. Instead, what was recorded was the post-event footage of the victim’s adjusting BWC, the victim confronting the accused for pushing him and the accused’s repeated apologies to the victim.

43     To piece together the events in the early hours of 21 October 2018 and the facts relating to the charge, I had considered the direct evidence from the victim, the security footage of the area outside Club Gaga, the BWC footages from both the victim and PW2 as well as the statements of both the victim (D1) and the accused (D4).

44     In his self-recorded statement on 21 October 2018 at 0800hrs, at paragraph 4 to 6 of his statement, the victim had stated the following:

> We were making our way around 0245hrs towards Club Lady Gaga and noted a huge group of at least 40 people having a commotion. No fight was occurring at the material time, as such SC/SGT Chia Kai Tiak and I decided to intervene to deescalate the situation. We managed to separate the parties.

> However, while we were trying to coerce the group, suddenly a male subject clad in Black shirt (A1) punched a guy clad in a long white sleeve (A2). I then pulled A1 away and placed him against the wall and tried to detain him, However, a Chinese male subject clad in a grey shirt (B1) pushed me on my left shoulder and gave A1 a chance to move away from the scene. I then tried to stop A1, however B1 turned around while his back was facing me and intervened me from stopping A1 from leaving the premise, then together with B1 two unknown male subjects joined and created a human wall and stopped me from entering a corridor where A1 was noted to have fled. While I was dealing with the situation, my partner SC SGT Chia Kai Tiak was trying to detain A2. However, A2 fled from the scene and my partner SC Chia Kai Tiak joined me shortly.

> As I only SC SGT Chia Kai Tiak and myself were in the incident and no other resource had yet arrived. I decided to detain B1.B1 admitted to pushing me and claimed that he wanted to deescalate the situation and he also admitted to blocking me, however when enquired about the other two friends whom also blocked me and A1, B1 mentioned he doesn’t know anyone of them.

45     In his statement recorded on 21 October 2018 at 1145hrs, when asked by the recorder to describe what had happened earlier at Orchard Towers, the accused had stated the following:

> Me and 5 friends went out to drink together at Club Gaga. 5 of us ordered a total of 8 towers of beer and we finished it. After that Gerald and the rest went out and I was alone inside the club.

> About 10 minutes later, I discovered that my friend did not return to me so I went out to take a look. After that I saw a whole group of people shouting at each other. My friends just stand there but the other party keep shouting towards them, Subsequently I think Gerald friend joined in and started to shout back. After that I went to the middle of the 2 groups and told my friends not to fight. I also tried to separate them because they are getting closer to each other. After that the 2 policemen came and the crowd was scattering. During the process, Gerald was with another guy and they seem like they are going to fight. Immediately, I faster hug Gerald and pulled him back. I also said to Gerald not to fight and faster run. I was facing Gerald when I was pulling him away but at my back was someone who kept pushing me. I tried to stop him from going towards Gerald. It was only later that I discovered that they were police officers and I was actually blocking them. After that the police officer brought me to the side and told me that they are going to arrest me for causing obstruction to a police officer.

46     I was also mindful that in Question 9 of his statement (D4), when asked how much drinks he had prior to the incident, the accused had stated that he drunk a lot and that Gerald drank more than him.

#### Inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence

47     The accused’s Defence Counsel had sought to characterise the incident as an example of a case where adrenaline got the better of a police officer while he was in the thick of things, at the expense of the accuracy of his decision-making process. It was submitted that the victim was unable to recall exactly where the victim had pushed him and had given inconsistent explanations. It was further submitted that mistaken by the accused’s full compliance to police authority and repeated apologies, the victim had made an arrest.

48     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence as highlighted by the Defence were not material. In my view, the victim had given a clear and credible account of the events that had transpired in the early hours of 21 October 2018. It had always been the Prosecution’s case that the victim was pushed by the accused from the front and I found that it was corroborated by PW2’s BWC footage as well as the victim’s own statement.

49     Although the proceeded charge (C1B) at the commencement of the trial had stated that the accused had used criminal force by pushing the victim on his shoulder, the Prosecution elected to amend the charge after the victim’s re-examination was concluded. The charge was amended to state that the accused had used criminal force by pushing him at his chest area (C1C). The Defence was given the opportunity to recall the victim and had in fact further cross-examined the victim on the amended particulars.

50     At trial, the victim had testified that the accused had pushed him in the chest area using both hands while in his statement he had stated that he was pushed in his left shoulder. While there may be a minor discrepancy as to the exact location of his body where the victim was pushed _ie_ whether on the right shoulder, left shoulder, or chest area, I agreed with the Prosecution that it did not affect the victim’s credibility as his testimony that he was pushed in the chest area was corroborated by evidence from PW2’s BWC footage.

51     I agreed with the Prosecution that such minor inconsistencies are also not surprising, having regard to human fallibility in recollection and retention. This is particularly so since the entire incident from the time the man in the white T-shirt was first seen engaging members of the accused’s group until the time of the physical contact between the accused and the victim had lasted for about two minutes. I was also mindful that the victim’s interaction with the accused and his friends in his attempt to arrest Gerald was over in a few seconds after Gerald managed to leave the scene.

#### PW1’s missing BWC footage

52     It was the Defence’s case that in order to stick to the story that he had initially proffered, the victim had made an error of judgement to delete the relevant footage from his BWC evidencing the incident instead of doing the right thing, which was to admit that his recollection of the chaos-filled series of events may not have been perfect.

53     It was the Defence’s case that in order to stick to the story that he had initially proffered, the victim had made an error of judgement to delete the relevant footage from his BWC evidencing the incident instead of doing the right thing, which was to admit that his recollection of the chaos-filled series of events may not have been perfect.

54     In response to this allegation, the Prosecution had argued that the Defence’s focus on the unavailable video footages was a red herring. It was submitted that the Defence’s arguments in respect of the unavailable video footages was irrelevant in light of the evidence that was available. It was further submitted that nothing raised by the Defence changed the fact that the accused’s act of pushing the victim was captured on PW2’s BWC and that the victim had testified credibly to that effect as well.

55     In the present case, I rejected the Defence’s serious allegation that the victim had deleted the relevant footage from his BWC evidencing the incident. In my view, such an allegation was baseless and without merit. The victim had testified that his BWC had been dislodged in the chaotic situation. He believed that it had stopped recording as a result. The Prosecution had submitted that the victim’s account of the BWC was dislodged was corroborated by the footage in P3 itself. As a result of the dislodgment, it was not fully and properly reattached and this was apparent from the slanted angle of the footage in P3.

56     It was further submitted that Investigation Officer (“IO”) Kan Bee Yan (PW5) testified that in her experience (as an investigation officer for about 3 years and previously a ground response officer for about 10 years), where a BWC was dislodged, or disconnected while recording, there were three possibilities as to what would happen to the footage:

> (a)     that the recording would continue;

> (b)     that it would continue recording but the file would be corrupted and not extractable; or

> (c)     that the video would not be recorded at all.

57     Similarly, IO Ng Yi Quan Glenn (PW7) had testified that in his experience (as an IO for three years and Team Leader of ground resource officers since January 2020), a BWC footage would not become available in situations such as the BWC being dislodged causing it to momentarily switch off and causing a corrupt file or technical faults or system faults like the footage being corrupted or not being downloaded to the system.

58     In the present case, I accepted the victim’s evidence that he could not have tampered or deleted the earlier footage as it was impossible for him to tamper with the footage. Officers were unable to delete, shorten, or edit it at any point and this point was confirmed by PW5. He also testified that he would not have been informed of the Investigation Officer’s subsequent application for the footage and did not have any access to the server either. In my view, it was highly foreseeable that the relevant BWC footage was unavailable due to a technical or system fault causing the footage to be corrupted or not downloaded into the system.

#### The missing CCTV footage that was shown to the accused on 21 October 2018

59     The Defence has submitted that the failure of the police and/or the Prosecution to sufficiently retrieve and preserve relevant evidence _ie_ the source CCTV footage was highly prejudicial to the accused. It was argued that as the source CCTV footage comprised of footage from differing CCTV camera’s (and/or angles), it could have provided this Court with crucial evidence as to whether the incident did in fact occur in the manner as described by the victim.

60     In response, the Prosecution had submitted that the Defence’s 14 September 2020 letter to the Prosecution had conveyed the impression that they were referring to such CCTV footage which was shown to the accused when he was first detained after the incident occurred _ie_ at the scene itself. It was the Prosecution’s case that they were not aware of the existence of any such CCTV footage and had conveyed this to the Defence as such. This was clarified on the record in open Court.

61     It was further submitted that the only available CCTV footage by the time of trial was tendered in evidence ie P4. There was no basis for the Defence’s argument that the source CCTV footage could have, or would have, provided the court with evidence potentially exculpating the accused for the following reasons:

> (a)     This was a wholly speculative argument. No evidence has been led to support it;

> (b)     It was against the weight of the evidence as PW7 had testified that content of P4 was the same as the source CCTV and the quality of the image was almost the same.

> (c)     CCTV footage from other angles were not very useful either, as it was not possible for him to make out what had happened from these footages;

> (d)     The fact that the source CCTV footage was longer than what was captured in P4 was logically irrelevant as P4 had captured the material timings of the incident.

62     I agreed with the Prosecution that it was inappropriate for the Defence to raise matters relating to the correspondence. In my view, I did not think the fact that the source CCTV footage was no longer available was prejudicial to the accused as P4 had captured the material timings of the incident.

63     All things considered, after having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the accused, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established its case in respect of the charge in DAC 933055-2019 beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted him on the charge.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

#### s 353 of the Penal Code

64     The prescribed penalty for an offence of using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty is a term of imprisonment which may extend to four years, or with a fine, or with both.

## Antecedents

65     The accused had no prior antecedents.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

66     The Prosecution had sought a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and had relied on the sentencing framework for s 353 Penal Code offences prescribed by the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 114</span> (“_Aw Soy Tee_”). It was submitted that the present case fell within the middle band and not the lower band of Category 1 of lesser harm and lower culpability.

67     It was the Prosecution’s case that it is quite clear from _Aw Soy Tee_ that the starting tariff is a short custodial sentence. It was highlighted that the High Court had referred to _Public Prosecutor v Chua Cheng Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 158</span>, a case involving a young offender who was only 21 years of age, had pleaded guilty and no public disquiet was caused. In that case, his sentence was seven days’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the degree of exceptional mitigating factors that must be present for a fine to be imposed is quite high.

68     It was highlighted that in _Public Prosecutor v Shalaan s/o Sukumaran_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 149</span> at \[10\](“ _Shalaan s/o Sukumaran”)_, the offender in that case was already trying to break up the fight when the police came. This was quite different scenario from the present case where the police went in first to break up the fight and the accused then went in and pushed the policeman.

#### Aggravating factors

69     It was submitted that the first aggravating factor present in this case was that this was a chaotic situation where the police were outnumbered by far. Outside of the club, the patrons were intoxicated and behaving rowdily. A fight had just broken out, there was screaming and there was danger of the fight escalating into a bigger fight. The victim did his duty of trying to take control of the situation by apprehending the subject who had punched another subject.

70     It was further submitted that it is especially important for the police to be able to assert control and restore order to such a situation before it spirals out of control. It was in this context that the accused deterred the victim from doing so and in fact, the accused had added to the chaos and violence by pushing the victim.

71     The second aggravating factor was that the subject identified as Gerald by the accused got away in this case. So, there was an element of actual obstruction in this case.

72     Lastly, it was submitted that this was a claim trial case. It was highlighted that the Defence’s run was entirely unmeritorious. PW2’s BWC did capture the act of pushing and the accused’s decision to claim trial just smacks of a lack of true remorse. It was the Prosecution’s case for a plead guilty case involving a simple push, a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was not unusual.

## Mitigation

73     In his written plea in mitigation, it was the Defence’s case that there was no such deliberate challenge or contempt shown towards police authority. It was submitted that prior to the incident, the accused had not committed any offence and was not trying to evade apprehension when the incident occurred.

74     Further, given the timing, the location of the incident and the chaotic situation at the material time, the incident was not witnessed by the members of public at large. According to the Defence, the only person who witnessed the incident was the victim as PW2 who was in close proximity with the victim and the accused, had testified that he did not witness the incident.

75     The Defence had urged the Court to consider the following factors:

> (a)     The accused was a first-time offender who simply made a momentary error of judgment. He is a man of good character and has no antecedents. He was not a hardened criminal with no remorse as this was his very first brush with the law;

> (b)     The accused had rendered full co-operation to the police and did not flee from the scene of the incident. When the victim informed him that he would be arresting him at the material time of the incident, the accused complied with the victim’s instructions and rendered his full co-operation to the police to assist them in their investigations;

> (c)     The accused is in his prime years and has a bright future ahead of him and this will be crushed by a custodial sentence. At the time of the offence, he was 23 years old. Any sentence of imprisonment imposed on him would be a crushing blow to both him and his family, given that he is the sole breadwinner of his family and they depend on him for their livelihood;

> (d)     The contact between the accused and the victim was minimal. The accused did not use or attempt to use any weapon and/or dangerous implement or means. He was unarmed and any contact inflicted on the victim was bare-handed. The victim did not complain that he had suffered any injuries arising from the incident;

> (e)     The accused had merely acted in the heat of the moment and that his acts were not pre-meditated. The offence did not involve any other offenders and was not the product of any concerted effort to commit any offence whatsoever. Further, given the chaotic situation and the manner in which the events unfolded at the material time, it would be natural and reasonable for the accused to have been in a heightened emotional state of panic then.

76     It was the Defence’s case that the present case was largely similar to _Public Prosecutor v Shalaan s/o Sukumaran_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 149</span> where the accused was sentenced to a fine of S$6,000. In that case, the accused and his friends were on their way home after clubbing when a male stranger approached them out of the blue and attacked them without warning. The male stranger later got into a fight with one of the accused’s friends. The accused panicked and tried to intervene, by trying to separate the two men. Four police officers then arrived at the scene to break up the fight and two of the police officers managed to successfully separate the two men. At this point, the accused suddenly approached the victim and pushed him once on his chest, with the intent to deter the victim from carrying out his duty. The victim was caught by surprise and moved backwards but did not fall or suffer any injuries.

77     Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Defence had urged the Court to consider the accused’s case as an exceptional one, falling within the lowest end of Category 1 cases _ie_ low harm and low culpability of the _Aw Soy Tee_ framework and to which a fine of S$8,000 would be a sufficient and appropriate punishment.

78     It was highlighted that the High Court in _Ong Chee Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> had cautioned, unrelenting deterrence does not mean indiscriminate deterrence, and any punishment imposed on an accused must fit the crime and the criminal.

## Decision on Sentence

#### Applicable sentencing framework

79     In my determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed I was guided by the sentencing framework in _Aw Soy Tee_ which prescribed the following presumptive sentencing ranges for first-time offenders who claim trial:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.8233646729346%"> <col width="46.7293458691738%"> <col width="36.4472894578916%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Band</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to eighteen months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eighteen months to four years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

80     At \[53\] of _Aw Soy Tee_, the High Court had reiterated that following the suggested framework outlined above, fines are only imposed in exceptional cases which lie at the lowest end of the low-harm, low-culpability spectrum. Meanwhile, lengthier custodial sentences are generally reserved only for the more serious offences which involve a higher degree of harm and/or culpability. Thus, the “starting tariff” or the indicative starting point for offences under s 353 of the Penal Code is a short custodial sentence.

81     In assessing the harm caused and/or culpability of the accused, the list of considerations as set out in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> which the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee_ at \[29\] affirmed applied for s 353 Penal Code offences include the following:

> (a)     the degree of hurt caused and its consequences;

> (b)     the use or attempted use of a weapon or other dangerous implement or means (_eg_ biting) and its capacity to do harm;

> (c)     the age, lack of maturity or presence of mental disorder where it affects materially the responsibility of the offender;

> (d)     the circumstances leading to the commission of the offence (_eg_ the offender’s motivations for causing hurt to the victim, whether the offence was planned or premeditated, whether it demonstrated contempt for police officers and their authority);

> (e)     the timing and location of the offence, in particular whether it was committed within the public’s view and hearing;

> (f)     whether the offence involved a sustained or repeated attack;

> (g)     the number of offenders involved;

> (h)     whether the offender intended to inflict more serious hurt than what materialised;

> (i)     whether any steps were taken to avoid detection or prosecution; and

> (j)     the offender’s criminal history and propensity.

#### The present case is a Category 1 case

82     It was not disputed between the parties that the present case fell within Category 1, involving low harm and low culpability. I agreed with this categorisation.

83     In the present case, the accused had pushed the victim in the chest area once. The victim did not fall as result of the push and no injury was caused.

84     No weapons were used in the present case and the offence did not involve any repeated or sustained attacks.

85     At the time of the offence, the accused was 23 years old and nine days away from his ORD.

86     The offence was not premeditated. The accused was not the one who started the fight and he had not been trying to evade apprehension by the police.

#### Aggravating factors

87     In the present case, the accused had demonstrated contempt for police officers and their authority. When the victim had moved towards Gerald to detain him for his involvement in the fight, the accused quickly followed suit and pushed the victim in the chest area to prevent him from doing so.

88     After pushing the victim, the accused had used his arms to block the victim from gaining access to Gerald until the latter managed to slip away. Hence, the accused had deterred the victim from executing his duties and in the process aided Gerald in evading apprehension.

89     The offence was committed in the early hours of the morning along a crowded passageway outside Club Gaga at Orchard Towers. The situation was chaotic as the two police officers who were outnumbered, had to disperse a crowd of individuals who were not only shouting and screaming but were also physical with one another.

90     In his statement (D4), when asked how much he had drunk prior to the incident, he had stated that he had drunk a lot while he was at Club Gaga. His intoxicated state was a culpability enhancing circumstance.

#### Mitigating factors

91     The accused had no antecedents.

92     Based on the above factors, I did not think the present case was an exceptional case which lie at the lowest end of the low-harm, low-culpability spectrum as submitted by the Defence. I disagreed with the Defence that the case of _Shalaan s/o Sukumaran_ was largely similar with the present case. I noted in that case when the four police officers arrived at the scene, they had witnessed two male Indians fighting and the accused was trying to separate the two men. In that case, the court found that there was no deliberate defiance of police authority. As highlighted by the Prosecution, in the present case the victim went towards Gerald first and the accused then went in and pushed him. Furthermore, the victim was clearly outnumbered when he went towards Gerald in the present case.

93     The imposition of a fine of $8000 as proposed by Counsel would clearly not be adequate or appropriate as there are aggravating factors in the present case. Hence, there were no exceptional reasons before me to depart from the usual custodial sentence imposed for offences of such nature.

94     Nevertheless, I did not think the present case warranted the imposition of a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution. The accused who was 23 years old at the time of the offence could be considered as being relatively young. He was also a first offender at the time of the offence.

95     Furthermore, the accused was not the one who started the fight. Instead, it was due to the persistence of the Chinese male in the white T-shirt who continued to engage members of the accused’s group despite attempts by others to separate them. The accused’s actions were spontaneous and not premeditated, although I disagreed that the accused had been in a heightened emotional state of panic.

96     All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances.
