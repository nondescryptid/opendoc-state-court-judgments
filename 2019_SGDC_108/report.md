## D.   Medical Reports

12     The victims in this case were conveyed to the respective hospitals as a result of the incident.

13     The following medical reports of each of the victims state the following injuries:

a.      **M Visnukanth**: Dr Jeremy Ng Chung Fai of Singapore General Hospital, in a report dated 7 July 2016, stated that Visnu suffered a single stab wound to the posterior left chest. He was hypotensive and resuscitated with fluids before proceeding for a CT scan. 2 defects were noted on the left hemo-diaphragm and a 4-cm laceration of the spleen were repaired. He was warded from 11 to 16 June 2016 and seen with a follow-up appointment on 23 June 2016.

b.      **Divagaran A/L Kesavan**: Dr Tina Koh of National Cancer Centre Singapore, Division of Surgical Oncology, in a report dated 12 July 2016, stated that Divagaran was found to have sustained a 4cm open wound horizontal over right anterior chest wall and a vertical 3cm laceration over lateral chest wall, lacerations over right shoulder, leg and finger, right pneumothorax in the chest, moderate haemothorax, pneumothorax and moderate haematoma in the fissure. He was seen by orthopaedics and hand and oncology surgeons in the repair of other injuries and was discharged well on 17 June 2016, six days after admission on 11 June 2016.

c.      **Jamal Razeen bin Abdul Ghani**: Dr Chok Aik Yong of Singapore General Hospital, in a report dated 26 July 2016, stated that Jamal was found to have suffered 6cm laceration over high occiput, 10cm laceration over left parietal region of scalp, 1cm laceration over left upper back, large left posterior convexity scalp haematoma, and subcutaneous emphysema in the right posterior chest wall. A CT on his chest showed small pockets of gas which were seen in the subcutaneous tissues and paraspinal muscles of the upper back, consistent with the given history of a knife wound. On 11 June 2016, he underwent wound exploration, toilet and suture of scalp lacerations and back wound. Intra-operative findings showed:

i)       Left-sided scalp laceration, located at parieto-occiptal region, 5cm in length, full thickness down to periosteum but no skull fracture;

ii)       Right-sided scalp laceration, parietal region, 5 x 3 cm degloving, partial thickness, some muscles exposed, debris present;

iii)       Upper back 2cm wound 5 cm deep, spinal process palpable.

He underwent toilet and suture of scalp lacerations and back wounds and was discharged well on 13 June 2016.

The X-ray of left hand showed displaced fracture of proximal phalanx of left thumb. He underwent wound debridement surgery under emergency OT and was discharged on 12 June 2016. Hospitalisation leave was given from 11 to 26 June 2016.

## The Prosecution’s Case

14     The prosecution called 17 witnesses to prove their case. The witnesses included 3 police officers, 2 doctors, the 4 victims, 5 lay witnesses, 2 employees from St James Power Station and 1 accomplice.

#### Station Inspector Noraini Hussain (SI Noraini), PW1 and Senior Staff Sergeant Neo Kai Loon Alvin (SSSgt Neo), PW2

15     SI Noraini is the current investigating officer. She introduced the floor plans of Posbar and Rupee, both clubs within the establishment of St James Power Station (St James). The floor plans, P38 and P39, accurately reflect the layout of St James as at 11 June 2016. SI Noraini obtained the photographs of the 5 suspects after they had been arrested. The 5 photographs were admitted collectively as P40. In P40, the first photograph is that of Darwin Singh (Darwin), the second photograph is that of Muhamad Danial bin Mohamed Siraj (Danial), the third photograph is that of Zulfiqar bin Johari (Zulfiqar), the fourth photograph is that of Muhammad Muhaimin bin Kasim (Muhaimin) and the accused appears in the fifth photograph.

16     SSSgt Neo, the initial investigating officer referred to P1 (FIR), where he confirmed the call was made but he was unable to ascertain the identity of the caller. He tendered a DVD (P41) that contains two folders, the first with eight clips and the second with three clips, which he obtained from St James. A video clip from the second folder was played where the camera faces the entrance of Postbar.

17     From 4.16:50 to 4:17:06 a.m., SSSgt Neo confirmed the identity of Zulfikar wearing a cap and a long-sleeve shirt and Muhaimin wearing a dark coloured shirt. The victim Visnu was seen to be in the video with the pair. Darwin and Zulhilmy, wearing an Adidas cap and a red long-sleeve shirt were also identified.

18     From 4.21:14 to 4:22 am, Jamal, a victim, is seen holding his head with Zulkifar and Muhaimin at the bottom right of the screen. During this time, SSSgt Neo said that this is where one of the fights involving Jamal took place. Two other ladies, Nur Khatijjah Bte Shaik Allaudin (Khatijjah) and Nur Shakila Bte A Salim (Shakila) were also present in the video. Jamal’s blood can be seen in the video clip.

19     At 4:10:40 am, SSSgt Neo described the location as a walkway leading out to the main road outside of St James which can be seen at the left side of D3. From 4:10:42 to 4:10;48 am, SSSgt Neo observed that Darwin was wearing a black shirt and was present at the walkway, holding a flick knife in his hand. Muhaimin, Danial and Zulfikar were behind Darwin. This event was taking place after the fighting incident outside Postbar involving Muhaimin and Zulfiqar. However, SSSgt Neo said that due to the discrepancies in time, the timestamp reflected in the second clip is not accurate as there is a time difference of 13 to 15 minutes. This is again an issue for the next clip.

20     From 4:10:46 to 4:10: 50 am, SSSgt Neo said that the video showed a horizontal middle section of the same walkway as in the previous clip which only showed the vertically down part of the walkway. Darwin, Muhaimin, Zulfikar and Danial appeared to be on their way towards Vivocity opposite the road. The accused is not seen in the video but he was with the group and at a distance away.

21     When cross-examined, SSSgt Neo agreed that the 5 accused persons were seen leaving Postbar at 4:17 in the first clip with the accused at the back of the queue. SSSgt Neo added that due to the limitations of the first clip, the accused was not seen in the assault on Jamal. There were blind spots where the fighting took place which were not captured by the camera. Based on investigation the flick knife held by Darwin was the same weapon used on Visnu and possibly the other three victims, as all four had stab wounds.

#### Dr. Chok Aik Yong (Dr Chok), PW13

22     Dr Chok prepared the medical report, P37, dated the 26 of July 2016 concerning Jamal. He examined Jamal when the latter was brought to SGH. He confirmed the injuries written in the report which included lacerations on his occiput, scalp region and left upper back. Dr Chok said that the subcutaneous emphysema, which is gas pockets and air seen in the soft tissue was consistent with external injuries. The injury, which was a laceration, travelled upwards north to the patient’s head and went deep into the soft tissue of his neck.

23     When referred to a right sided scalp laceration Dr Chok said that a 5 by 3cm degloving had taken place, which is when the soft tissue of the scalp was removed and hanging by itself in a V shape. The upper back wound was 5cm deep which was consistent with a knife wound. He was of the view that the injuries were consistent with that of a knife or a sharp object and that quite a large amount of force would be needed to cause these injuries. He saw no evidence of a possible glass bottle attack that may have occurred on Jamal’s head. The injuries caused to Jamal were all lacerations consistent with a sharp object rather than a blunt one like the glass bottle and that no debris of glass or glass shards were found on him during the surgery. Due to the thickness of the lacerations and the degloving, it is very highly unlikely that a blunt object such as a glass bottle could have caused them.

24     In cross-examination, when questioned as to whether a blunt trauma can lead to a laceration, Dr Chok disagreed as lacerations meant that the injury is clean cut and that it was unlikely that the clean-cut opening on Jamal was caused by blunt trauma. He added that if a glass bottle were to shatter, it may cause clean lacerations but an intact glass bottle without any sharp edges would not cause the lacerations found on Jamal. He disagreed that Jamal’s head injury was likely to have been caused by the glass bottle as the impact would have left other injuries which were not present and that his injuries were caused by something penetrating other than blunt trauma.

#### Abdul Kareem bin Noor Mohamed (Kareem), PW3

25     Kareem is a supervisor of the Command Centre Operations Room at St James. His duties covered security, safety and he is in charge of the CCTV cameras. Kareem said that the camera facing the entrance of Postbar was on the top of the building on the right side. The cameras for the second and third clips are different. The middle section of the walkway has no camera. Kareem agreed that there are discrepancies in timing between the first camera facing the entrance and the other two cameras facing the walkway.

26     The first video clip at 4:18 am was played and Kareem who identified himself in the clip said that he came to the entrance of Postbar and spoke to Muhaimim and his friends. They were shouting at the Indian males. Muhaimin appeared to be quite angry as he claimed his friend had been hit but Kareem did not believe him as the friend appeared to have no injury. Muhaimin then showed a flip knife and which all his friends saw. Kareem tried to calm Muhaimin and advised him not to use the knife. There were about 5 or 6 friends of Muhaimin around him but he was only able to recognise Muhaimin as the latter was a regular at the club. There was a lot of shouting going on.

27     At 4:21 am, Kareem saw Nicholas punching Jamal once. This led to Muhaimin and his friends attacking Jamal who was stabbed on his head. He was unable to identify Muhaimin’s friends, except for Zulfiqar, but saw Muhaimin stabbing Jamal on the head. He was unable to stop this. Jamal’s girlfriend came to take a tissue to cover his head as it was bleeding badly and Jamal was badly injured. He observed another victim, a fat Indian male lying down on the top of the right staircase who had been stabbed. He called for the police and ambulance to assist.

28     When cross-examined, Kareem said that that he was running up the staircase as there seemed to be a chaotic commotion involving 20 fellows, a mixture of Malays and Indians. He could not recall if the accused was present during the commotion.

#### Nicholas S/O Markandam (Nicholas), PW15

29     Nicholas is currently working for Club Bollywood as a security officer. He left Club Rumours 3 days after the incident on the 11 June 2016. He worked as a public relations officer for Club Rumours and his job was to provide information on promotions to customers.

30     On 10 June 2016 Nicholas had been working since 10pm. When shown P40, Nicholas recognised all of them being present in the club and he identified the accused. He did not know their names but he recognised them as being customers of the club and saw them between 12 midnight to 1 am on 11 June 2016. When he saw the 5 of them outside the club he told them that if they wanted to enter they can get a bottle inside. After the 5 chatted for about 15 to 20 minutes they told him that they will go into the club to get the bottle. Their behaviour was normal. Before the 11 June 2016, he knew them as Danial and Muhaimin would go to Rupee room once in a while.

31     At about 2.30am, his shift ended and Nicholas went to the Rupee room to have some drinks. He stayed in Rupee room for about 1 to 1 and half hours. After drinking, Nicholas went out to smoke around 4 plus. Some bouncers then told him that there is a fight happening at the carpark. He followed them to Club Rumours and by the time he went down the stairs there was a big fight going on. There were people screaming and shouting. There was a fight near the road area between a group of people. Nicholas saw the 5 Malay males whom he had allowed to enter the club fighting some 5 or 6 Indian males. He was very sure that the 5 Malay males were fighting as he was the one who stopped the fight by pushing the groups aside. He told the Malay group to leave the place because since he had allowed them to enter the club it would not be nice for his boss to know that as it would be considered his mistake.

32     The 5 Malays left before an individual from the Indian group shouted a vulgarity and caused all 5 to return for a second fight. The same 5 then started punching and kicking the Indian males. When asked if he specifically saw the accused fighting in the second fight, Nicholas replied he did not see but was sure all 5 took part in the fighting. The second fight was rather messy as some were on the road and some were near to the staircase area. Nicholas tried to separate the groups again but was cut on his finger and he assumed a weapon was used. There was an Indian male in front of him and Nicholas thought that this person had the weapon and he pushed this person. Before he could do anything else a few Malay males started to beat this person by kicking and punching him.

33     Nicholas was then showed video clips where he could be seen punching a man who he suspected had cut him. He also identified the two groups fighting although he did not recognise the members in the Indian group. The same Malays who entered the club earlier were also fighting. He saw Muhaimin in one of the videos as a person bending down. Another male with a cap was next to Muhaimin although he could not identify that person.

34     When shown the video of the staircase where he and 2 other Malay males were present, these 2 were attacking the same Indian that Nicholas had punched in the previous video clip. In the video, Nicholas was seen talking to someone to whom he said that he was telling the friends of the Indian male that his hand had been cut and he wanted to know what weapon was being used. He mentioned that one of the friends was a girl who kept shouting at him but he ignored her and went to shout at the Indian males. After shouting, Nicholas turned away before going back towards the Indian and Malay group, and by which time few of the latter still remained.

35     Nicholas yelled to the Malay group to leave. He escorted them from the back which comprised the 5 individuals in P40, to the entrance of the club. Nicholas was then shown video clips where he identified Darwin, Danial, Zulfiqar and Muhaimin. Upon viewing another video, Nicholas identified Darwin walking in front of him while Zulfiqar was next to him. He was certain he had escorted all 5 in P40 out and that the accused had his hair tied which was what he remembered. The accused was part of the group which attacked the Indians. He could identify all the victims of the Malay group but he did not know their names. Nicholas knew Muhaimin as he lives near him and that the 5 have been in the vicinity of Club Rumours. He had seen Muhaimin, Danial and Zulfiqar before but cannot recall when he had seen Darwin or the accused in the area.

36     In cross-examination, Nicholas said that Zulfiqar and the accused had long hair and that only the former was big-sized compared to the others. Muhaimin approached him when they first arrived, to discuss drinks and a table. At 12 am when they arrived, the club was only a quarter-filled though many came after. He brought them into the club to pass instructions to the waiter but he did not see where they sat. He later saw two groups shouting but he could not remember what they were saying. He saw them kicking, punching and shouting but the girls were just screaming. There were 5 in the Malay group. And he could identify that all 5 accused persons were there.

37     Nicholas recalled seeing the 5 at his club and they were involved in the fight. He punched Jamal because he thought Jamal was the person who cut his hand and that he was not thinking straight as he had been drinking. Jamal did not answer when he asked him why did he cut his hand and was covering his head as the Malay males were kicking and punching him. They were aggressive towards Jamal and he did not have the strength to push them away. Muhaimin and Zulfiqar were with Jamal and that the rest were at the main road. Jamal was holding his head because he had been punched and kicked by the 2 Malay males and they were still kicking him. He denied attacking Jamal with a glass or jug as no jugs or glasses are allowed to be brought outside the club. The blood of Jamal seen in the video was caused by the Malays attacking him. He maintained that the accused was involved in the attack.

38     When re-examined, Nicholas confirmed that all the 5 persons in P40 entered Club Rumours that night and no other Malay groups were present. He saw all 5 taking part in the fighting and recognised them as he was the one who let them into Club Rumours in the first place.

#### M Visnukanth (Visnu), PW4

39     Visnu is one of the victims of the attack. He testified that on the night of 10 June 2016, he was clubbing at the Avalon Club at Marina Bay Sands. He was with his friend Velanraj when the latter got a call from a friend, one Vinod, around midnight asking him to go to Club Rumours to settle an issue in the club with regards to Vinod’s girlfriend. Visnu followed Velanraj to Club Rumours where the issue had already been settled and they decided to have drinks. The time was past midnight, on the night of 11 June 2016. Despite Visnu being unaware of how much he had drunk, he said that he was aware of the events during that time.

40     At Club Rumours, Visnu went to the dance floor as he wanted to find his friends for a smoke break. He encountered a group of 4 to 6 Malay males. Although he could identify some clothing, he could not recall much as the lights in the club were dim. Visnu could only identify this particular Malay group. While the club generally catered towards Indians, Visnu had no idea as to why the Malay group was present. When the Malay group moved towards him, Visnu moved to the side of the dance floor to avoid them when a skinny male from the group bumped into him and another male pushed his face. Zulfikar, whom he could identify, stood in front of him and told him to go out of the club as they surrounded him and Visnu was held by them. He felt scared.

41     As they exited the club, Visnu tried to escape but the Malay group told him to return to them. Visnu asked why they called him out only to be met with a punch on the left side of his face before being punched all over his body, back and his head. He was unable to tell how long the assault took place or who punched him. After being punched, Visnu was dragged to the floor as a person grabbed him from the back and he felt a knife stab him in his left chest once. Visnu had covered his face all this time and could not identify anyone. After the stab, the assailants left him alone with the exception of someone spitting on him.

42     After the attack, Visnu, who was bleeding, traumatised and in pain approached Velanraj for help. Velanraj noticed that Visnu’s left side of his chest was bleeding. When the ambulance came to take him away, Visnu noticed at that point a small, skinny Indian man being attacked by the same group of Malays who had escorted him out from Club Rumours. He was traumatised by the incident and he gets nightmares. He did not understand why he had been assaulted as he, Velanraj and Vinod did nothing to provoke the incident.

43     During cross-examination, Visnu testified that Zulfiqar was the person who asked him to come out from the club in a threatening manner. When he was outside the club, he tried to escape from the group by going left towards a No Entry sign and that was when a person shouted at him to go back towards the group. Visnu reiterates that 4 to 6 people attacked him. He did not recognise the person who stabbed him.

#### Velanraj s/o Ramani Muthu (Velanraj), PW9

44     On the 11 June 2016 Velanraj and Visnu, from a club called Avalon, went to Club Rumours around 2 am to meet one Vinod, their mutual friend. The trio entered the club and that was when they noticed a big group of Malay males inside Club Rumours. This was unusual to Velanraj as Club Rumours was predominantly an Indian club scene. The Malay males, about 10 in number, were clad in long sleeves, jeans and T-shirts. They were drinking and dancing in the club.

45     Visnu then went out to smoke and after twenty minutes, Velanraj went outside to look for him. It was then that he encountered a commotion. There were people fighting, shouting and running about at the road signage where there is a double-arrow sign. He went to look for Visnu who later approached him with a bloody face and remarked that he was in pain. Velanraj took Visnu to the stairs on P2 and wiped his face. He realised that there was more blood as Visnu was bleeding. When Velanraj inspected his body, he could see something bloody and fleshy protruding out from Visnu’s left rib which Velanraj could feel that it was a deep, stab wound. Velanraj called for his friends to aid him as he called for an ambulance.

46     In the commotion, Velanraj recalls big-sized, tall Malay guys beating up Indians. He estimated than there were eight Malay guys beating up less than two Indian guys. The attire that Velanraj could recall the Malay guys wearing were grey long sleeve T-shirts and caps. The sizes of all the estimated eight Malay guys varied from big and small. Velanraj said that the group in the club prior to the incident were part of the Malay males beating up the Indian males.

47     Velanraj also noticed that at the counter of the entrance to the club, two Malay males were beating up one Indian male vigorously by punching and kicking him and the Indian male was holding his head which was bleeding. Descending the stairs, Velanraj noticed the Indian male with the bloody head injury at the staircase in front of the poster of Baby Face holding his head. He could only hear shouting during the fight.

48     When referred to P40 Velanraj identified Darwin and Muhaimin being at the scene. Darwin was running around with the Malay group who were beating up the Indian males although he did not see him physically attack anyone. Velanraj identified Muhaimin as being one of the two Malay males who attacked the Indian with the bleeding head injury at the reception counter. Muhaimin was later seen stabbing a skinny Indian male on his left shoulder at the pavement near to the brick wall in P2. The weapon used was a short knife and holding it in a clenched fist Muhaimin stabbed the skinny Indian male twice. Velanraj recognised the skinny Indian male as Divagaran, PW11, as they had played soccer together previously. He was two metres away from Muhaimin and Divagaran. Divagaran was in pain.

49     Velanraj did not know why the commotion happened and that it was around 10 to 20 minutes. Muhaimin was the most aggressive of the Malay males in the attack. The Malay males were the aggressors and the Indian males were the victims.

50     In cross-examination, Velanraj did not agree that there were other Malay males inside Club Rumours other than the group which he noticed. Velanraj said that he scanned the area first before he danced in the club. The Malay group he saw in the club consisted of 10 persons and they were sitting at the VIP table. He only recognised Darwin from P40 as being part of the group because he had a neck tattoo. Nothing out of the ordinary happened and then Visnu left to smoke. It was only the unusual amount of time taken for a smoke break, which was 20 minutes, that made him leave the club to search for Visnu.

51     When Velanraj left there were other people standing outside the door and in the area, which he described as messy and there was a commotion. He saw one unknown Indian male being beaten up by 2 or 3 Malay males. There was a brawl going on. He recognised the Malay males as being part of the group in the club.

52     In re-examination, Velanraj confirmed that he did not see any other Malay males in the club other than the initial ten man group. He saw two or three Malay males wearing bermudas outside of Club Rumours but they were apart from this group. Both Darwin and Muhaimin were part of the group at the VIP table.

#### Divagaran A/L Kesavan (Divagaran), PW11

53     Divagaran went to Postbar with his two friends Padmini and Chelsa at around 11. 30pm on 10 June 2016. He noticed a Malay group comprising of 4 to 5 Malay males which was unusual to him as Postbar was usually frequented by Indians. Divagaran was quite drunk that night. He went out to smoke with another 2 friends, he met at the club at the carpark found in D4. At first, everything seemed normal until he heard shouting at the carpark near the directional arrow in D4.

54     When he noticed the source of the shouting, Divagaran was about 5 to 10 metres away. It was coming from two large groups, one comprising the Malays he saw at the club and the other was an Indian group. He knew the Indian group were having an argument with the Malay group. He went closer to see what was happening and without warning, he was knocked out. When he regained consciousness, he was in the hospital and was informed that he had been stabbed. The hospital staff mentioned that he had been pierced with a sharp object. Divagaran said that as he approached the group, he collapsed and fell to the ground after experiencing a sudden pain.

55     Divagaran could not identify who had assaulted him although he was certain it came from the Malay group as he knew some members of the Indian group through football and was certain that the latter group did not attack him. He was unable to recognise any of the 5 accused persons. He did not start any trouble with the Malay group nor did any of his friends. Divagaran said that he was high but he was still aware of what was going on. The Malay group in the club was the same one shouting outside the club and he would have noticed if another Malay group was inside the club.

56     In cross-examination, Divagaran disagreed that the club was crowded at that time. He saw only 1 Malay group in the club. He could see the entire club as he was seated in front of a wall. The Malay group was in his line of sight and he could see them clearly as there was a light shining on them but he did not notice much after that. It was so obvious that there was a Malay group in the club.

#### Jamal Razeen bin Abdul Ghani(Jamal), PW12

57     Jamal went to Club Rumours with three friends, namely Shakila, Khatijjah and Visnu (not the first victim) on the night of 10 June 2016. He was there after midnight. He drank 2 bottles of whisky and did not notice much except that he was drinking, listening to music and dancing. At around 4 plus, Jamal went out for a smoke alone. While he was walking to the place where he wanted to smoke, he saw 2 groups of males comprising Malays and Indians quarrelling. These persons had been in the club earlier. There were more than 5 persons in each group. He did not bother with them and as he approached the brick wall in D4, Jamal noticed his friend Raj smoking at the same spot and went to join him.

58     While he was smoking, Jamal noticed a skinny Indian male lying down on the pavement in front of him. The male was unconscious at that time and Raj told Jamal that the male had been stabbed. It was then that Jamal felt someone using a bottle and gave him a singular hit at the back of his head. He turned around to see Nicholas, also known as Black, a bouncer had hit his head. Jamal then went down the staircase at D4. After going down the staircase, Jamal was attacked by three individuals, two Malays and one Indian but he cannot recognise them. When shown P40 he said that he cannot identify any of the 5 as being part of the group that attacked him. Jamal recognised the trio by their skin colour.

59     During the attack by the trio, they assaulted him with their hands but not weapons as he cannot remember if weapons were used. Jamal cannot remember which parts of his body was attacked but he has scars at the back of his head. The attack was about two minutes long. After the attack, he got up and moved to the car park to sit down where Khatijjah and Shakila attended to him.

60     When shown a video clip of the staircase on the right of the Asahi sign found in D5 at 4:21, Jamal identified himself as the man with the hands on his head. Prior to this, Black had attacked him with a bottle once. He later identified two males were going down the staircase and they attacked him near the Asahi sign. Later in the video, he pointed Khatijjah and Shakila approaching him. The pool of blood came from his head injury. During his assault by punches, Jamal felt little pain as he was numb due to his drunken state. He added that neither he nor his friends did anything that caused them to be attacked and he does not recognise the accused.

61     In cross-examination, Jamal described Club Rumours as an Indian club but agreed that there could be Malays patronising the said club. On the assault by the Malays, he felt no pain and was unsure of their movements because he had closed his eyes. After the attack, he was only concerned about his injuries and did not notice anything.

#### Nur Khatijjah bite Shaik Alauddin (Khatijjah), PW8

62     Khatijjah went clubbing at Club Rumours on 11 June 2016 with Shakila, Jamal and Jamal’s friend, one Vinod. They arrived at the club before 12 midnight. She went out for a smoke and met Danial, one of the co-accused persons, who was her friend, at the pavement of the corner of the red brick building in D6. Shakila was behind her at that point in time but she did not see Jamal. While talking to Danial, Khatijjah saw on her left side that a group of more than 5 Malay males, attired in shirt and jeans, started to beat a fat Indian male. Khatijjah identified them as Danial’s friends as the latter went to join them in the beating. She tried to stop Danial who responded by saying that were his friends. As she was unable to stop him, Khatijjah backed off. Danial joined the group and assaulted the fat Indian male. He disappeared amidst the chaos.

63     When a video that started at 4:10:43 on the night of the attack was played, Khatijjah spotted a male wearing a black shirt who had also joined in beating up the Indian male. She identified him as Darwin. She described the attack on the Indian male to be a group of more than 5 Malay males throwing punches and kicks at the fat Indian male who tried to retaliate in vain. When shown the other photographs in P40, Khatijjah could only identify Danial and Darwin as having taking part in the attack.

64     After the attack on the fat Indian male, the group who had beaten the fat Indian male, comprising Darwin but not Danial approached her and a skinny Indian male with a checked shirt who was next to her. Khatijjah and the skinny Indian male was at the brick wall at D6 at that moment. The group punched the skinny Indian male. Khatijjah told them to stop but one of them, whom she could not recognise, told her, in Malay, to keep quiet. She shouted back at them. She then saw a shiny, palm-sized pocket knife being taken out and used. As the group began to scatter, Khatijjah saw a wound on the chest of the skinny Indian man. She tried to compress the bleeding and in a moment, the friends of the skinny Indian man came out and she told them that their friend had been stabbed.

65     When the clip was replayed Khatijjah pointed out Darwin and Nicholas, wearing a blue shirt. She was able to identify Danial being at the scene as she was talking to him. After the skinny Indian man’s friends came, Khatijjah went to find Shakila and Jamal at the entrance of the club. As she walked forward, she saw Nicholas wanting to hit Jamal with a bottle and she pulled Jamal away. This incident took place at the entrance of the club. Khatijjah and Shakila were approaching Jamal and Nicholas from the stairs. There was a first hit on Jamal to which she partially blocked with her elbow by pulling him away but the second hit, was given by Nicholas using a glass object on Jamal’s head. Khatijjah was seen arguing with Nicholas.

66     Khatijjah called for an ambulance and comforted Shakila, who was crying. Besides those she saw being attacked, she did not witness any other. She was not able to recall if anyone other than Darwin and Danial from those as shown in P40 were present during the attack. Khatijjah had seen Jamal arguing with another unknown guy at the staircase before his attack by Nicholas.

67     When cross-examined, Khatijjah said that the group of males who were more than 5 in number, who attacked the fat Indian male were Malay as they looked and spoke Malay. She heard them as they were raising their voices. Danial joined the group. She could see the fat Indian male lying on the floor as the group of males dispersed. They went berserk and hit other people and the situation got chaotic. The skinny Indian male next to her was hit by the group. One of them attacked him in his chest area. They then walked away in a fast manner.

#### Nur Shakila Bte A Salim(Shakila), PW7

68     Shakila testified that on the morning of the 11 June 2016, after midnight, she was at Club Rumours to party with her friends, namely Jamal, Vinod and Khatijjah, also known as Kate. While at the club she consumed a lot of alcohol. Thereafter, together with Khatijjah, Jamal and an unknown male friend she went to smoke at the pavement beside the lamp post. While she was smoking, Shakila saw a fat Indian male being punched by a skinny male with a tattoo. The fat Indian male fell to the ground after he was punched. She saw Darwin at the scene but was unsure if he was the one who threw the punch.

69     The scene was chaotic and there were a lot of people outside the club which included the group of males, comprising Indians and Malays, surrounding the fat Indian male. After that, Shakila went to look for Khatijjah in the chaos and found her holding someone’s bleeding stomach at the brick wall. She saw Jamal being punched in the face by a male on the pavement. Jamal was next to the person who was being held by Khatijjah. She noticed that Jamal looked beaten up and was being pulled down the stairs by Nicholas. Together with Khatijjah she assisted Jamal by pulling him aside as he was bleeding from the head. They took him to the side of the road to calm him down and waited for the ambulance. She did not know any of the accused persons except for Nicholas as she frequently clubs at Club Rumours but does not have any dispute with him.

#### Sathaymoorthy s/o Kalaiselvan(Sathay), PW10

70     Sathay was with his friends, Suri and Suriya, at Postbar on 11 June 2016. The three of them were smoking outside the club, at the carpark area across from the road around 4 am to 5 am. He noticed a group of Malay males and a group of Indian males, with about 3 persons in each group, in a confrontation near to the red brick wall. The 2 groups were fighting each other. While he was inside the club, he did notice a group of Malay males but he was not sure if the group fighting with the Indians was the same group from the club. Sathay did not recognise any of the 5 accused persons as shown in P40.

71     As Sathay was walking away, he noticed on his right, at least two persons or possibly more were beating up an Indian male, one Jamal whom he recognised as his ex-girlfriend’s friend. He had previously seen Jamal in the club with two girls. Jamal saw Sathay and shouted for help. Sathay ran and grabbed Jamal to pull him away from the group as Jamal was bleeding badly. The group backed off and later on, he helped Jamal into the ambulance. When the video clip of Jamal’s incident was played, Sathay identified Jamal as the person with the head injury.

#### Prasad s/o Krishnan (Prasad), PW6

72     Prasad, the last victim, testified that in the early morning on 11 June 2016, he was with his girlfriend, Mariyamma and two friends in Club Rupee. He drank a lot of alcohol. He could not remember the events relating to his case clearly. When he was smoking outside Club Rupee together with his girlfriend and their friends he saw his friend Jamal, a Facebook friend. Prasad noticed Jamal an estimated 20m away, was being beaten with fists by a few, more than two Malays. He recognised they were Malays from the language they used and that they were wearing jackets. He was high on alcohol but could recall a few Malay men turning around, pushing and beating him as he tried to intervene on Jamal’s behalf. He was beaten with fists and he was cut on the mouth, hand and shoulder.

73     During his intervention, Prasad could only recall pushing someone. He could not recall how long the incident between him and Jamal took place nor who had beaten him but the incident did take place near the grass patch. Prasad was referred to his medical report where the injuries he sustained were recorded and he agreed that he was given hospitalisation leave from 11June to 26 June 2016. He did nothing to provoke the attack or cause any trouble nor did his friends and he does not know the accused.

#### Mariyamma Nalaini D/O Sithambaranathan (Mariyamma), PW5

74     Mariyamma is Prasad’s girlfriend. She testified that she, Prasad and two other friends went Club Rupee, next to Postbar at 11pm on 10 June 2016 for drinks. Sometime after midnight and before 6 am on 11 June 2016, Mariyamma and Prasad left Club Rupee for a smoking break with their friends. She and Prasad walked towards Postbar when they saw a riot going on. They were about 5 to 6 metres away.

75     At this time, Prasad saw and heard his friend, one Jamal, screaming. Prasad ran towards Jamal. As it was dark, Mariyamma’s visibility was impaired though she did hear a few girls crying and saying that there was a fight. At the scene, she observed that there were 4 to 5 Malay males and a lot of Indians. She ran after Prasad who was heading towards a Malay male. She saw two Malay males at the scene who were shouting their gang name ‘Tanjong Rhu’ with the Indian males telling them to stop. Her focus went on Prasad who had been pushed by a Malay male described as tall but she could not identify him. The Malay male had pushed Prasad and was stabbing him with a short pocket knife three times. She started screaming at the male Malay who threatened to stab her. The Malay male then backed off and escaped once the police reached the scene.

76     During the incident, Mariyamma could not recall anyone else being attacked except another male Indian who had been clutching his bleeding stomach near the red brick building. Mariyamma said that Prasad only tried to intervene by holding onto the Malay male before being stabbed. The groups were fist-fighting without weapons during the shouting argument about the gang names. She could not identify the accused. Mariyamma said that the situation was messy and she saw male Malays and male Indians shouting at each other.

#### Muhd Danial bin Mohd Siraj(Danial), PW14

77     Danial pleaded guilty to a charge of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code arising from the incident of the 11 June 2016 at Postbar. He was sentenced to serve a stint in the RTC which he is currently serving. Danial was shown P40. He identified himself and next Darwin who he described as a relatively close friend whom he first met in 2013 and played soccer with. He said that Zulfikar is his neighbour as they live in the same block. Zulfiqar was introduced to him by Darwin a few months prior to the incident on 11 June 2016. Next was Muhaimim whom he was not too close with but played soccer with him at Pasir Ris since 2014. Unlike Darwin and Zulfiqar with whom Danial hangs out at the coffee shop at his block, he was not that close to Muhaimin as they only played soccer together.

78     In identifying Zulhilmy, the accused, Danial mentioned that he was as close to the accused as he is with Muhaimin. He got to know the accused in 2015 in Pasir Ris when they played sepak takraw. They seldom meet but when they did they would have lunch or dinner. Muhaimim would sometime be present as he and the accused were friends.

79     On the evening of 10 June 2016, Danial, after having dinner with Muhaimin and the accused at the coffee shop opposite his home suggested to them to go to a club and party. They agreed and reached Club Rumours around midnight. He came across Darwin and Zulfiqar at the entrance of the club. It was unexpected. He was not aware of any prior arrangement by Muhaimim and the accused to meet up with Darwin and Zulfiqar. Thereafter, he bought a bottle of liquor which allowed all 5 of them to go into the club without paying the entrance fee. While he was high during that night and might not be able to recollect clearly what happened to him, everything was normal.

80     Sometime after midnight, Danial’s national servce friend, one Nick, invited him into the Rupee Room for drinks. He noticed that the accused was not present but he did recall the accused saying that he was going to leave Club Rumours. After half an hour in the Rupee room, Danial left to smoke outside Club Rumours at the brick wall where there were several people around him and he noticed a female smoking close to him. As he was smoking, he noticed a large group comprising 25 male and female Indians talking beside him. He was not sure what they were talking about. He then saw Zulfiqar had fallen down near the front of the staircase at D6. He was standing about 5-6 metres away from Zulfiqar and the group and surmised that he must have been hit because he had fallen down. At this juncture, Danial did not see any of the other three members of his group.

81     Danial approached the Indian male who stood in front of Zulfiqar as he assumed that he had hit Zulfiqar and asked him why he had hit Zulfiqar. The Indian male responded by pushing Danial. He retaliated by throwing a few punches towards the Indian male but he cannot remember exactly where as he was drunk. He was unable to recall if Darwin, Muhaimin or the accused were present. After the punches, he tried to help Zulfiqar who was struggling to his feet and the Indian group kept hitting him while other unknown persons helped him and Zulfiqar. He and Zulfiqar walked away and while doing so, he spotted Darwin and Muhaimin standing at the dustbin, doing nothing. The accused was nowhere to be seen.

82     While Danial had previously thought that his friends were the ones assisting him in the attack, upon further recollection, he realised that it was other people who helped him in the fight. After he saw Muhaimin and Darwin, all 4 of them left St James and crossed over to Vivocity where he saw the accused at the taxi stand. Throughout the whole incident outside Club Rumours he did not see the accused. The prosecution then applied to treat Danial as hostile and to cross-examine him because the account given by him in court was materially different from the statements he gave to the police.

83     The prosecution tendered 3 statements made by Danial to the police on the 12 June, 2016, 13 June 2016 and 19 April 2017. Danial agreed that he had made the 3 statements voluntarily and they were admitted as P42, P44 and P45. He was questioned on the inconsistencies between his statements and his testimony. In his statements Danial conceded that all 5 of them, including the accused were present during the fight. In particular, in his second statement P44, Danial admitted that the accused was fighting by punching the Indians. In his last statement, P45, again Danial stated all 5 of them were present, including the accused and fighting with the Indians. Danial disagreed and said that none of them were present during the fight. Danial also disagreed that all statements made by him to the police were consistent and true but agreed that they were given willingly without coercion.

84     When cross-examined by the defence, Danial said that the accused was at the club for a short while, about 10 minutes, before leaving to meet someone. He agreed that the account he gave to the court was the truth and that the police statements he made were inconsistent. The attack only involved himself and Zulfiqar and the rest were not a part of it.

#### Inspector Bryan Sng Guang Ming (Insp Sng), PW16

85     Insp Sng recorded a statement from Danial, P42, on 12 June 2016 at Police Cantonment Complex lock up room. He described the recording process which was a question and answer format and a total of 18 questions were posed and answered. Whatever was said by Danial was recorded. He read the statement himself once it was done. Danial did not want to make any amendment to the statement although he was invited to do so. He signed the statement willingly. Insp Sng testified that he did not coerce Danial in any way nor did he leave anything out. The statement was voluntarily given by Danial.

86     There was nothing unusual about Danial’s behaviour during the statement recording. There was a pause in the recording when he went for a medical examination. Insp Sng asked for the doctor to come before the recording but the doctor only came during the recording and the recording had to be paused. After the medical examination, there was no complaint from Danial and the recording continued. Insp Sng did not observe any sign of hangover, anxiety or stress from Danial who was able to answer all the questions posed to him. He went on to explain that if Danial was displaying such signs, the recording would have to cease and be done when Danial was feeling better but he saw no reason to activate that protocol. There was a further statement comprising a singular question recorded at a later time but on the same date when Danial was asked how much alcohol he consumed during the incident. Danial had no issues answering this question.

87     Insp Sng also recorded P44 from Danial on 13 June 2016. Similar to the P42, there were no issues with the process of the recording and Danial did not make any complaint before, during or after the statement was recorded.

88     In cross-examination, Insp Sng said that Danial was the first to be arrested and to be interviewed. He did not look drunk when the statement was recorded from him. He agreed that Danial did consume a fair amount of alcohol on the night of the incident. There was no pre-medical check-up done on Danial as the latter had not complained of any injuries and looked fine.

#### Senior Staff Sergeant Neo Kai Loon Alvin (SSSgt Neo), PW2: Further evidence

89     SSSgt Neo was recalled to the stand for the purpose of explaining the statement, P45 which he recorded from Danial on 19 April 2017 at the Tanah Merah prison. By then Danial had been convicted for rioting and was in prison. Only the 2 of them were present during the recording. Danial did not raise anything and appeared to be fine. Before he recorded P45, SSSgt Neo showed to Danial his previous statements, P42 and P44, and he read them to Danial who did not say anything. He recorded P45 in a question and answer format in that he asked nine questions and Danial responded with nine answers. The statement was read back to Danial in English and a few amendments were made and Danial signed on these amendments. Danial understood what was read back to him and he signed the statement.

90     SSSgt Neo said that he accurately recorded the statement and that he did not leave anything out. He did not do anything to coerce Danial into making the statement and Danial was fine throughout the statement-taking. Danial had no complaints and did not mention anything about all three statements to suggest that they were untrue and wrong. Danial did not tell him that his previous 2 statements, P42 and P44, were inaccurate in any way. He asked Danial if there was anything to add to which Danial replied in the negative.

#### Dr Raymond Lim (Dr Lim), PW17

91     Dr Lim, a doctor with the Healthway Medical Group, according to the medical report, P43, examined Danial on 12 June 2016 at 1120 pm at Central Police station. The police officers asked him to see Danial and requested him to check him for injuries. During the examination, Dr Lim ascertained that there was no significant past medical history to note. Danial did not complain about anything and did not raise any issue. He was alert and comfortable with the full GCS of 15 which meant that he was comfortable, alert and responsive. He had recorded it as it was standard procedure.

92     Based on his notes, Danial did not say that he had a hangover and he did not show nor mentioned any such symptoms. He did not display any signs of misunderstanding or discomfort. Danial did not display any signs of intoxication and was fine. He did not have alcoholic breath.

## The Defence

93     The accused testified that he was having dinner with Muhaimin and Danial at around 11 pm on 10 June 2016 in Tampines. They decided to go to Club Rumours and took a taxi there. They arrived at around 1 plus on 11 June 2016. About 15 to 20 minutes later, Darwin and Zulfiqar arrived in another taxi. In total, there were 5 of them, as shown in P40, at the club that night. The accused was wearing a long sleeved red top and black pants together with a black Adidas cap and Zulfiqar also wore a cap.

94     Upon reaching the club, the other 4, namely Muhaimin, Danial, Darwin and Zulfiqar negotiated the price of the bottle of liquor, paid for the bottle and all 5 entered the club. The time was about 1 plus and there were not many people present. Although music was being played by a DJ, the accused could still hear people talking. Club Rumours was a predominantly Indian club but Malays do go to the club. There were other groups of Malays present. The accused and his group sat near the bar.

95     About ten to fifteen minutes later, the accused left the club to go to Telok Blangah to meet a girl name Ayu. Before he left he spoke to Muhaimin and told him that they will leave St James together once Muhaimin was ready to leave as they planned to share the cab fare. He met Ayu and stayed with her till 4 am. He then took a taxi back to St James. On the way back to St James, he tried to call Muhaimin but to no avail. He alighted from the taxi and eventually returned to Club Rumours. Upon entering the club, he noticed that the liquor had all been consumed and his 4 friends were still inside the club. They accompanied the accused outside the club for a smoke. The time was between 4 to 4 30am. He was the last of the group to exit from the club. They went to smoke at the staircase.

96     While they were smoking and talking to each other, the accused saw that there was an argument outside the entrance of Club Rumours. The argument came from a group of Indians and he knew they were Indians because they were talking in Tamil. At that time, he was about 7 metres away from his friends talking on his mobile phone. The area outside Club Rumours was very crowded during this time. Suddenly he noticed people were shouting, it became louder and there was a commotion. He saw that there were a group of people fighting. He stayed in the area where he was when the commotion was going on as he tried to look for Muhaimin.

97     From where the accused was, he saw 3 bouncers running out from club Gossip and heading towards Club Rumours. He assumed that they were running towards the commotion. He saw them at the pavement in front of the Asahi signage. He knew they were bouncers as he recognised one of them had allowed him to enter Club Rumours when he first came and the other by his ID tag. He thought that the bouncers came to stop the fight but he was not certain as he only saw them pushing people aside. The accused was not aware as to the whereabouts of his 4 other friends except that Danial remained at his spot.

98     The incident happened very quickly and before he knew it, he saw his 4 friends walking along the shelter walkway in D3 towards the main road area. At this juncture, the accused was at the left hand side of D3 near the barrier area. By the time he met with the group, it was after the barrier and behind the wall in D3. He noticed the four talking in raised voices and that all were angry. They walked to Vivocity where he and Muhaimin shared a cab back to Pasir Ris.

99     In cross-examination, the accused testified that he had been friends with Muhaimin for about 9 years. They started clubbing monthly from the age of 20. During their clubbing sessions, Muhaimin would drink but the accused did not as he does not like to consume alcohol. The accused agreed that he would look out for Muhaimin’s well-being during their clubbing sessions and that he shares a very close relationship with Muhaimin. Both of them were friendly with Danial. Zulfiqar was introduced to him by Danial in early 2016. He only met Darwin for the first time on the date of the incident. He disagreed with Danial’s statements that all 5 of them knew each other through soccer.

100    The accused said the 11 June 2016 was the second time he was at Club Rumours. They had met Zulfiqar and Darwin unexpectedly at the club. Fifteen minutes after entering the club, he left to see Ayu. When he returned later at about 4 am and after failing to contact Muhaimin, the accused entered Club Rumours again where all 4 were still present and both Darwin and Danial looked drunk to him.

101    When shown a video that showed the entrance of Club Rumours at 4:17am, the accused identified Muhaimin, Zulfiqar, Darwin and himself along with another person who was not Danial but Visnu, PW4. The accused was not sure whether Danial was at the brick wall as shown in D4. He disagreed that Muhaimin, Zulfiqar Darwin and himself were escorting Visnu out of the club. Before he separated from his friends, they spoke for a while and he went to the left for his phone call and Muhaimin went to the right with Darwin and Zulfiqar. The commotion started and he lost sight of his friends even though he was 6 to 7 metres away from them. He did not move forward to the commotion. The accused saw Nicholas and Kareem pushing people aside and stopping the fight along the road at D4.

102    The accused saw the video which showed Jamal’s attack and he saw Nicholas punching Jamal and his friends Muhaimin and Zulfiqar were in the video. He agreed that the bloodstains sustained by Jamal happened after Muhaimin and Zulfiqar had approached Jamal. While he agreed that Muhaimin and Zulfiqar had assaulted Jamal, based on the video, he did not know whether they were among those in the commotion fighting.

## The Decision

103    The accused has claimed trial to 1 charge of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code. The charge states that on the 11 June 2016, at the Postbar (also known as Club Rumours) located at Sentosa Gateway, at or about 4.16 am, the accused together with 4 others, namely Danial, PW14, Zulfiqar, Muhaimin and Darwin, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt and hurt was caused to the 4 victims, namely Jamal, PW12, Visnu, PW4, Divagaran, PW11 and Prasad, PW6.

104    I shall begin with the undisputed facts as disclosed in the Agreed Statement of Facts, exhibit A, and from the evidence of the various witnesses, which has not been seriously challenged by the defence. Firstly, it was undisputed that the accused together with the 4 others named in the charge went to Postbar on 10 June 2016 after 11 pm. Secondly, it is undisputed that a fight did occur between 4.15 am and 4.30 am outside the club and as a result of this fight, the 4 victims were assaulted, in the manner which they described and as witnessed by some prosecution witnesses, and the 4 victims sustained injuries, as indicated in their respective medical reports. Visnu, Divagaran and Prasad were stabbed. As for Jamal, while he was struck on the head by a glass bottle, the examining doctor, one Dr Chok maintained that a sharp object was used to attack Jamal as his injuries could not have been caused by blunt force. Thirdly, the accused’s co-accused persons, named in the charge, namely Danial, Zulfiqar, Muhaimin and Darwin Singh have been dealt with for having participated in the fight as they have pleaded guilty to their respective charges. Danial and Zulfiqar pleaded guilty to section 147 of the Penal Code while Muhaimin and Darwin to section 148 of the Penal Code.

105    The only issue to be determined is whether the accused was a member of that unlawful assembly consisting of Danial, Darwin, Zulfiqar and Muhaimin whose common object was to cause hurt to the 4 victims and that one or more of the members of this unlawful assembly did use violence. The accused denied that he was but conceded that he was present at the material time and date outside the club.

106    In terms of the sequence of events, in gist, the accused and the 4 others were at PostBar first around midnight, the accused left and returned to the club around 4 am. The CCTV footage from 4.21 a.m. to 4.22 a.m. from one of the security cameras captured an incident outside the entrance of Postbar.. It showed Jamal, one of the victims, was punched by Nicholas, PW15. Then Muhaimin and Zulfiqar moved quickly towards a corner of the club entrance where Jamal had fled to after the punch. Thereafter, Jamal emerges from the corner, and is seen bleeding profusely. Shakila, PW7, and Khatijjah, PW8, can be seen helping him away.

107    Subsequently, CCTV footage showed Muhaimin, Zulfiqar, Darwin and Danial walking out of the St James compound towards the main road _via_ a sheltered walkway[^1]. Nicholas follows behind them. None of the CCTV footage captured the Accused, except another footage at 4:17:04 a.m., where he is seen wearing a maroon long- sleeved shirt and a black cap, and is seen leaving the entrance of Postbar together with some of the co-accused persons. In terms of when the 4 victims were attacked, it would appear that it started off with Visnu, then Divagaran, Jamal and Prasad.

108    The prosecution’s case against the accused rest primarily on Danial and in particular his 3 statements, P42, P44 and P45. In these 3 statements Danial has unequivocally implicated the accused and stated that the accused did fight with the Indian group. Danial does not dispute that he gave the 3 statements voluntarily and that there was no coercion. However, in court, he repudiated his statements and claimed that the accused was never involved. He even went so far as to say that he was unable to recall if the accused and for that matter Darwin and Muhaimin, were even present[^2] during the fight. While he thought that his friends were assisting him in the fight, upon further recollection, he realised that he had been assisted by other people. Unsurprisingly the prosecution sought to cross-examine him and eventually applied for his 3 statements to substitute his testimony in court.

109    I now turn to his first statement, P42, recorded on the 12 of June, 2016 at 10.34 pm. This was just 1 day after the incident of 11 June, 2016 in the early hours of 4 am and can be described as practically contemporaneous. In P42, which was recorded by Insp Sng, PW16, who asked Danial what he had to say about the fight, Danial had replied that “ _My other friends Muhaimin, Zulhelmie and Darwin Singh were also there but the Indians never beat them_ “[^3] and this was followed with “_Then we all started fighting with the Indian guys…_ “[^4] and he added that “_When we were fighting, we were all blur and don’t know what’s going. We just fight only_.”[^5]. The very next day, on 13 June 2016, Insp Sng recorded another statement, P44, where the questions were even more specific to the accused and Danial was asked:

_Q1:_ _Tell the police what is ‘Zulhimie’ role in the fight._

_A1:_ _He was fighting the Indians as all of us were fighting…_

_Q2:_ _How was ‘Zulhimie’ fighting with the Indians?_

_A2:_ _He was fist fighting. He was whacking and punching the Indian people._

_Q6:_ _So are you saying that all 5 of you guys threw punches at the Indians?_

_A6:_ _Ys. They were doing the same to us also._

Clearly Danial’s replies were just as specific and he gave clear details as to what the accused was doing during the fight and that he was simply attacking the Indian victims.

110    There can be no doubt that when Danial agreed that all 5 of them threw punches at the Indians, the accused was in that group of 5. If the accused was in the group of 5 fighting with the Indians by punching them, he cannot deny the fact that he had committed the offence of rioting. I find that when P42 and P44 were recorded, the events of 11 June 2016 must have still been very fresh and clear in Danial’s mind, they could have hardly faded from his memory and it is extremely unlikely that he could have been mistaken as to the accused’s involvement. Repudiating these statements now appeared to be nothing more than an attempt to shield the accused from liability.

111    When pressed for an explanation for the material inconsistencies in P42 and P44, and his testimony, Danial was not able to offer a convincing explanation and tried to say that he was suffering from a hangover as he had consumed alcohol. This seems to suggest that he could not have been in the best or even right frame of mind and was not himself when these 2 statements were recorded. However, Insp Sng, PW16, the recording officer said that there was nothing unusual about Danial’s behaviour, that he did not display any signs of hangover, anxiety, stress and did not look drunk[^6]. In any event, the examining doctor, Dr Lim, PW17, an independent and objective witness, who saw him on the said date said that Danial was alert, comfortable, responsive[^7] and did not have any alcoholic breath. These are not the traits of someone who was nursing a hangover. Dr Lim corroborated Insp Sng’s evidence and he had also revealed that Danial did not raise anything of significance to him.

112    As for his last statement which was recorded almost a year later on 19 April 2017, P45, Danial maintained the same account as per his previous 2 statements and that was the fact that not only was the accused present, he was also fighting. By this time Danial had already pleaded guilty to 1 charge of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code on 25 January 2017 and was serving his sentence of serving a stint in the RTC. Here was an opportune time for him to say that what he said in P42 and P44 was wrong and that the accused and the other co-accused persons were not involved but he did not. Danial had even conceded that there was no reason for to falsely implicate his friends as he was serving his sentence[^8].

113    The period of almost a year was more than sufficient for him to reflect over what he had said in P42 and P44. SSSgt Neo, PW2, the recording officer of P45, had testified, that before he recorded P45 from Danial he had read to him P42 and P44 and Danial did not say anything. There were no complaints from Danial, he was fine and he did not say that his previous 2 statements were untrue. In fact, Danial had responded by saying to SSSgt Neo “_I said whatever I said previously was the same[^9]_….”.

114    Danial has not offered any credible explanation as to why he chose not to raise anything about P42 and P44 when P45 was recorded. He has also failed to explain the inconsistencies between P45 and his testimony in court. The irresistible inference I can make, it bears reiterating, is that Danial was just trying to exculpate the accused. When questioned as to why he did not ask SSSgt Neo to amend the underlined portions of P45, Danial claimed that he thought there was nothing wrong and that he was just saying that he and his friends were just defending themselves and they would not be going to court[^10]. This is difficult to accept and believe since by the time P45 was recorded on the 19 April 2017, he had already been sentenced as well as Darwin and Zulfiqar for the rioting offence as a result of the incident. It would not have escaped Danial’s attention when he pleaded guilty to the charge of rioting that all his 4 other friends were also mentioned in his charge and it was therefore bizarre of him to even suggest that they would not be facing charges.

115    Under these circumstances, on the whole, since I find that Danial had failed to provide any satisfactory explanation on the material contradictions between his testimony in court and his 3 statements P42, P44 and P45 given voluntarily I should emphasise, I impeached his credit. I allowed the prosecution’s application that Danial’s testimony be substituted with his 3 statements, P42, P44 and P45.

116    Having decided on the admissibility of the 3 statements, I was mindful of the fact that the next issue for me to consider would be the weight to be attached to the statements. In considering this issue I was guided by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP_ \[1998\] 3 SLR 619 where the factors which the court must consider in the exercise of according the weight to be attached to previous inconsistent statements which has been admitted into evidence were elaborated. First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important, since it guards against inaccuracy. Second, there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement, but the court must be astute in spotting such instances. Third, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an accurate representation of the facts. Regard should also be had to the context of the statement, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon should be noted.

117    Applying the above factors to the facts of this case, I decided that due, full and sufficient weight can be attached to the statements such that these statements can support a conviction against the accused. As I have mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, P42 and P44, were recorded on 12 and 13 June, 2016 respectively and the requirements of contemporaneity is fulfilled. The possibility of any mistake in recollection has been addressed. Danial’s testimony in court almost 2 years later is not a case of him having a faulty memory. It is more a case, as pointed out by the prosecution, of him choosing not to tell the truth, to protect the accused. There was no motive for him to lie when he gave the statements as he was exposing himself to the possibility of being charged. In his statements, he implicated all his 4 friends. He was able to appreciate their particular involvement and how they specifically fought. The account which he gave in his statements were accurate and true as to what each and every one of his friends were doing during the rioting. The substance of Danial’s evidence therefore, based on his 3 statements is the fact that the accused was an active participant in the fight on 11 June 2016 and he had assaulted the victims by punching them.

118    When his explanation was sought again as to why he said that the accused was involved in his statement, Danial said it was an assumption on his part, as others had helped him and he assumed that they were therefore his friends. This defy logic because there was no reason why total strangers would want to come to his assistance. In fact, based on the evidence of Khatijjah, PW8, more than 5 Malay males were beating a fat Indian male, who it was undisputed was Visnu, and Danial who was then smoking next to her went to join them in the beating declaring that the attackers were his friends[^11] and assaulted Visnu. His friends would have been those he went to Club Rumours with and it was not challenged by the defence that the accused was one of these friends.

119    Visnu had testified that the group from the club comprising the Malay males had escorted him out after one of them bumped into him and he was pushed on the face by Zulfiqar. This group of 4 to 6 persons had surrounded him and walked him out of the club. They proceeded to attack him and he could identify Zulfiqar as part of the group. This was the group which was inside Club Rumours and Danial and the accused were in this group. The accused had in fact testified that he left the club with members of his group to go for a smoke. While it was true that Khatijjah could not identify the accused as being in the group, and could only point to Darwin and Danial as being involved, the fact remained that together with Zulfiqar and Muhaimin, the accused was in this group of Malay males which was the only Malay group in the club on that particular date. This was the most pertinent observation of a number of prosecution witnesses which I will touch on in the subsequent paragraphs.

120    This would be the testimony from 4 other prosecution witnesses which linked the accused to the fight and which unmistakably proved that the accused was in the group of attackers in the early hours of 11 June, 2016. The first would be Visnu who is the first victim. He had testified that he had noticed a skinny Indian man being attacked by the same group of Malays[^12] who had escorted him out from Club Rumours. The accused was a member of the group of Malays who had escorted Visnu out from the club and that being the case, he would have been one of the attackers of the skinny Indian man.

121    The second would be Velanraj, PW9. He together with Visnu were in Club Rumours, and had seen a group of Malay males inside the club. When Velanjraj went outside the club to look for Visnu, who had gone more than 20 minutes to have a smoke, he witnessed a commotion in that there were people fighting, shouting and running about. He observed that Malay males were beating Indian males. What is more significant is his testimony that the Malay males in the club prior to the incident were part of the Malay males who were beating the Indian males[^13]. The accused was a member of that Malay group in the club and admitted that he left with his 4 friends after 4 am to have a smoke outside the club.

122    Next would be Divagaran, PW11. He had testified that Postbar was an Indian club and he found it unusual after he entered the club that there was a Malay group comprising males only. He noticed them and said “_that’s what struck me_.”[^14] Subsequently, when he left the club to smoke there was shouting, between 2 groups, one was an Indian group and one was the Malay group. This Malay group, according to Divagaran, was the same group which was in the club[^15] but he did not know what they were shouting about. Since he was about 5 to 10 metres away from the groups, Divagaran could not have been mistaken as to the identity, in particular of the Malay group. The accused was a member of the only Malay group in Postbar at the material date and time and if that group was involved in the incident with the Indian group, it would follow automatically that the accused was also involved.

123    I turn now to Nicholas’s evidence. Nicholas, PW15, was an employee of Club Rumours on the 11 June 2016 and was in the thick of things when the commotion happened outside the club. When told by some bouncers that there was a fight happening at the carpark, while he was outside Club Rupee smoking, Nicholas rushed down and saw a big fight happening where people were screaming and shouting. He observed that the 5 Malay males whom he had allowed to enter the club fighting some 5 or 6 Indian males. These 5 Malay males whom he had allowed to enter the club earlier between midnight and 1 am consisted of the accused[^16] and the 4 other co-accused persons. This was not a point in contention. Nicholas was very sure that the accused and his 4 co-accused friends were fighting as he stopped the fight by pushing them apart and told them to leave the place. There can be no doubt that there was more than sufficient time for him to be able to tell that the accused was part of the group that was fighting with the Indian group. He saw them punching and kicking the male Indians.

124    Therefore, since Nicholas was the person who had interacted with the accused and his 4 co-accused persons when they first came to the club, and he knew Danial and Muhaimin as being rather regular customers of the club it can hardly be said that he was wrong when he was able to identify all 5 as having participated in the fight. His interaction with them was far from brief or fleeting because after dealing with the issue of them buying a bottle of liquor to enable them to enter the club, he brought them into the club to pass instructions to the waiter. As the club was only a quarter filled when the 5 of them arrived there was no crowd which could have distracted him from dealing with them or having his attention diverted. The fact that there was no crowd appeared to be conceded by the accused as he testified that “_… there was not many people… It was not loud. It was quite quiet…”[^17]_ Other than the accused and his 4 other co-accused persons who entered the club that night, no other Malay group was present.

125    While Nicholas had maintained that he escorted all 5 out of the club, the video did not appear to capture the accused leaving the club. This, in my view, did not mean that the accused did not participate in the earlier fight. By the time the party of 5 left the club, the fighting had ended. In any event, even the accused did not dispute that he left the club and he was behind the rest of them whom he could see walking along the sheltered walkway towards the road. When they finally met up they walked to Vivocity to take a taxi home, which he did with Muhaimin.

126    Despite a rather protracted and intensive cross-examination, Nicholas did not waver from his account that the accused was present and was very much involved in fighting with the male Indians. While he was not absolutely clear as to what each individual was specifically doing, Nicholas was positive that all 5 as shown in P40 and this would obviously include the accused, were present during the fight. Considering the fact that it was very crowded during the fight and the situation was chaotic[^18], a point made by more than 1 witness, and there was shouting, screaming and girls crying, with his main focus in trying just to separate the groups, it was understandable that Nicholas was not able to be more specific as to what each and every one of the 5 were doing, except to be able to say with certainty that the accused was there and he was fighting. And as to how the accused was fighting was revealed without a doubt by Danial who had described him as “_fistfighting, whacking and punching the Indian people.”[^19]_

127    I now turn to the accused’s defence. In essence, the accused said that after he and his friends came out from Postbar to have a smoke, and while talking to his friends, he observed an argument at the entrance of the club. While his friends were still in the vicinity, he was at a distance away from them, about 6 to 7 metres and using his mobile phone[^20]. He continued using his mobile phone while his 4 friends moved towards the commotion. He saw a group of bouncers coming from Gossip Club and running past towards Postbar and trying to stop the fight. Then he saw the co-accused persons walking towards the main road and he walked with them but a distance away. He observed that they were angry, used vulgarities but he did not hear what they were talking about. He did not ask them what had happened[^21]. He took a taxi and went home with Muhaimin. He did not see the co-accused persons fight and he was not involved in the fight.

128    I find the accused’s rather indifferent attitude towards his 4 friends rather baffling, especially when it came to Muhaimin. He claimed to be a close friend of Muhaimin for 9 years and they would look out for each other’s safety[^22] and he was on friendly terms with Danial and Zulfiqar[^23]. Further it was revealed by Danial in his statement[^24] that all 5 of them knew each other through soccer for about 3 years. While both Danial and the accused said otherwise during the trial, Danial could not explain the discrepancy and as for the accused, he was just trying to downplay his relationship with the 4 accused persons. Given this background, and after witnessing the commotion and his 4 friends being angry to the extent that they mouthed vulgarities, the accused did not bother to ascertain from them what had happened. His utter lack of curiosity after what had happened was absurd.

129    I agree with the prosecution that it was incredible that the accused just remained on his mobile phone amidst the chaos that was going on, with the shouting and screaming at the scene, going by the evidence of practically all the witnesses and did not look for Muhaimin and the rest. Further, the fact that he did not ask his friends what had happened contrasts sharply with his curiosity when he claimed that he asked Kareem and Nicholas what happened[^25] when they ran past him along the walkway. However, when questioned as to why he had asked the bouncers, the accused gave a rather ridiculous reason when he explained “_I’m not concerned, but it was just--- I just asked for the sake of asking_.”[^26]

130    I note that when the accused was asked to explain why his friends were standing 6 to 7 metres away when they were supposed to be smoking together, outside the club, his explanation was hard to follow about him turning left and Muhaimin turning right. It did not make sense that the accused and his friends would be standing a distance away to smoke. This was, I find, nothing more than a rather weak attempt by the accused to distance himself from the 4 co-accused persons. And, while the accused maintained that he was able to see Kareem and Nicholas trying to stop the fight, he said that the 4 co-accused persons were just walking away from the scene and he followed them.[^27] I find it difficult to believe this, that he noticed them in the chaos when moments before he lost sight of them. This, according to the accused, was when he heard a commotion while standing and that the commotion happened after he turned left and Muhaimin turned right[^28].

131    On the accused’s claim that Danial was with him when they went out to smoke, this has been contradicted by Danial himself, who said that he was smoking outside the club at the brick wall. His evidence was corroborated by Khatijjah who knows Danial, smoked with him and she tried to prevent him unsuccessfully from joining in the attack on Visnu. This is also buttressed by the CCTV footage outside the club entrance which did not show Danial anywhere but instead it showed Visnu being surrounded by the 4 accused persons, including the accused. This was obviously an attempt by the accused to ignore the presence of Visnu who was clearly walking with him and the 3 others out from the club and to distance himself from any association with the assault on Visnu, who was the first of the 4 victims hurt in the rioting incident.

132    When the accused was questioned further as to why Danial had implicated him as being involved in the fighting in his statements, his response was most telling as he replied that “_it’s impossible that he saw me involved in the fight because_ **_he himself was concentrating in the fight. Because it was very chaotic_**_. And he was concentrating in the fight. It’s impossible for him to see his left and right side…because when he was hitting someone when he was concentration_ (sic) _in hitting someone, it’s impossible for him to recognise who was with him.”[^29]_ (emphasis added). If he was not present and was not involved in the rioting, it would have been more reasonable for him to react and say that he did not know why Danial would say such a thing as he was not there.

133    The irresistible inference is that the accused was fully aware that Danial was fighting and hence concentrating in the fight. And, the only way the accused could have known what Danial was doing was because he was present and in the middle of the fight. Further, and that being the case, he could not have seen Danial at the spot he mentioned in D4. In the final analysis, I had no hesitation in rejecting the defence of the accused.

## Conclusion

134    In summary, I was of the view that the testimonies of the crucial prosecution witnesses were credible and consistent and proved that the accused was involved with the 4 other co-accused persons during the rioting. Following the bumping incident with Visnu, from their actions clearly a common object was formed to attack the Indian males around them who had intervened after they assaulted Visnu. I agree with the prosecution’s submission that even if there were discrepancies in their respective accounts, the following caution given by the High Court in _Osman bin Ramli_ \[2002\] SGHC 203, at \[36\] when it comes to assessing discrepancies given by different witnesses during a short period of time “_Given the chaotic situation at the time, it would not be unusual for witnesses to come up with different accounts of the same event”_ must be borne in mind. The same consideration must apply in this case as the scene of the rioting was chaotic, according to the witnesses.

135    I find that the material witnesses were candid and forthright in their respective accounts and testimonies and did their level best to truthfully recall what they had observed during the rioting. On the substantial aspect they remained consistent that all 5 accused persons, which without a doubt included the accused, participated in the rioting.

136    Further, I have given full weight to Danial’s 3 statements, P42, P44 and P45, which undoubtedly showed the participation of the accused and the 4 other co-accused persons and their common object to cause hurt to the victims and hurt was caused to achieve that common object, having found his explanations unconvincing. Therefore, I find that the prosecution has proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I find him guilty and convict him on the charge of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code.

137    Upon his conviction, the prosecution informed me that the accused is untraced. In their address on sentence, the prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents for section 147 offences which showed a range of sentences of between 15 months imprisonment up to 36 months imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. They submitted for a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment and 3 to 4 strokes of the cane. They highlighted the aggravating factors which included the fact there was a high degree of harm as 4 victims were seriously injured. Further, while the accused’s culpability was moderate, weapons had been used in the attack. In mitigation, counsel for the accused (who came on board after the trial proper) submitted that the accused should be considered for probation as he was only 23 years of age at the time of the offence and had the capability to reform. He described the accused’s role as minimal in the rioting and that the accused had moved away from his negative peers.

138    The punishment for the offence of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code is imprisonment up to 7 years and the offender is also liable to caning. In this case, I was not prepared to consider calling for a pre-sentence report to determine whether the accused would be suitable to be placed under probation. The submission by his counsel was not persuasive. The accused was not below 21 years of age at the time of the offence, being 23 years old and he is therefore an adult offender.

139    While I am aware that, that is not a barrier in itself, I agree with the prosecution that deterrence should be the dominant sentencing consideration here and certainly not rehabilitation, unless he demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation (See _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ \[2019\] SGHC 31). Moreover, even if rehabilitation is found to apply, it can be displaced by the need for deterrence. Deterrence would become relatively more prominent, and rehabilitation correspondingly less so, if the offence is serious or the harm caused is severe, amongst other considerations _(_See _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ \[2018\] 4 SLR 1294). In this case, it can hardly be disputed that the offence was serious, the harm was severe and there were no exceptional circumstances to justify even considering probation as a sentencing option for this accused. All said and done, rioting requires a deterrent approach as it is a group offence, which generally results in greater harm and greater fear to the victims. It affects public safety or security, and the court must demonstrate that such offences will not be tolerated in the community.

140    It was not in dispute that 3 of his co-accused persons, namely Danial, Zulfiqar and Darwin were minors at the time of the offence, being below 21 years of age, unlike the accused and none of them were even considered for probation. Granted their roles were far egregious than the accused, and their culpability was far higher, and yet Danial and Zulfiqar were sent to the RTC while Darwin was sentenced to 1-year imprisonment with 1 stroke of the cane but his charge was under section 148 of the Penal Code. However, the crucial difference between this accused and the other 3 is the fact that all these 3 persons had pleaded guilty. The only other adult offender Muhaimin, being almost 24 years of age at the time of the offence was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with 4 strokes of the cane when he pleaded guilty to a section 148 charge for his involvement in the rioting. While it is the accused’s prerogative to claim trial, he is certainly not entitle to the usual discount afforded to persons who chose to do so as it demonstrates a lack of remorse. Maintaining parity in sentencing amongst co-offenders is a desirable objective and that being the case, I was of the view that the usual sentencing norm of imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence.

141    Turning to the facts of this case, I took into account the obvious aggravating factors as highlighted by the prosecution. Firstly, would be the undeniable fact that the 4 victims had suffered a high degree of harm and the injuries were mostly slash and stab wounds. Prasad, one of the 4 victims, also had a fracture and had prominent scars on his face and hands. Jamal had a degloving of his scalp. The other 2, Visnu and Divagaran were also stabbed and till today Visnu still feel some pain[^30], despite more than 2 years having elapsed from the day of the incident. Visnu said he was still traumatised by the incident and gets nightmares[^31]. The resulting impact on Visnu was demonstrated clearly in his own words when he said “…. _when I eat too much also,…. I feel like the scar is actually expanding and its also painful….I find that I don’t really deserve it…I don’t know why I am going through this too_.[^32]” He was, a rather innocent and unfortunate victim of the relentless and savage attack of the accused and his 4 other co-accused.

142    Secondly, would be the fact that members of the unlawful assembly of which the accused was a member of, had used weapons, more likely than not, knives. In fact, it was the unchallenged evidence of Kareem, the security supervisor, that Muhaimin showed a flip knife. Mariyamma saw Prasad being stabbed 3 times with a short pocket knife[^33]. Velanraj saw Muhaimin stabbed Divagaran twice with a knife. While it is conceded that the accused did not use any weapon, he was neither a passive participant as he had fought the male Indians by punching and kicking them. In a group offence like rioting there is strength in numbers and the accused’s conduct cannot be viewed totally in isolation.

143    The 4 victims in this case were total strangers to the accused, his 4 co-accused persons and to each other. This was not challenged by the defence. They had no history with the accused and the 4 co-accused persons. What started the attack appeared to have been an initial encounter when Visnu accidentally bump into one of the members of the accused’s group and was “_escorted_” out by them. This can hardly be described as provocative and yet the accused and his co-accused persons over reacted excessively by attacking him to the extent of stabbing him. They then went berserk[^34] in the words of Khatiijah and hit others resulting in the situation becoming chaotic. The other 3 victims, namely Divagran, Jamal and Prasad were innocent bystanders who had done absolutely nothing on that day to incur the wrath of the accused and his 4 co-accused.

144    At the time of the attack, which happened outside the club, it was closing time and there was a large crowd. The disquiet caused to the public, other innocent club goers could not have been minor. From the accounts of the witnesses, there appeared to have been utter chaos when there was shouting, screaming and crying by the girls. Kareem described it as a chaotic[^35] commotion involving 20 males, Malays and Indians. Nicholas saw that there was a big fight going on and there were people screaming and shouting[^36].

145    Returning to the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution, it would appear to be the case that the sentences for adult offenders for section 147 offences ranged between 15 months’ imprisonment up to 36 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. While I do accept that the accused’s sentence should be within this range, I was not inclined to impose caning considering that his 2 co-accused persons, namely Darwin was only imposed with 1 stroke of the cane and Muhaimin received 3 strokes of the cane. I find that their culpability was far higher than the current accused and in any event they had been dealt with under a far more serious section, namely section 148 of the Penal Code.

## The Sentence

146    I had considered the case of _PP v Robin Anak Mawang_ \[2006\] 1 SLR 373 where the offender there, who had claimed trial to a section 147 charge was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. However, in that case there was only 1 victim and the offender administered only 1 kick. Taking into account the fact that the current accused was far more active and the fact that there are 4 victims who sustained serious injuries, I was of the view that a more appropriate sentence would be a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment and accordingly this was the sentence imposed on the accused.

147    The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail, pending the hearing of his appeal.
