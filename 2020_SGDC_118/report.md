Criminal Law – Offences – Hurt – Offences Against Public Servants

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9154/2019/01.\]

11 May 2020

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

1       The accused, Adrian Fun Weng Khoon (“the Accused”), claimed trial to the following two charges:

> DAC 933893/2016 (“C1C”)

> You, … …, Male/45 years, … …, are charged that you, on the 4th day of September 2016, at about 5.52 a.m. at 16, Flora Drive, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Staff Sergeant Tan Yi Yi Jean of the Singapore Police Force, a public servant who was in the discharge of her duty as such public servant, to wit, by punching her in her face, with the knowledge that you were likely to thereby cause her hurt, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224).

> DAC 936157/2016 (“C2B”)

> You, … …, Male/45 years, … …, are charged that you, on the 4th day of September 2016, at about 5.53 a.m. at 16, Flora Drive, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Staff Sergeant Tan Yi Yi Jean of the Singapore Police Force, a public servant who was in the discharge of her duty as such public servant, to wit, by punching her in her face, with the knowledge that you were likely to thereby cause her hurt, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224).

2       The said Tan Yi Yi Jean (“the Victim”) was a police officer at the time of the incident. She was then holding the rank of a Staff Sergeant.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on both charges. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

4       I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment on each charge, after having heard and considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea. I ordered both sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Therefore, the total imprisonment term the Accused has to serve is three months.

5       The Accused was dissatisfied with his convictions on both charges. He has filed an appeal against conviction. The Accused has been released on bail pending appeal.

6       This Grounds of Decision will only cover the assessment of the evidence and findings of facts leading to the conviction. This Grounds of Decision will not cover sentencing because neither the Prosecution nor the Accused had filed an appeal against sentence.

## Brief Outline of the Case for the Prosecution

7       It was the Prosecution’s case that in the early hours of 4 September 2016, the Victim and her partner, Corporal Solhan Bin Sarib (as he then was) (“Cpl Solhan”), responded to a “999” call recorded as “_My passenger is drunk and cannot wake up_”.[^1] The Victim and Cpl Solhan arrived at 16 Flora Drive at about 5:48 a.m. They were both attired in their police uniforms. The Accused was lying asleep inside the back seat of a taxi. The Victim tried to rouse the Accused from his sleep by tapping his face with her hand and calling out to him. She managed to get the Accused into a sitting position. The Victim used her right hand to tap on the Accused’s face to wake him up even more. At about 5:52:26 a.m., whilst the Accused was sitting on the back seat of the taxi, the Victim continued to tap the Accused on his cheek. The Accused reacted by punching the Victim once on her nose and upper lip region with his right hand (“the 1st punch”). This incident was captured on the Body Worn Camera (“BWC”) of the Victim.

8       The Accused was then brought out of the taxi. The Victim, Cpl Solhan and the Accused were standing by the side of the taxi. The Victim held the Accused’s right arm whilst Cpl Solhan held the Accused’s left arm. When the Victim let go of the Accused’s right arm briefly, the Accused used his right hand to punch the Victim on her nose and upper lip region (“the 2nd punch”).

9       The Accused was then pinned down to the ground and handcuffed to his back. The Accused was also placed under arrest.

10     The Victim sustained some bleeding from her upper lip which she cleaned up.

11     The Victim was seen by a doctor at Changi General Hospital (“CGH”). The medical examination revealed a small abrasion over the upper lip and mild bruising over the left side of her nose.

## Brief Outline of the Case for the Defence

12     The Accused’s defence was that he was drunk and sleeping inside the taxi. At the incident location, the taxi driver and a security supervisor from the condominium were not able to wake him up. This prompted the taxi driver to call the police on its “999” hotline for assistance.

13     Counsel for the Accused alleged that the Victim and Cpl Solhan used a variety of unusual methods such as (i) tapping and slapping the Accused on his face; (ii) shouting repeatedly at him; and (iii) peeling back his eyelids and shining light into his eyes. It was under such circumstances that the Accused lashed out and threw the 1st punch at the Victim.

14     The Accused could not remember throwing the 2nd punch at the Victim. It was the Accused’s defence that, as a fact, there wasn’t a 2nd punch at all.

15     In respect of both punches, the Accused’s defence was that he was in such a drunken and exhausted state that he could not have known that he had caused hurt to the Victim. The _mens rea_ for both charges – that of possessing the requisite knowledge of causing hurt – was lacking in this case.

## Background Facts and Issues in Dispute

### Undisputed Facts

16     On the night of 3 September 2016, at about 10 p.m., the Accused received a call from a business friend who asked him out to discuss business matters. The Accused and his friend met sometime after 11 p.m. at a KTV lounge in Havelock Road. At the KTV lounge, the Accused consumed alcoholic drinks.

17     At one point, the Accused went to a corner to lie down. Subsequently, he felt someone bringing him to the lobby and onto a taxi. He was able to tell the taxi driver (hereinafter referred to as “DW3”) his destination, “_16 Flora Drive_”. He then fell asleep on the back seat of the taxi.

18     According to DW3, he picked up a fare around 4 plus in the morning of 4 September 2016 from the Holiday Inn Atrium. A lady helped the Accused to board his taxi. The Accused gave DW3 the block number and name of the condominium where he resided. But by the time of the trial, DW3 could not remember the details of the address that was given by the Accused. There was no dispute that DW3 had brought the Accused to the correct destination – Ferraria Park Condominium located at Flora Drive.[^2]

19     When DW3 arrived at the condominium where the Accused resided, he was permitted by the condominium’s security to drive the taxi into the condominium compound. When DW3 reached the condominium block given the Accused, he could not wake up the Accused up from his slumber. He tapped the Accused for around 5 minutes but the Accused continued to sleep. DW3 then drove the taxi, with the Accused still inside, back to the security counter in order to seek assistance. [^3]

20     At the security counter, DW3 was told to drive his taxi out of the condominium compound and to park the taxi by the side of Flora Drive (hereinafter referred to as the “_incident location_”).[^4]

21     After about 15 minutes, a security supervisor from the Accused’s condominium came to assist DW3. The security supervisor asked DW3 for the unit number of the Accused’s residence. DW3 could not provide the information because it was not given to him when the Accused boarded his taxi. According to DW3, the security supervisor tried to wake up the Accused for about 3 – 5 minutes. The security supervisor was also unsuccessful in his attempt to wake up the Accused. Both DW3 and the security supervisor could not establish the exact block and unit that the Accused was residing in. Feeling that he was left with no other choice, DW3 called the Police hotline “999” for assistance. [^5]

22     The Victim and Cpl Solhan attended to the incident, and the Victim was primarily involved in rousing the Accused. In the course of rousing the Accused, the Victim was punched at least once by the Accused. Cpl Solhan was not assaulted at any point in time.

### Exhibits Admitted by Consent

#### First Information Report (“FIR”) (Exhibit P1)

23     The FIR was admitted into evidence by consent.

24     The FIR was lodged by DW3 through a “999” call to the Police’s hotline. The timing of the “999” call made by DW3 was recorded as 05:29:23 hrs in the FIR. The text of the message was recorded as “_My passenger is drunk and cannot wake up._”

25     On the FIR, the location was given as “_16 Flora Dr Ferraria Park Condominium S(506945).”_

#### The Victim and Cpl Solhan responding to the FIR

26     The Victim and Cpl Solhan were despatched to the incident location to attend to the matter. They arrived at the incident location in a police car.

27     The Victim spoke to DW3 and was informed that the Accused was sleeping in the taxi and had yet to pay for the fare. The Victim then opened the rear right passenger door (i.e. driver’s side). The footage obtained from Victim’s BWC showed the Accused lying down inside the taxi with his head nearest to the door.

#### Medical Report on the Victim (Exhibit P2)

28     The Victim was seen by Dr Ong Hiok Hong on 4 September 2016, the same day the Victim was punched twice by the Accused. The medical report on the Victim was however prepared and signed off by Dr Looi Chong Heng. The medical report of the Victim was admitted into evidence by consent. As such, both the doctors were not called to testify at the trial.

29     The medical report revealed that :

> (a)     The Victim gave a history of being assaulted that day and that she was punched on the face;

> (b)     Mild bruising was noted over the left side of the Victim’s nose;

> (c)     Small abrasion was seen over the Victim’s upper lip; and

> (d)     Superficial scratch mark noted over the right wrist of the Victim.

30     The Victim testified that there was slight bleeding arising from the two punches she received from the Accused. However, it was cleaned up by the time she was medically examined at CGH.

#### The Accused’s Medical Report and Toxicology Report (Exhibits P3 and P4)

31     The Accused was attended to by Dr Raymond Lim on 4 September 2016, at 9.30 a.m., on the same day he was arrested. The medical report on the Accused was however prepared and signed off by Dr Kang Jun Hui Larry. The medical report of the Accused was admitted into evidence by consent. As such, both the doctors were not called to testify at the trial.

32     The medical report revealed that :

> (a)     The Accused had a significant past medical history of hypertension and childhood asthma, but did not have any complaints at the time of the examination and did not have any suicidal thoughts;

> (b)     He was well and alert with full GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) of 15;

> (c)     He was ambulant with normal gait;

> (d)     Alcoholic fetor and conjunctival injection was noted;

> (e)     No injuries were noted on him, and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable; and

> (f)     He was certified fit for detention.

33     A blood sample was collected from the Accused, which was submitted to the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory at HSA by one Jessie Lin Simin to check for blood alcohol content (“BAC”). The subsequent report by the analyst Nadia Norashikin Bti A S Wong revealed that the BAC of the Accused was 154 mg/100ml.

### Issues in Dispute

34     After reading and hearing the submissions of the Prosecution and Defence, and taking the above into consideration, I narrowed the disputed issues of fact and law to the following:

> (a)     Whether an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Prosecution in amending the charges after the Case for the Defence had been filed;

> (b)     Whether the Accused did punch the Victim in respect of the second charge _i.e._ C2B; and

> (c)     Whether the Accused had the requisite _mens rea_ (i.e. knowledge of causing hurt) in respect of both charges.

## No Adverse Inference

35     In respect of the first issue, it was submitted by the Defence that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Prosecution for putting forth a case at trial which differed from the Case for the Prosecution[^6] which was submitted at the pre-trial stage.

36     The Prosecution submitted that the Court should not draw any adverse inference as the amended charges were not inconsistent with its Case, and the Accused was not prejudiced in any way.

37     I did not agree with the Defence that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Prosecution. The amendment to the charge was one in relation to an issue of law, and merely lowers the fault element of the charges. Counsel for the Accused referred this Court to the decision of the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in _Public Prosecutor v Li Weiming_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 393</span> (“_Li Weiming”_). The CA in _Li Weiming_ was addressing the Prosecution’s hesitance to be “bound” by its summary of facts in that case.[^7] The CA had further elaborated in the same paragraph (which the Defence did not highlight in its submissions):

> 91    … If the Prosecution is subsequently compelled, acting in good faith, _to depart from the original facts set out in its summary of facts due to the emergence of new evidence or because the summary of facts was drafted without the benefit of a full appreciation of the material circumstances_, there is no reason why the court would not be able to take this into account and decline to draw any adverse inference. _The Prosecution should not fear being unfairly “prejudiced” or restrained by being upfront of its present position in the Case for the Prosecution._

> \[emphasis added\]

38     This was clearly not the case here. The material facts or the evidence that the Prosecution would have relied on to prove either “knowledge” or “intention” would be substantially the same, and the Prosecution would not have departed from the original facts as set out in their Summary of Facts. In considering the Summary of Facts in the Case for the Prosecution, it was apparent to me that the Prosecution had sought to prove all the facts therein, and only the fault element of the charges were amended. I found that the Defence had failed to satisfy the Court that the prosecution had put forward a case at the trial which differed from or was otherwise inconsistent with the Case for the Prosecution.

39     Even taking the Defence’s case at its highest, I fail to see how the Defence was prejudiced in any way. The charges were amended on 23 January 2018, more than half a year before the trial before me had commenced on 27 July 2018. There was more than ample time for the Accused to prepare his defence to the amended charges.

40     I had also observed that the Accused was seen by his expert witness, Dr Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”), on 24 August 2017 and 7December 2017.[^8] The charges were amended on 23 January 2018. Dr Winslow’s psychiatric report on the Accused (Exhibit D4) was dated 21 June 2018, which was close to six months after the charges had been amended. Even though the consultations took place prior to the amendments, there was sufficient time for the Defence to consult Dr Winslow and update him of the amendments to the charges. Alternatively, after Dr Winslow had released the psychiatric report, there was still sufficient time in the intervening period prior to the commencement of trial for the Defence to seek clarifications from Dr Winslow. Based on the evidence presented before this Court, it was apparent that Defence did neither. To support my finding, I reproduce the relevant extract of the Notes of Evidence.

> Q    Doctor, this is day 5 of the trial in relation to the accused. You were not present during the earlier 2 tranches, but have you had a chance to look at the Notes of Evidence?

> A    I---I have scanned them, yes.

> Q    So you would know that when you prepared the report, it was on the basis of as you have set out in paragraph 2.3 of your report?

> A    Yes.

> Q    It was on the basis of charge sheets that were dated 22nd February 2017?

> A    That is correct.

> Q    Yes. And having scanned the Notes of Evidence, you would know by now that the mens rea element for both charges has been changed from one of intention to one of knowledge?

> A    Yes, I’m aware.

> Q    Doctor, given the change in the specific element of mens rea, does your opinion differ any way from what you’ve set out in your report?

> A    No.[^9]

41     I would also like to highlight that the Prosecution closed its case on the evening of 28 June 2018. Dr Winslow commenced his oral testimony on 7 January 2019. This was months after the psychiatric report was prepared and close to a year after the charges had been amended. It does not lie in the Defence’s mouth to now claim that they had been unfairly prejudiced by the amendments to the charges.

42     For the foregoing reasons, I declined to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution.

## Assessment of the Evidence

43     The second and third issues relate to questions of fact which I address below.

44     The best evidence showing the assault comes from the BWC footage of the Victim (Exhibit P5) (the “BWC Footage”). I have viewed the BWC Footage several times in the course of the trial. I have also viewed the BWC Footage in my chambers, on my own, in the course of my assessment of the evidence and my deliberation on this case.

45     Whilst Cpl Solhan was equipped with a BWC at the material time, footage from his BWC was not admitted into evidence. Cpl Solhan and the Investigating Officer had testified that whilst steps were taken to retrieve the footage from Cpl Solhan’s BWC, the footage could not be retrieved as his BWC had malfunctioned or had a flat battery during the material time.[^10] I accepted the evidence of Cpl Solhan and that of the Investigating Officer. In the circumstances, I make no adverse finding against the Prosecution.

46     Having viewed the BWC Footage and heard the oral testimonies of the factual witnesses, I made the following observations:

### Actus Reus – the 1st punch

47     It was undisputed that the 1st punch was inflicted by Accused on the Victim at or about 5.52 a.m. on 4 September 2016.

48     From the BWC Footage, it was clear that the Accused had inflicted the 1st punch on the Victim as the Victim was attempting to get him to pay the taxi fare.[^12]

49     The fact that the 1st punch was inflicted by the Accused to the Victim was also corroborated by the evidence of DW3, who testified that the Accused had punched the Victim’s nose and mouth area.[^13] This was also consistent with DW3 shouting “_It’s the police_” at or about the time of the 1st punch – which leads to the irresistible inference that the Accused had done something to the Victim which warranted a reminder that she was a police officer.[^14]

50     Whilst the Victim was seen to be giving the Accused light slaps on his face shortly before the 1st punch, I was satisfied that this did not amount to sudden or grave provocation. In any case, this was not canvassed by the Defence. Given the factual background to this case, I found that the Victim did not use excessive force to rouse the Accused from his sleep.

### Actus Reus – the 2nd punch

51     The Defence took the position that while there might have been contact between the Accused and the Victim whilst the police officers were pulling the Accused out of the taxi, the Accused did not punch the Victim. In reliance of their contention, the Defence submitted that:

> (a)     The Victim’s injuries did not reflect that there was a second punch;[^15]

> (b)     The Victim’s evidence that the Accused had punched her when his hands were let free to throw the 2nd punch is contradicted by that of Cpl Solhan and DW3;[^16] and

> (c)     There is nothing in the contemporaneous records to indicate that the Victim had been punched a second time.[^17]

52     The Prosecution however, submitted that the 2nd punch had definitely occurred as:

> (a)     The Victim had confirmed that the punch happened at 05:53:01 a.m.;[^18]

> (b)     The Defence is in no position to theorise that the injuries did not reflect a punch or were a result of another form of contact as they had chosen not to question the examining doctor;[^19]

> (c)     The Victim and Cpl Solhan’s evidence were corroborative that there was a 2nd punch;[^20]

> (d)     DW3’s evidence did not contradict the evidence of the Victim and Cpl Solhan; and

> (e)     The BWC Footage had recorded the Victim telling another police officer that she had been punched twice.[^21]

53     Having considered the submissions, and having reviewed the evidence, I found that it was clear that the Victim was punched a second time.

54     I found that the Defence’s submission that the injuries presented by the Victim did not reflect a punch was wholly misconceived. Having chosen not to cross-examine the examining doctor and allowing him the opportunity to address the contention, the Defence cannot now seek to contradict the findings of the examining doctor: per _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R. 67.

55     I believed the Victim that she was punched a second by the Accused.

> (a)     Firstly, her evidence was also corroborated by Cpl Solhan’s evidence.[^22] Cpl Solhan was unequivocal that after the Accused was put in a standing position, the Accused gave the Victim another punch.[^23] Cpl Solhan was also clear, that he had continued holding on to the Accused’s left hand between him pulling the Accused out of the car and the 2nd punch, and that the Accused had used his right hand to punch the Victim.[^24] The only apparent inconsistency was the fact that the Victim had testified that she and Cpl Solhan had let go of the Accused’s hands, whilst Cpl Solhan had testified that he did not release the Accused’s hands at any point. This apparent inconsistency was immaterial because both the Victim and Cpl Solhan were consistent in that the Accused had used his right hand to punch the Victim. In addition, there was absolutely no reason for Cpl Solhan to provide a false testimony on the witness stand. As an NSman police officer, Cpl Solhan has since completed his National Service and is no longer with the SPF.[^25] Cpl Solhan is also in no way related to the Accused, or the Victim for that matter. His testimony was consonant with the extrinsic evidence. There was no incentive for him to conceal or misrepresent the facts.

> (b)     Secondly, at the instance of her receiving the second punch, there was a flurry observed from the Victim’s BWC. In my assessment, the flurry of movement was caused as a result of the Victim reacting to being punched by the Accused.

> (c)     Thirdly, I also found corroborative evidence from the audio recording of the BWC wherein the Victim can be heard telling her superior, one ASP Zeya, that she was punched twice.[^26]

> _\[Key: Police Officer 2 is ASP Zeya and Female Speaker is the Victim\]_

> I found that the Victim was simply answering to ASP Zeya’s questions and not making up evidence to incriminate the Accused. The above evidence thus effectively demolished the Defence’s submission that there is nothing in the contemporaneous records to indicate that the Victim had been punched a second time.

56     On the contrary, I found that DW3’s evidence was not persuasive, as he testified that he remained on the driver’s side[^27] when the altercation happened on the other side. He also conceded that he did not know which part of the Accused’s body had contacted the Victim, as it was chaotic.[^28] When the Prosecution put to DW3 that his statement in paragraph 13 of his Statutory Declaration[^29], which reads _“I am certain that the second contact was not a punch unlike the first one”_, was inaccurate, he candidly agreed.[^30] Having reviewed the evidence, I disbelieved DW3 in relation to the second punch and I rejected his evidence in paragraph 13 of his Statutory Declaration.

### Mens Rea – the 1st and 2nd punches

57     The case of _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> ("_Jeffrey Yeo_") is instructive and sets out the two elements which need to be established in determining if the Accused possessed the requisite _mens rea_ in a s 332 Penal Code offence:

> (a)     The hurt was caused voluntarily to the Victim[^31]; and

> (b)     Objective knowledge that the Victim was a public servant discharging her duty.[^32]

58     The Penal Code provides the definition of “hurt” and “voluntarily”:

> **Hurt**

> **319**. Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.

> **“Voluntarily”**

> **39.** A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he _knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it_.

> \[emphasis added\]

59     In respect of the element set out in paragraph 57(b) above, the High Court espoused:

> 35    … However, the _knowledge required is objective and not subjective knowledge_. Therefore, if an ordinary person would have such knowledge in the circumstances of the case, it is not open to the accused person to claim that he did not know. Hence, _an intoxicated accused person would not be permitted to say that he was so drunk he was not aware of the status of the victim and was merely lashing out at any person who was in his proximity or who went near him_. Being in a state of intoxication would afford no defence to a charge under s 332 unless he could bring himself within the defence of intoxication in ss 85 and 86 of the Penal Code.

> \[emphasis added\]

60     Both the Prosecution and the Defence were aligned and agreed that the knowledge element as set out above was objective and not subjective. This means that it does not matter whether the Accused was aware that the Victim was a police officer, so long as a reasonable man in those circumstances would have appreciated that she was a police officer, the element would be satisfied.[^33]

61     In the present case, it cannot be disputed that hurt was caused to the Victim by the Accused. That leaves the issue of “voluntariness” and objective knowledge to be determined, and I deal with both in turn.

#### Expert evidence of Dr Winslow

62     The Accused’s defence in respect of both punches was that he did not possess the requisite knowledge of causing hurt, as he was in a stuporous state.[^34] It was submitted that the _mens rea_ for both punches was lacking in this case.

63     In support of their above contention, the Defence relied on the psychiatric report of the Accused (Exhibit D4) adduced through Dr Winslow. In the course of his testimony, Dr Winslow referred to an extract (i.e. page 88) from _Garriott’s Medicolegal Aspects of Alcohol (5_th_Edn, 2009)_[^35] (Exhibit D4A)

64     Dr Winslow’s psychiatric report on the Accused (Exhibit D4) can be broadly summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Accused met the diagnostic criteria for alcohol intoxication (DSM-V) at the time of the incident;[^36]

> (b)     The Accused had an estimated blood alcohol concentration (“BAC”) of 254 – 279 mg/100ml at the time of the incidents;[^37]

> (c)     The average person at the Accused’s BAC would be considered in the ‘Stupor’ stage of alcoholic influence;[^38]

> (d)     The Accused’s cognitions, perception, and behaviour would have been significantly altered at the time of the alleged offences due to alcohol intoxication;[^39]

> (e)     The Accused would not have been in a position to voluntarily cause hurt to the Victim with intent to deter her from discharging her duty as a public servant;[^40]

> (f)     As the Accused was in an alcohol-induced stupor with impaired consciousness at the time of the alleged offences, it is unlikely that he was able to perceive that the Victim was a public servant as he was unaware of his surroundings at the time of the incident;[^41]

> (g)     Considering the Accused’s level of intoxication and history of martial arts training in self-defense, it was possible that the Accused had an involuntary muscle memory reaction to being slapped by the Victim.[^42]

65     The Prosecution did not adduce any expert evidence in this respect.

66     Hence, in order to determine if the Accused possessed the requisite _mens rea_ for inflicting the two punches on the Victim, I reviewed Exhibit D4 and Dr Winslow’s testimony vis-à-vis the objective evidence before me.

#### Principles in dealing with expert evidence

67     In the present case, the law on dealing with expert evidence remains clear. In _Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 983 (“_Sakthivel_”), the High Court stated at \[76\]:

> 76    What is axiomatic is that a judge is not entitled to substitute his own views for those of an uncontradicted expert’s: _Saeng-Un Udom v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 1</span>. Be that as it may, a court must not on the other hand unquestioningly accept unchallenged evidence. Evidence must invariably be sifted, weighed and evaluated in the context of the factual matrix and in particular, the objective facts. An expert’s opinion “should not fly in the face of proven extrinsic facts relevant to the matter” _per_ Yong Pung How CJ in _Khoo James v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy_ \[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 414 at \[65\]. In reality, substantially the same rules apply to the evaluation of expert testimony as they would to other categories of witness testimony. Content credibility, evidence of partiality, coherence and a need to analyse the evidence in the context of established facts remain vital considerations; demeanour, however, more often than not recedes into the background as a yardstick.

68     It is paramount that despite Dr Winslow being the sole expert witness, his evidence must be scrutinised in light of the objective facts. What is paramount is the consistency and the logic of the evidence to be preferred.

69     Bearing in mind the above, I did not accept the opinion expressed at paragraphs \[28\][^43] & \[29\][^44] of Exhibit D4 and I gave minimal weight to Dr Winslow’s oral testimony report, when considered in totality of the extrinsic evidence as well as his oral testimony on the stand. I set out the reasons for my finding below:

##### (1)   Calculations of the Accused’s BAC was not an accurate estimate

70     In determining the estimated BAC of the Accused at the material time of the offences, Dr Winslow had used a burn-off rate of 25 mg per hour, starting from 154 mg/100ml at about 10.00 a.m.,[^45] which would amount to about 254 – 279 mg/100ml – at the time of the incidents – between the hours of 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m..[^46]

71     In Exhibit D4, Dr Winslow had used the burn-off rate of 25 mg per hour as a “heavy drinker burn off rate”, considering the Accused’s self-reported drinking patterns.[^47] However, Dr Winslow conceded that this figure was not the Accused’s exact burn-off rate, as the fate of alcohol in the body depends on several factors including the rate of absorption, the rate of distribution and rate of elimination.[^48] The most accurate calculation is where a doctor tests the subject himself, and watch the burn-off rate after giving alcohol.[^49] This was not the case in the preparation of the report.[^50]

72     Dr Winslow also testified that the Accused’s health status, medication, genetics, physiological state, and environmental influences that night were not taken in account in determining the burn-off rate.[^51] It was also conceded that the burn-off rate of 25 mg per hour was an estimate only, of what is believed to be the average burn-off rate for a Caucasian heavy drinker.[^52] When asked how he had derived the burn-off rate of 25 mg per hour, seeing as the literature was not provided for in his report, Dr Winslow then adduced Exhibit D4A.[^53] However, the burn-off rate of 25 mg per hour was not found in Exhibit 4A either. Dr Winslow explained that he had chosen 25 mg per hour as regular drinkers would either be in the rapid or ultra-rapid range.[^54] This was despite the literature citing that the customary burn-off rate is approximately 20 mg per hour.[^55] When questioned on this, Dr Winslow conceded that he would be prepared to accept that the Accused’s burn-off rate could have been 20 mg per hour as well.[^56] This would place the Accused’s BAC at between 213 – 234 mg/100ml, as calculated by the Prosecution.[^57] Nonetheless, Dr Winslow conceded again that these figures were all estimates and no one knows exactly the Accused’s burn-off rate.[^58]

73     Considering the literature[^59] and the concessions made by Dr Winslow when he was cross-examined by the Prosecution, I found that the defence had failed to establish the precise level of the Accused’s BAC on the two occasions when he inflicted a punch each. Even if the Court were to accept an estimated level of BAC, the Defence had also failed to establish it. There were too many uncertainties in arriving at a proper estimate of the Accused’s burn-off rate.

##### (2)   No conclusive evidence that the Accused was in a “stuporous” state

74     The next step in the analysis would be to determine the Accused’s state of mind taking into account his actions and his estimated BAC at the material time. With regard to the correlation of BAC levels to one’s state of mind, a table was exhibited in Exhibit D4, identifying the possible stages of alcoholic influence one could be in in relation to one’s BAC level.[^60]

75     The stages of alcoholic influence that are relevant for this Court’s consideration would be:

> (a)     Excitement (BAC of between 90 – 250 mg/100ml);

> (b)     Confusion (BAC of between 180 – 300 mg/100ml); and

> (c)     Stupor (BAC of between 250 – 400 mg/100ml).

76     It must be noted that the clinical signs and symptoms of each stage varies, and would go towards determining if the Accused had the requisite _mens rea_ in the commission of the offences.

77     Dr Winslow had estimated the Accused’s BAC to be 254 – 279 mg/100ml at around 5 - 6 a.m. on the day of the incident. Accordingly, based on the stages at \[75\] above, he had determined that the Accused would be considered in the ‘stupor’ stage. As I had found that the Defence had failed to establish the Accused’s estimated BAC at the time each of the two punches were inflicted, I rejected Dr Winslow’s opinion and testimony that the Accused was in the ‘stupor’ stage.

##### (3)   Effect of alcohol ingestion on the Accused did not significantly diminish the ability to form the requisite knowledge

78     Dr Winslow explained that when a person gets intoxicated, the intoxication starts from the front of the brain and goes to the back of the brain (_i.e_. that the brain would lose function from the front to the back); and vice-versa in recovery from an alcoholic intoxication. He further explained that the human brain can be dissected into three parts[^61]:

> (a)     Neocortex (front of the brain) – the part of the brain that is able to process and assimilate information, and to think or make intentional decisions;

> (b)     The limbic system or mammalian system (middle of the brain) – the part of the brain that allows for fight, flight, freeze responses, and emotions; and

> (c)     The brainstem or reptilian brain (the back of the brain) – the part of the brain responsible of the base functions of the body.

79     Dr Winslow then added that for a person “_to have knowledge, you still need to be able to engage your cortex, because anything less than it, you can still be acting out … lashing out if you perceived that you are under threat_”.[^62] It was his opinion that the Accused was not sufficiently functional or awake to be able to have that consciousness[^63], and that even up until the time of the 2nd punch, the Accused had not fully engaged his neocortex yet.

80     Whilst the learned doctor had taken great pains to bring the court through the scientific backdrop of how the human brain operates, I must respectfully disagree with his finding.

81     The Accused is a seasoned drinker, who had started indulging in alcohol at the young age of 23 years old, drinking at a frequency of about 2 to 4 times a week. He also reported that he could down half a bottle of whiskey and feel okay.

82     Whilst it was pointed out that the Accused appears to have decreased response to stimuli, impaired consciousness and muscular incoordination, these symptoms were not conclusive that the Accused person was in a state of stupor. I noted that even for the other two stages which I had earlier identified – of excitement and confusion – the behaviour of the Accused person was consonant with the signs and symptoms described, examples being decreased sensitory response, increased reaction time, sensory-motor incoordination, muscular incoordination, slurred speech. These were all symptoms which were observable in the BWC Footage as well.

83     When questioned by the Prosecution if the Accused could have been in the ‘confusion’ stage and not necessarily the ‘stupor’ stage (based on an estimated BAC of 254 – 279 mg/100ml), Dr Winslow conceded that the Accused could have been in the higher end of the ‘confusion’ stage as well.[^64] Dr Winslow had also conceded that it was possible the Accused was in the ‘excitement’ stage if the estimated BAC was between 213 – 234 mg/100ml.[^65]

84     Taking into account my finding at \[77\], and having observed conduct and behavioural, coupled with the numerous concessions of Dr Winslow[^66], I rejected the Accused’s defence that the effect of alcohol had significantly diminished his ability to form the requisite knowledge that he would likely cause hurt to the Victim.

##### (4)   The Accused knew that he would likely cause hurt to the Victim

85     Next, it had to be determined if the Accused had subjective knowledge that he would likely cause hurt to the Victim, in spite of his state of mind.

86     It was undisputed that at the point of arrival of the police officers, the Accused was fast asleep and was not aware of his surroundings, even after various means were employed by DW3 and the condominium security officer to wake him. As revealed by the BWC footage, the Accused became conscious in the brief course of the Victim’s attempts to wake him up. He was able to hold a conversation using complete sentences in various languages by the time he was arrested by the police officers.[^67] This was less than five minutes from the Victim’s first attempt to wake the Accused up.[^68] It is also noteworthy that the Accused could speak full sentences mere seconds after the 2nd punch[^69], where he was aware that he was being pressed / pinned, and even requested for the Victim to “loosen up”. [^70] My assessment will focus on the interim period, to determine if the Accused knew that he would likely cause hurt to the Victim.

(A)   Accused has a better than average tolerance of alcohol

87     The Accused was a person who had a better tolerance of alcohol than a regular Joe. This was corroborated by Dr Winslow, when it was pointed out to him that the Accused had reported being able to drink up to half a bottle of whiskey at a time and feel okay, and that the Accused was able to drive whilst having a BAC of 159 mg/100ml in the year 2014.[^71]

88     In the latter case, the Prosecution led evidence to show that in 2014, the Accused was convicted of drink-driving. The Accused had consumed alcohol at River View Hotel, and intending to send his friend home, drove his car. He was stopped at a road block along Outram Road. The Accused also testified that he was able to drive, but was stopped solely because of the police roadblock.[^72] His blood-ethanol level then was 159 mg/100ml.[^73]

89     Dr Winslow also testified that a person with tolerance would probably wake up faster than a person without, and agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused was able to regain consciousness after being woken up faster.[^74] He also informed the court that with tolerance, a person with a high BAC may be functioning at a higher level than the average person.[^75]

(B)   Accused was aware of his surroundings

90     One obvious feature in the BWC Footage which was expounded upon during the trial was the fact that the Accused was aware of his surroundings.

91     As the Victim attempted to wake the Accused up, she assisted to shift him up into a sitting position[^76], before asking him questions. Dr Winslow had stated that the Accused would have been relatively more conscious from when he was lying down.[^77] During this time, the Accused was also seen swinging at the Victim’s arms, fending her taps. Dr Winslow explained that the Accused was becoming more conscious, and more aware of that something was going on.[^78] More importantly, I observed that the Accused was able to direct his hand to fend off the Victim’s hand, and not simply waving his hand aimlessly.

92     As the Victim continued to tap on the Accused’s face, the Accused started to awake, as described by Dr Winslow.[^79] At this juncture, the Victim began to question the Accused, asking him where he resided. The Victim continued to tap on the Accused’s face, until the Accused managed to answer her[^80]:

94     From the above exchanges, it was clear to me that the Accused was conscious enough to:

> (a)     Understand the questions posed to him, which had mixed-elements of the English and Mandarin languages;

> (b)     Be aware of where he was; and

> (c)     Understand that he was in a taxi, and that he had to pay his fare.

95     The Defence submitted that the Accused was still not in a position to form knowledge, as it is commonplace for intoxicated persons to be able to identify their surroundings without true engagement with their surroundings.[^82] Preliminarily, I noted that their support stems from a statement by Dr Winslow about his other alcoholic patients, and not about the Accused.[^83] The Defence’s submission was also not substantiated with any literature.

96     The scene of the incident was outside the condominium premises, and it can be seen from the BWC Footage, that the perimeter walls of the condominium were unremarkable and did not even feature the name of the condominium.[^84] This was further juxtaposed against the Defence’s submissions that the Accused was in a fluctuating state of consciousness.

97     Hence, I could agree with the Defence’s submission that the Accused had not engaged his surroundings. My finding was further buttressed by the fact that the Accused had answered correctly that he “resided here” when presented with three differently phrased questions by the Victim. This was supported by Dr Winslow’s observation.[^85]

98     The Accused then answered logically, again, when presented with a totally different question as to payment of the taxi fare. He was aware of his surroundings – that he was in a taxi, and had arrived home. This was consistent with the testimony of DW3, who testified that the Accused had informed him of the destination and was sitting up for the first few minutes of the taxi ride, showing that the Accused was clearly conscious and aware as early as boarding the taxi home.[^86]

99     In the premises, it was evident that the Accused was aware of his surroundings at least during his conversation with the Victim on where he resided up until the 1st punch, even though he might have been in a fluctuating state of consciousness. This would be consistent with the finding that he had a higher tolerance, and would have been operating at a higher consciousness than the average person with a similar BAC.

100    In the same vein, I was also satisfied that the Accused was aware of his surroundings prior to the second punch, when he was brought to a standing position (without support)[^87], as he would have been even more conscious as compared to sitting down.

(C)   Accused was conscious at the material times of both punches

101    The Victim testified that the Accused had established eye contact with her as early as 05:51:48 a.m.[^88], where the Accused had also swung her hands away. She added that there was further eye contact subsequent to the Accused swinging her hands away. With respect to the 1st punch, the Victim testified that the Accused had used his right hand to swing away her hand, and to subsequently throw a punch up at her, after looking at her and aiming at her face area.[^89]

102    This was corroborated by Cpl Solhan, where he testified that the Accused was looking at the Victim while talking to her. He was candid that the Accused had his eyes closed at some points of time.[^90] He also testified that the Accused had looked at the Victim whilst fending off her tapping.[^91]

103    From the BWC Footage, I observed that moments before the 1st punch was inflicted, the Victim slapped the Accused’s cheek once that was harder than the other slaps. The Accused reacted immediately. His eyes stared at the Victim momentarily and thereafter, from a sitting position, his hand lashed out and he punched the Victim at her face around the nose area. In my assessment, the aiming of the fist to the nose cannot be any but done with both intent and knowledge.

104    In respect of the 2nd punch, the Victim also testified that the Accused had made eye contact with her before he punched her.[^92] This was similarly observed by Cpl Solhan.[^93]

105    Dr Winslow had testified that “it does require coordination to aim in the right direction of where you perceive a threat was coming from”, and the fact that the Accused had delivered both punches to the same bodily region of the same person despite having changed positions was demonstrative that the Accused had knowledge of the position with which he ought to put his punch to.[^94]

106    I would agree in this respect, as a punch is markedly different from flailing arms (which does not require any accuracy), or even the fending of the Victim’s arms (which involves merely guarding his face). It would take a certain degree of coordination to strike a standing person’s face which was some distance away, whilst one was sitting down, as it would involve being able to recognise where the target is, and the position with which he should strike.[^95]

107    It would take the same, if not more, coordination to aim and hit the same person in about the same spot (nose and mouth region) subsequently, within a second after having been brought to a standing position.[^96]

108    It becomes even more apparent when considering the circumstances surrounding the 2nd punch. At this juncture, Cpl Solhan had also made contact with the Accused – speaking to him[^97], and assisting to extricate him out of the taxi.[^98] However, the Accused did not even attempt to punch Cpl Solhan. There was no evidence that Cpl Solhan was hit at all.

109    It would fly in the face of all the evidence to say that the Accused was not conscious, or that he did not have knowledge that he would cause hurt to the Victim by doing so. The punches were coordinated, and measured, to inflict hurt on the Victim by striking her face – which is a vulnerable part of the human body.

110    On the issue of knowledge, I reproduce another extract which showed another material concession made by Dr Winslow.[^99]

Court:

 | 

Then if you look at the next question, “What is it?”, that means she’s trying to understand what is your, “here”, means. And the answer given at line 18, is “Reside here.”

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So there was a---the police officer appears to me, to be trying to understand---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

his answer, to get him to respond as to whether or not he was correct in understanding.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yah, she was trying to get him to respond, yes---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yes, she was---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

to---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

trying to get him to respond and trying to get---to get an affirmative response, that his response was correct.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Would that---in her context, it is trying to understand getting it correct. But---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

in his context---the accused’s context, he is able to understand what she was asking.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

That’s correct.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Correct?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Right. With reference to the 2nd punch, the evidence was that he had been taken out from the taxi.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

He was standing on his own. The female officer was initially holding on to his right hand. Her partner was holding on to his left hand. When---at one point in time, she let go of his right hand and that was when he lash out with the 2nd punch. Was that pas---what does that show?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

It sounds as though, uh, from the 1st punch he felt threat from---whether he knew or not the police officer was a police officer we don’t know, but it---it appears to be a first response---the first offence---first response to a threat perceived. The 2nd one when he let’s go---when she let go his hand, uh, I guess it is still---there’s a threat from the same source.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yah, but when---when---when I look at it in the context, he was in the taxi and she was trying to wake him up. There is a certain distance between the police officer and him.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

But in a standing position and a 2nd punch going towards the face, there is a difference in terms of the perception of m---accused’s position to victim’s position---accused’s position, to aiming the punch at her nose.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So what does---what---what---what does that show?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I---I would state that it is still part of the---the brain that this is a threat person or threat situation. Uh, and he---it hasn’t settled down to the point where he is going to, “Oh, okay, these people are not a threat actually.”

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

But in relation to be able to then at that point in time use his right hand to aim it at the face, what---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

He’s able to recognise where the threat is coming from.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Knowledge of the position with which he ought to therefore put his punch to?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

##### (5)   The evidence does not support the Accused having an involuntary muscle memory reaction

111    Dr Winslow had opined that considering the Accused’s level of intoxication and history of martial arts training in self-defence, it was possible that the Accused had an involuntary muscle memory reaction to being slapped by the Victim. This was on the basis that the Accused had been training Muay Thai at a frequency of about twice a week over two years.

112    However, having considered all the facts of the case, I was unconvinced by Dr Winslow’s explanation of the Accused’s punches as involuntary muscle memory reactions.

113    Dr Winslow had testified that one would develop muscle memory after doing the same action repeatedly over a long period of time, for example, riding a bicycle, rollerblading or doing a martial art sequence[^100], which would involve an intense amount of practice and training[^101].

114    When probed if he had adequate information to form a conclusion if the Accused was indeed lashing out in as a muscle memory reaction, Dr Winslow conceded that he did not have enough information – for example, if the Accused had enough Muay Thai training to form the muscle memory of how to punch, or even if his training involved punching or kicking.[^102]

115    The objective evidence on the other hand, painted a different view. The Accused testified that he was a beginner at Muay Thai, and had taken classes at most twice a week – sometimes just once a week.[^103] He also mentioned that it was a hobby and was for fitness, and that he had not entered any competitions.

116    In the course of his training, he was taught how to _defend_ attacks to his head, and that he was taught _to block_ the blows. He also mentioned that what he had learnt in Muay Thai was that punching a person is a means of attack and not a means of defence.[^104]

117    Further, as observed in \[108\] above, Cpl Solhan was not hit. The argument that the Accused was merely lashing out becomes tenuous in light of this fact, as the particularity and discrimination of the Accused’s “lashing out” becomes apparent. If he had truly “lashed out”, surely Cpl Solhan (who had physical contact with the Accused) would have been hit as well.

118    I was unable to reconcile the findings of Dr Winslow that the punches were the likely result of an involuntary muscle memory action with the objective facts presented. Dr Winslow had conceded that he had insufficient information to make such a finding. The facts when presented, showed that any possibility that the Accused’s punches were involuntary muscle memory reactions was wholly unsubstantiated.

##### (6)   Conclusion

119    Applying the above approach to the present case, I accorded minimal weight to Exhibit D4 and rejected its concluding opinions. This was because Exhibit D4 was not internally and externally consistent with the facts. During the course of his cross-examination by the Prosecution, Dr Winslow had to make many material concessions which substantially diminished any weight to be attached to his opinion and to Exhibit D4.

120    For the avoidance of doubt, this is not to say that it is of any fault attributable to Dr Winslow. As he had candidly conceded, the BWC Footage as a whole doesn’t show the full incident, and due to the poor lighting and obscuring of certain parts of the field of vision, only the people actually present would have been able to see what had actually happened.[^105]

121    As the Accused’s testimony was that he could not remember the happenings at the material time, I arrived at my decision from the Victim’s and the independent witnesses’ testimonies. Upon a holistic assessment of the evidence, I found that the Prosecution had established that the Accused would have known that his actions would likely cause hurt to the Victim.

#### An ordinary person would have known that the Victim was a public servant

122    The objective facts show that an ordinary person would have had knowledge that the Victim was a public servant in the circumstances of the case.

123    The Victim had identified herself as a police officer upon arrival at the scene. It was also established that the Accused had opened his eyes and had responded to the Victim’s questions prior to the 1st punch. It was also undisputed that the scene was well-lit by street lamps.[^106]

124    Immediately subsequent to the 1st punch, the objective evidence shows DW3 saying aloud that the Victim is a police officer, in Mandarin.[^107] This was shortly before the Victim radioed to inform that “subject assaulted police officer”.[^108] The Victim was directly in front of the Accused throughout the above. The 2nd punch occurred seconds after.[^109]

125    Any ordinary person would have recognised the standard uniform of a police officer – which the Victim was wearing – on a street well lit by streetlamps. Coupled with the various times that the Victim and DW3 had made oral remarks that the persons at the scene were police officers, any ordinary person would have had knowledge that the Victim was a police officer – a public servant.

## Conviction

126    In the circumstances, I found that the Accused had knowledge that he was likely to cause hurt to the Victim, a public servant who was acting in the discharge of her duty as such public servant, in respect of both the s 332 PC charges.

127    For the reasons given above, I found the Accused guilty on both charges and I convicted him accordingly.

It is unlikely that he was able to perceive that the victim was a public servant as he was unaware of his surroundings at the time of the incident.
