Criminal Law – Sentencing – section 5(1) read with section 11A of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9202/2022/01.\]

18 November 2022

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

1       Mr Jimmy Ong ran a mobile phone and accessories shop. To make more money, he devised a scheme to sell fraudulently registered prepaid SIM cards on the black market. The names and particulars of hundreds of unsuspecting individuals were misused by him to register additional prepaid SIM cards which all ended up on the black market through his machinations. Some of those SIM cards were ultimately used by syndicates involved in illegal activities. Tracings led to his arrest. He was then brought before the courts on 4 amalgamated charges under section 5(1) read with 11A of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CMA”), and he admitted to them all. After considering the facts, his mitigation, and the submissions, I sentenced him to a total term of 24 months imprisonment. These are the grounds for my decision on his sentence.

## Charges & Penalty

2       The act of fraudulently registering each prepaid SIM card results in entirely misleading subscriber details being captured on the computer systems of the various telcos. For knowingly effecting such unauthorized modifications to the contents of those computer systems, an offence under s 5(1) of the CMA is committed. Given the numerous instances where Mr Jimmy Ong did so, the Prosecution focused only on the more recent years and tendered 4 amalgamated charges under s 5(1) read with s 11A of the CMA. Mr Jimmy Ong pleaded guilty and admitted to the two proceeded charges in DAC 912790/2022 and 912792/2022 (involving a total of 616 prepaid SIM cards), and admitted & consented to have the balance two charges in DAC 912789/2022 and 912791/2022 (involving a total of 112 prepaid SIM cards) being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

3       Given that these were Mr Jimmy Ong’s first such offences, section 5(1) of the CMA states that each of those charges carried a maximum penalty of a fine of up to $10,000 or to imprisonment of up to 3 years or to both.

## Facts:

4       The Statement of Facts setting out the details of Mr Jimmy Ong’s offences was admitted to without qualification by him. The pertinent aspects are recounted chronologically below:

> a.     Mr Jimmy Ong was at all material times the owner of a mobile phone retail shop called “J2 Telecomm” located at 164 Bukit Merah Central #01-3657, Singapore.

> b.     To facilitate his business there, he obtained Terminal Device machines (“TD machines”) from Singtel and M1 in 2017 and 2019 respectively; these TD machines were meant for the registration of subscriber particulars for each SIM Card sold/issued by him. This was done by using the TD machine to scan the customer’s identification document and link that subscriber to the selected SIM card. The TD machine would then transmit that data and update the computer system of the relevant telco. Mr Jimmy Ong knew that each such registration of subscriber details for a SIM card would result in a modification of the computer system of Singtel and M1. He also knew that each TD machine allowed him to register up to three SIM cards under each person’s identification number.

> c.     After successfully registering the legitimate SIM card selected by a customer at his shop, Mr Jimmy Ong did not close the registration page but clicked the back button instead to scan more SIM cards with the TD machine and register them against that customer’s particulars without their knowledge. Mr Jimmy Ong knew that doing so was unauthorized and against the regulations of Singtel & M1, and against the law. The resultant extra pre-registered SIM cards were known as “Space Cards” and they were all prepaid mobile SIM cards. Mr Jimmy Ong created these Space Cards for sale as early as 2017. Whereas the cost price for a Singtel and M1 prepaid mobile SIM card was $7.50 and $8 respectively, Mr Jimmy Ong managed to sell each Space Card for $35 in 2017. By 2021, this sum grew to $70 - $85 each. Mr Jimmy Ong estimated earning around $5,000 a month due to his involvement in the creation and sale of such Space Cards.

> d.     Between 2017 to mid-October 2021, Mr Jimmy Ong also instructed his employee to pre-register Space Cards for him. Though the employee advised against doing so, Mr Jimmy Ong persisted with his involvement in Space Cards. Mr Jimmy Ong was aware that the Space Cards would likely end up being used for illegal activities.

> e.     To meet the demand for Space Cards and earn more money, Mr Jimmy Ong would also purchase Space Cards from unknown persons at Lorong 18 Geylang and upsell them for a profit. He purchased about 200 pieces each time, three times a week since 2017 for $35 per unit and would upsell them at $50 - $80 per unit.

> f.     From April 2020 to October 2021, Mr Jimmy Ong would also meet a person only known to him as ‘_Lao Ban_’ one to three times a month. Each time, he would receive 100 to 300 passports from _Lao Ban_, and he would use those passports to register Space Cards. _Lao Ban_ would then come to collect the passports and the Space Cards and pay him about $2,000 to $4,000 for each of their transactions.

> g.     From March 2021 to October 2021, Mr Jimmy Ong would also meet another person only known to him as ‘_Ah Bang_’ once a month. Each time, he would receive 50-70 passports from _Ah Bang_, and he would use those passports to register Space Cards. _Ah Bang_ would then come to collect the passports and the Space Cards and pay him about $2,000 to $3,000 for each of their transactions.

> h.     In mid-October 2021, the TD machine became obsolete as the telcos changed to a registration process which did not allow for the creation of Space Cards. On 30 November 2021, a police raid targeting retailers of Space Cards led to Mr Jimmy Ong’s arrest and he admitted his Space Card activities as set out above. At least 34 of those Space Cards originating from him were found to have been used as lines for unlicensed moneylending operations and advertisements.

> i.     For DAC 912790/2022, Mr Jimmy Ong admitted causing the unauthorized modification of the contents of the M1 computer system for the registration of prepaid mobile SIM cards in the manner set out above. Over a month plus period between 28 August 2021 to 10 October 2021, Mr Jimmy Ong pre-registered a total of 304 prepaid mobile SIM cards belonging to M1, and this resulted in the unauthorized modification of the computer system at M1.

> j.     For DAC 912792/2022, Mr Jimmy Ong admitted causing the unauthorized modification of the contents of the Singtel computer system for the registration of prepaid mobile SIM cards in the manner set out above. Between 15 May 2021 and 6 October 2021, Mr Jimmy Ong pre-registered a total of 312 prepaid mobile SIM Cards belonging to Singtel, and this resulted in the unauthorized modification of the computer system at Singtel.

## Antecedents:

5       Mr Jimmy Ong’s CRO records ran into 54 pages. They set out multiple types of antecedents spanning 14 years from 2005 to 2019, and he admitted to them all. I considered the following to be material in assessing the nature of the offender before the court.

> i.     On 29 June 2005, Mr Jimmy Ong was placed on 15 months’ Probation for an offence of Theft under section 379 of the Penal Code, with another charge of Dishonestly Receiving Stolen Property under section 411 of the Penal Code being taken into consideration. He breached the Probation and was convicted of the same offence of Theft again on 1 Aug 2006. He was nonetheless granted a second chance at Probation, but he breached it again by committing the same offence of Theft again; and on 30 Jan 2007 he had his Probation revoked and he was ordered to stay at the Juvenile Home for two months. Apart from those offences, he also clocked up 8 other offences during that same period (whilst on Probation) for various motor vehicle related activities for which he was fined and served with Disqualification Orders.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> ii.     Shortly after being released from the Juvenile Home, Mr Jimmy Ong came back before the courts again a few months later for similar motor vehicle related offences: on 21 June 2007, he was again fined for them and served with a longer period of Disqualification.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> iii.     On 20 July 2010, Mr Jimmy Ong returned before the courts and was convicted of one charge of furnishing False Information to a Public Servant under section 182 of the Penal Code, and was fined $4,000/- (which was paid in full).[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) He was 21 years old.

> iv.     On 29 Dec 2015, Mr Jimmy Ong returned before the courts and was convicted of one charge of Dealing with Secondhand Goods without a Licence under section 4(1) of the Secondhand Goods Dealers Act, and was fined $1,500/- (which was paid in full).[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) He was 26 years old.

> v.     On 6 Nov 2019, Mr Jimmy Ong returned before the courts for the third time as an adult with 48 charges of Fraudulent Evasion of Customs or Excise Duty under section 128D of the Customs Act. Sixteen of those charges were proceeded with and the balance 32 were taken into consideration, and a total fine of $72,400/- was imposed (which was paid in full). He was 30 years old.

6       The facts for the current charges shows that Mr Jimmy Ong started his Space Card activities in early 2017 and persisted with it for about 5 years until October 2021 when the telcos changed their SIM card registration process. Those facts showed that even as he was being investigated and dealt with for his many Customs and Excise evasion offences by the authorities, none of that served to deter him and alter the path that he was then on. In fact, even after being fined heavily for that episode (which he nonetheless resourcefully managed to pay in full), he perversely scaled up his Space Card activities instead with his involvement with _Lao Ban_ and _Ah Bang_. The current episode was now his 6th before the courts. In my judgment, the antecedents recounted indicated the following:

> \-    That whilst having come from evidently challenging family circumstances, Mr Jimmy Ong had been accorded multiple opportunities at rehabilitation & reform and had through those instances and the instances which followed, attained a clear familiarity with the criminal justice process, and an awareness of right and wrong and their consequences.

> \-    Despite all that, he continued to have a poor attitude towards staying on the right in his pursuits and possessed a clear proclivity to breaking obvious rules repeatedly and at scale (as evident from the last episode which involved multiple Customs and Excise evasion charges, and the current episode) just to advance his own interests, a proclivity which was undeterred by fines. Having come from challenging circumstances, and having been given repeated opportunities to reform, it was evident that he has still not managed to arrive at a point where he truly recognizes his obligation to the rest of society to abide by the law and resist taking liberties with it with no regard for others.

## Mitigation:

7       When Mr Jimmy Ong entered his plea and mitigation, he was acting in person. He followed the proceedings in English with ease and was brief & direct in his mitigation: pleading for leniency to be shown to him through a lighter sentence – preferably a fine – as he had a new-born to care for. In answers to the court, he confirmed that the child was from his marriage and that accommodation was taken care of.

## Prosecution’s Submissions:

8       The Prosecution sought a sentence of 24 months imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges with both terms to run concurrently. Noting that there were no reported cases for the current fact circumstances, the Prosecution applied the _Logachev_ sentencing approach (_Logachev Vladislaw v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span>), and submitted that culpability and harm justified the sentence sought, i.e. that:

> \-    Deterrence was the dominant sentencing objective being served because the obvious anonymity which Space Cards afforded meant that they commanded a premium amongst users who wanted to have their identities shielded from the parties they dealt with and ultimately from the authorities as well; the same category of persons who were usually involved in illicit activities. Mr Jimmy Ong not only knowingly facilitated such users, but he also sought them out with his involvement with _Lao Ban_ and _Ah Bang_, so as to actively profit from it.

> \-    That the offending actions were sophisticated, repeatedly sustained at scale over a long period, and was driven by greed. Hundreds of innocent persons – both local and foreign – had their identities misused by Mr Jimmy Ong without their knowledge, and many Space Cards flooded the black market because of his actions. Some of which were ultimately confirmed to have indeed been used by illegal moneylending syndicates.

> \-    That specific deterrence was further activated given that Mr Jimmy Ong’s present offending took place against a backdrop where he was already under investigation by the authorities for the manner in which he was conducting his affairs, and that neither the fact of those investigations nor the financial penalties imposed served to do anything to deter him from continuing to seek out the lucrative illicit gains on offer from being part of this scheme.

## Reasons for Sentence:

9       I found reason to view Mr Jimmy Ong’s offending with seriousness on account of the factors set out below.

### \-   High Potential for Harm

10     The true implications of the offending here must be appreciated. As stated earlier, the obvious advantage of Space Cards is the anonymity it offers to users. With these SIM cards, users can reach out to and contact others – whether they be other similar associates or other unsuspecting parties – to further their activities, and/or to advance their propositions, and be assured that tracing attempts by those parties/authorities of the SIM card’s subcriber details would lead to naught, and instead result in some other hapless innocent individual being investigated instead. In effect, these Space Cards were a critical means to an end, and all manner of illicit activities are facilitated through them. Apart from direct ‘point to point’ calls and messages, these Space Cards also afford users the ability to get online and access ‘one to many’ platforms and gain other products, services & payments whilst still maintaining that same anonymity. These Space Cards also allow for the remote activation of various devices – an option which has been tragically exploited to devastating effect in the past. It is precisely because the potential for harm arising from the misuse of SIM cards is so obviously high that the subject has been part of parliament’s deliberations and efforts over the years to address that risk. Working through the Infocomm Media Development Authority, all SIM card retailers are required to comply with rules to ensure the proper registration of a SIM card’s subscriber details. Proper registration mitigates that harm by ensuring subscriber traceability, and hence subscriber responsibility in use. Mr Jimmy Ong’s actions in the offences defeated that control mechanism entirely and reopens the box wide to release all manner of troubles instead. The harm arises with a singular Space Card falling into the wrong hands, and it was multiplied many times over in this case given the scale and duration of Mr Jimmy Ong’s actions where he ultimately deliberately sought out and partnered obviously unscrupulous individuals.

### \-   Entrustment and Abuse.

11     Connected to the aspect of appreciating the nature of the offending, I found it appropriate to note as well that as a SIM card retailer, Mr Jimmy Ong received the TD machines from the telcos upon an undertaking to adhere with the rules regarding their proper use. Entrusted in that manner with their proper use, he abused his position soon after instead. That abuse was in both directions because he also employed deliberate subterfuge in abusing the trust of the customers who handed over their particulars to him. In both aspects, the abuse was absolute because he did what he was precisely not authorized to do.

### \-   Knowing Breach, Greed Motive & the Scale of Illicit Gains Derived.

12     With his handphone and accessory shop, Mr Jimmy Ong could have run a legitimate business. It was obvious that he wanted more than the pace which that route afforded. Instead of directing his entrepreneurial efforts towards boosting his legitimate business, he chose at a very early stage – soon after receiving the first TD machine from Singtel in 2017 – to involve himself in the illicit business of Space Cards instead. He knew it was wrong and was in fact reminded of it even by his own staff, but he persisted because he could not find it in himself to resist the illicit financial rewards which he stood to gain. The obvious anonymity which Space Cards afforded to users meant that they commanded a handsome premium over the controlled prices for legitimately registered prepaid SIM cards. Individuals who wanted their identities shielded and not be held to account for their activities were willing to pay for the ability to do so. Mr Jimmy Ong knew that and was happy to oblige. He in fact took advantage of it to enrich himself. The admitted facts show that the premium he commanded for his Space Cards grew over time, and the illicit financial rewards reached a stage where he devoted so much of his energies to scale up his involvement with Space Cards and ramp up supply – even procuring black market ones to resell at further profit – that it ultimately formed a substantial part of his activities. He was indiscriminate in whose identities he misused (the charges list names of customers both local and foreign – all were fair game to him), and in who he dealt with for his Space Cards business; ultimately it mattered not to him who they were and what they intended to do with the cards, it only mattered whether they were in a position to pay for the ability which he was peddling. The admitted facts show that his illicit gains far outstripped the maximum fine which the law provided. In my judgment, given the admitted facts before the court, it would be a mistake to construe this mildly as a case of an errant retailer who was bending the rules on one (or at most a few) occasion for a known and select client (wherein a non-custodial sentence might be justified). The facts indicated instead that this was a thoroughly unscrupulous retailer who was devoting significant efforts to deliberately circumvent the rules at scale without any regard for the potential consequences to others, just to unjustly enrich himself financially, and all this indicated that the custodial threshold was amply crossed.

### \-   Premeditated, Sustained Multiple Offending, Syndicate Involvement.

13     The assessment just alluded to regarding the nature of the offender before the court is justified further when one considers the full context in which Mr Jimmy Ong went about his offending. Whilst the charges focus only on the more recent years of his activities, the admitted facts to those charges show that his offending actually went on for about 5 years from 2017 onwards when he obtained the first TD machine from Singtel. Though he had a legitimate business which he could focus on, Mr Jimmy Ong directed his industry to find the technological loophole in the TD machine registration process and exploit it to generate Space Cards instead. The deliberate steps involved in that process, together with the subterfuge employed on each occasion, all indicated that the offending was well-planned, sophisticated, and entirely premeditated. His subsequent actions soon after in 2017 itself to source for additional Space Cards from the black market – numbering about 200 each time, three times a week – to resell at further profit also indicated the deliberate and significant escalation of his offending where he put it on a commercial scale. This admitted context from 2017 onwards, whilst not being the subject of formal charges, nonetheless forms the relevant backdrop to the charges which were tendered; charges which reference his further escalation from April 2020 onwards. Whilst this court ought to sentence Mr Jimmy Ong only for the charges as presented, the admitted context to those charges debunks any attempt to characterize Mr Jimmy Ong’s offending in those charges in any milder terms. The admitted facts show that by April 2020, Mr Jimmy Ong was already an experienced old hand and hardly a first offender in terms of his involvement with the generation and supply of Space Cards. The context also shows that for the charges presented involving the period from April 2020 onwards, the offending in them in fact represented a significant further escalation of his Space Card activities where he linked up with _Lao Ban_ (and subsequently _Ah Bang_ in addition) to generate Space Cards from passports – 100 to 300 passports at each time, one to three times a month, from April 2020 to October 2021. Mr Jimmy Ong did not know _Lao Ban’s_ identity (or _Ah Bang_) and it did not matter in terms of his willingness to deal. That these individuals were able to obtain and pass over numerous passports at volume on a regular basis, and could move the resultant Space Cards on, and pay handsomely for them, all indicated the involvement of an illicit syndicate. Mr Jimmy Ong’s actions with them over that sustained period greatly enabled their capabilities.

### \-   Actual Harm.

14     The reports to the authorities by persons impacted by the activities of unlicensed moneylending syndicates led to tracings. The facts indicate that at least 34 Space Cards originating from Mr Jimmy Ong for the select period under review were ultimately used by those unlicensed moneylending syndicates. That is the number as it stood when plea was taken, and all the other Space Cards continue to remain in circulation with unknown users. The point here is that Mr Jimmy Ong’s offending is far from a victimless crime.

### \-   Offender Specific Factors.

15     Drawing all those threads together, it was my judgment that culpability was undoubtedly high in this case. Further, given the scale of the offending, the harm wrought from his actions was also undoubtedly high. By harm, I refer to that which results when a Space Card is generated and gets released on the black market. That is the mischief being targeted, and the scale of it here was aggravated. I found that both deterrence and retribution ought to take centre stage during sentencing in these circumstances. Their effect remained unmitigated given the inconsequential matters raised by Mr Jimmy Ong in his mitigation. For the reasons alluded to earlier regarding the context and circumstances of the multiple offending in the charges, I did not think that Mr Jimmy Ong deserved to be treated as a first offender. I did however think that Mr Jimmy Ong ought to be accorded some credit for his early admission to the authorities regarding his actions from 2017 onwards, and his early plea of guilt in court to the charges. The credit due was however moderated given that the details of the SIM Cards allotted to him was easily established from telco records, and confirmations from the alleged subscribers would have resulted in evidence of his activities. Further, the moderation was justified given the aggravated manner of the offending involved, and the fact that there were grounds to also question that sincere remorse was present here. In that regard, I repeat my observations at \[6\] above. Attention ought to be paid to the fact that Mr Jimmy Ong’s actions in the current offences took place even as he was being investigated by authorities for his other numerous activities in relation to Customs and Excise evasion. Even though those investigations culminated with his being heavily fined in court in November 2019, that entire episode served to do nothing to deter him from the Space Cards path which he was then on. The facts show that Mr Jimmy Ong purposefully scaled up his Space Cards involvement instead by linking up with _Lao Ban_ (and subsequently _Ah Bang_ in addition) – as if to perversely make up for the financial losses he suffered from being fined in court. It was evident that Mr Jimmy Ong had not – despite the many repeated reform opportunities given to him and the regularity in which he was returning before the courts – yet found it in himself to appreciate the need to comply with the law, have due regard to the legitimate interests of others, and that dignity rests in honest labour instead. In the end, whereas a substantial imprisonment term was already justified given the reasons alluded to earlier, I found that specific deterrence was further activated in this case given the context in which Mr Jimmy Ong persisted with his offending and the evident pithy respect which he has displayed for compliance with the law.

## Precedents:

16     The Prosecution indicated that there were no reported decisions involving similar fact circumstances. This does not however mean that Mr Jimmy Ong was the first such offender before the courts. Before Mr Jimmy Ong’s plea was taken on the charges, I had in fact indicated this to him when he asked if a fine was an option for his case. I had explained then that I would have to consider all the facts and his mitigation, but that others have been imprisoned before for their involvement with Space Cards. He acknowledged that before entering his plea.

17     I am cognizant of the repeated cautions issued by the High Court about relying on unreported decisions when there are reasoned decisions available. In this case, there are no reasoned decisions available, and I therefore found it useful to reference the unreported decisions so as to ensure broad parity in the sentencing approach by the courts in such cases. I set these out below.

### \-   PP v Ang Kian Seng (Male, 42 years old)

18     MAC 901894/2022: Ang ran a mobile phone business. Between 13 Dec 2019 to 10 April 2021, Ang fraudulently used the particulars of his customers to register Space Cards using the TD machine assigned to him. On 20 April 2021, a police raid resulted in the recovery of 51 Space Cards from his shop. The facts indicated that Ang registered the Space Cards to perform value transfers for other customers who wanted to top-up their SIM accounts, or to simply hand them to his friends. For the singular charge under s 5(1) read with 11A of the CMA involving those 51 Space Cards, he was sentenced to **20 weeks imprisonment** after pleading guilty. Ang faced another unrelated charge under section 9(1)(d) of the Remove Gambling Act 2014. Ang was traced for various other offences, but none were for s 5(1) of the CMA.

### \-   PP v Lau Siew Boon (Female, 64 years old)

19     DAC 924879/2021 & 34 Others: Lau faced 35 charges in total, with three being amalgamated charges and the rest being ‘simpliciter’ charges under s 5(1) CMA. Lau ran a mobile phone business. In the 1990s, her business was located at the presently named Harbourfront Centre. Tourists arriving at port there would visit her shop and procure SIM cards from her. Over time, she used the particulars of those tourist customers to register Space Cards without their knowledge. Boarding officers for other vessels arriving at port also visited her shop, and she would sell these Space Cards to them for the benefit of the crews on board those vessels to allow them to contact their families back home and get online. These boarding officers became her regular customers; in some cases, providing her with passports as well to register for the SIM Cards. In 2005, the then Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) tightened the SIM card registration process by implementing the use of TD machines. Each TD machine allowed up to ten SIM cards to be registered against one subscriber’s particulars. In 2014, the IDA tightened the procedures further and only allowed each TD machine to register up to three SIM cards against one subscriber’s particulars. By that stage, Lau was operating a few connected businesses for her trade. Due to the sheer number of SIM cards involved, the police focused their investigations only for the period from 1 Nov 2019 to 5 Feb 2020. For that period, Lau was found to have registered at least 3,391 Space Cards across the various businesses she had charge over, with the large majority going to her regular customers (i.e. the boarding officers). It was an accepted fact that Lau did not actively seek to profit from the sale price of Space Cards, and instead sold them at either cost or the retail price. Lau explained that she did however benefit financially from the commissions and incentives paid out to her as a result of her hitting the various sales targets set by the telcos. Lau knew that her actions were wrong, and that there was a possibility that the Space Cards could end up in the wrong hands. The authorities found that at least 537 of those cards were used by unlicensed moneylending syndicates in their operations. For the 5 proceeded charges, Lau was sentenced to an aggregate of **18 months imprisonment** after pleading guilty. Lau was then completely untraced.

### \-   PP v Phoon Yiow Heng (Male, 64 years old)

20     DAC 925074/2021 & 19 Others: Phoon was one of the boarding officers who was a regular customer at Lau’s business. After obtaining the Space Cards from Lau, Phoon resold them to vessel crew members at a slight profit. Later on, he even sold Space Cards obtained from Lau to other boarding officers, again at a slight profit, for those boarding officers to do the same with their respective vessel crews. Phoon obtained crew particulars from ship captains and passed them to Lau. Phoon knew that Lau would use each set of particulars to register extra Space Cards for him. At the point of his arrest, Phoon was found to have 20 such Space Cards, and he was charged for having abetted Lau in the registration of those 20 Space Cards, an offence under s 5(1) read with 10(1) of the CMA. For the 7 proceeded charges, Phoon was sentenced to an aggregate of **4 months imprisonment** after pleading guilty. Phoon had some very dated property related antecedents and was otherwise untraced.

### \-   PP v Tan Chinn (Male, 38 years old)

21     DAC 926059/2015 & 19 Others: Tan was the owner of a mobile phone business. Tan used the TD machines assigned to him to fraudulently register Space Cards using the particulars of legitimate customers at his shop without their consent. Tan did this over the course of about a year from early 2013 to early 2014. Some of those Space Cards were subsequently found to have been used by unlicensed moneylending syndicates in their operations. Tan admitted to 20 simpliciter charges under s 5(1) of the CMA, and pleaded guilty to the 7 which were proceeded with and was sentenced to an aggregate of **6 months imprisonment**. Tan was then completely untraced.

### \-   PP v Tan Kong Chieh (Male, 43 years old)

22     DAC 921563/2015 & 659 Others: KC was freelance agent in the business of selling prepaid SIM Cards. KC started selling Space Cards registered with the particulars of willing subjects. After exhausting that supply, KC approached a tour agency in China in 2008-2009 to obtain the passport images of tourists in order to register additional Space Cards. Between Jan 2010 and Aug 2012, KC registered a total of 66,445 Space Cards. KC admitted to 660 simpliciter charges under s 5(1) of the CMA and pleaded guilty to the 220 which were proceeded with and was sentenced to an aggregate of **48 months imprisonment**. KC was traced for fraud during the same period when he was generating those Space Cards.

#### \-    **PP v Wong Yat Sung (Male, 44 years old) –** DAC 925728/2015 & 706 others:

#### \-    **PP v Wong Kok Leong (Male, 41 years old) -** DAC 925043/2015 & 706 Others:

23     YS was the Director of a mobile phone business, and KL was the Manager whom he employed there. In May 2013, YS told KL that their business would qualify for financial incentives if they met the sales targets of the various telcos. YS then instructed KL to fraudulently register Space Cards using the particulars of legitimate customers calling at their store. The Space Cards were then supplied to other mobile phone shops for sale. Between 23 July 2013 and 6 Oct 2013, a total of 707 Space Cards were fraudulently registered pursuant to that conspiracy. Whereas KL earned a modest additional sum due to the increased commissions, the said financial incentives went to YS instead. YS and KL admitted to the 707 simpliciter charges under s 5(1) read with 10(1) of the CMA and both pleaded guilty to the 235 which were proceeded with. YS was sentenced to an aggregate of **24 months imprisonment** for his role, and KL was sentenced to an aggregate of **18 months imprisonment** for his involvement. YS was traced for dissimilar antecedents, and KL was then completely untraced.

24     The precedents recounted show that since 2015 the courts have invariably viewed such offences with seriousness and dealt such offenders with hefty imprisonment terms. This was the case even where relatively small quantities of Space Cards were involved (see _Ang_, _Phoon_ and _Tan_). Mr Jimmy Ong was but the latest offender to nonetheless venture himself into this potentially lucrative trade of dealing with Space Cards. The precedents indicate that sentences were proportionately adjusted to take into account the period of the offending, the scale of the operations, the quantity of the Space Cards generated & where they were intended for, and the personal role and motivations of the offender. All of those were considerations to which I had applied my mind in this case. Those factors placed Mr Jimmy Ong’s case closer to _Tan Kong Chieh_ and to a lesser extent to _Wong Yat Sung_. Nothing further can be said since no formal grounds were issued in both of those cases. Nonetheless, given all the factors set out above, I found that a sentence of 24 months imprisonment was entirely proportionate for the great enabler role which Mr Jimmy Ong performed in the charges and his circumstances as was presented before me, and so ordered for each of the two proceeded charges. Both those charges straddled an overlapping period and involved similar quantities of Space Cards, with each charge referencing the computer system of the two telcos to which he was registered with. I exercised my discretion to order both terms to run concurrently and arrived at an aggregate sentence of 24 months imprisonment.

## Conclusion:

25     After that sentence was meted out, Mr Jimmy Ong applied for a deferment to arrange his personal affairs. The Prosecution had no objections to the application, nor for his bail to be extended for that period. After considering the application, I granted Mr Jimmy Ong a deferment till the 31st of November 2022 and extended his bail.

26     As it turns out, Mr Jimmy Ong used the time to engage learned counsel Mr Thomas Tham to file an appeal against the sentence. Sentence has since been stayed pending the appeal, and Mr Jimmy Ong remains on bail.
