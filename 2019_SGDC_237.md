Injunctions – Mareva injunction

8 November 2019

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       This was the plaintiff’s application for an injunction restraining the defendant in his capacity as sole administrator of the estate of his late father (the “Deceased”) from disposing of or dissipating the assets of the estate of the Deceased. I heard the application _inter partes_ and granted it with some minor amendments to the draft order that the plaintiff had prepared. The defendant has appealed against my decision and so I explain now my reasons in writing.

2       I might mention parenthetically that I heard this injunction application together with an application by the defendant to expunge certain paragraphs and exhibits from the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the injunction application. I dismissed that application to expunge but I say no more about it because the defendant has not appealed against that decision.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff is the brother of the Deceased and is thus the defendant’s uncle. The plaintiff’s claim in this action concerns a written settlement agreement dated 21 May 2017 between him and one Li Yanan (“Li”) in her capacity then as sole administrator of the estate of the Deceased (the “Agreement”). The defendant replaced Li as sole administrator in June 2018 pursuant to a court order and the plaintiff alleges that the defendant in that capacity breached the terms of the Agreement soon after taking office.

4       To understand the dispute concerning the Agreement in this action it is necessary first to understand the dispute that the Agreement was meant to resolve. On 9 July 2015 the plaintiff commenced District Court Suit No 2077 of 2015 (“DC 2077”). The two defendants in DC 2077, one of whom was Li, were sued in their capacity as co-administrators of the estate of the Deceased (there were two administrators at the time). The plaintiff alleged that in 2011 he had lent the Deceased $200,000 to purchase a flat in Yishun (the “Flat”) and that this debt had not been repaid when the Deceased passed away on 1 May 2014. The plaintiff thus sought in DC 2077 repayment of the sum of $200,000 from the estate of the Deceased. Li and her co-administrator resisted this claim. They pleaded that the $200,000 was a “gift” from the plaintiff to the Deceased.

5       Li became the sole administrator of the estate of the Deceased in December 2016 after her co-administrator successfully applied to be released, and in May 2017 she entered into the Agreement with the plaintiff. Li was described in the Agreement as “the Administrator”, and “Administrator” was defined as “the person appointed by the Court to administer the estate of the Deceased”. The preamble to the Agreement stated – in recitals (C) and (D) – the fact that the plaintiff had commenced DC 2077 to recover “a debt of S$200,000 … owed to the Plaintiff by the Deceased” and that this debt “arose from a personal loan of S$200,000 extended by the Plaintiff to the Deceased for the purchase of \[the Flat\]”. The preamble also recorded in recital (E) the intention of the plaintiff and the Administrator to enter into “a full and final settlement” of the claims in DC 2077 “without any admission of liability” by either party. The Agreement then went on to provide that:

> (a)     The Administrator “shall agree to transfer the Flat or sell the Flat in the open market”, and the plaintiff’s nominee “shall have sole conduct of the sale of the Flat”;

> (b)     The plaintiff shall pay $30,000 to the Administrator in three equal payments upon the occurrence of three events – (i) $10,000 to be paid upon execution by the Administrator of a power of attorney empowering the plaintiff’s son to be the Administrator’s lawful attorney to “effect the sale and transfer of the Flat”, (ii) $10,000 upon the Administrator’s “vacating the Flat and handing over the keys of the Flat to the Plaintiff’s nominee”, and (iii) $10,000 upon “completion of the sale and transfer of the Flat”;

> (c)     The plaintiff undertook to make two outstanding payments in respect of the Flat, namely (i) arrears of $394.05 owed to the Housing and Development Board and (ii) the outstanding mortgage loan of $88,941.63 owed to DBS Bank Ltd; and

> (d)     The plaintiff agreed to file a Notice of Discontinuance in respect of DC 2077 and to serve it on the Administrator within two working days of completion of the sale or transfer of the Flat.

6       Conspicuous by its absence was any mention of any monetary benefit to be received by the plaintiff in return. The effect of this absence is of course heavily disputed by the parties and I will address that dispute later. Li subsequently executed a power of attorney giving the plaintiff’s son various powers in respect of the Flat. The plaintiff paid Li $20,000 and on 29 May 2017 he discontinued DC 2077 against Li.

7       The defendant took over as sole administrator of the estate of the Deceased a little over a year later, and on 12 July 2018 he revoked the power of attorney that Li had executed in favour of the plaintiff’s son. The plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors on 14 August 2018 alleging that the revocation of the power of attorney constituted a breach of the Agreement and demanding that the defendant execute a fresh power of attorney empowering the plaintiff’s son “to effect the sale or transfer of the Flat”. The defendant’s solicitors declined to accede to that demand in a letter dated 21 August 2018 that said, among other things, that:

> (a)     The defendant was “disturbed and alarmed” by the fact that Li stood to receive $30,000 under the Agreement;

> (b)     Such receipt by Li appeared to be “contrary to the fiduciary duties” owed by her to the estate of the Deceased and the plaintiff appeared to be “actively assisting or facilitating” the breach of duty, and a “dishonest or fraudulent element” could not be excluded;

> (c)     Given the apparent irregularities the defendant “cannot, in good conscience and in discharge of his duties as administrator, continue to extend the power of sale and sole conduct of the Flat” to any nominee of the plaintiff;

> (d)     The defendant would “continue to market the Flat for sale”; and

> (e)     The plaintiff was “relieved from paying any further towards the Flat”, which he would have been obliged to do under the Agreement.

8       The plaintiff commenced this action on 15 October 2018 claiming that the defendant had breached the Agreement by revoking the power of attorney. The defendant entered appearance and filed a defence, and even as he contested the plaintiff’s claim in the action he continued making arrangements for the sale of the Flat. Eventually the Flat was sold with the completion of the sale taking place on 9 April 2019.

## Whether the plaintiff has a good arguable case

9       As mentioned above the Agreement contains no clause providing that the plaintiff is to receive any sum of money. Notwithstanding this the plaintiff pleads in this action that he and Li, as administrator of the estate of the Deceased, had in fact agreed that the plaintiff would receive $200,000 “upon the sale or transfer of the Flat, in full and final settlement of the claims … in DC 2077”, and that a clause to that effect “was, due to a clerical error, inadvertently omitted from the version of the Agreement that was executed on 21 May 2017”: at paragraph 5g of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1). The plaintiff says that the Agreement should be rectified to embody this agreement. He pleads further or in the alternative that it was an implied term of the Agreement that the plaintiff would be repaid $200,000 from the estate of the Deceased on completion of the sale or transfer of the Flat. Given that the Flat has been sold the plaintiff claims that the defendant has breached the Agreement by failing to pay him $200,000. In the alternative the plaintiff pleads that the Agreement is void by reason of a mistake of fact.

10     The defendant’s position on the other hand is that the Agreement means no more than what it says and so the plaintiff is not entitled to be paid any sum of money under it. The defendant relies on a clause in the Agreement providing that (a) the Agreement “constitutes the entire agreement between parties” and “supersedes any and all other agreements, understandings, negotiations or discussions” between them, (b) the parties “confirm and acknowledge that no representations, inducements, promises, agreements or warranties” have been made that are not embodied in the Agreement, and (c) the parties also confirm and acknowledge that they “have not executed this Agreement in reliance on any such representation, inducement, promise, deed or warranty”. The defendant also points out that the plaintiff was represented by solicitors at the time the Agreement was entered into.

11     Although the defendant is correct to say that the text of the Agreement may present a formidable obstacle to the plaintiff’s claim, I took the view that the plaintiff had at least a good arguable case in the action. I thought that it was very important to consider the context behind the Agreement. The plaintiff had pending in DC 2077 a claim of $200,000 against the estate of the Deceased. Given that Li and her co-administrator had in resisting that claim characterised the sum of $200,000 as a gift rather than a loan I thought it could not seriously be disputed that the plaintiff had in fact paid that sum to the Deceased. It is not disputed that after the Agreement was entered into the plaintiff discontinued DC 2077 and thereby gave up his claim to that $200,000 or indeed to any other sum. On the defendant’s case the Agreement required the plaintiff to make substantial payments to the Administrator and toward the Flat in exchange for nothing more than the right to appoint a nominee to carry out the sale of the Flat. It seemed to me that it would take a person of incredible irrationality to give up a sizeable claim on the basis of such a bargain, and I thought it quite improbable that the plaintiff or anyone for that matter could have behaved so irrationally. This being so I thought it at least arguable that the defendant’s case was not to be preferred to the plaintiff’s and that the Agreement did not in fact embody the true accord between the plaintiff and Li and so should be rectified or interpreted in a manner that reflects that accord.

## Whether there is a real risk of dissipation of assets

12     Turning then to the issue of whether there was a real risk that the defendant would dissipate the assets of the estate of the Deceased, what troubled me most was that the defendant did not in my view have a good reason for assuming control of the process of selling the Flat by revoking the power of attorney that Li had granted in favour of the plaintiff’s son. As set out above the explanation advanced by the defendant in correspondence between solicitors was that he suspected that the plaintiff had helped Li to breach her fiduciary duties and so could not “in good conscience and in discharge of his duties as administrator” permit the plaintiff’s son to retain power over the Flat. And at the hearing before me counsel for the defendant submitted that as administrator the defendant had a positive duty to deal with the assets of the estate of the Deceased and so there was nothing untoward about him taking over conduct of the sale of the Flat. But these explanations failed to convince because it appeared to me that the Agreement did not permit this unilateral course of revocation that the defendant took.

13     The terms of the Agreement patently required that the plaintiff’s nominee have “sole conduct of the sale of the Flat” and envisaged that the Administrator would execute a power of attorney in favour of the plaintiff’s son. The defendant has not suggested that the Agreement is of nil effect. On the contrary he has asserted in his pleadings that the Agreement is valid and binds the plaintiff. This being the defendant’s position I considered that he must accept that the Agreement is equally binding on him as the Administrator. Although an administrator ordinarily has power to deal with the assets of the estate I thought it clear that he is duty-bound also to comply with any contractual obligations that he or his predecessors might have taken on. In sum, although the defendant denied in his pleadings that the revocation of the power of attorney was a breach of the Agreement, I was unable to understand how that denial could possibly be justified.

14     It seemed to me that an honest administrator harbouring genuine concerns about the propriety of the accord between Li and the plaintiff would do one of two things. Either he would take the position that the Agreement is void and does not bind him and the plaintiff such that the plaintiff has an uncompromised and outstanding claim for $200,000 against the estate (albeit one that might be time-barred) that he is free to pursue, or he would accept that he was bound under the Agreement to leave it to the plaintiff’s nominee to carry out the sale of the Flat. The defendant has done neither of those things. He has instead insisted that the plaintiff has by entering into the Agreement wholly given up any claim to the $200,000 while asserting in the same breath a right to disregard the requirement in the Agreement that the plaintiff’s nominee have conduct of the sale of the Flat. Now it may be that the defendant truly believes that the Agreement was fraudulently reached and should be avoided and in seeking to hold the plaintiff to its express terms is guilty of nothing more than disingenuous opportunism that does not suggest a risk of dissipating assets. But it remains to my mind a distinct possibility that the defendant’s eagerness to seize control of the sale of the Flat is motivated by a desire to have in hand the sale proceeds in order that he might make use of them on his terms. I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that in revoking the power of attorney the defendant demonstrated a readiness to act in breach of his legal obligations, and that this rendered dubious any assurance by the defendant that there is no danger in his having possession of the proceeds from the sale of the Flat because he can be trusted to deal with the proceeds in accordance with the duties that the law imposes on administrators.

15     I also considered it material that the defendant was not forthcoming in responding to the plaintiff’s queries concerning the sale of the Flat after it had been sold. In a letter dated 20 August 2019 the plaintiff’s solicitors asked for “relevant information pertaining to the sale” including the sale price and the names of the purchasers. The plaintiff’s solicitors also asked that the defendant (a) confirm “that the sale proceeds of the Flat have been retained by the estate”, (b) “identify the bank account(s) where the sale proceeds are currently being held”, and (c) undertake that the sale proceeds “will remain in the said account(s) pending the final resolution” of this action. In their reply dated 23 August 2019 the defendant’s solicitors pointed out that before the plaintiff amended his pleadings in May 2019 it had never been his case that the alleged loan of $200,000 would be repaid from the sale proceeds, and that in the circumstances the defendant had not owed any duty to the plaintiff to “inform him of any intended sale of the Flat” and the plaintiff was “not entitled to the information requested”. The defendant added that he was “unable” to provide the plaintiff with any undertaking.

16     I did not think that the defendant’s response was satisfactory. While it is true that prior to amendment the plaintiff did not plead that he stood under the Agreement to receive $200,000 from the sale proceeds, the fact is that he now pleads precisely that, and I could not see how his pre-amendment position bore any relevance to his present entitlement to information. More crucially, the defendant did not offer any good reason why he could not or would not furnish the confirmations and undertakings sought by the plaintiff. I thought that the plaintiff’s requests were reasonable ones to make given that he was a potential creditor of the estate of the Deceased. It seemed to me that while the plaintiff’s claim remained unresolved an honest administrator in the defendant’s position owing duties to creditors and beneficiaries ought not to make payment out of the assets of the estate, save perhaps for expenses necessarily incurred in the administration of the estate and provided perhaps that the plaintiff’s claim was not taking an unreasonably long time to be resolved. Hence it seemed to me that an honest administrator in the defendant’s position should not have difficulty furnishing the information and assurances sought by the plaintiff in relation to the retention of the sale proceeds by the estate, subject perhaps to suitable exceptions or qualifications or caveats. Although the defendant’s reticence in this regard might plausibly be cast as merely an instance of a legitimately aggressive approach to litigation that yields the least possible ground to an opponent, given what I saw as his ill-explained anxiety to take control of the sale of the Flat I thought it a substantial possibility that he was either unable to confirm that the sale proceeds had been retained by the estate or unwilling to guarantee that the proceeds would be retained by the estate while the plaintiff’s action awaited resolution, or both. In other words I thought that there was a real risk that the defendant either had already disposed of or dissipated assets of the estate or was not prepared to commit to preserving those assets while this action awaited resolution, or both.

## Conclusion

17     For the reasons set out above I was satisfied that the plaintiff had a good arguable case in this action and that there was a real risk that the defendant would in his capacity as sole administrator of the estate of the Deceased dispose of or dissipate the assets of the estate. I therefore thought it right to grant the injunction sought by the plaintiff in substantially the terms of the draft order that had been prepared.
