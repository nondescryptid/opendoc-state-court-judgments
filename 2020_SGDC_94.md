Tort ― Defamation – Justification

3 April 2020

### District Judge Lynette Yap:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is a general surgeon in private practice, practising at Julian Ong Endoscopy & Surgery. The defendant was a business development manager at Thomson Medical Centre. While she was married, she began an extra-marital relationship with the plaintiff’s friend, Dr Chan Herng Nieng (“Dr Chan”), a senior consultant psychiatrist at Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) sometime in January 2017.

2       The relationship between the defendant and Dr Chan was generally smooth sailing until 22 April 2018, during the defendant and Dr Chan’s vacation to Eastern Europe, when the defendant accessed Dr Chan’s handphone and took photographs of various WhatsApp Messages between the plaintiff and Dr Chan (the “WhatsApp Messages”). The relationship between the defendant and Dr Chan started to deteriorate and their relationship ended sometime around 29 May 2018[^1].

3       On 19 June 2018, the defendant submitted a complaint against Dr Chan and the plaintiff to the Singapore Medical Council (the “SMC Complaint”)[^2]. On 19, 23 and 25 June 2018, the defendant sent separate individually addressed e-mails to a number of doctors, largely Dr Chan’s colleagues, department heads and the management at SGH as well as 2 doctors in private practice. The e-mails were entitled “Complaint against Dr Chan Herng Nieng for Professional Misconduct” and were prefaced by the following words: “Please take this as a formal notification that I have made an official complaint to the Singapore Medical Council against Dr Chan Herng Nieng for his professional misconduct. I believe SMC will be conducting an investigation very shortly”. The e-mails attached the SMC Complaint.

4       The plaintiff’s pleaded case in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) was based on the following words that were contained within the SMC Complaint (the “Offending Words”):

> (a)     “I found out that he has been colluding with Dr Julian Ong, a surgeon from the private practice to take advantage of other vulnerable woman patients”;

> (b)     “I suspect Dr Chan uses his reputation as a platform, together with Dr Ong to “source” and “groom” the patients turned victims”;

> (c)     “Both doctors exchanged potential patients and colleagues who are deemed to be easily taken advantage to satisfy their immoral desires”.

5       On 4 July 2018, the plaintiff commenced this action in defamation against the defendant. He contended that he had been injured in his reputation and well-being and had suffered distress, embarrassment and hurt to his feelings and sought various reliefs against the defendant.

## The trial

6       The plaintiff and Dr Chan testified for the plaintiff. At the close of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant made a submission of no case to answer. As a result of the defendant’s submission, no evidence was led on her behalf and I expunged her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) from the record.

7       In the defendant’s closing submissions, she contended that the defence of justification applied as a complete defence against the plaintiff’s claim.

## No case to answer submission

8       I will first deal with the implication of the defendant’s no case to answer submission. In _Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wen and another_ \[2009\] 2 SLR 104 (“_Lim Eng Hock Peter”)_, the defendant submitted there was no case to answer. The High Court at \[209\] accepted the defendant’s submission that the test of whether there is no case to answer is whether the plaintiff’s evidence at face value establishes no case in law or whether the evidence led by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that its burden of proof had not been discharged. The High Court reached the decision that the publications were defamatory but the defendants were able to rely on the defence of qualified privilege. It is pertinent to note that the High Court held at \[210\] that a submission of no case to answer did not diminish, in that case, the plaintiff’s burden of proof to establish there was malice on a balance of probability on the totality of the evidence, in respect of the defendants’ pleaded defence of qualified privilege.

9       Similarly, in _TWG Tea Company Pte Ltd v Murjani Manoh Mohan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 117</span>, the High Court held at \[71\], that even if the defendant’s no case to answer submission was dismissed, it did not lead to the automatic result that judgment is entered for the plaintiff. While all the claimant needed to show to overcome the submission of no case to answer was that there was a _prima facie_ case, the Court was still entitled to look at the totality of circumstances, the pleadings and the evidence to determine whether the claimant had truly succeeded on the claim on a balance of probabilities. Therefore, a no case to answer submission may be dismissed and yet the claimant may not succeed in the claim. The High Court went on to find at \[73\] that the defendant would be entitled to rely on evidence adduced by the plaintiff and quoted _Lim Eng Hock Peter_, where the court “considered all the admissible evidence… including the evidence that counsel from the defendants elicited from the plaintiff in the course of cross-examination”.

## My decision

10     For the plaintiff to establish a _prima facie_ case of defamation, the plaintiff must show that: (a) the statement was defamatory in nature; (b) the statement referred to the plaintiff; and (c) the statement was published: see Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, _The Law of Torts in Singapore_ (Second Edition, Academy Publishing, 2016) at \[12.010\].

11     There is no dispute that the Offending Words referred to the plaintiff and that they were published.

#### Natural and Ordinary Meaning of the Offending Words

12     The principles for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in a defamation action were set out by the Court of Appeal in the case of _Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings Ltd_ \[1999\] 3 SLR (R) 465, as follows (at \[53\]):

> “... The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: _Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong_ \[1983-1984\] SLR (R) 745 and _Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew_ (\[50\]). The test is an objective one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. Similarly, the sense in which the words were actually understood by the party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out. The Court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines...”_._

13     Applying the principles in _Microsoft’s_ case, read in the context of the entire passage it was set out, I found the natural and ordinary meanings of the Offending Words to be as follows:

> (a)     Dr Chan colluded with the plaintiff to take advantage of vulnerable female patients;

> (b)     The defendant suspected that the plaintiff and Dr Chan used their position as doctors to source for patients to have sexual activities with; and

> (c)     Both doctors exchanged information about patients and colleagues that they could potentially have sexual activities with.

#### Whether the Words were defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning

14     The test for determining whether statements are defamatory was set out by the Court of Appeal in _Aaron Anne Joseph and others v Cheong Yip Seng and others_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 258</span> (“_Aaron Anne Joseph”_) at \[51\] as follows:

> “….. \[W\]hether words are defamatory must be determined by _an objective test, being whether "the words tend to lower the \[appellants\] in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally"._ ….. We are of the view that these imputations _tend to bring the appellants into public odium and contempt and lower them in the estimation of right thinking members of the society_. In our judgment, the words complained of in the report were defamatory of the appellants.” _(Emphasis added)_

15     Based on the ordinary meaning of the words set out in paragraph 13 above, I found that the Offending Words were defamatory as they tended to lower the Plaintiff’s reputation in the estimation of right-thinking members of society. The defendant is therefore _prima facie_ liable to the plaintiff for defamation, subject to a consideration of any defences. I will next look at the totality of circumstances, the pleadings and the evidence to determine whether the plaintiff has truly succeeded on the claim on a balance of probabilities. The admissible evidence would include the evidence elicited from the plaintiff and Dr Chan while they were on the stand as well as the WhatsApp Messages exchanged between them as the authenticity of the WhatsApp Messages was not in dispute.

## Defence

16     While the defendant had originally pleaded the defences of justification, qualified privilege and/or fair comment, the only defence she relied on in her closing submissions was the defence of justification.

#### Justification

17     The defence of justification is made out if the “substance or gist” of the defamatory material is true (see _Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 52</span>). It is not necessary to prove the truth of every word in the defamatory publication (see _Tan Chor Chuan v Tan Yeow Hiang Kenneth_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 16</span> at \[72\]). As stated in _Gatley_ on _Libel and Slander_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) at \[11.7\]:

> For the purpose of justification, only the substantial truth of the imputation must be proved. _The defendant can rely on the defence of justification if he proves that the main charge, or gist, of the libel is true._ This is an objective requirement: it is the facts as they were, not the facts as they appeared to be to the defendant or some other observer that must be proved. _If the gist of the libel can be proved, then there is no need also to prove peripheral facts that do not add to the sting of the charge_ or introduce any matter that is separately actionable: _it is sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be justified_…Hence, when considering substantial truth it is important to isolate the essential core of the libel and not be distracted by inaccuracies around the edge-however substantial. (_Emphasis added.)_

18     It is also provided in section 8 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed), that the defendant is not required to prove every charge so long as the other unproved charges do not materially injure the plaintiff’s reputation any further

19     The defendant’s plea of justification and the meanings she sought to justify are set out in the pleaded particulars in paragraphs 3, 4 and 11 of her Defence. In essence, the main charge or sting which she needed to justify was that Dr Chan colluded with the plaintiff to take advantage of vulnerable female patients, she suspected they used their position as doctors to source for patients to have sex with, and they exchanged information about these women. If the defendant could prove that this main charge was substantially true, there was no need for her to justify charges which did not add to the sting.

20     Considering all the admissible evidence placed before me, including the evidence that counsel for the defendant elicited from the plaintiff and Dr Chan in the course of cross-examination, I found that the main charge was substantially true for the following reasons:

> (a)     The plaintiff sought to have sexual activities with the defendant, who was for all practical intents and purposes Dr Chan’s patient, even if they were concurrently in a personal relationship. Dr Chan was a psychiatrist and he admitted supplying the defendant with Xanax, a drug which was only available under prescription after diagnosing that she was suffering from anxiety. Dr Chan provided the defendant with Xanax while they remained in a relationship. Knowing the short and long term potential side-effects of this drug, Dr Chan exercised his professional medical judgment and adhered to treatment guidelines when he assessed the suitable dosage and the number of the tablets that she should take[^3]. During cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that he had suggested that they (i.e. Dr Chan, himself, the defendant and another party) have a foursome, naming the defendant specifically as a party he wanted to have group sex with[^4]. The evidence before me therefore showed that the defendant was _de facto_ Dr Chan’s patient and that the plaintiff sought to collude with Dr Chan to have sexual activities with her. Whether the plaintiff ultimately succeeded in having sex with the defendant does not detract from the substance of the sting.

> (b)     The WhatsApp Messages show that the plaintiff forwarded to Dr Chan the contact details of his patient, one K (name redacted), for Dr Chan to try to have sexual activities with her. The relevant exchange between the plaintiff and Dr Chan is reproduced below (picture and name redacted):

![]([2020] SGDC 0094_Image/[2020] SGDC 0094_image1.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0094_Image/[2020] SGDC 0094_image2.png)

After providing his patient’s contact details to Dr Chan, the plaintiff told Dr Chan to “feel free to play your game” and he recommended “a dilatation of her anus after her wounds heal”. In cross-examination, the plaintiff denied that this was a reference to anal sex, and asserted that it was a mere “bad joke”[^5]. I found his explanation incredulous, and find that the plaintiff was in fact making a reference to sexual activities with the patient since the context of these messages show that the plaintiff and Dr Chan were discussing how to meet more women for sex[^6].

The plaintiff and Dr Chan also attempted to explain that “feel free to play your game” referred to Dr Chan making a “low-ball” offer to K for a property transaction. I also do not accept this. The sequence of the messages show that the plaintiff forwarded K’s contact details to Dr Chan after Dr Chan asked the plaintiff if he could ask K out for drinks. The plaintiff’s suggestion that Dr Chan should “feel free to play your game” was also made after the plaintiff had used the word “game” in reference to sexual activities. The WhatsApp Messages therefore clearly show that that Dr Chan sought to collude with the plaintiff to take advantage of the plaintiff’s female patient K, and that the plaintiff had forwarded her contact details to Dr Chan, and encouraged Dr Chan to try to have sexual activities with her.

> (c)     The plaintiff and Dr Chan looked for women to have sex with as follows:

>> (i)       The plaintiff introduced women he was having sexual activities with to Dr Chan for him to do the same. The plaintiff shared naked photos of one E (name redacted) with Dr Chan, describing her breasts and saying he was giving Dr Chan a “preview” [^7]. Dr Chan later admitted that the plaintiff had in fact introduced E to him[^8] and Dr Chan did go on to have sex with her[^9].

>> (ii)       During cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that he and Dr Chan wanted to increase their sexual activities[^10]. The plaintiff expressly told Dr Chan “But we need to meet more of these sluts leh”. He told Dr Chan to step up efforts to connect him with more women to have sex with, stating “Have to say you haven’t provided many recently bro”. He criticised Dr Chan for Dr Chan’s recent failure to provide enough women for them to have sex with and told Dr Chan to work harder to look for women for sexual activities, stating Dr Chan “better buck the fuck up”[^11].

>> (iii)       When Dr Chan was unable to join the plaintiff for an activity on one occasion, he told the plaintiff to keep the contacts of these women for Dr Chan so that he could try to have sex with them. Dr Chan stated, “keep their contacts for me can”, and explained that sex was “never enuff for (him)”, he was “just horny”, he “need(s) new chicks also” and he “was doing 7 to 8 a day over the weekend”. Instead of refusing to assist Dr Chan, the plaintiff encouraged him, saying “heheh enjoy your fuck”, Dr Chan was “a grade AAA fucker” and that the plaintiff was also “just horny” [^12].

>> (iv)       When Dr Chan told the plaintiff that Dr Chan could join him in a threesome sex activity, the plaintiff asked him to look for a woman who they could have sex with. He stated “is there anyone you can ask who will come tonight?[^13]” Dr Chan admitted during cross-examination that Dr Chan was asking him for somebody to bring to a sex party[^14].

> The WhatsApp Messages clearly show that the plaintiff and Dr Chan colluded with each other to look for women to have sex. There is undisputed evidence that at least the defendant and K (name redacted) were two patients whom Dr Chan and the plaintiff colluded to try to take advantage of. Taken as a whole, the WhatsApp Messages concerning the defendant, K, and other women, reinforced my finding that the main charge of the Offending Words is substantially true, that Dr Chan colluded with the plaintiff to take advantage of the defendant and at least one other female patient (K) and had passed information about these women to each other.

21     Plaintiff’s counsel sought to argue that there was no proof that the patients that Dr Chan and the plaintiff sought to have sex with were “vulnerable”. I rejected this argument. The relationship between doctor and patient is necessarily one of trust. I note in particular that Dr Chan is a psychiatrist, whose practice involves patients with mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression, where a high level of trust between doctor and patient is required. To be clear, it is this court’s view that _any_ doctor who seeks to have sex with his patient or pass a patient to another doctor to have sex with that patient, is interacting with a vulnerable person vis-à-vis that doctor.

22     In _Singapore Medical Council v Dr Lee Siew Boon Winston_ \[2018\] SMCDT 4, the Disciplinary Tribunal stated at \[55\] that its review of the cases and ethical guidelines in Singapore, UK and Australia put it beyond doubt that trust is the foundation of a doctor-patient relationship. The Disciplinary Tribunal further stated at \[57\] that maintaining proper sexual boundaries is crucial to upholding the trust that patients and the community repose in doctors and cited the 2016 edition of SMC’s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines:

> **C4**.     **Propriety and sexual boundaries**

> In order to uphold the trust that patients and the community repose in doctors, it is critical that you maintain propriety and observe appropriate boundaries in your relationships with patients. Having an inappropriate or sexual relationship with patients is unprofessional as it exploits the patient-doctor relationship and may cause profound psychological harm to patients and compromise their medical care…

23     The Disciplinary Tribunal at \[62\] also quoted from section 4 of the Sexual Boundaries Guidelines produced by the Medical Board of Australia:

> **Power imbalance**

> The doctor-patient relationship is inherently unequal. The patient is _vulnerable_. In many clinical situations, the patient may depend emotionally on the doctor. It is an abuse of this _power imbalance_ for a doctor to enter in to a sexual relationship with a patient. (_Emphasis added.)_

24     The above would be sufficient to justify the sting of the Offending Words. However, for completeness, I will add that the facts as proved further demonstrated that the plaintiff and Dr Chan did indeed exchange information about colleagues they could potentially have sexual activities with, as follows:

> (a)     The plaintiff told Dr Chan he had sex with a married nurse with whom he was previously colleagues in SGH on her husband’s bed[^15];

> (b)     The plaintiff alerted Dr Chan that a female colleague of Dr Chan, Dr P (name redacted) had said she was not comfortable with Dr Chan touching her[^16];

> (c)     The plaintiff discussed a psychologist that Dr Chan wanted to have sex with but Dr Chan told the plaintiff to have sex with her instead, saying “so you can fuck her while I fuck whoever you bring. At least we both try someone new”[^17]; and

> (d)     The plaintiff also discussed with Dr Chan how another colleague of Dr Chan, one G (name redacted) was upset with Dr Chan as she suspected Dr Chan was seeing someone else at the same time he was having sex with her[^18].

25     On the totality of the evidence before the Court, the particulars of justification pleaded by the defendant as proved were sufficient to justify the sting and the defendant has made out the defence of justification.

## Conclusion

26     In the circumstances, the plaintiff therefore fails in his claim against the defendant. His action is dismissed with costs and disbursements to be agreed or taxed.
