Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Disposal of Property – Section 370 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9211/2021/01.\]

18 October 2021

### District Judge A Sangeetha:

## Introduction

1       A Disposal Inquiry (“DI”) was commenced pursuant to Section 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to determine the disposal of one Rolex Oyster watch bearing serial number R374332 (“Watch”) which was seized by the police on 16 October 2020.

2       There were two claimants in this DI, namely Mr Lim Tee Guan (“Mr Lim”) and Mr Teo Yan Kee (“Mr Teo”). At the end of the DI, I ordered the return of the Watch to Mr Teo (“DI Order”).

3       Dissatisfied, Mr Lim filed a Magistrate’s Appeal against the DI Order. The reasons for my decision are set out below.

## Undisputed facts

4       In the following paragraphs, I have summarised the pertinent undisputed facts from the DI Report dated 18 August 2021 which was prepared by Investigation Officer Sgt Teo Min Min (“DI Report”).

5       On 22 December 2013, Mr Lim discovered the loss of the Watch which he had purchased in 1998. His searches to locate the Watch were futile. Subsequently, Mr Lim reported the loss to the Police and Rolex HQ.

6       On 6 July 2014, the Watch was sold to Peng Kwee Watches and Jewellery Pte Ltd (“Peng Kwee”), a second-hand dealer shop, by a foreigner (“Seller”). Peng Kwee purchased the watch from the Seller after carrying out screenings on the Watch and the results did not reveal that the Watch was a stolen item. Peng Kwee then put the Watch up for sale.

7       On 7 December 2014, Mr Teo purchased the Watch from Peng Kwee at $22,800 without knowing that the Watch was a lost item.

8       About six years later, Mr Teo brought the Watch to Rolex HQ for servicing. As the Watch was reported as stolen in Rolex HQ’s system, the police were called in and the Watch was seized.

9       Police investigations revealed that the Seller had left Singapore. Necessary action, such as tracing of the Seller’s whereabouts, was taken by the Police. Upon completion of investigations, no further action was taken against Mr Teo. Given that Mr Lim and Mr Teo were laying competing claims on the Watch, a DI had to be convened.

## Preliminary issue: Appropriate course of action to challenge the DI Order

10     The preliminary issue concerned the appropriate course of action to challenge the DI Order.

11     As disposal inquiries are not a criminal case or matter, there was no right of appeal against the orders made pursuant to a disposal inquiry: see _Sofjan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1970\] 2 MLJ 272</span>. A similar position was adopted by the High Court in _Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan s/o Gopanaidu_ \[1994\] 2 SLR (R) 113 (“_Thai Chong Pawnshop_”) at \[12\]. Aggrieved parties may wish to petition for revision if there was a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice.

12     In the present case, Mr Lee had, through his solicitors, lodged an appeal instead of a petition for revision against the DI Order. Notwithstanding this, I considered this as an application to the High Court to exercise its powers of revision under s 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). As enunciated by the High Court in _Magnum Finance Bhd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 159</span> (“_Magnum Finance_”) at \[4\], the High Court can regularise this technical irregularity by exercising its powers of revision in this case.

13     It is trite law that the High Court would only exercise its revisionary powers if it is shown that there are fundamental errors of law which have occasioned a clear failure of justice: _Magnum Finance_ at \[4\]. In other words, Mr Lim must demonstrate that, in making the DI Order, I had made an error which resulted in material and serious injustice.

## Governing principles

14     A disposal inquiry is not a means to resolve conclusively a dispute over title where there are factual disputes giving rise to competing claims. This is because the court conducting the disposal inquiry lacked the procedures available in civil process to decide between the competing claims and applies a “rough and ready” approach to make an award to the party that it thinks has the better right to possession: _Public Prosecutor v Intra Group (Holdings) Co Inc_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 154</span> at \[12\].

15     As set out in the case of _Thai Chong Pawnshop_ at \[5\], a disposal inquiry is intended to be an inexpensive and expeditious manner of distributing items and the width of the judge’s discretion underlines this intention. A judge presiding over disposal inquiries is given broad powers and a fair measure of discretion to make orders. A disposal inquiry is not conclusive as to title and parties are not foreclosed from commencing civil suit to assert their rights.

16     The High Court in _Sim Cheng Ho and another v Lee Eng Soon_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 190</span> at \[9\] held that in exercising its discretion to determine who was entitled to possession, the Court must look at the facts of the case. This position was reaffirmed in _Wang Wang Pawnshop Pte Ltd v K J Tiffany_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 222</span> at \[9\].

## My decision

17     In the present case, the State took no position on who the Watch should be returned to. In the premises, I gave Mr Lim and Mr Teo an opportunity to consider whether they wished to negotiate an amicable settlement. However, no settlement was achieved between parties.

18     Both Mr Lim and Mr Teo understood and accepted the contents of the DI Report in full. Both informed me that they did not wish to place any further evidence before the court. No witnesses were called at the DI. When Mr Lim and Mr Teo were invited to submit on why the Watch should be returned to each of them respectively, both informed me that the Watch had sentimental value.

19     Given that there were no factual disputes and no additional evidence, I proceeded to consider this case based on the contents of the DI Report and the submissions made by parties.

20     This was a case where Mr Lim, who had _lost_ the Watch, appeared in court eight years later to lay a claim for its return. It was undisputed that Mr Lim was dispossessed of the Watch because he had lost it, and not due to any criminal act by any party. At no time did he lead any evidence, such as the circumstances leading up to the loss of the Watch and when he had made the police report.

21     With this background in mind, I considered the sale transaction between the Seller and Peng Kwee. Having been satisfied that the Watch was not stolen property, Peng Kwee purchased the Watch from the Seller. At no time did Mr Lim raise any issues on the screening process carried out by Peng Kwee. Neither was there any suggestion by Mr Lim or evidence before this court to show that the sale between the Seller and Peng Kwee was tainted by criminal activity. Seen in this light, I found nothing irregular about the sale of the Watch to Peng Kwee and found that Peng Kwee was a _bona fide_ purchaser of the Watch.

22     Some five months later, Peng Kwee then sold the Watch to Mr Teo. To me, this was a regular business transaction involving a willing buyer and willing seller. There was no evidence before this court to show that Peng Kwee or Mr Teo were part of any criminal activity concerning the Watch. In fact, it was undisputed that Mr Teo did not even know that the Watch was lost property. To my mind, Mr Tan was a _bona fide_ purchaser who parted with good money for the Watch. In the circumstances, I found that Mr Teo was the rightful legal owner and person entitled to possession of the Watch. Accordingly, I made an order in his favour.

## Conclusion

23     On the undisputed facts before me, I ordered that the Watch be returned to Mr Teo as he was the rightful legal owner and person entitled to possession.
