Criminal Law – Offences – Hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9080/2020/01.\]

30 June 2020

### District Judge Prem Raj Prabakaran:

## Introduction

1       Mohammad Nurshahid bin Ahmad (“Shahid”) claimed trial to a charge for voluntarily causing hurt, an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The Prosecution averred he had punched one Muhammad Shahdam bin Junabi (“the Complainant”) “on \[the\] mouth once”. This allegedly happened on 16 February 2017 “at or about 3:42 a.m., along the pavement at No. 1 Bayfront Avenue, Marina Bay Sands” (“the Pavement”).

2       Shahid was part of a group of eight (“the Group”) that met in the evening of 15 February 2017. The Group comprised five males and three females. Sometime in the early morning of 16 February 2017, at least two males from the Group assaulted the Complainant, repeatedly, after he swore and spat at them (“the initial assault”). Among other things, the Complainant was punched and kicked several times in his face and head. The identities of two of these assailants was not disputed. But, it was the Complainant’s evidence that at least one other male was involved in this initial assault. The identity of this third male was never established during the trial. That said, the Prosecution accepted, at trial, that Shahid was never involved in this initial assault.

3       The initial assault was not a fleeing one. It endured from the Pavement to the middle of the road. It ended only when Shahid and some others from the Group intervened. It was common ground between the Prosecution and the Defence that Shahid was the “last and only person” from the Group to help the Complainant (who was lying on the road) to his feet after the initial assault. Weighing at about 125kg, the Complainant was more than two times Shahid’s weight.[^1] It was also common ground that Shahid told the Complainant to leave the area, and the Complainant thanked Shahid for helping him up. That said, it was the Prosecution’s case that the Complainant then directed a supposedly provocative remark at Shahid (which referred to a fictitious gangster). This remark purportedly “caused \[Shahid\] to snap”[^2], and he punched the Complainant “on \[the\] mouth once” (“the alleged punch”).

4       I acquitted Shahid after a seven-day trial, in which three different versions as to the alleged punch emerged from the Complainant. In examination-in-chief and cross-examination in the first tranche of the trial (“the first tranche”), the Complainant said the person who had helped him up following the initial assault _also_ punched him in the mouth after his supposedly provocative remark. But, he recanted his evidence when the Defence resumed its cross-examination in the second tranche of the trial (“the second tranche”).[^3] This change in evidence led to the Prosecution cross-examining him on his three previous investigation statements. It did so with the intention of persuading the court to substitute his now unfavourable testimony with his statements (which it averred were inconsistent with his second tranche testimony, but consistent with his first tranche testimony). The first of these statements was recorded a mere two hours after the initial assault. It was also the most detailed of the Complainant’s statements. But, it was _also_ inconsistent with the Complainant’s first tranche testimony – for it implicated one of the males involved in the initial assault as having thrown the alleged punch (_viz._, not Shahid, who the Prosecution accepted, at trial, was never involved in the initial assault). There were also other inconsistencies in the Complainant’s first tranche testimony, and gaps in the case advanced by the Prosecution. Reasonable doubt arose within the Prosecution’s case, and on the totality of the evidence.

## Scope of these grounds

5       I delivered brief grounds when acquitting Shahid, and indicated I would provide detailed grounds if the need arose. The Public Prosecutor has since appealed the order of acquittal. I therefore set out my detailed grounds.

6       In explaining the change in his evidence, the Complainant made certain claims against the trial prosecutor (“the APP”) and the Investigation Officer (“the IO”). These claims related to their conduct during the three pre-trial witness preparation sessions they had with him. The first two of these sessions were held on 15 August 2018 and 10 September 2018. The third session was conducted on 24 September 2018 – one day before the Complainant testified in court.[^4] The Complainant’s claims led to another prosecutor (“the DPP”) appearing in place of the APP, to clarify the nature of these claims. The Prosecution did not dispute that the APP and/or the IO conducted themselves in the manner described by the Complainant. That said, the Complainant testified that the APP did not tell him to lie.[^5] But, the Defence argued that the conduct of the APP and/or the IO had the effect of leading the Complainant to internalise certain points. As such, it submitted that it would be “perilous to give any weight to \[the Complainant’s testimony in\] the first tranche”.[^6]

7       The “simple principle” in witness preparation is that “the witness’s evidence must remain his own” (_Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compania De Navegacion Palomar, SA and others and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 894</span> (“_Ernest Ferdinand_”) at \[136\]). In _Ernest Ferdinand_, the Court of Appeal observed that “at least three rules” flowed from this principle. The third rule relates to group preparation or training of witnesses, and is inapplicable in this case. The court’s observations on the remaining two rules appear below:

> 137     **From this simple principle \[that a witness’s evidence must remain his own\], at least three rules follow, the breach of which** **_may_** **– depending on all the circumstances – lead the court to accord less weight (or even no weight) to the resulting testimony. We emphasise that these are rules of thumb and not to be applied mechanistically. The ultimate question is still whether the preparation has compromised the fundamental principle that the witness’s evidence must be his own independent testimony.**

> 138    First, and most obviously, the solicitor in preparing (not _coaching_ or _training_) the witness must not allow other persons – including the solicitor – to _actually supplant or supplement_ the witness’s own evidence.

> 139     **Secondly, even if the first rule is observed, the preparation should not be too lengthy or repetitive.** As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal observed in _HKSAR v Tse Tat Fung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] HKCA 156</span> at \[73\]…, the court must guard against “repetitive ‘drilling’ of a witness to a degree where his true recollection of events is supplanted by another version suggested to him by an interviewer or other party”. **Even if no one ever** **_tells_** **the witness to change his evidence, the exercise by its nature carries an inherent danger. Over time, oblique comments, non-verbal cues, and the general shape of the questioning (especially when reiterated) may** **_influence_** **the witness to adopt answers which he does not believe to be the truth, but which he has surmised would be more favourable to his case. Indeed, a witness may even come to convince himself, quite sincerely, that the more favourable answer is the true one.**

> \[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold\]

8       In coming to my decision to acquit Shahid, I had _assumed_ that the Complainant’s evidence in the first tranche was his own independent, unvarnished, and uncontaminated testimony. I did not, therefore, accord less weight to it on account of his claims about his witness preparation sessions with the APP and/or the IO. There was ultimately no need for me to delve into whether the Complainant’s testimony in the first tranche had been contaminated by these witness preparation sessions. This was because the case advanced by the Prosecution was already, on its own, so fraught with inconsistencies. A finding that the Complainant’s testimony in the first tranche was contaminated by these witness preparation sessions would only have weakened the Prosecution’s case further and bolstered the grounds for acquitting Shahid.

## Facts that were not disputed

9       Many aspects of the evidence adduced before the court were not disputed during the trial. These aspects are set out in this section.

### Events on 15-16 February 2017

10     The Group comprised eight persons – five males and three females:[^7]

11     All eight members of the Group had met in the evening of 15 February 2017 to celebrate Nazrin’s birthday.[^8] A room at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (“the Hotel”) had been booked for this purpose.

12     Shahid had picked his wife up in his lorry on 15 February 2017 after work. They went to pick up Tan, Hazlan, Nazrin, and “Sadik” thereafter.[^9] The party of six travelled to the Hotel, where they met Nazrin’s wife and Tan’s wife. The Group then went up to the room that had been booked. In the room, the Group eventually decided to go to a club. As Shahid was still in his “work clothes”, he returned home with his wife to change his attire. Hazlan followed them as he wanted to borrow a long-sleeved shirt from Shahid.[^10] When the three of them returned to the Hotel, the Group left for a club in Shahid’s lorry. They remained in the club for about an hour before they decided to return to the Hotel in the lorry. After alighting from the lorry, they proceeded to walk back to the Hotel. Along the way, they stopped to smoke near a smoking point along the Pavement.[^11] There was a parapet next to this smoking point. Shahid and his wife smoked at a point along this parapet (**D3-1**). The rest of the Group smoked close to a bin (**D4-1**) to the left of this parapet.[^12]

#### Complainant’s acts of provocation

13     The Complainant did not know anyone in the Group. He walked past, wanting to cross the road next to the Pavement. While walking past, he said, “Peace be upon you” in Arabic. When nobody in the Group responded, he got angry and said, in Malay, “this one confirm not Islam, just don’t mess with the wrong person and take care you guys, goodbye”.[^13] He also directed vulgarities, in Malay, at the Group.[^14] On hearing this, Nazrin and Tan walked up to the Complainant. Nazrin asked him what he had said. The Complainant did not respond. Instead, he spat at Nazrin and Tan.[^15]

#### Nazrin’s & Tan’s involvement in initial assault

14     Incensed, Tan punched the Complainant in his stomach and Nazrin punched the Complainant in his face.[^16] Nazrin then pulled the Complainant to the ground. Nazrin and Tan then assaulted the Complainant by punching and kicking him repeatedly. Their assaults continued even though the Complainant was already lying on the road.[^17]

15     It was the Complainant’s evidence that Nazrin had “pulled \[him\] to the ground”, and that was when he “felt kicks and punches to \[his\] body and \[to his\] head”.[^18] As Nazrin and Tan continued to assault him while he lay on the road, he adopted a foetal position and tried to cover his head with his hands. However, he only managed to cover the back of his head.[^19] He also recalled a hard kick to his forehead, and then repeated kicks to his face and stomach which he tried to block. He said he was also punched in the stomach as he lay on the road.[^20]

#### Shahid intervened to stop assault & helped Complainant up

16     Shahid was not involved in the initial assault on the Complainant, as it endured from the Pavement to the middle of the road.[^21] It was only after Shahid and Hazlan intervened (and with the assistance of Nazrin’s wife and Tan’s wife[^22]) that the initial assault ended.[^23] Katijah had asked Shahid to intervene to stop the initial assault.[^24]

17     Hazlan, Nazrin, and Tan did not give similar accounts as to how the initial assault on the Complainant ended. Neither the Prosecution nor the Defence sought to clarify the differences in their accounts, which are set out below.[^25] That said, it was common ground between the Prosecution and the Defence that Shahid was the “last and only person” from the Group to help the Complainant (who was lying on the road) to his feet after the initial assault.[^26] It was also common ground that Shahid told the Complainant to leave the area, and the Complainant thanked Shahid for helping him up.[^27]

##### (1)   Hazlan’s testimony

18     Hazlan said he stopped Nazrin and Tan from assaulting the Complainant further by “pushing them away” from the Complainant.[^28] Shahid, who was behind him[^29], “went to help \[the Complainant\] to stand up”.[^30] It was Hazlan’s evidence that Shahid had first asked the Complainant to stand up before proceeding to help him up.[^31] According to Hazlan, both of them had also shouted at Nazrin and Tan to stop attacking the Complainant.[^32] Hazlan testified that only he and Shahid had intervened to stop the initial assault on the Complainant.[^33]

19     Hazlan confirmed that Shahid “was the last person and the only person to help the \[Complainant\]” to his feet after the initial assault.[^34] He said he was at the side of the road[^35] when he saw Shahid helping the Complainant until he was “fully stood up”. He then left to join the rest of the Group along the Pavement.[^36] At this time, Nazrin and Tan were already walking towards the parapet.[^37] Hazlan testified that he did not hear the Complainant or Shahid say anything while he was with them on the road.[^38] According to Hazlan, he had turned his back to walk away after he saw Shahid help the Complainant to his feet.[^39] He was therefore not sure if the Complainant or Shahid exchanged any words after he had turned to walk away.[^40]

20     Hazlan testified that the Complainant had walked away after Shahid lifted him to his feet. It was Hazlan’s evidence that after Shahid lifted the Complainant to his feet, the Complainant and Shahid “parted ways” (in “separate directions” or “went apart”) and the Complainant had then “went…straight…\[towards the\] opposite side of the road”.[^41] In re-examination, Hazlan said he was sure that Shahid had not punched the Complainant.[^42]

21     Hazlan said Shahid joined him at the smoking point along the Pavement (**D3-3**) about one to two minutes after he had reached the Pavement.[^43]

##### (2)   Nazrin’s testimony

22     It was Nazrin’s evidence that his wife had pulled him away while he was attacking the Complainant. This was all he could remember. He could not remember if Shahid had pushed him away to stop him from assaulting the Complainant further.[^44] He also could not recall if anybody else in the Group had intervened to stop the initial assault on the Complainant.

23     After his wife had pulled him away, he turned his back for “about 2 to 3 seconds”[^45] and saw Shahid helping the Complainant up.[^46] This was the only thing he saw.[^47] He did not hear any words exchanged between Shahid and the Complainant (or anything else) because he was intoxicated.[^48] He had also walked away after he saw Shahid helping the Complainant up.[^49] He did not know if anything else had then happened behind him.[^50] He did not see where Shahid went after helping the Complainant up. He also did not see where the Complainant went after he had been helped to his feet.[^51] That said, Nazrin testified that Shahid “was the last and only person to lift the \[Complainant\] up” after the initial assault.[^52]

##### (3)   Tan’s testimony

24     It was Tan’s evidence that Shahid had come toward him and Nazrin to stop them from assaulting the Complainant further. Shahid had pulled him away.[^53] Tan’s wife came “after a while” to stop him as well. Nazrin’s wife then came to stop Nazrin. Shahid, Tan’s wife, and Nazrin’s wife were all shouting at him and Nazrin to stop attacking the Complainant.[^54] He and Nazrin then decided to walk away.[^55]

25     As Tan walked away, he turned back for a few seconds and saw Shahid helping the Complainant up.[^56] He also heard Shahid asking the Complainant to stand up while helping him up, and telling the Complainant to leave.[^57] According to Tan, a taxi was coming their way and Shahid wanted to get the Complainant out of its way. He could not remember if the Complainant said anything to Shahid.[^58] He had turned and continued to walk away before the Complainant was able to stand up fully. He did not know if anything else had then happened between the Complainant and Shahid.[^59] This was because he did not look back again after walking away.[^60] He had walked away with Nazrin, Nazrin’s wife, and his wife – leaving the Complainant, Shahid, Katijah, Hazlan, and “Sadik” at the location where Shahid was helping the Complainant up.[^61] Like Hazlan and Nazrin, Tan testified that Shahid was the “final and only person” to help the Complainant up after the initial assault.[^62]

26     It was Tan’s evidence that Hazlan had also been involved in stopping the initial assault on the Complainant. “Sadik”, on the other hand, was not involved in stopping the initial assault. Tan also testified that his wife was with Katijah (on the road) while his wife was trying to stop him from assaulting the Complainant further.[^63]

#### Complainant’s first information report

27     The Complainant crossed the road and boarded a taxi waiting in a queue. He told the driver to drive to where there were more people. In the taxi, he called the police and reported (**P11**) the following at about 3:45am (“the first information report”, henceforth “the FIR”):[^64]

> I GOT BEATEN UP. TWOS GIRLS AND GROUP OF GUYS. ALL MALAYS. ONE BOTAK WEARING GREY SHIRT. ALL DRESSED IN CLUBBING ATTIRE. I THINK THEY HEADING TO \[ROCHOR\][^65] ROAD. THEY KICK ME AT THE ROADSIDE.

28     The taxi-driver drove a short distance to a lobby where there was a security post.[^66] The Complainant then called the police again to provide his exact location.[^67] He waited in the taxi with the driver for the police to arrive. The police arrived within five minutes. He told the police what had happened. When asked if he needed an ambulance to send him to the nearest hospital, he replied in the affirmative. He was thus conveyed to the Singapore General Hospital (“the SGH”) in an ambulance.[^68]

#### Complainant’s medical examination

29     Dr Liew Siew Lee (“Dr Liew”), a Medical Officer attached to the Department of Emergency Medicine at the SGH, examined the Complainant. He also prepared a medical report (**P1**), which was admitted by consent.[^69] Dr Liew was on the Prosecution’s list of witnesses. That said, the Prosecution did not eventually call him and opted to admit his conditioned statement (**P2**) instead. The Defence did not object to the admission of this statement.[^70] Dr Liew’s medical report and conditioned statement were almost identical. The relevant portions from his conditioned statement appear below:

> 2    On 16 February 2017 at about 5.30am, \[the Complainant\] was seen by me at the \[SGH\]…Department of Emergency Medicine…

> 3    The \[Complainant\] informed that he was assaulted by a group of eight to ten unknown people at the roadside at 3.50am on 16 February 2017.[^71]**He was punched over the face for 20 times and kicked over \[the\] face 20 times.**[^72] There was no weapon involved. Post trauma, he complained of pain on \[the\] nose with nose bleed from \[his\] left nostril and pain on \[his\] left forehead and left parietal area with mild giddiness. Otherwise, there \[were\] no other symptoms such as loss of consciousness, vomiting, headache, blurring of vision, chest pain, and shortness of breath, abdominal pain, neck pain, back pain, limb weakness or numbness.

> 4    On examination, \[the Complainant\] was conscious, alert and hemodynamically stable. His Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15. Bilateral pupils were equal and reactive. There was dried blood on \[his\] left nostril, with tenderness on nasal bridge. **On the lips, there was a superficial laceration wound measuring 5mm on left upper lip, \[with\] no active bleeding.** Otherwise, there was no broken tooth. On \[his\] left forehead, there was a hematoma measuring 5cm x 4cm, \[with\] no bleeding noted. There was tenderness on \[his\] left parietal area, no wound or hematoma seen. Otherwise, there was no septal hematoma or periorbital hematoma or hemotympanium or jaw tenderness. Eyes movement were full and no diplopia. Jaw movement was full. There was no tenderness on chest wall or pelvis or midline spine. Neck has full range of movement and no spine tenderness. All four limbs have full range of movement and no neurovascular deficit.

> 5    Facial bone and nasal bone x-ray were performed. X-ray reported as a lucent line projected over the nasal bone is suspicious for a fracture in the context of trauma. No airspace opacity of \[a\]ir-fluid level is seen within the visualised paranasal sinuses.

> 6     **The \[Complainant\] was diagnosed as closed fracture of nasal bone, minor head injury and laceration of lip.**

> 7    \[The Complainant\] was given intramuscular injection of antitetanus toxoid…vaccine and analgesia in \[the\] emergency department. He was not keen for computer tomography scan of brain. Head injury advice given and he was advised to come back to \[the\] emergency department if he experience\[d\] any vomiting or headache or giddiness or slurred speech or blurred vision. **He was discharged on 7.10am on 16 February 2017 with analgesia** and granted medical leave from 16 February 2017 to 22 February 2017. He was referred to Ear Nose Throat…specialist clinic for the nasal bone fracture.[^73]

### Hazlan, Nazrin, & Shahid arrested on 20 February 2017

30     Members of the Group were traced after 16 February 2017. On 20 February 2017, Nazrin, Shahid, and Hazlan were arrested after presenting themselves at the Police Cantonment Centre on the IO’s directions.[^74]

### Shahid’s statement on 21 February 2017

31     Investigation statements were recorded from various members of the Group.[^75] One such statement was recorded from Shahid on 21 February 2017 (**P10**). Shahid did not challenge its admissibility. The Prosecution applied for Shahid’s statement to be admitted into evidence, as part of its case[^76], to rely on the following extract in this statement:[^77]

> After \[Nazrin and Tan\] had walked a distance away, I approached the male Malay subject \[_viz_., the Complainant\] who was seating \[_sic_\] in the middle of the road and spoke to him \[in\] Malay and asked him to go back. I slowly pulled him up and asked him to move away from the road and asked him to go back. He then walked away. .

32     Shahid had also been asked if he recalled his attire on 16 February 2017. He responded as follows:

> I was wearing Maroon long sleeve \[shirt\] with maroon jeans.

> \[emphasis added by underlining\]

### Complainant warned for spitting at Nazrin & Tan

33     Sometime in August 2017, the Attorney-General’s Chambers directed the police to issue a stern warning to the Complainant for spitting at Nazrin and Tan. The warning was issued on or about 6 September 2017.[^78]

### Nazrin & Tan pleaded guilty to role in initial assault

34     For their role in the initial assault on the Complainant, Nazrin and Tan were each charged with voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code. They pleaded guilty, separately, between November 2017 and January 2018. The table below sets out some details relating to their convictions:

## Parties’ case theories

35     It was common ground between the parties that:

> (a)     Shahid was the “last and only person” from the Group to help the Complainant (who was lying on the road) up after the initial assault.

> (b)     Shahid told the Complainant to leave the area, and the Complainant thanked Shahid for helping him up.

36     At trial, the Prosecution also accepted that Shahid was never involved in the initial assault on the Complainant In addition, it accepted that the initial assault “ended when \[Shahid\] intervened”.[^79]

37     It was the Complainant’s evidence that he could not remember the face of the person who had:[^80]

> (a)     helped him up after the initial assault; and/or

> (b)     punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark.

38     The Prosecution’s case at trial was that the person who had punched the Complainant in the mouth after the Complainant uttered the Remark was the _same_ person who had helped him up after the initial assault. Its case was also that this person was Shahid on both instances. In its submissions, the Prosecution described its case in the following terms:[^81]

> In essence, the Prosecution’s case is that \[Shahid\] became enraged and slighted when \[the Complainant\] challenged him with regard to who the biggest gangster was…and \[Shahid\] reacted by throwing a punch at the \[Complainant’s\] mouth area after he had lifted the \[Complainant\] up and…told the \[Complainant\] to move away from the road. \[Shahid\] was thereafter the last, and only person, seen to have walked away from the road. At no point was \[Katijah\] with \[Shahid\] at the material time. Notably, \[Shahid\] did not deny lifting the \[Complainant\] up.

39     As the Complainant could not remember the face of the person who had:

> (a)     helped him up after the initial assault; and/or

> (b)     punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark,

he was therefore not in any position to state that this person was Shahid on either or both of these instances. The Complainant’s inability to do so was clear in court. Shahid had been seated less than five metres away from him in the same courtroom, and had been doing so for more than three hours. Yet, he only realised that the person seated behind counsel was Shahid when he was expressly informed of this during cross-examination.[^82]

40     The Defence described its case in the following terms:[^83]

> After \[Shahid\] helped \[the Complainant\] to his feet, \[Shahid\] told \[the Complainant\] to leave and \[Shahid\] and \[the Complainant\] parted ways. \[Shahid\] did not punch \[the Complainant\] once on his mouth.

41     The Defence therefore agreed that Shahid was the person who had helped the Complainant up after the initial assault. But, it strenuously disputed that Shahid was the person who had punched the Complainant in the mouth after the Complainant uttered the Remark.

42     As the Defence noted, the dispute between the parties was about “what…happened between the time…\[Shahid\]…helped \[the Complainant\] to his feet and before \[the Complainant\] and \[Shahid\] parted ways”.[^84]

## Case for the Prosecution

43     The Prosecution called seven witnesses, including the Complainant – on whom its case hinged. He testified over the course of four days, in two tranches:

44     I set out the Complainant’s evidence in this section. He had given inculpatory testimony in the first tranche. However, he recanted his evidence at the outset of the second tranche on 27 February 2019. While doing so, he also made certain claims about the conduct of the APP and the IO in their pre-trial witness preparation sessions with him. The second tranche proceedings on 28 February 2019 largely involved the DPP clarifying these claims. As I have _assumed_ that the Complainant’s evidence in the first tranche was his own independent testimony,[^86] I shall not delve into the Complainant’s claims about the conduct of the APP and the IO in their pre-trial witness preparation sessions.

### Complainant’s testimony on 25 September 2018

45     The Complainant first testified on 25 September 2018.

#### Evidence-in-chief by APP

46     It was the Complainant’s evidence that he saw “another 2 guys” “run in to give \[him\] kicks and punches”[^87], after he was pulled to the ground by a male with tattoos on his face.[^88] The Prosecution and the Defence agreed that this person was Nazrin.[^89] Apart from Nazrin, the Complainant said he was not able to remember the faces of the others who were involved in the initial assault as it had “happened…fast”.[^90]

47     According to the Complainant, he felt a tap on his shoulder as he lay on the road in pain after the initial assault. He then heard a person tell him, in Malay, to “hurry up and get up”. To “buy time”, he replied he was “very weak” and could not get up as he was still in pain. He also said, “let’s wait for the police”. However, this person then said, “faster get up”. In response, he said, “\[W\]ait. I cannot get up, I still in pain”. On hearing this, the person lifted him to his feet and they saw each other. It was the Complainant’s evidence that he got up because he was in the middle of the road and he felt that this person “wanted to help \[him\] maybe because of traffic coming or what”. He said he was “not sure” if this person was also from the Group.[^91]

48     According to the Complainant, he had an “exchange of words” with this person when he got to his feet. He said he asked this person, in Malay, if he knew “who’s the biggest gangster in the world?” He then followed up by saying it was his “cousin’s brother, ‘Gramy Seow’” (“the Remark”).[^92] The Complainant claimed that this person responded by saying, “Okay, I from Tanjong Rhu” (or “this Tanjong Rhu one”) – and that was when “the first punch landed on \[his\] lip \[and he\] felt pain”.[^93] Nothing else was said. According to the Complainant, “the guy who help\[ed\] \[him\] up…\[gave him\] the final blow…to \[his\] mouth…lip area”. The blow was a “fisted punch” that landed on his “upper lip” and caused him “pain”.[^94] Following this punch, they “disperse\[d\]”. As the Complainant testified, “he go his way, I go my way”.[^95]

49     The Complainant was “not sure” if the person who helped him up was also from the Group. He was also “not sure” of this person’s face (although he had seen him “face to face when…talking to him”). That said, he said he was sure that this person was a male, because of his “attire” and as he had received a reply when they communicated.[^96]

#### Cross-examination by Defence

50     The Complainant was pressed on his evidence that “another 2 guys” had “run in to give \[him\] kicks and punches” after Nazrin had pulled him to the ground.[^97] He initially confirmed that a total of three persons had attacked him during the initial assault. But, he testified immediately after that he was “not sure \[of the\] exact number”. According to the Complainant, this was because he was in a foetal position on the ground “busy…defen\[d\]ing” himself by covering “\[m\]ostly” the back of his head and his “vision \[was\] not on the people who attacked \[him\]”. He remembered how he protected his head because he recalled receiving a “hard kick” to his forehead. He testified that he then felt “more and more” (_ie_, repeated) kicks to his stomach and face from more than one person.[^98]

51     The Complainant then testified, again, that he was “clear that 3 people \[were\] attacking \[him\]” during the initial assault.[^99] In a later part of his testimony, he said he believed that “another 2 guys…joined \[Nazrin\] in the attack”.[^100] He also agreed with the Defence that “2 other guys \[had\] c\[o\]me after \[him\]” after Nazrin had pulled him down, and that “3 people kicked \[him\]”.[^101]

52     The Complainant further testified that the person who helped him up had done so using “his own strength”. It was his evidence that he had remained on ground after this person asked him to get up because he wanted to “buy \[himself\] time” and he was “still in pain” and shock. He said he saw the person who helped him up when he stood up.[^102] He had also said “thank you” to this person when they were facing each other, as this person had helped him up.[^103] He then had an “exchange of word\[s\]” with this person, where he made the Remark. The person responded, “this one…Tanjong Rhu and \[gave him\] a fisted punch to his mouth area”. He said he was not sure which hand was used to punch him. But, he “kn\[e\]w a punch was landed…and \[he\] felt pain”.[^104] According to the Complainant, he believed that “Tanjong Rhu” referred to a secret society. He therefore ran for his safety after he was punched.[^105]

53     The Complainant agreed with the Defence that he was unsure if the person who helped him up was also part of the group that attacked him during the initial assault.[^106] However, he said he was able to remember that this person was clad in a “purple long sleeve…button shirt” with shoes and jeans or pants.[^107] He reiterated that he remembered the colour of this person’s shirt “\[v\]ery clearly”, but he did not remember his face.[^108] He also said he was not able to remember the colour of the pants the person was wearing. That said, it was his evidence that he had informed the IO that these pants were black.[^109]

### Complainant’s testimony on 27 February 2019

54     The Complainant’s cross-examination resumed on 27 February 2019.

#### Change in evidence during cross-examination by Defence

55     The Complainant changed his evidence, materially, when the Defence resumed its cross-examination. This turn occurred at the outset of the second tranche, when the Defence put its case to him. The Complainant maintained he uttered the Remark to the person who had helped him up after the initial assault. But, he testified that this person had _not_ said “Tanjong Rhu” and had _not_ punched him thereafter:[^110] I set out the Complainant’s evidence in this regard:[^111]

> Q:    I put it to you that when the fight first started, the fight was between yourself and \[Nazrin\]. Do you agree or disagree? \[Nazrin\] is the guy with the tattoo on his face that you mentioned earlier.

> A:    Yes, \[Nazrin\] approached me first and he gave the---the first---uh, punch to the stomach.[^112]

> Q:    So, do you agree or disagree?

> A:    I agree to that.

> Q:    When the fight started, \[Shahid\] was not involved in the fight. Do you…agree?

> A:    I agree on that.

> Q:    When \[Shahid\] intervened, he…was trying to stop the fight, do you agree or disagree?

> A:    I---I agreed because, uh, he asked me to stand and he helped me up and he asked me to go away.

> …

> Q:    \[Shahid\] was not confrontational with you at that point in time, agree or disagree?

> A:    I agree on that.

> …

> Q:    Okay, \[Shahid\] helped to carry you up \[after the initial assault ended\], agree or disagree?

> A:    Yah, he---he---I was \[lying on the road in a foetal positon\] and I felt someone, uh, tap my shoulder, “Hey, bro, \[wake up, wake up\]”, \[Shahid\] helped me up and he asked me to go away.

> …

> Q:    Yes. And you said “thank you” to \[Shahid\]?

> A:    Yes, correct.

> Q:    \[Shahid\] told you to leave?

> A:    He asked me to leave the place immediately.

> **Q:**      **…I put it to you that you did not \[make the Remark\] to \[Shahid\], agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **I ag---I mentioned** but I---I put in it in a way that I---I---as in---in the statement a---as reflect, I said, “Who’s the biggest gangster in the world?” So, I said, “He’s my---uh, my cousin brother, Grammy Siaw” as stated in the my statement. Yah.

> **Q:**      **I put it to you that \[Shahid\] never mentioned the words or said anything to the effect of “Tanjong Rhu” to you, you can agree or disagree?**

> **A:**      **Uh, he did not mention to me because it happened so fast, I---I hereby \[say\] he did not mention the word “Tanjong Rhu”.**

> **Q:**      **I put it to you that \[Shahid\] did not punch you thereafter?**

> **A:**      **Yes, I agree on that.**

> Q:    …I put it to you that there was no reason for you to \[make the Remark\], correct?

> A:    Yes, no reason \[but\] because I felt threatened after 1 beated---was beaten up and is---was a big group of people. And they left and I don’t know, my main intention in my mind, they are running up to take some weapon or what, that’s my main intention in my mind. So, that’s where I shouted the word.

> …

> **Q:**      **I put it to you that…\[Shahid\] had not engaged in the fight with you earlier---before the fight had stopped.**

> **A:**      **Sure.**

> Q:    And there was therefore, no reason also for \[Shahid\] to engage in a fight with you thereafter?

> A:    Yes, correct, I agree on that, Your Honour.

> **Q:**      **Now, I put it to you that at no point in time, did \[Shahid\] hit you.**

> **A:**      **(pause – 00:00:26) He did…he did not hit me, Your Honour.**

> **Q:**      **And in particular, I put it to you that at no point in time did \[Shahid\] punch you on your mouth once.**

> **A:**      **Yes, I agree on that, Your Honour.**

> DC:    No further questions, Your Honour.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

56     Counsel’s references to Shahid in his questioning were rather unfortunate. This was because it was the Complainant’s evidence that he could not remember the face of the person who had:[^113]

> (a)     helped him up after the initial assault; and/or

> (b)     punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark.

57     In these circumstances, I took the Complainant’s evidence to be that the person who had helped him up after the initial assault had _not_ punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark.

#### Re-examination by APP

58     Given the Complainant’s change in position[^114], the Prosecution asked him if he was maintaining his evidence in the first tranche. The Complainant said he was not. He also provided a reason for the change in his evidence. He explained that he had “tried to recall everything” in the “gap” of five months between the first tranche and the second tranche. He said he had changed his evidence because he had managed to recall events “from the start and to the end”. I set out the Complainant’s evidence:[^115]

> Q:    Mr Shahdam…last year in September 2018…\[you\] informed the Court that the last person who had helped you out to stand up…was the last person who had punched your mouth area?...Is that still your position?

> **A:**      **Uh, no.**

> Q:    What is now your position then?

> **A:**      **My position is \[this last person\] helped me---and after that, he asked me to quickly get away, and I ran through the taxi stand. That’s all.**

> Q:    Can you explain why you have departed from what you last informed the Court? In the last hearing?

> **A:**      **Because at the time, uh---at the time, there’s a gap from the \[last\] hearing to now, till date, I---I---I tried to recall everything and---and this is what I recall, uh, from the start and to the end.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

59     The Prosecution then drew the Complainant’s attention to the _first_ paragraph of the medical report, where Dr Liew recorded that the Complainant:

> …complained of pain on nose with nose bleed from left nostril and pain on left forehead and left parietal area with mild giddiness…

60     The Prosecution asked the Complainant if Shahid had caused “any of these purported injuries”. This did not seem to be entirely correct, because the Complainant’s injuries were listed in the _fourth_ paragraph of the medical report (_viz_., “closed fracture of nasal bone, minor head injury and laceration of lip”). In any event, it was the Complainant’s evidence that Shahid did not cause _any_ of these injuries because he “saw Shahid \[leave\] the scene without touching \[him\]”. I set out the Complainant’s evidence:[^116]

> Q:    Now, paragraph 1 \[of the medical report\]…you have informed the doctor of the pain on the nose, basically you informed the doctor what you were feeling?

> A:    Yes, definitely.

> Q:    Or the…pain that you…sustained?

> A:    Yah.

> **Q:**      **Okay, purportedly. Now, \[were\] any of these injuries---\[were\] any of these purported injuries caused by \[Shahid\]?**

> **A:**      **No, definitely**, because he was the last one who helped me up and he was the last one to ask me to go away. **And I---I saw he left the scene without touching me.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

61     The Prosecution then applied for a “stand down…to review its position given this \[fresh\] development”.[^117] The proceedings later resumed with the Prosecution asking the Complainant if he had directed the Remark to Shahid specifically. The Complainant testified that he had made the Remark to Shahid specifically as there was nobody else around them:[^118]

> **Q:**      **…Alright, this morning under Cross-Examination, you have...said to this Court that you said “Grammy Siaw” when \[Shahid\] lifted you up? Did you say “Grammy Siaw” to \[Shahid\] or not?**

> **A:**      **When I face to face to him, then I said.**

> **…**

> **Q:**      **Alright. So you did say “Grammy Siaw” to \[Shahid\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes, correct.**

> …

> Q:    Okay. Now for completeness, based on the Court’s records. Here, you have uttered \[the Remark\]. This was a statement that you said to \[Shahid\], yes?

> A:    Yup.

> …

> **Q:**      **I see. And when you \[made the Remark\], it can only be for \[Shahid\] because he was the only one there…who had helped you to get up, is that right?**

> **A:**      **Yah, of course, def---definitely, because he’s alone and I’m aware that he is alone after his group of friends left.**

> **Q:**      **Okay. And just to be very sure that there was no other person apart from you and \[Shahid\] at that time, is it right?**

> **A:**      **Uh, that one, I---uh, within the, uh, parameter around me, the nearest, there’s nobody.**

> Q:    Okay.

> **A:**      **Except for \[Shahid\].**

> **Q:**      **Okay, so just you and \[Shahid\]?**

> **A:**      **Yah, who helped me up.**

> **Q:**      **Okay, and when you made \[the Remark\], there was no other people apart from just you and \[Shahid\], correct?**

> **A:**      **Yes…correct.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

62     The Prosecution’s references to Shahid in its questioning[^119] was unfortunate (as with counsel’s[^120]), given the Complainant’s evidence that he could not remember the face of the person who had:

> (a)     helped him up after the initial assault; and/or

> (b)     punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark.

63     In these circumstances, I took the Complainant’s evidence to be that he had uttered the Remark to the person who helped him up after the initial assault.

64     It was also the Complainant’s evidence that he heard the person who helped him up after the initial assault say, “Go away because oncoming traffic or vehicle is coming, and for your own safety, please leave.” In response, he said “thank you”. The person who helped him up then also said “thank you” (and not “Tanjong Rhu”):[^121]

> Q:    Alright, Mr Shahdam. I will repeat my question…I was saying earlier that in the morning….of 25th September 2018, you were under Evidence-in-Chief okay? And…this \[was\] my question to you. “So despite you feeling unsure of his face, you know your mouth was being punched?” You answered “yes”. My next question, “By that person?” You replied, “correct”. My further question, “And just to reconfirm that this very same person who lifted you up, this is the same person that threw the punch on your mouth?” You said “Yes, correct”.\[The\] Prosecution went on to ask you whether you have any reason to make false accusation, you said “no”. Do you recall saying this?

> **A:**      **Yes. And….the time gap, I refresh everything A to Z what happened and I remember, he did not touch me. He only lifted me up and he said, “Go away because oncoming traffic or vehicle is coming, and for your own safety, please leave.” And I said “thank you”, and he also said “thank you”. That’s what I recall.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

65     The Prosecution also asked the Complainant if he recalled when his investigation statements were recorded. In response, he testified that his statements were recorded when:

> (a)     he was undergoing treatment for a psychiatric condition at the Institute of Mental Health (“the IMH”); and

> (b)     he was taking an anti-psychotic medication (prescribed by the IMH) for this condition.

66     It was the Complainant’s evidence that the medication he took affected the accuracy of his statements. I discuss the significance of the Complainant’s psychiatric condition and medication later in these grounds.

### Complainant’s testimony on 1 March 2019

67     Having reviewed the Complainant’s evidence during the proceedings on 28 February 2019, it was the Prosecution’s position that the APP could continue prosecuting the trial.[^122] The APP therefore resumed his re-examination.

#### Re-examination by APP

68     The Prosecution raised the Complainant’s investigation statements again.[^123] The Complainant confirmed his statements represented “the truth at that point in time” (_viz_., at the time they were recorded). He also confirmed he was “100% sure” that Shahid “was the last and only person to help \[him\] up”, and that he had directed the Remark at Shahid. That said, he testified that Shahid had then said “thank you” and not “Tanjong Rhu”. It was also his evidence that Shahid had not punched him thereafter. I set out the Complainant’s evidence:[^124]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. I’ll move on. Now, Mr Shahdam, you have also stated that you were very satisfied with the statements which you have given to the police as the truth. Is that yes or no?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, uh, at the point in time I was satisfied, but when I recall back the---the incident, I---as I swear by the oath, I need to tell the truth to the Court of law and to Your Honour. That’s---that’s my final say.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. Sorry, Mr Shahdam, I---I just want to be---I just want to make sure---I’m not the brightest here, okay, but I just want to make sure I understand what you’re saying?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Alright sure.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

What you’re saying is that---is that---earlier I asked you whether you were very satisfied with the statements which you have given to the police as the truth. Can you help me answer that again?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

As in what? Answer what?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay, forgive me, the fault is mine. Maybe I’ll rephrase that. When you \[gave\] statements to the police, you have---in your testimony 2 days ago, you have told this Court that those statements were the truth at that point in time. Can I confirm that?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes---

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

it was the truth and I s---and I---

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

signed by my name on it. If it---it’s not the truth, I won’t sign it, because that’s my statement and it’s under my name. I won’t sign anything if it’s not the truth.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay, thank you. Now you have also confirmed that \[Shahid\] was the last and only person to help you up. Is that correct, Mr Shahdam?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, I’m sure about that---

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. Thank you.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

100%.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay, “100%”. And you are also 100% sure that the \[Remark\] that you \[made\] was directed at \[Shahid\]. Is that correct?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. And you’re also 100% sure, right?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay, thank you. Alright.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

But when the part when---uh, when I put on the statement to the IO, when he shouted Tanjong Rhu, actually I recall back it’s thank you, uh, it’s not Tang---not---not Tanjong Rhu.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Alright. So, you have confirmed a moment ago that \[Shahid\] was the last and only person to help you up. You have also confirmed that the \[Remark\] that you made was directed at \[Shahid\].

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

….So---bear with me, Mr Shahdam. So it is---is it now your shifted position---or rather, is it now your new position that \[Shahid\] did not hit you on your mouth area?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, I---uh, because, uh, at that point of time when I gave my statement and I thought he was---he want to carry me, and he want to wallop me, but actually his intention is to carry me up---he carry me up with his own body weight. How big am I? He carry me up and he said “(speaking in a different language)” and he asked me to move faster.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Can you translate what you just said…into English?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

\[He\] asked me to wake up, wake up and, uh---and he grabbed me by his both hand, be---because I was in a \[foetal\] position…So he gripped me…up, he carry me to stand on my both feet, then he said, “You better get out from her\[e\] be---because scared of oncoming traffic, (speaking in a different language), just go away from here”. And I thought---at that point of time I was angry, that’s where I---said, uh, “You think---uh, do you know who’s the biggest gangster of the---in the world or not?” So I said “Grammy Siaw”, but after that, uh, he---he said, “No”---uh, I don’t know what he said but he never replied at anything. When I about to go, he said “Thank you, uh, for leaving” he---he said, thank you, then I---I also said thank you. That’s all, Your Honour.

69     The Prosecution’s references to Shahid in its questioning was, once again, unfortunate[^125] – given the Complainant’s evidence that he could not remember the face of the person who had:

> (a)     helped him up after the initial assault; and/or

> (b)     punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark.

70     In these circumstances, I took the Complainant’s evidence to be that:

> (a)     the person who had helped him up after the initial assault had said “thank you” and not “Tanjong Rhu”.

> (b)     he was “100% sure” that he had directed the Remark at the person who had helped him up after the initial assault.

#### Cross-examination by APP

71     The Prosecution submitted that the Complainant was “asserting a version that \[was\] materially inconsistent with his statements”, given his “new position that \[Shahid\] did not punch him” after he made the Remark. It thus applied for leave, under s 156 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), to cross-examine the Complainant “on the basis that the \[Complainant, a witness for the Prosecution, had turned\] hostile”. The Prosecution added it was adopting this course of action as it wished to urge the court “to substitute” the Complainant’s “materially inconsistent oral testimony” (in the second tranche) with his three previous investigation statements, pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.[^126]

72     In cross-examination, the Complainant constantly reiterated that Shahid had not punched him.[^127] The Prosecution then applied to cross-examine the Complainant on his previous investigation statements, pursuant to s 147(1) of the Evidence Act.[^128] It also tendered the Complainant’s three statements.

##### (1)   Complainant’s first statement on 16 February 2017

73     The Complainant’s first statement (**P12**) was recorded on 16 February 2017 at the SGH, between 5:55am to 6:50am – before he was discharged later that morning.[^129] The relevant paragraphs from this statement read as follows:

> On 15.2.17 at about 10pm, I left home from Geylang to purchase cough syrup. Thereafter, I consumed a bottle of cough syrup before heading to MBS to meet up with my friends.

> On 16.2.17 at about 2 to 2.45pm. I arrived at MBS Tower One near to Bayfront Ave MRT to meet up with my friends who are working there. My friends is by the name of ICE 87425220, his supervisor whom I do not know the name, Riya, Fast. They all left for work at about 3.20am. They asked me to head opposite towards the floating platform area to relax and wait for them to end work. As I was about to jay walk across the road to the floating platform, a group of about 11 to 12 Malay subjects inclusive of 2 females walked past me from the right, away from the MRT entrance. As they walked past, I said “Peace be upon you” to them in Malay. They did not replied and looked down. Seeing that they did not reply, I said to them “This one confirmed not Islam, just don’t mess with the wrong person and take care you guys, goodbye” in Malay.

> Immediately, I was chased by one of the subjects who is the shortest among all wearing long sleeve of unknown colour and long pants. I also observed a dot in the middle of his two eyebrows \[the Complainant was referring to Nazrin\]. Two other subjects followed him to chase after me. Thereafter, I noticed three other subjects followed by two other subjects.

> All eight subjects stopped me in the middle of the lane by grabbing my bag. This caused me to fall on to the floor. At this juncture, I was then assaulted by all eight of them. I recalled I was assaulted by the short subject who hit me on my face but I managed to block it off. However, the group started to punch on the floor and thereafter, they kicked me seven to nine times. I remember that I was kicked two times on my face, two times at the back of my head. There was also punch on my nose causing it to bleed as well as a kick on my forehead causing it to swell.

> The assault last 10 to 20 minutes and the group eventually stopped I asked one of the male subject in purple shirt who punched me in the nose asked if he knows who is the biggest gangster to which I replied it is my cousin’s brother. I then asked if he knows who is gremy siao. He said “Oh…” and gave me another punch to the mouth. Thereafter he told me to leave but I refused as I wanted CCTV to capture the incident. When I saw a taxi across the road, I went over to board the taxi and called the taxi to drive around as I wanted to look for the subjects. During which, I also called for the Police assistance.

> \[Underlining in original by the Prosecution\]

74     The Prosecution directed the Complainant to the underlined text in this statement, where the Complainant had stated that the person he uttered the Remark to had punched him in the mouth. The Complainant was then reminded of his testimony that he had uttered the Remark to Shahid. Testifying that he did make the Remark to Shahid, the Complainant however reiterated that Shahid had “not punch\[ed\] \[him\] in \[his\] mouth or anywhere around \[his\] facial area.”

75     I set out the Complainant’s testimony on these aspects:[^130]

> Q:    Mr Shahdam…I’ll point you \[to\] the difference \[between your oral testimony and this statement\], if you look at the part which has been underlined in red.

> A:    Which…part?

> Q:    Yah, hold on. Just give me a moment. In which it states that---yah. “I then asked if he knows who is Grammy Siaw. He said, ‘Oh’, and gave me another punch to the mouth.”

> A:    Okay.

> Q:    Okay?

> A:    Then?

> Q:    This is the person that you said Grammy Siaw to.

> A:    Okay, then?

> Q:    Right? Which you have informed the Court \[was Shahid\].

> A:    But, I recall, yes, I said Grammy Siaw to him but he did not punch me in my mouth or anywhere around my facial area. He just tapped me and asked me to go away faster, because there’s incoming traffic or motorist.

> Q:    I see.

> A:    And I turned my back, I said thank you and he shouted “Thank you.”. That’s where I…misunderstood Tanjong Rhu…It’s actually thank you…

##### (2)   Complainant’s second statement on 25 May 2017

76     The Complainant’s second statement (**P13**) was recorded on 25 May 2017. He was asked if he could identify persons from a set of 15 photographs. He was able to identify only one person (_viz_., Nazrin). That said, the Prosecution relied on the Complainant’s reference to the word “last” (in this statement) when he was asked if he had “anything else to add”.

77     The relevant portions of this statement read as follows:

>   
| 

1

 | 

The following questions are posed to me:

 |
| 

**Q1**

 | 

**A set of photographs marked as P1 to P15 is shown to you. Can you identify them?**

 |
| 

A1

 | 

I can only identify P4. He was the one that first confronted me and he was the \[one\] that grabbed the \[strap\] of my sling bag which caused me to lose my balance and I fell onto the road. Then he started to kick me and \[a\] few others joined in to kick me.

 |
| 

A1.1

 | 

I am unable to identify the rest in the photographs.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

**Q3**

 | 

**Do you have anything else to add?**

 |
| 

A3

 | 

As I have mentioned in my previous statement on the person that gave me a _last_ punch at the mouth, he was wearing a purple colour long sleeves shirt. But I am unable to recognise him.

 |

  
  

> \[Underlining in original by the Prosecution; emphasis added in italics\]

78     The Prosecution then asked the Complainant if Shahid had delivered this “last punch”. The Complainant denied this. I set out his evidence:[^131]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay, Mr Shahdam, you have consistently told this Court that \[Shahid\] was the person whom you have made that Grammy Siaw statement to---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

and the person who last \[picked\] you up.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Okay, then?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. Now I have to trouble you to look at that statement…which has been underlined in red, right?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

P13, correct?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

P13, forgive me. It’s at P13. Now, that word, “last punch”…can you see that, Mr Shahdam?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Last punch. Okay, so the word, last” here…in this statement refers to \[Shahid\], is that correct?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Uh, no. Because you know why? As my statement put, I’m am unable to recognise him. Until today, I see him also, I---I don’t know is he him who help me up, yah.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Sure. So my question is not whether you can identify him, but…looking at your P13 statement here…”That the person that gave me a last punch at my mouth”. Here I just wanted to…invite you to explain…the…discrepancy when you say, “last” here in this statement. The word, “last punch”---the word, “last” that you have stated here in this statement, right?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Okay, you see, uh…if there’s was the last punch and I’m able to re---recognise the person, all these photograph, I will pinpoint---I have pinpoint the person already, what, because the person is face-to-face to me. And till today I can’t pinpoint, because I don’t know…who’s the guy is.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. Thank you, Mr Shahdam. Well, unfortunately, my question was not directed at whether you can identify the person by looking at those photographs. My…question simply is to invite you to explain to the Court why…in your oral testimony, you have constantly said, “The last person that I said Grammy Siaw to and the last person that help me up, this is \[Shahid\].” Now, that’s what you said---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

I never…said…\[Shahid\] I don’t even know the person name at that point of time…anything. I did not even said Mr Mohammad Nurshahid or whoever, because I do not know \[his\] name. I did not ever say that and do not put any words into my statement that \[are\] not true.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So is it your position here that the word “last” that you used in this statement---in this particular line, does it or does it not refer to \[Shahid\].

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Uh, no.

 |

  
  

##### (3)   Complainant’s third statement on 17 August 2017

79     The Complainant’s third statement (**P14**) was recorded on 17 August 2017. He was asked if he could “remember the attire of the assailants \[who\] assaulted \[him\] on…16 February 2017”. He responded as follows:

> A1)    The first guy that attacked me wore a black long sleeved t-shirt with jean and shoes. The guy who picked me up and also gave me a punch on my facial area wore a purple shirt with jeans and shoes. The rest of them were wearing t-shirt, jeans and shoes. But I cannot remember the exact colour of the t-shirt as the incident happened quite some time ago.

> \[Underlining in original by the Prosecution\]

80     The Prosecution then asked the Complainant if his reference to the “guy who picked \[him\] up”[^132] in this statement was in fact a reference to Shahid. The Complainant denied this (though he initially had some difficulty understanding the question). He also stated that his medication from the IMH affected his “brain chemistry”; how he reacted, felt, and talked; how he “wrote \[his\] sentence”; and his memory. He again displayed some difficulty following the Prosecution’s subsequent question, before providing a response that did not answer the question at all. I set out the Complainant’s evidence:[^133]

> Q:    Okay. Now expanding this, Mr Shahdam, just again your attention is drawn to the one underlined in red at P14, okay?

> A:    Okay.

> Q:    Now, which you…\[had\] signed and accepted to be true and correct. The guy who picked you up…had also given you a punch on your facial area.

> A:    Which sheet? (flipping of papers) Okay, Uh, sorry? The guy who picked me up?

> Q:    “And also give me a punch on my facial area”. Okay? Now strictly on this sentence alone---

> A:    Oh, okay, I---

> Q:    No, no, I have not come to my question. Just---just hold on. Now can you…help to explain the difference why are you now saying that \[Shahid\] did not hit or punch you on your mouth area?

> \---

> A:    Okay, uh, because, uh, I’m--- I recall everything, uh, when I was kicked on the hip and I was punched by the other group of the---Nazrin and Tan Chun Ming, I was hit by the nose and I was, uh, hit and kicked, so they might cause the---the---the wound on my left---my lips because, uh, \[Shahid\] did not touch me. He just raised me up and asked me, “Hey bro, (speaking in a different language).” Means…“Please go away from here fast, for your own safety”.

> …

> Q:    You…agree that \[Shahid\] was the one who picked you up from the road after you were being assaulted by Nazrin and Tan Chun Ming.

> A:    Yes, correct…He…did not get involved in the fight.

> …

> Q:    Okay. Okay. So Mr Shahdam, we need to be specific with your answer. I’ll say that again, okay? Now, in all 3 statements…that you have given to the police…you had maintained in these 3 statements of yours collectively that you have passed the Grammy Siaw remark and the guy who pick you up, now was wearing a purple shirt, correct?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Okay.

> A:    Uh, okay. I think you don’t really get what I---after all I have explained, nothing goes through your---your head. I’m under quetiapine, the medicine under IMH and it affects my---my che---brain chemistry and how I react and how I feel and how I talk and how I write my sentence and how it affects my memori---my memory. So you can search it up yourself and you can call up the doctor or whatever, you can do so. And anyone in the street can be wearing purple but to me…I know the last person to lift me up, he asked me---

> Q:    Okay. You have said that, Mr Shahdam.

> A:    Huh?

> Q:    Yes, you have explained that…already.

> A:    So that’s it.

> …

> Q:    In \[your\] 3 statements, you have consistently said that a person to whom you have passed the Grammy Siaw remark and the guy who picked you up was wearing a purple shirt.

> A:    Mmm.

> Q:    Based on that 3 statement\[s\] of yours? Is that correct?

> A:    Okay.

> Q:    Is that correct, Mr Shahdam?

> A:    Sorry? What’s the question again? I need to hear the question again, because I guess it’s not cleared---to me, I don’t understand, ‘cause to me you are rushing me like you want---like how to said? You are---want to fish up faster, faster, faster. Can you just slow down and let me digest slowly? You cannot rush everything. I’m a human being. I’m not a machine with a Ferrari engine who just burst, uhuh. I’m a human being. Okay? Please be---

> Q:    Okay. Now, I will speak very slowly for your benefit. Let me know if it’s too slow, okay? Now in all the 3 statements…which you have given to the police, in these 3 statements, you have maintained that the person to whom you have make that Grammy Siaw report and the guy who picked you up was wearing a purple shirt.

> A:    Okay. But when I…saw…the…picture---when I saw the group photo, uh, actually, there’s no guy wearing purple shirt. There’s only maroon shirt only, yah. There’s no guy wearing purple shirt. There’s no guy, yah. Your Honour. So that’s my bottom line, period.

## Case for the Defence

81     Shahid gave evidence in his defence. He also called Katijah as a witness.

### Shahid’s testimony

82     Shahid said he was leaning against Katijah’s leg and smoking at a point along the parapet (**D3-1**)[^134] when he heard Hazlan or “Sadik” shout “fight” in Malay. When he got up, he saw Nazrin and Tan hitting the Complainant somewhere along the middle of the road (**D3-3**).[^135] The Complainant was standing and not lying on the road.[^136]

83     Katijah then asked him to stop Nazrin and Tan from attacking the Complainant. He immediately “proceeded to where they were…and stood between Nazrin and the \[Complainant\] to stop them from fighting further.” He faced Nazrin and told him, “Don’t fight, don’t fight.”[^137] However, “Nazrin kept walking forward because he wanted to hit the \[Complainant and Shahid\] kept backpedalling, and…eventually, the \[Complainant\] fell. After the \[Complainant\] fell, Nazrin and Tan walked away.” He then went to the Complainant (who was on the ground in a “curled up position”), “lifted him up \[from the back\] and told him to go.” After saying “thank you”, the Complainant walked off. He saw the Complainant cross the road and reach the opposite side. He then walked away. He returned to the Hotel with Katijah. He had noticed Katijah standing behind him after he had lifted the Complainant to his feet. He therefore asked her to walk with him, back to the Hotel.[^138]

84     In the room, he asked Nazrin what had happened. Nazrin told him that the Complainant had “used vulgarities against him \[and\] spat at him.” He had not known what triggered the attack on the Complainant before this. According to Shahid, he had lifted the Complainant to his feet because he was lying in the middle of the road and he “couldn’t just leave him there”.[^139]

85     It was Shahid’s evidence that Hazlan and “Sadik” had also been involved in stopping Nazrin and Tan from attacking the Complainant further. Nazrin and Tan were the first to walk away from the middle of the road, followed by Hazlan and “Sadik”.[^140]

86     In cross-examination, Shahid agreed he had helped the Complainant to his feet. But, he denied that the Complainant had uttered the Remark to him after he helped the Complainant up. According to Shahid, the Complainant “’did not say anything \[to him\] except for “thank you”.” He also denied punching the Complainant in his mouth after helping him up.[^141]

### Katijah’s testimony

87     Katijah testified that she heard someone shout “fight” in Malay while Shahid was laying against her as she sat at a point along the parapet (**D3-1**).[^142] She asked Shahid to get off her lap, so they could turn to see what was happening. When she turned, she saw Nazrin and Tan “were fighting with another man \[they\] did not know.” According to Katijah, Hazlan and “Sadik” “were already proceeding to \[the middle of the road\] to stop the fight \[when\] she \[asked Shahid\] to go there to stop the fight.” It was Katijah’s evidence that “Sadik” “walked away” after he saw that “\[the fight\] was getting too messy and that \[it\] could not be stop\[ped\].” As such, only Shahid and Hazlan remained on the road. According to Katijah, she “also approach\[ed\] that area because \[she had\] noticed that they were in the middle of the road.” She said she had not informed Shahid she was following him. He was also not aware she was following him. She did not try to stop the fight because she was pregnant.[^143]

88     It was Katijah’s evidence that Shahid was facing Nazrin and Nazrin kept on walking forward. Shahid therefore had to keep walking backward. At one point in time, the Complainant fell on his buttocks. Nazrin and Tan then walked away. After Nazrin and Tan walked away, Shahid “went to lift the \[Complainant\] from the back and the \[Complainant\] said “thank you” to \[Shahid\]”. Shahid then told the Complainant “to go home”.[^144] After the Complainant walked to the taxi stand on the opposite side of the road, she and Shahid walked back to the Hotel.[^145] They were the last two persons to walk away from the middle of the road.[^146] It was Katijah’s evidence that she never saw Shahid hit or punch the Complainant.[^147]

## Reasons for acquittal

89     I now explain my reasons for acquitting Shahid. I start by reviewing the fundamental rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which rests on the presumption of innocence (_Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”) at \[126\]). I then discuss why I applied the “unusually convincing” standard to the Complainant’s testimony, to assess if the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I end with a further review of the evidence, and explain why the Complainant’s testimony was not “unusually convincing”.

### Prosecution’s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt

90     The Prosecution had to prove Shahid’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This entailed that “upon a consideration of all the evidence presented by the Prosecution and/or the Defence, the evidence must be sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, each and every element of the offence with which \[Shahid was\] charged” (_Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> (“_Jagatheesan_”) at \[48\]). The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that the Prosecution must dispel all conceivable doubts. The “question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts are \[real or reasonable\] that the Prosecution has not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal (_Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[50\]). The Prosecution’s burden of proof was stated in similar terms by Denning J in _Miller v Minister of Pensions_ \[1947\] 2 All ER 372 at 373:

> That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence “of course it is possible but not in the least probable,” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, **but nothing short of that will suffice.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

91     A “reasonable doubt is one for which a reason can be given, so long as the reason given is logically connected to the evidence” (_GCK_ at \[131\]). The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt “mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there is a reason that is, in turn, relatable to and supported by the evidence presented, must be excluded. Reasonable doubt may also arise by virtue of the lack of evidence submitted, when such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt” (_Jagatheesan_ at \[61\]). The “existence of a reasoned doubt is a necessary condition for an acquittal” (_GCK_ at \[131\]).

92     The Prosecution’s legal burden to prove a charge beyond a reasonable doubt is a permanent and enduring burden that does not shift throughout the trial (_GCK_ at \[130\]). As such, “in the context of a criminal trial, a trial court should generally not make a finding that resolves against the accused what would otherwise amount to a vital weakness in the Prosecution’s case when the Prosecution itself has not sought to address that weakness by leading evidence and making submissions to support such a finding” (_Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 1087</span> (“_Mui Jia Jun_”) at \[72\]). The principle that the Prosecution must prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt “implies that it is incumbent on the Prosecution, and not the court, to address any weakness in the evidence that the Prosecution adduces, failing which the Prosecution must accept the consequences that follow for its case against the accused” (_Mui Jia Jun_ at \[76\]). “If indeed gaps in the evidence should prevail so that \[a\] trial judge feels it is necessary to fill them to satisfy himself that the Prosecution’s burden of proof has been met, then the accused simply cannot be found legally guilty” (_Jagatheesan_ at \[59\]).

### Complainant’s testimony had to be “unusually convincing”

93     The Prosecution differed with the Defence as to whether the “unusually convincing” standard should be applied to the Complainant’s testimony, to assess if it had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. That said, it acknowledged – at the same time – that whether “the alleged punch on the \[Complainant’s\] mouth \[happened\] was a matter of one’s word against the other”.[^148] I reproduce the relevant paragraphs in its closing submissions:

> **VI**.     **THE BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF**

> …

> 29    The relevant considerations in determining whether a witness is unusually convincing includes, _inter alia_, whether the complainant’s evidence is internally and externally consistent, as well as the demeanour of the \[complainant\]…

> …

> 32    Applied to the facts of the present case, whilst it is noted that the \[Complainant\] was unable to identify his assailant at the time he was being lifted up saved for the colour of the shirt he was seemingly wearing, the further corroborative evidence available comes from the fact that the witnesses; Tan, Nazrin and Hazlan, had each observed \[Shahid\] to be the last and only person to be seen helping the \[Complainant\] up, a point of which \[Shahid\] did not dispute.

> 33    Significantly, this particular evidence **corroborates on point** with the \[Complainant’s\] recollection, and in particular his recorded statements, that the last and only person who had lifted him up from the road was the same person who had punched his mouth once after he made the \[Remark\].

> …

> 35    In this regard, it is argued that the subsequent complaint made by the \[Complainant\] himself in his recorded statements implicating the last and only person who had lifted him up ought to be seen as corroboration as it was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the offence was committed.

> …

> **VII**.     **THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS**

> …

> 37     **_Whilst the alleged punch on the \[Complainant’s\] mouth was a matter of one’s word against the other_**, it is clear that the \[Complainant’s\] evidence should be preferred over \[Shahid\], as the \[Complainant’s\] evidence during \[the first tranche\] that he had been punched at his mouth once by the last person who had helped him up represent\[s\] a true account of what took place. There is internal consistency to what is contained therein: the story flows naturally. There is corroboration _in toto_ by Nazrin, Tan and Hazlan’s evidence-in-chief, and recorded statements in P10, and P12 to P14.

> \[emphasis in bold and by underlining in original; emphasis added in bold italics\]

94     The Prosecution repeated these submissions in its further submissions:

> 9.    Applying the law to the facts of the case, the Prosecution submits that the basis for the “unusually convincing” standard is that the Prosecution must ultimately prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt…\[The “unusually convincing” standard does not apply in this case because\] \[i\]t is neither one where the \[Complainant’s\] uncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for a conviction, nor does the potential problem relate only to the \[Complainant’s\] inability to identify the person who punched him.

> 10.    The corroborative evidence available in this case comes from the \[Complainant’s\] contemporaneous recorded police statements (exhibits in P10, and P12 to P14[^149]) to which he admits were the truth at the point in time. This testimony alone is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt because the \[Complainant\] had consistently posited \[during his examination-in-chief and cross-examination\] at the \[first tranche\] **that the final punch to his mouth had come from the last and only person who had helped him up from the road, after he had passed the \[Remark\] to \[this person\].**

> 11.    The Prosecution’s _last and only person_ theory is further supported by the reliability of the witnesses\[’\] account, namely, Tan, Nazrin and Hazlan, who had each observed \[Shahid\] to be the _last and only_ person to be seen helping the \[Complainant\] up, a point of which \[Shahid\] steadfastly does not deny. To this end, the \[Complainant\] tacitly acknowledged that the \[Remark\] he uttered to the only person who picked him up at the time was provocative, unnecessary and uncalled for.

> \[emphasis in original\]

95     The Prosecution acknowledged that this case boiled down to the Complainant’s word against Shahid’s.[^150] But, it argued that the “unusually convincing” standard did not apply to the Complainant’s testimony as there was “corroborative evidence” to be found in the:

> (a)     testimony of Hazlan, Nazrin, and Tan, that Shahid was “the last and only person to be seen helping the \[Complainant\] up” after the initial assault; and

> (b)     Complainant’s three investigation statements, where he stated that “the last and only person who had lifted him up…was the same person who had punched his mouth once after he made the \[Remark\].”

96     The “unusually convincing” standard applies to all instances where the uncorroborated testimony of a witness (such as a complainant or an alleged victim) forms the _sole_ basis for convicting an accused (_GCK_ at \[87\] and \[89\]). It is _independent_ of the status of the witness concerned (namely, whether he is an alleged victim, an eyewitness, or a complainant) and applies across _all_ types of offences (_GCK_ at \[89\] and \[99\]). This standard is used to describe a situation where a witness’s testimony is so convincing that the Prosecution’s case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt solely on the basis of that evidence (_GCK_ at \[88\], citing _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Liton_”) at \[38\]). On this note, a witness’s testimony would be “unusually convincing” if that testimony, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth that leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused (_Liton_ at \[39\]). The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’s demeanour as well as the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence (_GCK_ at \[88\]).

97     In a case where no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt “only if it is “unusually convincing” and thereby capable of overcoming any doubts arising from the lack of corroboration and the fact that such evidence will typically be controverted by that of the accused person” (_GCK_ at \[89\], citing _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_AOF_”) at \[111\]).

98     On this note, I was aware that the requirement for strict corroboration in the _Baskerville_ sense has not been followed in local jurisprudence. Instead, our courts adopt a liberal approach to corroboration, focusing instead on the substance, relevance, and confirmatory value of the evidence in question (_GCK_ at \[96\]). The forms of corroboration were discussed in _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> in the following terms:

> 29    It should be noted that the “unusually convincing” standard does not introduce a new burden of proof. It “does nothing … to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but it does suggest how the evidential Gordian knot may be untied if proof is to be found solely from the complainant’s testimony against the accused” (_XP v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[31\], cited in _AOF_ at \[113\]).

> 30     **Where the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, “an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story”** (_AOF_ at \[173\]). In _Liton_ at \[42\] and \[43\], this court discussed the meaning of “corroborative evidence”:

>> 42    As to what can amount to corroborative evidence, the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) did not, at its inception, provide a definition of corroboration and still does not do so. However, by virtue of s 2(2), the common law is imported into the Evidence Act unless it is inconsistent with the Act’s tenor and provisions. **There is thus legal justification for the judicial adoption of the common law definition of corroboration laid down in the oft-cited English decision of** **_R v Baskerville_** **<span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span> at 667**, **_ie_****, independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular.**

>> 43    However, it is clear that **the** **_Baskerville_** **standard** (as set out in the preceding paragraph) **does not apply in its strict form in Singapore since Yong CJ, in** **_Tang Kin Seng_** **\[****_v Public Prosecutor_** **<span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span>\], advocated a liberal approach in determining whether a particular piece of evidence can amount to corroboration.…**

> **This more “liberal approach” to corroboration treats subsequent complaints made by the complainant herself as corroboration provided that “the statement \[implicating\] the \[accused\] was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence”** (_Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span> at 33, cited in _AOF_ at \[173\]).

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

#### No corroborative evidence from Nazrin, Tan, & Hazlan

99     The Prosecution’s position on the evidence of Nazrin, Tan, and Hazlan[^151] was wrong. These witnesses did certainly provide eyewitness testimony that Shahid was the “last and only person” to help the Complainant up after the initial assault.[^152] This was also consistent with Shahid’s statement[^153], as well as the testimonies of Shahid and Katijah.[^154] That said, Nazrin, Tan, and Hazlan did _not_ testify that Shahid had then gone on to punch the Complainant in the mouth. Indeed, their unchallenged evidence was that they did _not_ see Shahid punch the Complainant. Neither did the Prosecution adduce _any_ corroborative evidence from Hazlan, Nazrin, or Tan that implicated Shahid as having assaulted the Complainant (by means of a punch or other means) whether “on \[the\] mouth once” or anywhere else. Nazrin, Tan, and Hazlan did _not_ give any evidence that confirmed in material particulars, not only that the Complainant was punched after the initial assault, but also that it was Shahid who had punched the Complainant. The fact that Shahid was the “last and only person” to help the Complainant up after the initial assault did not _ipso facto_ support the conclusion that it was Shahid who had punched the Complainant “on his mouth once”.

#### Complainant’s statements not independent corroboration

100    The Prosecution’s position on the Complainant’s investigation statements[^155] was also wrong. Subsequent repeated complaints by a complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony (_Public Prosecutor v Wee Teong Boo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 56</span> at \[46\]; _AOF_ at \[114(a)\]; and _XP v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[29\]-\[35\]). This point was in fact made, earlier, in _Khoo Kwoon Hain v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 591</span> (“_Khoo Kwoon Hain_”) – in terms which bear quoting at some length:

> 44    In _Balwant Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1960\] MLJ 264</span>, Rigby J expressed the view that in cases of sexual offences, it is unsafe to convict where there is no independent evidence.

> 45    In _PP v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span>, the same view had been enunciated by Spenser-Wilkinson J. There, he said at 33:

>> Whilst there is no rule of law in this country that in sexual offences the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated; nevertheless it appears to me, as a matter of common sense, to be **unsafe to convict in cases of this kind unless either the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing or there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story. It would be sufficient, in my view, if that corroboration consisted only of a subsequent complaint by the complainant herself provided that the statement implicated the accused and was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence.**

> 46    So far as the complainant’s recent complaints to \[the complainant’s sister, to whom the complainant had told that the accused had molested her\] and the police are concerned, s 159 of the Evidence Act states:

>> **In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness**, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, **relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.**

> 47    Now, **it is not controversial that the complainant’s previous complaint to her sister and the lodging of the police report are technically corroboration, in view of s 159 of the Evidence Act.****However, the fact remains that these are not corroboration byindependent evidence. All the complaints originated from the complainant. They therefore have little additional evidential value.****Otherwise, by the same token, the \[accused’s\] previous denials made to the police are also technically corroboration under s 159 of the Evidence Act.**

> 48    In the classic case of _R v Baskerville_ <span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span>, Lord Reading CJ emphasised that in order for evidence to amount to corroboration, the evidence must be independent of the testimony which is sought to be corroborated. It is clear that had it not been for s 159 of the Evidence Act, a recent complaint cannot be corroboration of the complainant’s testimony. This was so held in _R v Whitehead_ <span class="citation">\[1929\] 1 KB 99</span>. The reason simply is that the complaint originated from the complainant as well, and is not independent.

> 49    The position in Singapore is of course as stated in _PP v Teo Eng Chan_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] SLR(R) 567</span>. Hence, a previous complaint goes beyond the question of consistency and is admissible evidence. **In my view,****although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is** **_not_** **corroboration by** **_independent_** **evidence. It would be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word.****I can see no reason why a s 159 corroboration of a complainant’s testimony should necessarily carry more weight than a s 159 corroboration of the accused’s denial. Both appear to me to be equally self-serving.**

> 50    Hence, **I agree with counsel’s submission that the court should treat \[the\] evidence \[of the complainant’s sister with great circumspection. Despite s 159, \[the complainant’s sister’s\] evidence is no more weighty that the \[accused’s\] s 121 and s 122(6) statements. It would be erroneous to attach to them such weight as would have been the case had they been independent evidence. Thus, I am of the view that****even though there was technically corroboration of the complainant’s allegations, the corroboration is not of sufficient weight to materially affect the fact that all there is before the court is essentially the bare allegation of the complainant.**

> 51    In my view, in a case such as this, the observation in _Balwant Singh_ should normally apply. **For this reason, if Spenser-Wilkinson J meant in** **_PP v Mardai_** **(\[45\]** **_supra_****) that a mere corroboration by virtue of s 159 is sufficient to remove the caution that the complainant’s testimony must be unusually convincing, then I respectfully disagree.****If the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, I cannot see how the fact that she repeated it several times can add much to its weight.****I am of the view that****even though a previous complaint goes beyond the question of consistency in Singapore, it normally does not go very far, so far as its weight is concerned.**

> \[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

101    In _GCK_ (at \[99\]), the Court of Appeal noted that the “application of the “unusually convincing” standard does not depend on the category of offence alleged against the accused person”. The observations in _Khoo Kwoon Hain_ therefore apply with equal force in this case, in relation to the Complainant’s investigation statements. As such, any subsequent complaints by the Complainant could not, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the need for “unusually convincing” testimony. As the Defence correctly submitted:[^156]

> \[a\]pplying the principles….in _Khoo Kwoon Hain_….mere corroboration by virtue of s 159 of the \[Evidence Act\] is insufficient to remove the requirement that \[the Complainant’s testimony\] must still be unusually convincing if it is to be accepted as the sole basis for convicting \[Shahid\].

102    I therefore applied the “unusually convincing” standard to the Complainant’s testimony, to assess if the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Complainant’s testimony had to be sufficient, in and of itself, to overcome any doubts that arose from the lack of corroboration (_Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 490</span> at \[58\]).

### Reasonable doubt had arisen

103    In _GCK_ (at \[134\]-\[135\]), the Court of Appeal observed that the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be conceptualised in two ways:

> (a)      First, a reasonable doubt may arise from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution”.

> (b)      Second, a reasonable doubt may arise on an assessment of the “totality of the evidence”. It is the assessment at _this_ stage that relates to the “unusually convincing” standard – which arises in the context of mutually exclusive and competing testimonies. The “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence put forth by the accused, where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s (_GCK_ at \[143\]). The assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing standard” must thus be made with regard to the totality of the evidence presented (_GCK_ at \[144\]).

104    This was a case where a reasonable doubt arose on both fronts.

#### Reasonable doubt had arisen within the Prosecution’s case

105    The term “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” is not synonymous with the term “at the close of the Prosecution’s case”.

106    The term “at the close of the Prosecution’s case” relates to the _procedural_ task of calling on the accused to give his defence, when the court is satisfied there is some evidence “which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charge” against the accused (_GCK_ at \[134\], citing s 230(_j_) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)).

107    In contrast, the term proof beyond a reasonable doubt “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” denotes the _evaluative_ task of considering all the evidence adduced by the Prosecution at each stage of the proceedings” (_GCK_ at \[134\]). In _GCK_, the Court of Appeal noted that a reasonable doubt may arise from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” in two situations:

> 136    As we recently explained in \[_Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 490</span>\] at \[113\], **given that the legal burden lies on the Prosecution throughout a trial, as part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a** **_prima facie_** **basis. One example of a failure to do so would be where, after the Defence has been called, there are discrepancies in the accused person’s testimony, but there remain significant inconsistencies** **_in the Prosecution’s case_** **that nevertheless generate a reasonable doubt. In such a situation, the court would be obliged to acquit the accused person.** Another example would be where the Prosecution’s evidence is so weak that, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, it falls below the \[_Haw Tua Tau and other v Public Prosecutor_ \[1981\]-\[1982\] SLR(R) 133\] standard. The court would then be entitled to find that there is no case to answer even without calling upon the Defence.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

108    The Court of Appeal in _GCK_ also noted (at \[137\]) that the inquiry into whether a reasonable doubt has arisen from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution” may include, among other things, an:

> (a)     assessment of the internal consistency within the content of a witness’s testimony; and

> (b)     assessment of the external consistency between a witness’s evidence and the extrinsic evidence, which includes testing the witness’s evidence against the inherent probabilities and uncontroverted facts.

109    The main plank of the Prosecution’s case was the Complainant’s evidence. He had implicated Shahid in his first tranche testimony. However, he went on to absolve Shahid in his testimony in the second tranche. His testimony was therefore internally inconsistent. The only safe conclusion to draw, in these circumstances, was that the Complainant’s evidence against Shahid was simply unreliable unless the Prosecution could show that the Complainant’s inculpatory first tranche testimony should be preferred over his exculpatory second tranche testimony. To accept that the Complainant must have been telling the truth only when he was implicating Shahid in the first tranche would be to assume what the Prosecution had to prove. It was my view that the Prosecution failed to show that the Complainant’s inculpatory first tranche testimony should be preferred over his second tranche exculpatory testimony.

110    I had closely observed the Complainant as he testified in two tranches, over four days. He struck me as a rather simple-minded individual. He was also neither an articulate witness, nor a sophisticated one. His testimony was, in general, not particularly easy to follow or understand. The Prosecution had indicated that the Complainant wished to testify in English, and he did do so. But, his responses were fragmented, incomplete, or in faulty syntax. Indeed, the record of his testimony is replete with “uh”, because he would hesitate mid-way through his sentences as he tried to express himself and provide coherent responses. To compound matters, he seemed to have difficulty following and understanding a number of questions.[^157] Even when he did appear to understand the questions, he did not seem to appreciate the thrust of them (this became clear when he responded). The questions thus had to be repeated with some emphasis or simplified. That said, he constantly declined an interpreter during the trial. The first instance was when counsel asked if he preferred to give his evidence in a different language after he expressed that he did not know how to express his response in a sentence (in English):[^158]

> Q:    So, then when you called up \[the police to make the FIR\], do you immediately tell them---do you immediately tell the police about this issue of Tanjong Rhu? That this person had gang relations or potential person may have gang relations?

> A:    Because the follow up, uh, interview is just after I was, uh, discharged from the emergency department?

> Q:    Okay.

> A:    And as I reached my home, uh, the---the officer from, uh, central police made a call to me and said, where am I? So, uh, the investigation officer, the CID, SSB and, uh---uh, the inspector was in the car. Uh, so that’s where I---that’s why, uh, there’s a---these---these names came up. Yah.

> Q:    What name?

> A:    As in---I’ve said---I also don’t know how to put in---in a sentence.

> Q:    Do you prefer to give your evidence in a different language?

> A:    No. Uh, this is okay.

111    The second instance was when the DPP asked if he needed an interpreter. He also claimed he was “a perfect A, English student” – while asking the DPP, at the same time, to simplify a question (as he did not understand it):[^159]

> Q:    Mr Shahdam, so are you saying after you had---you know you did the ‘sumpah’---you did the---you took the oath---after you took the oath in---in September, when you came into this Court after that and when you---after you had started to---to give evidence before \[the court\], during the lunch break when you went down, you also talked to the \[APP\]? Is---is that what you’re saying? I just need to clarify that.

> A:    Your Honour, I did not understand, uh, his question. So can you understand? Because your English, I don’t really---I don’t understand what---what’s your---your meaning. I understand English but the way that you put it, I did not understand.

> Q:    Yes, Mr---

> A:    Can you simplify it?

> Q:    Yes, Mr Shahdam. I---can I have---ask you a question. Do---do you need an interpreter, Mr Shahdam?

> A:    No, I did not---I---I’m a perfect A, English student, but the way you put it, I---don’t know how---I don’t understand a single word---

> Q:    Right.

> A:    meaning.

112    It appeared to me that the Complainant’s difficulties in following the questions posed and in expressing himself did not stem from just a lack of proficiency in the English language.

113    That said, on demeanour alone, I noted that the Complainant was far more certain and confident in his exculpatory testimony in the second tranche. I was, however, mindful of the dangers of relying excessively on the demeanour of witnesses in assessing the veracity of their evidence (_Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 562</span> at \[42\]). In this regard, I now detail the inconsistencies that arose from “within the case mounted by the Prosecution”.

##### (1)   Complainant’s testimony inconsistent with Shahid’s attire

114    In his examination-in-chief in the first tranche, the Complainant had agreed that the “very same person who lifted \[him\] up \[was\] the same person \[who\] threw the punch on \[his\] mouth”.[^160] But, he consistently testified that he could not remember the face of the person who had:[^161]

> (a)     helped him up after the initial assault; and/or

> (b)     punched him in the mouth after he uttered the Remark.

115    It was also his evidence that he never actually saw this person punch him. As he informed the DPP, “…if he punched…me in the face, I should have \[seen\] that punch coming”.[^162]

116    That said, when cross-examined by the Defence in the first tranche, he said he remembered “\[v\]ery clearly” that this person was “wearing a “_purple_ long sleeve…button shirt”.[^163] But, the Complainant’s evidence was at odds with that part of Shahid’s investigation statement – which the Prosecution _accepted_ – where he stated that he had been wearing a long-sleeved _maroon_ shirt.[^164] The Complainant had additionally agreed with the Defence that maroon and purple were different colours.[^165] The Complainant’s evidence meant that the man who threw the alleged punch could not have been Shahid (as they were attired in differed coloured shirts).

117    The Prosecution’s case at trial appeared to be that the Complainant was mistaken about the colour of the shirt worn by the man who threw the alleged punch. This was apparently because he had been kicked in the head during the initial assault. In this regard, I was aware that the Complainant had agreed with the Prosecution’s suggestion (made just before it concluded its cross-examination) that he was “mistaken by the colour \[Shahid\] was wearing”:[^166]

> Q:    Okay, I’m suggesting to you that you were mistaken by the colour \[Shahid\] was wearing on that time. Do you agree, disagree?

> A:    I agree.

118    But, the Complainant’s agreement at this stage of the proceedings stood in stark contrast to his earlier evidence in the same second tranche. Indeed, he denied he had been mistaken on both the occasions the Prosecution raised this issue. I set out the Complainant’s evidence on 27 February 2019, where the Prosecution asked if he might have been wrong about the colour of the shirt worn by the man who helped him to his feet after the initial assault\] because he was “feeling blur and giddy after being kicked at the head”:[^167]

> Q:    Okay. Now, in your Cross-Examination \[at the first tranche\], you…informed the Court…that because of the kicks to your head, you felt giddy, blur, giddy, that’s what you told this Court.[^168]

> A:    Yes, Your Honour.

> Q:    Is that correct?

> A:    Yes.

> **Q:**      **Okay. So, is it your position that \[the\] person who picked you up from the ground, he was wearing a purple shirt? Purple---**

> **A:**      **Yah.**

> **Q:**      **long sleeve shirt at that time?**

> **A:**      **Correct.**

> Q:    Okay.

> **A:**      **That is what I last remember, uh, because he is the one who picked me up and face to face, I saw his shirt** **and his t---tie.**

> **Q:**      **…Is it fair for me to say, Mr Shahdam, that you may have got the colour of the shirt wrong as at that point in time, you were feeling blur and giddy after being kicked at the head?...**

> **A:**      **Okay, I don’t think so because, uh, as I was conscious** and when the ambulance arrived, my--they checked my consciousne---couscioun---uh, my state of mind and my consciousness, **I was alert**.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

119    Indeed, the Complainant went on to testify that his “eyesight is 6/6” and he could see “perfectly” in the dark. He could therefore “see who is who \[and\] what colour this person \[was\] wearing” although the area was not well lit.[^169]

120    The Complainant reiterated his position, more forcefully, on 1 March 2019, when the Prosecution asked if it was “possible that…the football kick to \[his\] head caused \[him\] to feel giddy \[and he was hence\] mistaken \[about\] the colour of the shirt of the last person who…helped \[him\] up”:[^170]

> Q:    You have described to the Defence lawyer that you felt giddy because of the kicks to your head.

> A:    Yes, so?

> Q:    So that is true?

> A:    Yah, so?

> **Q:**      **Okay. Now is it possible that because the football kick to your head caused you to feel giddy, you \[were\] mistaken \[about\] the colour of the shirt of the last person who had helped you up?**

> **A:**      **Uh, definitely, no.** I have been hit harder---much more harder than that, by a baseball bal.

> Q:    So---

> **A:**      **Yah. I still can remember.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

121    One further point on the Complainant’s testimony about the attire of the man who threw the alleged punch bears mention. The Complainant had testified that this man was also wearing a tie.[^171] No evidence was adduced that Shahid was also wearing a tie with his (maroon) shirt.[^172]

##### (2)   Complainant’s testimony contradicted by Hazlan

122    It was the Complainant’s evidence in the first tranche that he and the person who helped him up after the initial assault “disperse\[d\]” after this person punched him in his mouth. As the Complainant testified, “he go his way, I go my way”.[^173] Based on the Complainant’s testimony, the alleged punch was hence delivered by this person:

> (a)      _after_ this person had helped him up; and

> (b)      _before_ he and this person separated.

123    The Complainant’s testimony was, however, at odds with Hazlan’s. In this regard, Hazlan said he saw the Complainant walk away (and across the road) “straight” after Shahid had helped him up. According to Hazlan, the Complainant and Shahid “parted ways” (in “separate directions” or “went apart”) after Shahid lifted the Complainant to his feet, and the Complainant then went “straight” to the opposite side of the road.[^174] Based on Hazlan’s testimony, there was therefore _no_ further contact between Shahid and the Complainant after Shahid helped the Complainant up. Hazlan’s testimony therefore cast a real doubt over the Complainant’s first tranche testimony. I set out Hazlan’s evidence in cross-examination:[^175]

> Q:    And then \[Shahid\] help the \[Complainant\] up? So, you saw \[Shahid\] helping \[the Complainant\] up?

> A:    I saw him helping up yah, the \[Complainant\] yah.

> Q:    So, when you decided to leave, was \[the Complainant\] fully stood up or was---

> A:    Yah.

> Q:    he still in the pose---so fully stood up?

> A:    Fully stood up.

> Q:    When \[the Complainant\] fully stood up, what happened?

> A:    Then I left.

> Q:    Then you left. Yah, okay. And how far later did \[Shahid\] come after you?

> A:    Okay I went straight to the smoking area I think.

> Q:    Okay and then roughly, how long before \[Shahid\]

> A:    I think about minute or two.

> Q:    One or two minutes?

> A:    Yes, correct.

> Q:    So you are saying that after---

> **A:**      **After \[the Complainant\] leave---after the---after \[the Complainant\] went up, the \[Complainant\] went away and \[Shahid\] start to walk.**

> …

> **Q:**      **Now, from there, where did the \[Complainant\] go?**

> **A:**      **Opposite of the road.**

> **Q:**      **So you saw the \[Complainant\] go across the road?**

> **A:**      **Yes, correct.**

> …

> A:    Yup.

> Q:    you walked away from there, you could see the scene, where the---that means that the---the---where the \[Aetos car\] is \[in D3-3\]?

> **A:**      **After I saw---after I saw the \[Complainant\] up, \[the Complainant\] went---he straight went opposite of the road lah.**

> **Q:**      **He straight went---**

> **A:**      **Yah. Yes---**

> **Q:**      **opposite side of the road?**

> **A:**      **correct.**

> **Q:**      **So, he went opposite of the road and did \[Shahid\] followed him?**

> **A:**      **No.**

> **Q:**      **So, that means \[the Complainant\] and \[Shahid\], after \[Shahid\] lifted him off the ground, \[Shahid\] and \[the Complainant\] parted ways? Basically, they were not to---they were not together anymore?**

> **A:**      **Yah. Yes, correct.**

> **Q:**      **So, and then \[the Complainant\] went across the road?**

> A:    Yes, correct.

> Q:    And \[Shahid\] followed you back?

> A:    Yes, correct.

> …

124    Hazlan testified to similar effect in re-examination:[^176]

> **Q:**      **And when you turn your back and walk towards the side of the road, \[Shahid\] and the \[Complainant\] were still on the road?**

> **A:**      **They went apart.**

> **Q:**      **They went apart?**

> **A:**      **Correct.**

> Q:    Okay. But you are certain that \[Shahid\] was the one and only person to help the \[Complainant\] up?

> A:    Yes, correct.

> Q:    Okay, yah? You wasn’t sure whether there was exchange of words---between the \[Complainant\] and \[Shahid\]?

> A:    No.

> …

> **Q:**      **But you were sure \[Shahid\] did not punch the \[Complainant\]?**

> **A:**      **Yes, correct.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

125    I was aware that Hazlan did testify in re-examination that he had turned his back after he saw the Complainant “being picked up by \[Shahid\]”.[^177] But, this had to be read together with his testimony that he had turned his back after he saw Shahid help the Complainant to his feet up _and_ the parties separate.[^178]

##### (3)   Complainant’s statements contrary to Prosecution’s case

126    In its submissions, the Prosecution had argued that the “unusually convincing” standard did not apply to the Complainant’s testimony. This was because his investigation statements supposedly corroborated his testimony in the first tranche.[^179] The Prosecution was, presumably, of the view that these statements were consistent with the Complainant’s testimony in the first tranche. This also explained why it cross-examined the Complainant with the intention of urging the court “to substitute” his testimony in the second tranche with his three previous statements, pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. But, the Complainant’s statements were in fact inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case (as set out in his first tranche testimony). They did not provide any corroborative evidence supporting the Prosecution’s case. Instead, they undermined the Prosecution’s case.

127    I set out the relevant aspects from the Complainant’s statements below (with emphasis added in bold or by underlining):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="25.72%"> <col width="74.28%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Date recorded</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Extracts from investigation statements</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 February 2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The assault last 10 to 20 minutes <u>and the group eventually stopped I asked one of the male subject in </u><b><u>purple </u></b><u>shirt who punched me in the nose asked if he knows who is the biggest gangster to which I replied it is my cousin’s brother.

128    The Complainant’s first statement was recorded on 16 February 2017, from 5:55am – about two hours after the initial assault.[^180] In this first statement, the Complainant stated that he had made the Remark, after the initial assault “eventually stopped”, to a “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt who \[had previously\] punched him in the nose”. This purple-shirted man had then given him “another punch to the mouth” after first saying “Oh”. The Complainant had therefore stated in his first statement – the most contemporaneous of all his statements – that he was punched _twice_ by the same purple-shirted male. It was to this purple-shirted man that he had directed the Remark, which invited a _second_ punch from this same man (but this time to his mouth as opposed to his nose).[^181]

129    However, this was inconsistent with the Complainant’s testimony in the first tranche. He never said he had been punched two times in all by the purple-shirted man who helped him up after the initial assault.[^182] It was also not the Prosecution’s case at trial that Shahid had punched the Complainant more than once. Indeed, the Complainant had maintained in the first tranche that the person who had helped him up had only punched him _once_.[^183] This was also reflected in the charge the Prosecution had framed against Shahid, which stated that Shahid had (only) punched the Complainant “on \[the\] mouth _once_”. Curiously, however, the Complainant had stated in his first statement that the “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” had punched him a total of _two_ times.

130    In addition, the Complainant failed to state in his first statement (contrary to his testimony in the first tranche) that this purple-shirted man:

> (a)     had first helped him up before punching him in the mouth.

> (b)     had uttered “Tanjong Rhu” (or anything referring to “Tanjong Rhu”) before punching him in the mouth. Instead, the Complainant stated that this purple-shirted man had only uttered “Oh” – a word completely distinct from “Tanjong Rhu” – before punching him in the mouth. Indeed, there was, oddly, no reference at all to “Tanjong Rhu” in any of his three statements.

131    A reading of the Complainant’s first statement also indicated that the “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” was a male from the Group who had been involved in the initial assault. This was because the Complainant had first referred to a “punch on \[his\] nose” (“causing it to bleed”) when describing the initial assault. I reproduce the relevant paragraphs from his first statement:

> …I recalled I was first assaulted by the short subject who hit me on my face but I managed to block it off \[the Complainant was referring to Nazrin\]. However, the group started to punch me on the floor and thereafter, they kicked me seven to nine times. I remember that I was kicked two times on my face, two times at the back of my head. **There was also a****punch on my nose****causing it to bleed** as well as a kick on my forehead causing it to swell.

> The assault last \[_sic_\] 10 to 20 minutes and the group eventually stopped **I asked one of the male subject in purple shirt****who punched me in the nose****asked if he knows who is the biggest gangster to which I replied it is my cousin’s brother. I then asked if he knows who is gremy siaw. He said “Oh…” and gave me****another****punch to the mouth**. Thereafter he told me to leave but I refused as I wanted CCTV to capture the incident. When I saw a taxi across the road, I went over to board the taxi and called the taxi to drive around as I wanted to look for the subjects. During which, I also called for the Police assistance.

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

132    Based on the Complainant’s first statement, the alleged punch was therefore thrown by a man who had been involved in the initial assault. On this note, the evidence of Nazrin, Tan, and Hazlan (as well as Shahid and Katijah) was that _only_ Nazrin and Tan were involved in the initial assault.[^184] That said, it was the Complainant’s evidence that (at least) _three_ men had attacked him during the initial assault.[^185] He had also informed the DPP in the second tranche that he “felt hurtful” because “4 to 3 people \[had\] beat him up”.[^186] The Complainant’s testimony therefore meant that _at least_ one other man had been involved in the initial assault (apart from Nazrin and Tan). The identity of this third man was never established during the trial. That said, given the Complainant’s first statement, Nazrin, Tan, or this unidentified male (all of whom were involved in the initial assault) must have thrown the alleged punch. Shahid could not have thrown it, because it was never the Prosecution’s case, at trial, that he was involved in the initial assault.

133    One further point flows from this. The Complainant had consistently testified that he had directed the Remark to the person who helped him up after the initial assault.[^187] Based on the Complainant’s first statement, the person to whom he had directed the Remark was a man who had been involved in the initial assault. This would have been Nazrin, Tan, or the unidentified third male.[^188] It could not have been Shahid, as it was never the Prosecution’s case, at trial, that he was involved in the initial assault.

134    The Complainant’s second statement was recorded on 25 May 2017, about three months after the alleged punch (on 16 February 2017). It was also inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case. This was because the Complainant was referring to what he had “mentioned in \[his first\] statement”[^189] when he stated that the “person \[who\] gave \[him\] a last punch at \[his\] mouth…was wearing a purple colour long sleeves shirt”. The issues surrounding the Complainant’s reference to this “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt”, as discussed above in relation to the first statement[^190], apply equally in relation to this second statement.

135    The Complainant’s third statement was recorded on 17 August 2017, about six months after the alleged punch (on 16 February 2017). It was the _last_ of his statements. It was also the _first_ time he stated that a purple-shirted man had “**picked \[him\] up** and also give\[n\] \[him\] a punch on \[his\] facial area”. In this regard, it was unclear if the Complainant was referring to the _same_ purple-shirted man across his three statements. This was because:

> (a)     in his third statement, the Complainant was responding to a _general_ question of what he remembered of the attire of _all_ “the assailants \[who\] assaulted \[him\] on the day 16 February 2017”.

> (b)     the Complainant did not state in his third statement that the purple-shirted man referred to therein:

>> (i)       had picked him up after the initial assault; and

>> (ii)       had been on the receiving end of the Remark before giving him “a punch on \[his\] facial area”.

> (c)     while the Complainant had stated in his first two statements that the “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” had given him a punch to the “**mouth**”, he stated in his third statement that the man who “wore a purple shirt” had “give\[n\] \[him\] a punch on \[his\] **facial area**”.

136    In any event, given the unchallenged evidence that Shahid was wearing a _maroon_ (and not purple) shirt on the day of the alleged punch[^191], there was thus a flaw in the Prosecution’s case even if I:

> (a)     assumed that the Complainant was referring to the _same_ purple-shirted man across his three statements[^192]; and

> (b)     ignored that part of the Complainant’s statements where he stated that he was punched two times in all by this purple-shirted man (once during the initial assault and, again, after the initial assault).[^193]

##### (4)   Complainant’s statements could not substitute testimony

137    I have discussed the Prosecution’s reliance on the Complainant’s investigation statements to corroborate his testimony in the first tranche.[^194] The Prosecution also urged the court to substitute the Complainant’s testimony in the second tranche with parts it underlined in these previous statements – which it averred were inconsistent with his second tranche testimony. This was pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. The underlined parts in these statements mirrored those aspects the Prosecution had claimed were corroborative of the Complainant’s testimony in the first tranche.[^195]

138    I have noted it was _unclear_ if the Complainant was referring to the _same_ purple-shirted man across his three statements.[^196] However, for ease of analysis, I shall _assume_ he was. This would, in turn, require me to _assume_:

> (a)     that the purple-shirted man who “picked \[the Complainant\] up” (third statement) was the _same_ purple-shirted man who “told \[the Complainant\] to leave” after the initial assault (first statement).

> (b)     that the Complainant was not making any distinction between the purple-shirted man who punched him in the “mouth” after the initial assault (first statement and second statement) and the purple-shirted man who punched him in the “facial area” (third statement).

139    Making these assumptions, I compared the Complainant’s evidence:

140    The Complainant’s testimony in the second tranche was clearly inconsistent with his investigation statements. His statements therefore came within the operation of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, which read as follows:

> (3)    Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.

141    The effect of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act “is that…previous inconsistent statement\[s\] admitted in the course of cross-examination becomes actual evidence in the case” (Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) (“_Pinsler_”) at para 20.045). The weight to be attached to previous inconsistent statements admitted as evidence pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act is governed by s 147(6), which reads as follows:

> (6)    In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section _regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement_ and, in particular, to the question _whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated_, and to the question _whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts._

> \[emphasis added in italics\]

142    The factors to be considered in according weight to such previous statements were discussed by the High Court in _PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 192</span> in the following terms:

> 27    The **contemporaneity of a statement with an incident is important for it guards against inaccuracy**. However, the degree of contemporaneity that is required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time. However, the recollection of the existence of a relationship, such as of employment, is not so malleable.

> 28    \[Section 147(6) of the Evidence Act\] refers as well to the **possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement**. There can be little guidance on this; the court must be astute in weeding out such instances.

> 29    In addition to the above matters, which are explicitly referred to, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by **an explanation of the inconsistency, and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts**.

> 30    Regard should be had to the **context of the statement**. \[Section 147(6) of the Evidence Act\] does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement, but requires **consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy**. Thus, the court must **consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined**. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of a statement that is taken out of context. In practice, it is necessary for the Defence to be given a copy of the whole statement, so that counsel may assist the court in putting the portion used in context.

> 31    Finally, **the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon has to be noted**. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

143    The weight of previous inconsistent statements that have been admitted into evidence therefore depends on various factors, and is a matter for the court’s estimation. Apart from the specific criteria which must be taken into account, the court is to consider “all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement\[s\]” (_Pinsler_ at para 20.051).[^197] In _Public Prosecutor v Ramalingam Ravinthran_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 265</span>, the High Court observed (at \[63\]) that:

> \[w\]hile s 147(3) \[of the Evidence Act\] renders the statement admissible in evidence, the weight to be accorded to the statement has to be determined. When \[the previous inconsistent statement of the witness\] becomes admissible as though it was the direct oral evidence of \[the witness\], it does not mean that \[the previous inconsistent statement of the witness\] must be regarded as truthful. Admissibility of any evidence and the weight to be accorded to the evidence are separate issues. **In a situation where s 147(3) \[of the Evidence Act\] operates, a court must take into account the fact that the witness’s statement is inconsistent with or contradicted by his oral evidence. In such a situation, it is open to the court to find:**

>> (i)    that the oral evidence is to be accepted in preference over the previous statement,

>> (**ii**)    **that the inconsistencies/contradictions cast doubts over the veracity of the oral evidence as well as the previous statement, or**

>> (iii)   that the previous statement is to be preferred over the oral evidence.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

(A)   Inconsistent with Prosecution’s case

144    I was aware of the contemporaneity of the Complainant’s three investigation statements.[^198] His first statement, in particular, was recorded about two hours after the initial assault.[^199] But, it was also _inconsistent_ with his testimony in the first tranche and the case advanced by the Prosecution at trial.[^200] The second statement was no better.[^201] And, I had to make certain assumptions[^202] to fill the gaps between the statements to read these statements in a manner that best advanced the Prosecution’s case.[^203]

145    Even if I assumed – further – that the Complainant had been mistaken about the nature and colour of the attire of the man who threw the alleged punch,[^204] the fact remained that his first statement stated he was punched two times in all by this person (once during the initial assault and, again, after the initial assault). This was not at all consistent with the Prosecution’s case against Shahid.[^205] The Complainant’s statements were in fact inconsistent with his testimony in the second tranche _and_ his testimony in the first tranche.[^206] The inconsistencies cast doubts over the veracity of his testimony (whether in the first tranche or the second tranche) and his previous statements.[^207] It was not at all possible to say which version held the truth. I therefore did not give _any_ weight to the Complainant’s previous statements, and did not substitute these statements as his evidence in place of his second tranche testimony.

(B)   Affected by psychiatric condition/medication

146    To compound matters, the Complainant testified that at the time his investigation statements were recorded:

> (a)     he was undergoing treatment for a psychiatric condition at the Institute of Mental Health (“the IMH); and

> (b)     he was taking an anti-psychotic medication for this condition.

147    It was the Complainant’s evidence that the medication he took affected his “thinking”; “memory”; “ability to recall thing\[s\]”; and “brain chemistry” (among other things). This, in turn, affected the accuracy of his statements. Significantly, his testimony on this aspect first arose during his re-examination by the Prosecution on 27 February 2019 – _before_ the Prosecution put his statements before him, and later cross-examined him on the inconsistencies between his statements and his second tranche testimony.[^208] I trace the Complainant’s testimony on this aspect in the paragraphs that follow.

(I)   APP’s re-examination (27 February 2019)

148    In re-examination, the Prosecution asked the Complainant if he recalled “how soon did \[he\] give his statements to the police” after the events of 16 February 2017. His _immediate_ response was that he “was under IMH…medication \[that he\] need\[ed\] to take \[every morning and night\]” “at that point in time”, and that it “might be \[that the medication\] affect\[ed\] \[his\] thinking”.[^209] The Prosecution did not quite appreciate the significance of his response, and thanked him for “being generous with \[this\] information”.[^210] The Prosecution then asked the Complainant if he gave any statements in February 2017. The Complainant said he did give a statement in February 2017 (the first statement), and he agreed this statement was given “fairly immediately after the \[events of 16 February 2017\]”.[^211]

149    But, the Complainant disagreed when the Prosecution then asked him if “the contents of \[his\] statements… represent\[ed\] \[his\] recollection at the time” he made them. He reiterated that he was “under IMH medication” “at that point in time”, and that it affected his “thinking”; “memory”; and ability to “recall thing\[s\]”. He also described himself as a “walking zombie”. He further said he had “even informed \[the\] IO” of these issues. He testified that “whatever \[he\] said in the statement\[s\] \[was\] the truth”, but he was not able to recall “certain things” as they “happened very fast”.

150    According to the Complainant, “all \[his\] memory start\[ed\] to come back” “after \[he was\] out of the \[IMH\] medication”. He was thus able to “recall everything” in the time between the first and second tranches, and his second tranche testimony reflected his recollection.[^212] In a later exchange with the Prosecution, he said his statements was “the truth” but referred, once more, to his “IMH medications”. He even invited the Prosecution to “call up \[his\] psychiatrist \[to\] ask how…the medication \[was\] like”.[^213] He confirmed that he was not challenging the voluntariness of his statements, and said he had only stated what he “recall\[ed\] and the truth” in his statements. That said, he testified, once again, that he had been under “IMH…medication” at the time he gave his statements. He even identified his medication as “Quetiapine”[^214] – an anti-psychotic drug. He went on to testify that the medication “might affect his thinking”; affected the accuracy of his statements; and “slow\[ed\] down \[his\]…everything, so that he was a “walking zombie”.[^215] I set out his testimony on these latter aspects:

> Q:    Okay. So you gave your statement willingly, there was no pressure despite the fact that you mentioned you were---what, you were at IMH?

> **A:**     I’m sorry. I am not in IM---IMH, **but I was under appointments with IMH, and I was prescribed medication for it.**

> **…**

> Q:    …Now, I’ll say it slower for you, Mr Shahdam. I just want to confirm that the statements that you have given to the police were made willingly with no pressure, even though you were under medication by IMH?

> **A:**      **Yes, no pressure, but, uh, the medication might affect my thinking.**

> Q:    Okay. Okay. So, “The medication might affect my thinking”, are you therefore saying that the statements that you have given to the police about the incident, would it be accurate or not accurate?

> **A:**      **It’s accurate but---**

> Q:    Okay.

> **Q:**      **not---uh, not, uh, to---not 100% accurate but I can confirm it’s 90% acc---98% accurate. Because I’m conscious, I’m not---I’m not like, uh, floating around or what. It’s just that, that medication is help me to cool down and it helps my brain, that is all.**

(II)   APP’s re-examination (1 March 2019)

151    The Prosecution had resumed its re-examination on 1 March 2019 by questioning the Complainant about his psychiatric condition.[^216] It was the Complainant’s evidence that he was warded at the IMH for three days[^217], after suffering a bout of “psychosis” a “few months” before 16 February 2017.[^218] According to the Complainant, he was in “the police lock up” when he suffered this bout of “psychosis” (he declined to elaborate why he was in the “police lock up” in the first place, saying it was not linked to the present case). As such, the police “tie\[d\] \[him\] up” and brought him to the IMH for assessment. At the IMH, he was diagnosed with “psychosis” after he told “a panel of doctors and the psychiatrists” what happened. It was the Complainant’s evidence that he had not been able to “differentiate whether it’s reality and whether it’s fake” when he suffered this bout of “psychosis”.[^219]

152    The Complainant said his psychiatrist prescribed “Quetiapine”[^220] to him after his discharge from the IMH. He had to take “Quetiapine” twice every day, once after waking up in the morning and then before retiring at night.[^221] He estimated that his last visit to the IMH was sometime in late 2017 or at the start of 2018.[^222] Before this, he was required to visit the IMH once every one to two months for his psychiatrist to assess him.[^223] He said he “was already off \[“Quetiapine”\] because of the side effects” when he testified in the first tranche. He had stopped taking “Quetiapine” sometime in 2018 (but he could not remember the month). He said he was also no longer on regulated follow-up with his psychiatrist at the IMH as of 1 March 2019, and had an open appointment instead. It was his evidence that he had not been diagnosed with any other psychiatric illnesses apart from “psychosis”.[^224]

153    According to the Complainant, he could “still…carry on \[his\] everyday routine” (such as playing football and watching movies) while he was on “Quetiapine”.[^225] That said, when asked if “Quetiapine” affected his “mental faculty”, he testified as follows:[^226]

> **A:**      **That one I ca---I cannot explain, because I don’t know what happens inside my brain chemical.** Yah. So that’s why every 2 months, the doctor---or 1 month, the doctor will ask me how am I feeling, getting better, any episodes of manic?

> (emphasis added in bold)

(III)   APP’s cross-examination (1 March 2019)

154    As mentioned, the Prosecution applied to cross-examine the Complainant following the about-turn in his testimony.[^227] His statements were put before him mid-way through his cross-examination, and he was asked to explain the inconsistencies between the underlined portions in these statements[^228] and his second tranche testimony. At one point, he responded in the following terms when asked about the contents of these statements:[^229]

> Uh, okay, I think you don’t really get what I---after all I have explained, nothing goes through your---your head. I’m under quetiapine, **the medicine \[from the IMH\]** and it **affects my---my brain chemistry and how I react and how I feel and how I talk and how I write my sentence and…it affects my memori---my memory.** So you can search it up yourself and you can call up the doctor or whatever, you can do so….

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

(IV)   Defence’s cross-examination (1 March 2019)

155    When cross-examined by the Defence, the Complainant testified that a psychiatrist and a panel of doctors had diagnosed him with “manic of psychosis” after he was warded at the IMH for three days. He also provided more information as to what led the police to send him to the IMH for assessment.[^230] He said he had “suddenly go\[ne\] into a rage” and was not able to “differentiate…whether \[he was\] in the reality or in \[his\] dream”.[^231] He further said his psychiatrist at the IMH had informed him that “Quetiapine” was also prescribed to patients suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia:[^232]

> Q:    And when \[the APP\] asked whether \[“Quetiapine”\] affects your mental faculty, you say you cannot explain about your brain chemicals. Can you explain to us what does that mean?

> A:    Yah, uh, because I’m not a medicine student, so I do not know what, uh, this medicine will do to you, but I asked, uh, the doctors, the doctor said is, “Yah, like people suffering from bipolar, schizophrenia, all, uh, our pre---will be prescribed this medicine.”

156    The Complainant said he had taken “Quetiapine” in the morning and evening of 15 February 2017, before he left to meet his friends. But for the events of 16 February 2017, he would have taken his next dose of “Quetiapine” at about 6:00am that day (but he did not do so as he was at the SGH.[^233]

157    That said, it was the Complainant’s evidence that there was “not much difference” on the previous occasions he missed his doses:[^234]

> Q:    \[H\]ave you ever missed a dosage, that means missed taking \[“Quetiapine”\]?

> A:    I have missed, uh, dosage before, but there’s not much difference because I---for me the---the medication---because I do not have a depressive disorder or any serious mental illness. So to me, this thing I avoid, because medication i---is only---i---from my understanding, it only ruins your body.

158    However, it was also his testimony that “Quetiapine” helped him to clear the “traffic jam” in his head so he could think normally. He also said “Quetiapine” affected him emotionally and caused him “very bad” anxiety.[^235]

> Q:    Forget about what the literature says or what…Google says or what anybody else says about it. You personally, what did you feel this medication have on you?

> A:    Okay. Uh, basically, **you will just feel zombie---you feel zombie.** You will like---you will just lie down and it will cool you down and will put you to sleep and how to said? That’s why it’s called---there’s the word “Sedatt---Sedatiive” and **it will calms your emotion down, like, uh, your head is in a haywire, like traffic jam, right, it will clears the traffic, so you can think like a normal hum---not so accurate but better**.

> …

> Q:    So just now when you said about this feeling…calming your emotions…the traffic jam and all that…is that \[what\] you yourself experienced or is that what…you read or what you think people who take this medication experience, or---

> A:    I ask the doct---the panel of doctor\[s\] and I dis---talk to the patients…**I experienced myself also**.

> Q:    Okay. I only want to know what you yourself experienced. So can you just…for clarity, just tell us what did you yourself…experienced?

> A:    Usually---I will---my mouth will be very dry and how---how to said? You will---sa---you---**your emotion is very, very deep, a bit, a bit you want to cry and the anxiety is very bad. You are very anxious and like---when someone raise a voice, you will immediately i---a tear will drop.** That---that, uhuh.

> Q:    Would you have full control over your physical…abilities?

> A:    Physical, yes.

> Q:    Would you have full control over your mental faculties, your mental…ability?

> A:    Yes…mental all can control**. Eh, no, mental the---like I said, anxiety, yah, uh, tears will suddenly roll down your cheeks, then, uh, you keep shaking your leg, like anxious, that’s anxiety, yah. That’s the side effect**.

> …

> Q:    But you said it makes you feel like a zombie?

> A:    Yah, a zombie as in---how to said, uh? Because you are not productive. It will only---if you don’t push yourself, uh, you wake up, you eat the medicine, you will---if you really don’t want to do anything, you will just go to sleep.

> Q:    Okay. When you say you…feel like a zombie…are you able to be fully aware of your surroundings, fully aware of what is going on around you?

> A:    Yes, correct. I’m aware. That’s why, uh, before I take the medication I ask the psychiatrist, “What’s this medication for?” And he said “It’s just to calm down your emotions.” Uh, that’s all.

> Q:    When you say you are fully aware, but does it take more time for you to process the information?

> A:    No, no, uh, it’s just like normal only. It’s just a bit, because my dosage was the lowest.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

(V)   Analysis

159    The Prosecution did not dispute _any_ aspect of the Complainant’s testimony on his psychiatric condition and the effect of the medication prescribed to him. I had, in fact, invited the Prosecution (in chambers) to apply for the medical records of the Complainant (its own witness, on whom its case hinged) from the IMH – to better appreciate, and to better assess the veracity of his testimony in light of, his psychiatric condition and medication. I accepted that the Complainant was in a position to provide direct evidence about how “Quetiapine” affected him. That said, he was not a psychiatrist. He was therefore not in a position to provide any expert evidence as to the precise nature of his condition(s) and medication. As the Complainant testified, he was “not a medicine student” and so “\[did\] not know what \[“Quetiapine” would\] do to \[him\]”.[^236] He also said he could not explain how “Quetiapine” actually affected his mental faculties because he did not know “what happen\[ed\] inside \[his\] brain chemical”.[^237] Indeed, he twice invited the Prosecution to contact his psychiatrist to understand the effect of “Quetiapine” on him.[^238] However, no report from the Complainant’s psychiatrist was produced. The Complainant’s psychiatrist was also not called to testify.

160    In written submissions, the Prosecution argued that the Complainant’s testimony as to how “Quetiapine” affected the accuracy of his statements “appear to be afterthoughts and should not be believed”.[^239] In this regard, the Prosecution submitted as follows:[^240]

> The Prosecution rejects any suggestion that the \[Complainant\] was not well enough to have his statements recorded. The \[Complainant\] did not appear to be unwell during the recording of the statements despite his assertion that he was under medication. In fact, the \[Complainant\] stated that he had full control of his mental \[faculties\] and was able to process the information as his dosage was minimal.

> Above all, it is imperative to note that the \[Complainant\] had confirmed that \[his investigation statements\] were his statements to which he **admits were the truth at the point in time**. It bears mention that he did not allege that the statement recording process was false or flawed in any way.

> \[emphasis in bold and by underlining in original\]

161    I rejected the submission that the Complainant’s testimony was an afterthought.[^241] This was never raised or put to the Complainant during the trial.[^242] There was also no basis for this belated submission, given that the Prosecution did not challenge _any_ aspect of the Complainant’s testimony on his psychiatric condition and how “Quetiapine” affected him. In addition, the Prosecution never disputed the Complainant’s testimony that he had informed the IO that his “IMH medication” made him a “walking zombie” and affected his “thinking”; “memory”; and ability to “recall thing\[s\]”.[^243] I further noted that the Complainant had stated in his first statement that he was “on medication prescribed by IMH to relieve stress”.

162    There was also no basis for the submission that the Complainant “did not appear unwell during the recording of the statements despite his assertions that he was under medication”.[^244] This was because the IO, who recorded the second statement, never testified on this issue. The Prosecution also did not call the officers who recorded the first and third statements to testify.

163    I was aware of the Complainant’s testimony that his statements reflected the truth.[^245] But, it was _not_ unqualified (as the Prosecution asserted[^246]). Indeed, the Complainant consistently reiterated he was under the effect of “IMH medication” (_viz_., “Quetiapine”) at the time he gave his statements.[^247] He was therefore saying that his statements contained the truth – as he remembered it to be while he was under the effect of “Quetiapine”. It was in this context that he said his statements reflected the truth.

164    I was also aware of the Complainant’s testimony that his ability to process information was unaffected because his dosage of “Quetiapine” “was the lowest”.[^248] But, he never said he had “full control of his mental \[faculties\]” (as the Prosecution asserted[^249]). A reading of the notes of evidence (extracted above at \[158\]) showed that his actual testimony was that he did _not_ have full control of his mental faculties when he consumed “Quetiapine”. Indeed, his testimony was that “Quetiapine” made him feel \[like a\] zombie”; affected him emotionally; and caused him “very bad” anxiety. His unchallenged testimony in this regard must also be considered against his earlier testimony (which was _not_ challenged as well) that “Quetiapine” affected his “thinking”; “memory”; and ability to “recall thing\[s\]”.[^250]

165    It was not disputed that the Complainant missed his morning dose of “Quetiapine” on 16 February 2017 as he was at the SGH.[^251] Incidentally, this dose was due the same time he gave his first statement. On this note, I was aware of the Complainant’s testimony that he did not experience “much difference” when he missed his doses previously.[^252] That said, he had also testified that “Quetiapine” helped to clear the “traffic jam” in his head so he could think normally.[^253] It also appeared that the Complainant was downplaying the extent/severity of his psychiatric condition(s). It was his testimony that he had not been diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia but “a single episode of…manic psychosis”. That said, he concurrently testified that this single episode of psychosis had happened because he was “depressed”.[^254] His supposed diagnosis of (only) “a single episode of…manic psychosis” also did not appear consistent with his testimony that he had to visit the IMH once every one to two months for his psychiatrist to assess him – a “few months before 16 February 2017” and all the way to sometime in late 2017 or the start of 2018.[^255] He was also on medication during this entire period. There was also the issue as to whether his ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy[^256] was impaired when he gave his first statement in the morning of 16 February 2017, before his scheduled dose of “Quetiapine”. Many of these issues were left unresolved.

166    That said, given the Complainant’s unchallenged evidence as to his psychiatric condition and how “Quetiapine” affected him, it was entirely plausible that his statements did not accurately represent the facts.[^257] This was a further reason[^258] not to give weight to his previous statements (and not substitute these statements as his evidence in place of his second tranche testimony).

##### (5)   Nazrin’s & Tan’s SOFs did not support Shahid’s guilt

167    As part of Prosecution’s case against Shahid, the Prosecution tendered the Statement of Facts that Nazrin and Tan admitted to when they pleaded guilty (“the SOFs”).[^259] Nazrin and Tan pleaded guilty on separate occasions. Their SOFs were near identical. The relevant paragraphs in the SOF that Nazrin admitted to (“**P6**”) read as follows:

> 7    When the \[Complainant\] was along Bayfront Avenue and about to cross the road towards the floating platform, he saw a group of Malays comprising \[Nazrin\], Tan, \[Shahid\] and five others (the “\[Group\]”) walking past him.

> 8    As the \[Group\] walked past the \[Complainant\], the \[Complainant\] said “Peace be upon you” to them in Arabic. However, they did not respond to his greeting. The \[Complainant\] then commented, “this one confirmed not Islam, just don’t mess with the wrong person and take care you guys, good bye” in Malay.

> 9     **Upon hearing the above, \[Nazrin\] went to confront the \[Complainant\] together with Tan** **and \[Shahid\]**. Tan then punched the \[Complainant’s\] stomach, and \[Nazrin\] punched the \[Complainant’s\] face. \[Nazrin\] pulled the \[Complainant\] to the ground and, together with Tan, assaulted him by punching and kicking him. The \[Complainant’s\] nose was bleeding as a result of this assault.

> 10    The assault ended when \[Nazrin’s\] friends then intervened and asked \[Nazrin\] and Tan to stop attacking the \[Complainant\]. **As Tan and \[Nazrin\] walked away from the \[Complainant\], \[Shahid\] pulled the \[Complainant\] up and told him to leave the scene. However, the \[Complainant\] then asked \[Shahid\] if he knew who the biggest gangster was, and that it was his cousin’s brother knowns as “Gremy Xiao”. This provoked \[Shahid\], who then punched the \[Complainant’s\] mouth once. \[Shahid\] then walked away and joined the rest of the \[Group\] and they left the scene.**

> \[emphasis added in bold and by underlining\]

168    The Prosecution admitted the SOFs into evidence, presumably, to rely on those aspects that implicated Shahid. However, no mention was made of these SOFs in its submissions. That said, the admission of these SOFs did not take the Prosecution’s case very far. This was because the Prosecution accepted at trial that Nazrin and Tan had walked away _before_ the alleged punch.[^260] They therefore did not see the alleged punch.[^261] It was also Hazlan’s (unchallenged) testimony that Nazrin and Tan were _already_ walking towards the parapet _before_ the Complainant “fully stood up”.[^262] Nazrin and Tan were thus not in a position to give any direct evidence on whether Shahid did in fact punch the Complainant. I was also mindful that the aspects in the SOFs that implicated Shahid were not at all material to Nazrin’s and Tan’s guilt. In this regard, the following observations in _Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 716</span> were instructive (_assuming_ Shahid could be classified as an “accomplice”):

> 88    There was, however, nothing magical about the conclusion that PW4 had, by virtue of his plea of guilt and admission to the statement of facts confessed to the facts stated therein \[which also implicated the accused person\]…

> 89    In coming to this conclusion, I was persuaded by numerous factors which militated against treating an accused person’s statement of facts as evidence which could, on its own, convict the accused’s accomplice:

>> …

>> (c) Furthermore, as I have said, **the judge’s duty in accepting the statement of facts is not to scrutinise every detail to make sure that it is accurate. He is only required to be certain that the accused has admitted all material particulars to the offence.** See the judgment of L P Thean J, as he then was, in _Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 501</span> in which my learned friend held (at \[16\]) that:

>>> If what he admits contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence and what he disputes or does not admit is irrelevant or immaterial to the offence, such an admission … is sufficient …and the court should accept his plea of guilty.

> However, **it goes without saying that details which are not material to the accused person’s conviction may be material to the conviction of an accomplice.** In the present case, the statement of facts admitted to by PW4 contained details which incriminated the \[accused person\], namely, that PW4 had paid money which he received from the prostitutes to a male driver of a white Mercedes (ostensibly, the \[accused person’s\] agent). **However, these details, although greatly probative of the \[accused person’s\] guilt in the present appeal, were not relevant to the charges against PW4 and had these details been inaccurate, the statement of facts would not have been objectionable for the purposes of PW4’s conviction. To then proceed upon those potentially inaccurate and unproved facts in prosecuting the \[accused person\] would be unsound as that part of the statement of facts may be false but taken for truth. It would then be unsafe to hang the \[accused person’s\] conviction on the thread of the “immaterial” parts of PW4’s statement of facts.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

169    The SOFs also contradicted the Prosecution’s case, at trial, that Shahid was not involved in the initial assault on the Complainant. Indeed, Nazrin and Tan confirmed that Shahid was not involved in the initial assault when they were directed to their SOFs during the trial.[^263] This was not challenged.

170    In addition, the SOFs never stated it was Shahid (and Hazlan) who intervened to stop the initial assault (another aspect of the evidence that was not challenged). They were also silent on the Complainant’s acts of provocation that triggered the initial assault.[^264] The SOFs did not therefore accurately reflect the events on 16 February 2017 (as these facts emerged during the trial).

171    Moreover, the SOFs and the Complainant’s first statement, when read collectively, undermined the Prosecution’s case at trial. The SOFs had stated that the Complainant’s “nose was bleeding as a result of \[the\] assault \[by Nazrin and Tan\].[^265] In his first statement, the Complainant had stated that it was the “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” who had “punched \[him\] in the nose” during the initial assault. This punch “caus\[ed\] \[his nose\] to bleed”. This “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” had then “gave \[him\] another punch to \[his\] mouth” when he made the Remark to him after the initial assault.[^266] Assuming the Prosecution had drafted the SOFs so they were consistent with the Complainant’s first statement, this meant that “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” who had punched the Complainant in the mouth after the initial assault was either Nazrin or Tan (whose role in the initial assault, based on the SOFs, had caused the Complainant’s nose to bleed).

##### (6)   No evidence Shahid caused Complainant’s lip laceration

172    On examination, Dr Liew had found a “superficial laceration wound measuring 5mm on \[the Complainant’s left upper lip, \[with\] no active bleeding”.[^267] In submissions, the Prosecution argued that this laceration was attributable to Shahid. I set out the submissions in this regard:

> **VII**.     **THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS**

> …

> (**d**)     **Medical report**

> 68    The \[Complainant\] had informed Dr Liew in SGH about the incident when he sought medical attention less than two hours after the assault. He had informed Dr Liew that he was assaulted by a group of people.

> 69    In Dr Liew’s final diagnosis, laceration of the lip was, _inter alia_, noted. At no point did the \[Complainant\] said \[_sic_\] this to the doctor. This was what Dr Liew found on his examination.

> 70    The area of the laceration, in addition, was also consistent with the manner in which the injury was sustained – that \[Shahid\], being the last person to have helped the \[Complainant\] up, had punched him at his mouth after the \[Complainant’s\] seemingly provocative “_Gremy Xiao_” remark. It is submitted that the laceration of the lip is attributable to \[Shahid\]. Accordingly, it is clear that the \[Complainant’s\] version of events has remained consistent and credible.

173    I saw no significance to the fact that this laceration was “found \[by Dr Liew\] on his examination” without the Complainant having had to say anything. More problematic, however, was the attempt to attribute this injury to Shahid. Dr Liew was never called to testify during the trial. The only evidence from Dr Liew was his conditioned statement, which was silent as to how this laceration was caused. There was therefore no evidence on the record that the “superficial laceration” Dr Liew found on the Complainant’s “left upper lip” was consistent with a direct blow to the mouth (in the form of a “fisted punch”[^268]). The basis for submitting that only Shahid could have caused this laceration – and not someone who was involved in the initial assault – was also unclear. This was especially glaring given the Complainant’s unchallenged testimony in re-examination that he did _not_ know how he came to sustain this “superficial laceration” because he received “a lot of blows to \[his\] nose…to \[his\] head and kicks” during the initial assault:[^269]

> Q:    Okay. Now can you…help to explain again, how did you come about sustaining this…laceration around you \[left upper lip\]?

> **A:**      **Uh, Your Honour, uh, because the attack took place so fast, I was---the first approach, I was already given a punch to the stomach, and the---the face, and I was dragged down to the floor, and I was---all the way at the \[foetal\] position and---and last, it was “pa, pu, pu, pa, pu, pa, poop”, and the last kick to my head.** I \[then\] felt someone, uh, after like 1 minute, he tapped my shoulder, “Hey (speaking in different language)” and he carried me up, and he said, “You better go away from here and, uh, “before any”---he spoke in Malay, “Before any (speaking in different language).” And it---uh, when I walk off, he said, “Thank you”. And )---when I about to cross, I said, “Thank you” too. Yah. That’s all, Your Honour.

> Q:    Okay. Yah. Thank you, Mr Shahdam. **So coming back to my…question specifically. So this laceration around your \[left upper lip\]…how did you get that?**

> **A:**      **Because---I don’t know. Because the---there’s---there’s a lot of---uh, how to say, there’s a lot of blows exchanged, uh, a---among---they---they gave me a lot of blows to my nose, to my---to my nostrils, to my head and kicks. So I don’t know how I get that. So I cannot put my 100% blame on \[Shahid\] when I did not see him do it**. Instead he’s the one who helped me up to get away from the scene, before any oncoming traffic hit me, because I was lying down. I---I cannot see behind.

> (emphasis added in bold)

174    In addition, I considered the:

> (a)     unchallenged testimony of Nazrin and Tan that:[^270]

>> (i)       Nazrin had punched the Complainant in the _face_ at the outset of the initial assault (this was also reflected in the charge[^271] and the Statement of Facts that Nazrin pleaded guilty to); and

>> (ii)       they had punched and kicked the Complainant, _repeatedly_, thereafter.

> (b)     charge that Tan had pleaded guilty to, which averred he had punched and kicked the Complainant on his _face_ and body.[^272]

> (c)     unchallenged testimony of the Complainant that he received _repeated_ kicks to his stomach and _face_ during the initial assault.[^273]

> (d)     Complainant’s first statement, where he stated he was “kicked two times on \[his\] _face_ \[and\] two times at the back of \[his\] head”.[^274]

175    There was simply no basis to attribute the “superficial laceration” on the Complainant’s “left upper lip” to Shahid.

##### (7)   No mention of alleged punch in FIR & to doctor

176    I noted that the Complainant’s FIR was not particularly brief.[^275] It contained some details relating to:

> (a)     the race and composition of the Group (“TWOS GIRLS and GROUP OF GUYS. ALL MALAYS”);

> (b)     the general attire of its members (“ALL DRESSED IN CLUBBING ATTIRE”);

> (c)     the nature of the initial assault (“I GOT BEATEN UP…THEY KICK ME AT THE ROADSIDE”); and

> (d)     the direction the Complainant thought the Group had headed in thereafter (“I THINK THEY HEADING TO \[ROCHOR\] ROAD”).

177    The Complainant’s FIR also singled out the attire and appearance of one member from the Group (“ONE BOTAK WEARING GREY SHIRT”), though it was unclear who this was.

178    That said, the Complainant’s FIR did not refer to any “male subject in \[a\] purple shirt” punching him (in the mouth or any other area) – unlike his first statement, which was recorded just about two hours later.[^276] This was a somewhat curious omission. That said, I was mindful that a FIR is not be regarded “as a document which should contain the entire case for the Prosecution”, as its main purpose is “merely to give information of a cognisable offence to the police so as to set them in motion.” The fact that elaborate details of the alleged offence are not mentioned in a FIR was hence irrelevant (_Tan Pin Seng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 494</span> at \[27\]).

179    Based on the Complainant’s first tranche testimony, this was, however, not a case where the alleged punch was intertwined with the initial assault. It was difficult to see how the initial assault and the alleged punch could be regarded as one continuous assault. On this note, the Complainant had said he was unsure if the man who helped him up was part of the same group that attacked him during the initial assault.[^277] There was also a marked distinction between the circumstances surrounding the initial assault and those leading to the alleged punch. The alleged punch came from someone who the Complainant thought was trying to help him after the initial assault, and who did in fact help him. It was hence unclear why the Complainant failed to mention this distinct incident in his FIR. Indeed, he was unable to provide any satisfactory answer when the Defence pressed him to explain this omission.[^278]

180    The Complainant also failed to inform Dr Liew of the circumstances surrounding the alleged punch. As Dr Liew was not called to testify, the only evidence from Dr Liew was in the form of his conditioned statement. In this regard, Dr Liew’s statement made _no_ mention of the Complainant informing him that he was punched in the mouth after he was helped to his feet following the end of the initial assault. All Dr Liew’s statement stated was that the Complainant had informed him that “he was assaulted by a group of eight to ten unknown people at the roadside at 3.50am on 16 February 2017”, where he was “punched over the face for 20 times and kicked over \[the\] face 20 times”.[^279] This appeared to be a reference only to the initial assault. It was unclear why the Complainant failed to inform Dr Liew of the alleged punch, given the distinct circumstances that surrounded it.[^280]

#### Reasonable doubt had arisen on the totality of the evidence

181    A reasonable doubt may also arise on an assessment of the totality of the evidence.[^281] The assessment of the Prosecution’s evidence under the “unusually convincing” standard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence. The “totality of the evidence necessarily includes a holistic assessment of both the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s cases \[“both as a matter of the assertions put forth by the accused person, and the evidence he has adduced”\], and the interactions between the two” (_GCK_ at \[135\] and \[144\]). The court in _GCK_ also observed that:

> 144    …The evaluative task here is not just _internal_ to the Prosecution’s case, but rather, also _comparative_ in nature…At this stage of the inquiry, regard may be had to weaknesses in the case mounted by the Defence as part of the assessment of the totality of the evidence.

> 145    Conversely, **what the Defence needs to do to bring the Prosecution’s case below the requisite threshold is to point to such evidence that is capable of generating a reasonable doubt…If the Prosecution fails to rebut such evidence, it will necessarily fail in its overall burden of proving the charge against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. We would add that such evidence need not necessarily be raised (in the sense of being asserted, or being made the subject of submissions) by the Defence in order for it to give rise to a reasonable doubt. What matters is that a reasonable doubt arises (in whatever form) from the state of the evidence at the close of the trial.**

> …

> 148     **In the context of the uncorroborated evidence of \[a witness\], whether his or her account is considered unusually convincing (and therefore capable of discharging the Prosecution’s burden of proving the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt) requires an assessment of the internal and external consistencies of the account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider. Such other evidence necessarily requires a consideration of the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person (or the lack thereof).**

##### (1)   Consistency between Shahid’s testimony & statement

182    Shahid’s testimony has been set out above.[^282] It was largely consistent with his statement of 21 February 2017, made just five days after the events on 16 February 2017. This was unlike the Complainant, whose statements as well as testimony in the first and second tranches were _all_ inconsistent.

183    In his statement, Shahid denied punching the Complainant after helping him up following the end of the initial assault. When asked if the Complainant had “said anything” to him, he responded that the Complainant had only said “thanks”. I set out the relevant extracts from his statement:

> **Q2:**      **Can you tell me more on what happened on \[16 February 2017\]?**

> …

> …We \[referring to members of the Group\] left the club at about 2 plus am. After we left the club, I drove them back to Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

> I parked \[my\] lorry at the open space car park located a distance away from Marina Bay Sands hotel. After \[I\] had parked, all of us then walked back together to the hotel. Before entering the hotel, they stood one side and were smoking together. I was sitting together with my wife a distance away from them and was smoking as well. When we were about to join the rest, I then saw that Nazrin and \[Tan\] was \[_sic_\] fighting together with one male Malay subject in red shirt alongside the roadside of Marina Bay Sands.

> I then went to them and saw Hazlan and Sadiq were trying to stop the 2 of them from assaulting \[the male Malay subject in red shirt\]. I went in and tried to stop them as well. Hazlan and Sadiq kept on pushing them away to the hotel. After they had walked a distance away, I approached the male Malay subject who were \[_sic_\] seating \[_sic_\] in the middle of the road and spoke to him \[in\] Malay and asked him to go back. I slowly pulled him up and asked him to move away from the road and asked him to go back. He then walked away.

> In the room, I then asked what happened and Nazrin told me that the male Malay subject scolded vulgarities and spat on him. That was all I know.

> …

> **Q6:**      **When you pulled the male subject up from the road, did you punch him?**

> A6:     No.

> **Q7:**      **Did the male subject said \[** **_sic_** **\] anything to you?**

> A7:     He only say \[ _sic_ \] thanks to me.

> **Q8:**      **Do you have anything else to say?**

> A8:     I was not involved in any fight. I was there trying to separate them from fighting.

> \[emphasis added by underlining\]

184    Shahid’s statement and subsequent testimony were both consistent and exculpatory. In this regard, the Court of Appeal’s observations in _Muhammad Nabil bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> bear mention:

> 52    …that there is no principle of law that the evidence of an accused person must be treated as inherently incredible or being of suspect value merely because it advances his defence and is, in that sense, self-serving. If the presumption of innocence means anything at all, it must mean that an accused person who testifies to exonerate himself may be telling the truth. The assessment of whether or not he is doing so must, in the final analysis, depend on the totality of the evidence…

##### (2)   Katijah’s exculpatory evidence

185    Shahid’s statement was, however, silent on one aspect. This related to Katijah’s presence on the road while he was helping the Complainant up. Shahid had only raised Katijah’s presence in his testimony.[^283]

186    Katijah’s testimony was significant. She said she had followed Shahid (without his knowledge) when he walked to the middle of the road to stop the initial assault. It was her evidence that she _only_ saw Shahid help the Complainant to his feet; heard the Complainant say “thank you”; and heard Shahid tell the Complainant “to go home”. She said she never saw Shahid hit or punch the Complainant. It was also her evidence that she and Shahid were the last two persons to walk away from the middle of the road, after seeing the Complainant cross the road to the opposite side.[^284] The testimonies of Shahid and Katijah were therefore consistent.

187    The Prosecution submitted that:

> 72    \[Shahid and Katijah were\] not being truthful and \[their\] evidence ought to be disbelieved…because:

>> i.    …Nazrin and Tan \[had\] averred that \[Katijah\] was never on the road at the material time. Similarly, Hazlan candidly testified that \[Katijah\] was neither next to \[Shahid\], nor was she in or around the area where \[Shahid\] was seen lifting up the \[Complainant\]. All three witnesses asserted that \[Shahid\] was the last, and only person, seen helping the \[Complainant\] up and leaving the road.

>> ii.    For completeness, the \[Complainant\] himself did not mention in any of his evidence and/or statements that \[Katijah\] was with \[Shahid\] at the material time.

>> iii.   In \[Shahid’s\] \[investigation\] statement to the police, he did not state that \[Katijah\] was with him when he picked the \[Complainant\] up in the middle of the road…

188    I noted that Hazlan did say that he did not see Katijah or anyone else around the area while Shahid was helping the Complainant up. He had also said that Katijah had been at the parapet.[^285] That said, Nazrin never testified to similar effect (contrary to the Prosecution’s submissions[^286]). I set out Nazrin’s testimony in his examination-in-chief:[^287]

> Q:    Okay. So when \[Shahid\] was lifting the \[Complainant\] up, was he alone or was he with someone else.

> **A:**     I---I only saw---at the point of time, **I only saw \[Shahid\] lifting alone**.

> Q:    Mmm.

> **A:**      **But after that, I do not know.**

> Q:    You’re not sure. At the point in time you only saw \[Shahid\] alone lifting the \[Complainant\] up, right?

> A:    Yes.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

189    Indeed, it was Nazrin’s evidence that he saw Shahid helping the Complainant up only when he turned his back for “about 2 to 3 seconds”. He had walked away thereafter, and so did not know what else might have happened _behind_ him.[^288] On this note, save for Hazlan, the Prosecution was incorrect in submitting that Nazrin and Tan had “asserted that \[Shahid\] was the last, and only person, seen helping the \[Complainant\] up and leaving the road.”[^289] Nazrin and Tan – who were the _first_ to leave the area after the initial assault – never testified that they had seen Shahid “leaving the road” after he had helped the Complainant up.

190    It was also not Tan’s evidence that Katijah “was never on the road at the material time”[^290] (contrary to the Prosecution’s submissions[^291]). Tan in fact said that Katijah _was_ on the road together with his wife:[^292]

> Q:    Did \[Shahid\] try and stop the fight?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Do you know if \[Katijah\] was anywhere near there as well?

> A:    I think \[Shahid\] was with our---my wife.

> **Q:**      **So your wife tried to stop the fight. \[Katijah\] was also with your wife?**

> **A:**      **Yah.**

> **Q:**      **So \[Katijah\] would have been there as well?**

> **A:**      **\[Y\]es.**

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

191    Tan’s evidence was therefore consistent with that of Shahid and Katijah. In this vein, I noted that the Prosecution never disputed Shahid’s testimony that he saw Katijah standing behind him after he had helped the Complainant up.[^293] Indeed, the Prosecution did not even put it to Shahid that Katijah was not on the road at the material time.[^294]

## Conclusion

192    The case for the Prosecution hinged on the Complainant’s evidence – for which there was no independent or objective corroboration. The Complainant’s evidence was the Prosecution’s sole basis for seeking Shahid’s conviction on the charge. It therefore had to be “unusually convincing”, or so convincing that the Prosecution’s case is proven beyond reasonable doubt solely on the basis of the Complainant’s evidence.[^295]

193    This was a case where the Complainant’s first tranche testimony, second tranche testimony, and previous investigation statements were _all_ inconsistent with one another. These inconsistencies cast doubts over the veracity of his testimony (whether in the first tranche or the second tranche) and his previous statements. It was not at all possible to say which version held the truth. There were also other inconsistencies in the Complainant’s first tranche testimony (on which the Prosecution relied) and gaps in the case advanced by the Prosecution. Reasonable doubt arose within the Prosecution’s case, and on the totality of the evidence. Against this backdrop, the Complainant’s evidence was hardly “unusually convincing”. In these circumstances, I found that the Prosecution failed to establish the charge against Shahid beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore ordered a discharge amounting to an acquittal. A conviction would have been plainly wrong and against the weight of the evidence in this case.

[^72]: The Complainant testified that he informed Dr Liew that he had been “punched over the face for 20 times and kicked over \[the\] face 20 times” to explain/describe the severity of the pain he felt: Day 2, p 12, lines 5-30. See also Day 2, p 66, lines 6-11, where the Complainant explained that he had not told Dr Liew that he had been punched and kicked on his body because his body did not “feel the pain of the attack” as he was “most hit” on the face, around his “head area”, and on his forehead. According to the Complainant, these were the areas where he felt the most severe pain.

[^73]: The Complainant testified that he did not attend at the specialist clinic because he no longer felt any pain and there was hence “no need for follow up”: Day 2, p 11, lines 2-9.
