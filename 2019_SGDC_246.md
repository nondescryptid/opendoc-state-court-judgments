21 November 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

#### The Charges

1       The accused, Mr Jumaane Soon Kai Yuan, a 22-year old male Singaporean, had pleaded guilty on 8 November 2019 to two charges, namely, one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a heated substance under s 324 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 913400-2019** and a charge of criminal intimidation under Section 506 (2nd limb) Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 913401-2019**. The accused gave his consent for the remaining charge under s 323 Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **MAC-904895-2019** to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       I sentenced the accused to four weeks’ imprisonment for the charge under s 324 Penal Code in **DAC 913400-2019** and two months’ imprisonment for the charge under s 506 Penal Code in **DAC 913401-2019**. As I had ordered both his sentences in **DAC 913400-2019** and **DAC 913401-2019** to run concurrently, his global sentence was two months’ imprisonment.

3       This is his appeal against his sentences filed on 8 November 2019 through his Defence Counsel, Mr K V Sudeep Kumar of S K Kumar Law Practice LLP. The two proceeded charges against him were as follows:

> _Exhibit C1A –_ **_1st charge (Amended)_**

> “…that on 1 January 2019, sometime between 4am and 6am, at Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, level 8 lift lobby, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao, by means of heated substance, _to wit_, by touching the said Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao’s right cheek using a lit cigarette once, causing the said Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao to suffer a superficial burn injury to his right cheek measuring 0.3cm by 0.3cm in size and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> _Exhibit C2A –_ **3rd** **_charge (Amended)_**

> “…that you, on 1 January 2019, sometime between 4am and 6am, at Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, level 8 lift lobby, Singapore, did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao with destruction of property by fire, _to wit_, by telling the said Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao that you know where he stays and telling him that you will burn down his house with the intent to cause alarm to the said Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (2nd limb) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

4       His stood down charge in **MAC-904895-2019** was as follows:

> _Exhibit C3A –_ **_2nd charge (Amended_** **)**

> “…that you, on 1 January 2019, sometime between 4am and 6am, at Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, level 8 lift lobby, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao, _to wit_, by punching and slapping the said Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao multiple times, causing the said Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao to suffer superficial bruising on his left cheek, tenderness over the lateral aspect of the maxilla and around the jawline, and superficial abrasion injury on his right lower lip, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

## B.   Statement of Facts

5       The Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) prepared by the Prosecution which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

> “1.    The accused is one Jumaane Soon Kai Yuan, male, Chinese, aged 22 years old (DOB: 24 June 1997), a Singapore Citizen. At the material time, the accused was unemployed.

> 2.    The victim is one Joshua John Yeo Boon Hao, male, aged 18 years old.

> 3.    The witness is one Yan Ling Hui Cheryl, female, aged 19 years old. At the material time, the witness was the accused’s girlfriend.

> DELAYED INFORMATION REPORT

> 4.    On 2 January 2019, at about 12.02am, the victim lodged a police report at Jurong West NPC, informing that he had been assaulted by one of his friends’ boyfriend. The incident location was reported to be Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, level 8 lift lobby, Singapore.

> FACTS RELATING TO THE 1st CHARGE (DAC-913400-2019)

> 5.    Investigations revealed that the accused was the boyfriend of the witness who was in the same clique of friends as the victim.

> 6.    Sometime in November 2018, the victim, the witness and their clique of friends met up at a friend’s house to drink alcohol. On that occasion, the victim drank some alcohol and became tipsy. The victim noticed the witness recording a video of him using her mobile phone. To stop her from doing so, the victim grabbed the witness’ hand and snatched the mobile phone from her. Sometime later, the victim, the witness and their clique of friends left the friend’s house. Before parting ways, the victim hugged the witness and said goodbye to her. As the witness felt uncomfortable about the victim grabbing her hand and hugging her, she subsequently told the accused, who was her boyfriend, about it.

> 7.    On 31 December 2018, the victim, the witness, their clique of friends and the accused gathered at one of their friends’ house, which is located at Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, to eat and play mahjong.

> 8.    On 1 January 2019 sometime between 4am and 6am, some of them decided to go to Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, level 8 lift lobby to smoke. While at the lift lobby, the accused confronted the victim regarding the latter touching the witness (ie, the accused’s girlfriend) inappropriately. The accused demanded that the victim address the accused as “Sir” and “Captain” when answering his questions and to answer by whispering. The victim complied. Whenever the victim did not reply properly, the accused slapped him on his cheeks. The accused demanded that the victim apologise to everyone in the clique, and the victim complied. Each time the victim was unable to pronounce a word properly or the victim was too soft for the accused’s liking, the accused slapped the victim on his cheeks. When the accused asked the victim to “touch his heart”, the victim complied by placing his hand over his chest. However, the accused told the victim that his hand was not at his heart and punched him three times on his chest. The accused demanded that the victim apologise to the witness for touching and hugging her inappropriately. The victim complied.

> 9.    Throughout the whole time when the accused was slapping the victim on his face and punching the victim on his chest, the victim did not retaliate. Despite some of the victim’s friends’ attempts to stop the accused, the accused asked them to mind their own business and informed them that even if they call the Police, the Police would not be able to do anything to him.

> 10.    Subsequently, the accused placed his right arm around the victim’s neck. At the material time, the accused was holding a lit cigarette with his right hand. With the intention of causing hurt to the victim, the accused touched the victim’s right cheek with the lit cigarette once.

> 11.    According to the medical report prepared by Dr Louisa Liu Ying Ying from Pioneer Polyclinic dated 18 January 2019, as a result of the incident, the victim sustained, among other injuries, a superficial burn injury to the right side of his cheek around 0.3cm by 0.3cm in size.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has voluntarily caused hurt to the victim by means of a heated substance and has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

> FACTS RELATING TO THE 3rd CHARGE (DAC-913401-2019)

> 13.    On 1 January 2019 sometime between 4am and 6am, at Blk 520 Jurong West Street 52, level 8 lift lobby, with the intention to cause alarm to the victim, the accused told the victim that he knows where the victim stays and threatened to burn down the victim’s house. The threat was said in the presence of the witness and their clique of friends. The threat caused the victim to feel threatened and afraid.

> 14.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of criminal intimidation by threatening to cause destruction of property by fire to the victim with intent to cause alarm to the victim. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 of the Penal Code (2nd limb).”

## C.   Antecedents

6       The Accused has no prior antecedents.

## D.   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

7       In its oral address on sentence, the Prosecution had indicated that they were seeking a custodial term for each of the proceeded charges in **DAC 913400-2019** and **DAC 913401-2019** and that they would be objecting to the calling of a probation report.

#### Section 324 Penal Code

8       It was the Prosecution’s case that for the charge under s 324 Penal Code, the Prosecution was seeking a sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution had sought guidance from the recent High Court authority of _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> at \[12\] - \[17\] where the High Court had set out the sentencing approach for s 324 Penal Code cases. Essentially, the first step was to consider what would be an appropriate sentence had hurt alone been the subject of an offence under s 323 Penal Code. The second step was to apply a suitable uplift based on the dangerous means used. The third step would be to calibrate on account of other considerations such as the various aggravating and mitigating circumstances at play.

9       The High Court in _Ng Soon Kim_ had considered the sentencing framework in s 323 Penal Code for a first-time offender who pleaded guilty as set out by the High Court in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[77\]:

10     It was submitted that the first step would be to consider what is the appropriate sentence had hurt alone been the subject of an offence under s 323. In the present case, low harm was caused as there was a burnt mark on the accused’s right cheek. The indicative sentencing range would be from fines to a short custodial term of up to four weeks. It was further submitted that the second step would be to look at the dangerous means used, which was a lit cigarette in the present case. Finally, under mitigating and aggravating factors, it was noted that while the accused had pleaded guilty and was an untraced first time offender, the facts of the present case was egregious. It was the Prosecution’s case that at no point in time did the victim retaliate despite the persistent and one-sided attacks on the victim.

11     The Prosecution next refered to the table of sentencing precedents under s 324 Penal Code that involved the use of cigarettes and the naked flame as set out below:

12     It was highlighted that in _Public Prosecutor v Law Shijie_ the accused who was traced for unrelated offences was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the present case fell flatly within the first band of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ and sought a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Section 506 Penal Code

It was highlighted that the cases cited above involved threats relating to burning of property and the destruction of property by fire. It was submitted that the most analogous cases would be at serial number 1, _Public Prosecutor v Cruz Joseph_ and at serial number 4, _Public Prosecutor v Alwinder Singh_.

14     It was further highlighted that in _Public Prosecutor v Cruz Joseph_, this involved a disgruntled client of a law firm who threatened to burn down a law firm’s office over the phone. The accused who had prior antecedent for using indecent, threatening, abusive and insulting words or behavior was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment. In _Public Prosecutor v Alwinder Singh_, this case was a case of an attempted s 506 Penal Code where the accused had uttered words in Malay “_If I come back tomorrow and you don’t come out I will burn your house.”_ The accused in that case who had prior antecedents for violent offences was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that taking into account the fact that the accused in the present case was a first time offender, an appropriate sentence would be two months’ imprisonment.

#### Global sentence

15     The Prosecution indicated that it had no objections to the sentences in _DAC 913400-2019_ and _DAC 913401-2019_ to run concurrently, bringing it to a global sentence of two months’ imprisonment. It was further submitted that in proposing these sentences, the Prosecution had taken into account the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty and the fact that he was untraced offender.

16     It was the Prosecution’s case that given that all three charges arose out of the same incident, it painted the picture of an accused being someone who resorts to violence and threats whenever he is met with a situation that is not to his liking. It was submitted that despite his friends’ attempts to stop him and had ample opportunities to disengage from the victim, he had failed to avail himself to those opportunities. It was on this basis that the Prosecution was objecting to the calling of a probation report as deterrence instead of rehabilitation should be the key sentencing principle in the present case.

## E.   Mitigation

17     In his written plea in mitigation, his Defence Counsel had highlighted the inter-relatedness of the offences such that it was a single transaction. It was submitted that given the accused’s youth and lack of mandatory punishments in terms of fines or imprisonment terms, it was a fit case to call for probation report in lieu of other alternatives.

18     It was the case for the Defence that the offences were committed to address a perceived misbehaviour to the accused’s girlfriend as reflected at paragraph 6 of the Statement of Facts. It was submitted that the accused got involved when his girlfriend shared her misgivings and that the accused had reacted or was motivated to address the misbehaviour as a normal boyfriend, albeit it was foolish and on hindsight, it was unwarranted.

19     It was further submitted that the accused was more amenable to rehabilitation than one who commits offences actuated by non-healthy reasons such as revenge or bullying. It was the case for the Defence the consequence would be less serious if the offender was more inclined to teach a lesson rather than actually commit an offence and that a superficial burnt injury was sustained which would have been treated fully without marks. In respect of the intimidation, it was submitted that the seriousness of the threat was matched by its hollowness as it was the consequence of a person aggrieved by the alleged misbehaviour to his girlfriend.

#### Background

20     His Counsel highlighted that in the accused’s 2013 School Graduation Certificate from Yuying Secondary School which was exhibited at Tab 3 in his plea in mitigation, under Character Traits, it was stated that “_…Although not outstanding in certain aspects of his academic pursuits, Jumaane nevertheless perseveres and maintains a positive countenance. He tries to put in creditable efforts to improve his results on his own…”_ It was submitted that the accused was blessed as his parents are supportive and were prepared to pay $1,000 to the victim to meet his pain and expenses.

21     It was the case for the Defence that in view of the above circumstances and the relatively minor injuries for the proceeded charge under s 324 Penal Code, the Court should call for a probation report. It was submitted that paragraph 8 of the Statement of Facts were strictly on matters relating to the charge that was taken into consideration and therefore warranted a discounted view or weight.

22     Apart from his written mitigation, Counsel had orally submitted that the accused is only about 22 years old. According to Counsel, he is ‘a young impressionable guy with a future ahead of him’ and he is doing well in his studies. He submitted that the accused’s whole life would be destroyed by the imposition of a custodial sentence. When queried by the Court as to what the accused was doing presently and where he was studying, Counsel informed the Court that the accused was actually looking for a job and was also trying to further his studies later.

23     His Counsel reiterated that the accused had listened to his girlfriend who according to him was victimised by the victim and he was protecting her. The accused was apologetic for what had happened and when his girlfriend had complained to him, he was frustrated at what the victim allegedly did to his girlfriend. According to his Counsel, ‘otherwise as far as his school records and anything is concerned, it was all very clear’. When queried by the Court about the lack of the accused’s school records in his written plea in mitigation, his Counsel indicated that the accused has no school records and that he was a good student. He clarified that the accused never got into trouble as far as school was concerned.

24     It was submitted that this was a one-off incident and a matter of true love which had gone wrong in certain unfortunate circumstances. His Counsel urged the Court to call for a probation report as if he is imprisoned, it will be a terrible mark on his career and his future. His Counsel asked that the accused be given a chance to merge back with the society so that he can build his career and get on with life.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

25     In response to the plea in mitigation, it was submitted that the accused was not at an impressionable age. At the time of the offence, he was already past 21 years old. It was also submitted that the accused ought to have been able to assess for himself the potential consequences of his actions.

26     It was further submitted that while the motivation behind the accused's actions as highlighted by his Defence Counsel were clear, his actions were wholly disproportionate to the cause of the unhappiness which is the victim’s alleged inappropriate contact with the accused’s girlfriend and it was a persistent assault. It was the Prosecution’s case that an accused person's young age cannot be used as a factor or used as a free pass for any accused person. Once again, it was reiterated that the Prosecution would be objecting to the calling of a probation report in this case and that a custodial sentence was necessary.

## G.   The Sentences

#### Prescribed punishment under Section 324 Penal Code

27     The prescribed punishment for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means under s 324 Penal Code is a term of imprisonment that may extend to seven years or with a fine, or with caning or with any combinations of such punishments. In the present case, the accused had used a heated substance namely, a lit cigarette on the victim’s right cheek once and caused him to suffer a superficial burn injury measuring 0.3cm by 0.3cm in size.

#### Prescribed punishment under Section 506 Penal Code (second limb)

28     The prescribed punishment for an offence of criminal intimidation where the threat is to cause the destruction of property by fire under the second limb of s 506 Penal Code is a term of imprisonment that may extend to 10 years or with a fine, or with both. In the present case, the accused had intended to cause alarm to the victim when he threatened the victim with destruction of his property by fire, by telling him that he knew where he stays and that he would burn down his house.

29     The Prosecution had sought a custodial term for each of the proceeded charges and had objected to the calling of a probation report. The Prosecution had urged the Court to impose a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment for the charge under s 324 Penal Code and two months’ imprisonment for the charge under s 506 Penal Code. In contrast, although the accused was above 21 years of age, the Defence had urged the calling of a probation report in respect of the two proceeded charges. His Defence Counsel had submitted that this was due the accused’s youth and lack of mandatory punishments in terms of fines or imprisonment terms for the proceeded charges. According to Counsel, the accused is a young impressionable guy with a future ahead of him and he is doing well in his studies (which was unsupported by any documentary evidence). He submitted that the accused’s whole life would be destroyed by the imposition of a custodial sentence.

#### Whether a probation is an appropriate order

30     In considering whether to call for a probation report, I was mindful that as a general rule, a probation order is inappropriate for serious offences or where violence has been committed. In the present case, the offences committed by the accused were serious offences as reflected in the lengthy maximum sentences prescribed for the proceeded charges under s 324 Penal Code and s 506 Penal Code. In addition, an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by the use of dangerous weapons or means under s 324 Penal Code is an aggravated form of the offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 Penal Code. Similarly, an offence of criminal intimidation where the threat is to cause the destruction of property by fire under the second limb is an aggravated form of criminal intimidation under s 506 Penal Code.

31     In the present case, it was undisputed that at the time of the offence, the accused was not a young offender below the age of 21 years. He was already six months shy of turning 22 years of age and was unemployed at the time of the offences. I noted that the accused is currently looking for a job and was not engaged in any academic pursuits or was a good student as suggested by his Defence Counsel. Hence, the sentencing framework for young offenders is not applicable in the present case.

32     Rehabilitation can be an operative concern of an offender above the age of 21, only if he or she demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation as set out by the High Court in _Goh Lee Yin_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 530</span> at \[28\]. From the plea in mitigation presented before me, I was unable to discern any evidence that showed that the accused had extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are any exceptional circumstances.

33     Further, this was not the case where the accused person was labouring under any serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder that had a causal link to the commission of the offences. Under these circumstances, I was unable to accept the Defence Counsel’s contention that a probation report should be called and that probation be imposed in view of the accused’s youth and lack of mandatory punishments in terms of fines or imprisonment terms for the proceeded charges. In my view, as he was not a young offender, it was also not evident that the accused had extremely strong propensity for reform and there were no exceptional circumstances in the present case, rehabilitation was no longer the main sentencing consideration in this case.

34     Furthermore, there were aggravating factors as reflected in the Statement of Facts for the present case that weighed clearly in favour of deterrence. I agreed with the Prosecution that his actions were wholly disproportionate to the cause of the unhappiness, namely the victim’s alleged inappropriate contact with the accused’s girlfriend and the assault on the victim was a persistent one. Hence, I disagreed with Defence Counsel’s contention that the accused’s offending was one-off and a matter of true love which had gone wrong in certain unfortunate circumstances.

35     I next considered the appropriate sentences to be imposed for the proceeded charges in _DAC 913400-2019_ and _DAC 913401-2019._

#### DAC 913400-2019 – s 324 Penal Code

36     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence for the s 324 Penal Code charge, I was guided by the sentencing approach of the High Court in _Ng Soon Kim_. In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that it fell within the first band of _Low Song Chye_ for an offence under s 323 Penal Code that low harm was caused as there was a superficial burn injury measuring 0.3cm by 0.3cm in size on the accused’s right cheek. The indicative sentencing range would be from fines to a short custodial term of up to four weeks. I took into account that the hurt was caused to his right cheek which is a vulnerable part of the victim’s body. I also took into account the fact that the accused had deliberately targeted the victim’s face as he placed his right arm around the victim’s neck while holding a lit cigarette with his right hand. The custodial threshold had been crossed and a short imprisonment term of at least two weeks’ imprisonment would have been justified had the hurt alone been the subject of a charge under s 323 Penal Code.

37     The second step was to look at the dangerous means used. In the present case, it was a heated substance in a form of a lit cigarette that was used once to touch the victim’s right cheek. This is unlike the use of an open flame such as a lighter or a blow torch which had the potential to cause more serious burns and would have attracted higher degree of culpability. In my view, the single use of a lit cigarette would have warranted a slight uplift of around three weeks’ imprisonment on account of the dangerous means used. I also found the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution unhelpful as a majority of the offenders were not first offenders and/or the injuries caused were more serious as compared to the present case.

38     Finally, I considered the mitigating and aggravating factors in the present case. The fact that the accused had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges and was an untraced first time offender were mitigating factors which I had taken into account. Nevertheless, I agreed with the Prosecution that the facts of the present case were egregious. The accused’s actions against the victim were wholly disproportionate to the cause of the unhappiness and his attacks on the victim were persistent. This warranted a further uplift of the imprisonment term to four weeks’ imprisonment. I further agreed with the Prosecution that at no point in time had the victim retaliated despite the persistent and one-sided attacks on him.

39     After a careful consideration of the above factors, in view of the dominant sentencing principle of general deterrence, the aggravating factors highlighted above, as well as the mitigating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment for _DAC 913400-2019_ would be just and approporiate in the present case.

#### DAC 913401-2019 – s 506 Penal Code (second limb)

40     The present charge involves a threat by the accused to cause the destruction of property by fire under the second limb of s 506 Penal Code. From the sentencing precedents under s 506 Penal Code tendered by the Prosecution involving threats relating to burning of property and the destruction of property by fire, the sentences imposed ranged between three to four months’ imprisonment. I noted that the offenders there either had previous related or unrelated antecedents and/or had taken overt steps such as lighting a piece of cloth on top of a beer bottle with a lighter in _Public Prosecutor v Tan Jun Shun_ or dragging two gas cylinders as part of their threats to the victim in _PP v Tan Cheng Huat_.

41     In the present case, the accused is a first offender who despite having uttered a serious threat to cause the destruction of property by fire, had not taken any further overt steps in support of his threat. In my view, this warranted a downward calibration of the sentence to a sentence of two months’ imprisonment as proposed by the Prosecution.

42     Given that the offences including the s 323 Penal Code charge that was taken into consideration arose out of the same incident, I agreed with the Prosecution that the two imprisonment terms in _DAC 913400-2019_ and _DAC 913401-2019_ ought to run concurrently. Hence, the accused’s global sentence in respect of his present case was two months’ imprisonment.

43     Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against his sentences on 8 November 2019. The accused is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal
