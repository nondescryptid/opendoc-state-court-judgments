### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused Oskar Song Hauming aged 35 years pleaded guilty to two charges under sections 403 and 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for misappropriating his boss’s credit card that he had picked up in the office, which he later used to make a series of purchases at various merchants.

2       The accused was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health to be suffering from two psychiatric disorders which had contributed to the commission of the offences. Prosecution submitted that because the accused faced an amalgamated cheating charge under section 417 of the Penal Code he cannot be sentenced to community orders as his offence fell within the ambit of the disqualifier in section 337(1)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed ) (“the CPC”), and in any event the court should impose an imprisonment term on the accused.

3       This raised issues on the interpretation of section 337(1)(i) of the CPC, and the applicable sentencing principles in determining the appropriate sentence for the accused.

4       I sentenced the accused to a 24-month Mandatory Treatment Order and a 10-day Short Detention Order. The Prosecution has appealed against my sentence, and the accused has cross-appealed.

## The Charges

5       The two proceeded charges the accused pleaded guilty to were:

> DAC-919389-2019

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, sometime in early May 2019, at No. 138 Market Street, #06-01, CapitaGreen, Singapore, did dishonestly misappropriate one Diners Club credit card bearing number XXX in the name of Dabbs Matthew Edward, which belonged to the said Dabbs Matthew Edward, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-919390-2019

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, in this amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), that you, on not less than 103 occasions between 4 May 2019 and 27 June 2019, in Singapore, did embark on a course of conduct of cheating employees working at the sales outlets set out in column 2 of the Annex (the “Employees”) by presenting one Diners Club credit card bearing number XXX (the “Diner’s Club card”) in the name of Dabbs Mathew Edward, to the Employees as payment for the items set out in column 3 of the Annex (the “Items”) a total value of S$20,642.48 in order to deceive the Employees to believe that you were the rightful holder of the Diner’s Club card, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the Employees to accept the Diner’s Club card as payment for the Items and to deliver them to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Material Facts

6       The material facts extracted from the Statement of Facts to which the accused had admitted without qualification are set out below.

7       The complainant is Dabbs Matthew Edward, a 46 year old male British National who at the material time was the Chief Executive Officer of AAM Advisory located at no. 138 Market Street #06-01, CapitaGreen, Singapore. He is owner of a Diners Club credit card bearing number XXX (the “Credit Card”).

8       The accused a male Singapore citizen was at the material time 34 years old and the Digital Marketing Manager in the complainant’s company.

9       On 12 June 2019 at about 10.46am the complainant lodged a report stating that he had lost the Credit Card and had incurred fraudulent charges on it. On 2 July 2019 at about 5pm at AAM Advisory, the accused was arrested and brought to Commercial Affairs Department for investigation. He admitted to the commission of offences and led police to his office and residence where the items listed in Annex A of the Statement of Facts he had purchased using the Credit Card were seized.

##### FACTS RELATING TO FIRST CHARGE DAC-919389-2019

10     Investigations revealed that sometime in May 2019, whilst at one of the meeting rooms at AAM Advisory, the accused found the Credit Card on the floor of the said meeting room. He decided to dishonestly misappropriate the Credit Card despite knowing that it belonged to the complainant.

11     Thereafter, the accused made fraudulent purchases using the Credit Card at various merchants in Singapore.

12     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

##### FACTS RELATING TO SECOND CHARGE DAC-919390-2019

13     The accused started using the Credit Card on 4 May 2019 to make purchases for himself, his wife and his family members. The accused had used the Credit Card to make purchases up until 27 June 2019. Sometime at the end of June 2019, the accused tried to use the Credit Card at a restaurant called Cedele located at HillV2, Singapore, but the Credit Card was declined. Thereafter the accused discarded it.

14     Between 4 May 2019 and 27 June 2019, the accused embarked on a course of conduct of cheating employees working at the 103 sales outlets set out in column 2 of Annex B of the Statement of Facts (the “Employees”) by presenting the Credit Card to the employees for the items set out in column 3 of the said Annex B (the “Items”) amounting to a total value of S$20,642.48 to deceive the Employees to believe that he was the rightful holder of the Credit Card, and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced the Employees to accept the Credit Card as payment for the Items and to deliver them to him. The accused has thereby committed an offence of under section 417 of the Penal Code.

15     The accused has since made full restitution of the amount of $20,642.48.

## Charges taken into consideration

16     The accused admitted and consented to two further amalgamated charges under section 417 relating to the use of the Credit Card to be taken into consideration in sentencing. Under the 3rd and 4th charges, the accused had used the Credit Card on not less than 26 occasions in the May-June 2019 period to purchase food, beverage and other items from various merchants, amounting to $2,234.17 and $42.20 charges respectively.

## Antecedents

17     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

18     Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of at least eight months imprisonment, comprising 2 months for the section 403 offence and eight months for the section 417 offence, with both sentences to run concurrently.

19     Prosecution said they were not disputing the contents of the two psychiatric reports tendered by Defence from Dr Lionel Lim (“Dr Lim”), a psychiatrist in private practice, and Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”) a forensic psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (“the IMH”), but would place greater weight on the IMH report by Dr Goh as IMH was more independent. [^1]

20     Prosecution submitted on the following aggravating factors[^2] :

> (a)     As the offences involved the use of a misappropriated credit card, his offences undermine both the reliability of credit cards as a mode of payment and the entire security of our credit infrastructure ( citing _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (_“Fernando Payagala”_). General deterrence is of the paramount consideration and the offender must expect to face harsh custodial sentences.

> (b)     The accused’s acts were premeditated and deliberate, and specific deterrence applied. Prosecution cited Dr Lim’s report where the accused told Dr Lim that he had struggled over two days with the idea of using his boss’s credit card to buy things for his wife and his mother before using the credit card for the first time on 4 May 2019, and he also made up his own rules that he would not splurge on luxurious items and would only buy things he could afford.[^3]

> (c)     The offences were motivated by greed and persons who act out of greed will rarely be treated with much sympathy, citing _Zhao Zhipeng v Public Prosecutor_ \[2008\] 4 SLR( R) 879 at \[37\]. Prosecution cited Dr Goh’s report[^4] where the accused told Dr Goh that he had bought clothes, sunglasses and wellness packages for himself. Prosecution said the accused had also bought various luxurious items for his wife and mother, and the 10 most expensive items ranged from $409.15 for lace shoes to a Dyson vacuum costing $749.

21     On the global sentence of at least eight months, Prosecution cited the cases of _Fernando Payagala_ and _Idya Nurhazlyn binte Ahmad Khir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya Nurhazlyn_”).

> (a)     In _Fernando Payagala_ the High Court said that an imprisonment term of two to six months was an appropriate benchmark for first offenders, and imposed a sentence of two months’ imprisonment on the accused for the dishonest misappropriation of credit card charge as the appropriate benchmark for a first-time offender who pleaded guilty.

> (b)     Considering the aggravating factors and also that full restitution had been made, at least two months imprisonment was appropriate for the accused.

> (c)      _Idya Nurhazlyn_ was the benchmark case for section 417 cheating offences, where the High Court stated that a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate where the victim parted with property of more than negligible value. The High Court had also observed that custodial sentences of between four to eight months were imposed for cheating offences involving sums of between $1,000 and $15,000.

> (d)     As the sums involved in the present case exceeded the monetary range observed by the court in _Idya Nurhazlyn_, an uplift from the eight months was appropriate.

> (e)     However as Prosecution accepted that the accused suffered from OCPD and major depressive episode at the material time and had made full restitution, this was of some mitigating value and a slight sentencing discount could be given and a sentence of at least eight months imprisonment for the cheating charge was appropriate.

22     Further to the court’s request to address on sections 337(1)(i) and 124 of the CPC, Prosecution stated that[^5] as the section 417 charge was an amalgamated charge, the offence was punishable with imprisonment of up to six years by virtue of section 128(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, and therefore the court could not impose any community sentences as section 337(1)(i) CPC disallows community sentences where the offence is punishable with imprisonment exceeding three years. This was in keeping with Parliamentary intent that the community sentences regime was set up primarily to deal with minor offending for which rehabilitation is the key sentencing consideration. Further:

> (a)     Any series of acts amalgamated under section 124(4) CPC involve multiple discrete acts and would be more serious than any stand-alone acts and this has been reflected in the doubling of the court’s sentencing jurisdiction; and

> (b)     The undertaking of an extended course of criminal conduct would typically engage the sentencing consideration of deterrence rather than rehabilitation.

23     In any event even if the accused could be sentenced to a community sentence, the court should impose a jail sentence on the accused as his offences were serious. It was not appropriate to impose a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) or Short Detention Order (“SDO”).[^6] Prosecution said there was no explanation provided as to how his Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (“OCPD”) and depression contributed significantly to impair his self-control and restraint so as to reduce his culpability, and Dr Goh’s first report had stated that the accused was “aware of the nature and quality of his actions”. Although Dr Lim had in his second report[^7] stated that there was a causal link between the accused’s OCPD and the commission of the offences, he had not explained why he had changed the term “contributed” in his first report to “causal link” in his second report. There was also no determinative finding that the accused’s psychiatric condition extinguished his self-control or significantly diminished his criminal responsibility, nor any determination on the severity of the accused’s OCPD and depression.

## Mitigation

24     In mitigation,[^8] Counsel initially asked the court to consider a conditional discharge or a light fine. He referred to the psychiatric reports of the two psychiatrists engaged by Defence. Dr Lim opined that the accused was suffering from OCPD which was aggravated by stressful life events the accused was experiencing in the two years preceding the offences, while IMH’s Dr Goh confirmed the OCPD diagnosis and further opined that the accused was suffering from a major depressive episode at the relevant time and that he continued to have depressive symptoms. Attached to the mitigation dated 31 March 2020 (“the Mitigation”) were the two psychiatric reports[^9] setting out the accused’s personal and family circumstances as reported by the accused to the two psychiatrists.

25     Counsel highlighted that at the relevant period the accused was badly affected by the cancer diagnosis of both his parents and the cancer treatment they were undergoing. Added to this was his wife moving out of their home after a quarrel with the accused’s sister. The accused had made full restitution and had since found a new job and proven himself at work. Counsel also attached a testimonial from the boss the accused had worked for from 2014 to 2016.

### Counsel’s further written submissions

26     Subsequent to the Mitigation, Counsel filed further mitigation documents[^10], containing mainly repetitions of what was already set out in the Mitigation and the reports of the two psychiatrists, and attaching literature and articles on OCPD and MTOs. He also submitted that probation was not a suitable alternative for the accused.

27     Further to the court’s request to address on community orders and sections 337(1)(i) and 124 of the CPC, various additional submissions[^11] were filed. Counsel then asked the court to grant the accused a discharge not amounting to an acquittal or otherwise an MTO for 24 months[^12]. He submitted that the case authorities relied on by Prosecution were irrelevant and should be ignored, and cited other cases which he urged the court to variously apply or distinguish in the accused’s favour, but in neither case explaining why the court should adopt the positions he was urging, nor explaining why or how the cases cited were relevant to the various positions he was urging. I did not find this helpful. Prosecution had also submitted on the general lack of clarity and ambiguity of Counsel’s citation and use of the case authorities.[^13] Voluminous documents and attachments that had previously been submitted to the court were re-submitted, and included were some correspondence between AGC / police IO and alluding to “Threat Inducement or Promise” scribbled into the Contents page[^14].

28     As regards the CPC provisions, Counsel submitted[^15] that the accused is “entitled to the protection of section 337 CPC and entitled to invoke the community orders” but without saying why this was so. He then added that” Even if the Court takes the position that **Section 124(4)** is applicable and so also **Section 124(8**), **this would be subject** to the defences that can be raised for the accused” and that the accused’s depression and OCPD which were “genuine defences”. In court Counsel clarified that the accused could mitigate on account of his mental illness but not that the accused had a defence and the accused was not detracting from his plea.

29     Counsel then reiterated that :

> (a)     The accused was genuinely remorseful for his actions and had demonstrated this with his early plea of guilt. The accused had also penned an apology letter to the victims.

> (b)     No injuries had been suffered by the victim, and there was no damage caused to any property.

> (c)     The accused had a clean record.

> (d)     This was a one-off incident, not in keeping with the accused’s general temperament. There was very little possibility that the accused would re-offend.

> (e)     The accused had rendered full cooperation with the authorities.

## Relevant legal principles when sentencing mentally disordered offenders

30     An offender’s mental disorder may be relevant both to the court’s assessment of his culpability and the weight that should be placed on the sentencing principles of general and specific deterrence. It is generally relevant where the psychiatric condition lessens his culpability, and the extent of this relevance depends on factors such as the nature and severity of the mental disorder and the impact of the disorder on the commission of the offence: _Ho Mei Xia Hannah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 211</span> (“_Ho Mei Xia Hannah_”) at \[37\].

31     As the court observed in _Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1287</span> _(“Lim Ghim Peow”_) at \[26\] and \[39\] there is generally a tension between the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence, and the principle of rehabilitation when sentencing a mentally disordered offender. Ultimately the court is required to balance the interests of society against those of the offender and it is the search for the right balance which poses the greatest difficulty.

32     The court in _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> _(“Chong Hou En”_) at \[24\] and \[25\] considered and distilled the relevant principles from _Lim Ghim Peow_:

> (a)    The existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is generally a relevant factor in the sentencing process.

> (b)    The manner and extent of its relevance depends on the circumstances of each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder.

> (c)    The element of general deterrence may be accorded full weight in some circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious one.

> (d)    In spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused person, specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence.

> (e)    If the serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence less relevant, where for instance the offender has a significantly impaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, then rehabilitation may take precedence.

> (f)    Even though rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, it does not necessarily dictate a sentence that excludes incarceration. The accused person could well be rehabilitated in prison.

> (g)    Finally, in cases involving heinous or serious offences, even when the accused person is labouring under a serious mental disorder, there is no reason why the retributive and protective principles of sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation.

## Issues to be determined

33     Bearing the above legal principles in mind, I considered the following issues for determination:

> (a)     The nature and severity of the accused’s mental disorder and the impact of the disorder on the commission of the offences.

> (b)     The relevant sentencing considerations on the facts of this case

> (c)     Were community orders statutorily available as a sentencing option?

> (d)     Were community orders the appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case?

## Issue 1: Nature and severity of the accused’s mental disorder and the impact of the disorder on the commission of the offences

### Contents of the psychiatric reports from Dr Lim and Dr Goh

34     Dr Lim and Dr Goh tendered two reports each. Dr Lim examined the accused in August 2019 and Dr Goh examined the accused in February 2020. Besides interviewing the accused, Dr Lim interviewed the accused’s father and Dr Goh interviewed the accused’s wife. Prosecution urged the court to place more weight on Dr Goh’s report as IMH was more independent.

#### Accused’s background and circumstances of commission of offences as reported by the accused to the psychiatrists

35     The accused relocated to Singapore from Indonesia with his parents when he was 12 years old. After he completed his polytechnic studies and national service, he signed on as a combat medic with the SAF. Whilst in the SAF he obtained an external degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and graduated with distinction in mass communications in 2012.

36     He married his wife in January 2018 and she moved in to live with him and his parents and unmarried sister in the same household. His father had been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer around 2017, and this was followed by his mother’s diagnosis for stage 3 cancer in the 2nd half of 2018 shortly after the accused returned from his honeymoon. Then a major family conflict occurred in January 2019 resulting in his wife packing her bags and leaving home. During a family meal there was an exchange between his sister and his wife, and his sister told his wife she could leave the house if she doesn’t like it, and his father had sided with his sister.

37     At the time of the offences some 5 months later, his wife was still living separately from him. The accused was also having financial worries as he was supporting his family and he also felt an urgent need to sort out his family’s housing arrangements after the fight between his family and his wife. His two paternal uncles were also afflicted with serious medical illnesses at about that time, which stressed his father out and this in turn also affected the accused.

38     As regards the commission of offences, the accused said he had struggled with the idea of using the credit card for two days to buy things for his wife and his mother and then convinced himself that he would only be borrowing from his boss. He also made up rules like he should not splurge on luxurious items and to buy things he could afford as he had the intention of returning the money to his boss. The first day he used the credit card, he felt guilty after buying shoes for his wife but not his mother, so the next day he bought a pair of shoes for his mother, and then also bought shoes for his father. He would frequent many of the shops repeatedly and at regular intervals. He bought numerous pairs of shoes for his wife and his mother even after they asked him to stop, and some of the purchased items were kept in his cupboard with the original wrapper and price tag. Of the retail items purchased with the credit card, he had bought four items for himself and the rest were for his wife and parents, and he had also bought wellness packages for himself. He had recurring thoughts as to why he did not buy things for his wife after he had bought items for his parents, and vice versa. At that time his wife was living separately from him and when he met her on weekends he would have something to give her. He had bought a lot of things for his family but kept them to give them on a later date. [^16]

#### Psychiatric opinions on the mental disorders and how they affected the accused

39     In Dr Lim’s first report dated 23 October 2019 he diagnosed the accused as suffering from OCPD, with his condition aggravated by stressful life events over two years such as both his parents being diagnosed with cancer one after another, family discord and the need to refinance his father’s housing loan. Dr Lim elaborated as follows:

> (a)     The accused’s OCPD was previously undiagnosed and it affected his good judgement and contributed to the commitment of the offences.

> (b)     The OCPD could account for some of his peculiar behaviour such as purchasing many similar items for example shoes for his wife, frequenting the same shop frequently and using the card repeatedly even though this increased his risk of being caught. He had rules about buying only things he could afford and not splurging on luxurious items. His intention of buying gifts for his parents was to his ease their pain and suffering. Hence he continued his obsessive buying even though his family had asked him to stop.

> (c)     His offences were a cry for help. His use of the credit card in a “repeated, persistent and careless” way was akin to depressed patients who shoplifted repeatedly until they were caught.

40     In his second report Dr Lim[^17] said that the OCPD had affected the accused’s good judgement and “There is indeed a causal link between the disease (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) the accused is suffering from and his conduct (the use of credit cards and lapses in his judgment)._”_

41     In Dr Goh’s forensic psychiatric report dated 3 March 2020, Dr Goh diagnosed the accused as having OCPD and also suffering from a major depressive episode around the time of the offence. In his follow-up report dated 30 April 2020, Dr Goh further explained and elaborated on how both mental conditions had contributed to his commission of the offences.

42     I reproduce both Dr Goh’s reports:

> 3 March 2020

> 24\. I am of the opinion that:

>> a)    He has obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). He also has major depressive episode around the time of the offences and he continues to have depressive symptoms now. His major depressive episode had occurred in the midst of a series of life events, such as his parents’ illnesses and his wife moving out just one year after they got married.

>> b)    The characteristics of his obsessive compulsive personality disorder (preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, control and being inflexible) and his depressive symptoms made it harder for him to cope with the changes in his life then. His Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder and major depressive episode are contributory factors to his offences, in that his offence are part of his dysfunctional way of coping during this very stressful period.

>> c)    He was not of unsound mind at and around the material time of the offences, in that he was aware of the nature and quality of his actions.

>> d)    He is currently fit to plead in a Court of Law.

>> e)    He appreciated the consequences of such wrongful acts on himself and his family and is now keen for treatment. I have started him on an antidepressant on 25th February 2020 and will continue to follow him up at our outpatient clinic.

> 30 April 2020

> 1.    I refer to your request for clarification, specifically on whether the psychiatric conditions he is suffering from contributed to his conduct (use of credit card etc and lapse in judgement).

> 2.    In my opinion, this major depressive episode and obsessive compulsive personality disorder contributed to his conduct of the alleged offences in that both these conditions made it harder for him to cope with the stressors in his life then. He had poor sleep and problems with his appetite and concentration, and lethargy from his depression, and together with his obsessive compulsive personality disorder (with his preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism and control, and being inflexible), these caused him to have difficulty in dealing with his problems effectively and impaired his judgement with regards to the criminal acts.

> 3.    His acts were his dysfunctional ways of coping and dealing with his stress and his depressive mood. He told me during his assessments that when he got the credit card and he was able to use the card without anybody stopping him, he thought it was a “godsend” and “so coincidental” even though he felt bad about it, and he rationalised to himself that he was “not harming anyone”.

### Assessment of the psychiatric reports and how the disorders impacted the accused

43     The psychiatric reports from Dr Lim and Dr Goh were agreed that the accused was mentally disordered at the relevant time and that the mental disorders had contributed to his commission of the offences. The contents of both reports were mostly consistent on the main points, save that Dr Lim was of the view that the accused’s pre-existing OCPD was aggravated by stressful life events at the relevant time, while Dr Goh was of the view that that the accused additionally suffered from a major depressive episode which occurred in the midst of a series of significant life events. I accepted the reports of both Dr Lim and Dr Goh, although I was mindful that Dr Goh was more independent. I found the contents of the reports cogent and the reasoning of both psychiatrists persuasive.

44     However I did not place any weight on Dr Lim’s use of the term “causal link” between the accused’s OCPD and the offences contained in his second report. Dr Lim did not explain the difference in terminology and what he meant by causal link. The courts have noted the conceptual distinction between causal link and contributory link: see _Chong Yee Ka v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 309</span>(“_Chong Yee Ka_”) at \[64\] and _Ho Mei Xia Hannah_ at \[38\]. I therefore assessed both the reports on the basis that the mental disorders had contributed to the accused’s commission of the offences.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on the need for a causal link and impairment of self-control and restraint

45     Prosecution submitted that the mere fact that the accused was diagnosed with OCPD and depression but without any causal link to the offending did not mean that his culpability was diminished to the extent that it warranted a significant sentencing discount. Moreover there was no explanation how the depression and OCPD contributed significantly to impair his self-control and restraint as Dr Goh’s IMH report said that the accused was “aware of the nature and quality of his actions”.[^18]

46     The cases have been consistent in that there is no requirement for an expert to opine that there must be a “causal link” between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence as opposed to the mental disorder being a contributory factor before the mental disorder assumes significance in the legal assessment by the court : see _Chong Yee Ka_ at \[79\] citing _Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 299</span> (“_Soh Meiyun”)_ at \[4\] and \[28\] where the expert had opined that the accused’s disorders were a ”contributory cause” of her offences. Moreover as the court in _Ho Mei Xia Hannah_ at \[38\] and \[40\] guided, in assessing the extent and nature of a contributory link and the commission of the offences, the court considers the expert opinions but less turns on the express terms chosen by the expert than the reasoning in the expert reports, which is persuasive and carries weight with the court. Ultimately the legal significance of any contributory link identified by the psychiatrists is a question to be decided by the sentencing court.

47     As to whether the nature and effect of an accused’s psychiatric disorder must be such as to cause him to lose control and self-restraint before it affects weight to be given to culpability and deterrence, in _Ho Mei Xia Hannah_ it was noted that the courts have consistently accepted that two types of impairment are relevant in determining weight to be accorded to deterrence and in assessing culpability – first, where the mental disorder affects the offender’s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint, and second, where the mental disorder diminishes the offender’s ability to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of the act, and which may relate to the offender’s knowledge of the legal or moral wrongfulness of his actions : see _Ho Mei Xia Hannah_ at \[38\] and \[40\].

48     The significance of any contributory link identified by the psychiatrists is a fact-specific exercise, as no two cases are similar and the same type of mental disorder may affect different persons in varying degrees and in diverse circumstances: see _Chong Yee Ka_ at \[80\] and _Public Prosecutor v Kong Peng Yee_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 295</span> (“_Kong Peng Yee”)_ at \[60\]. That the accused was “aware of the nature and quality of his actions” formed part of Dr Goh’s opinion that the accused was _“_not of unsound mind at the material time, in that he was aware of the nature and quality of his actions”[^19] and should therefore be read in the context of that statement, and also within context of the whole report that the accused’s mental disorders had contributed to his commission of the offences. Dr Goh was elaborating on his statement that the accused was not of unsound mind as he was aware of the nature and quality of his actions. Clearly the accused remained culpable for his acts as he was of sound mind and aware of the nature and quality of his acts, but his culpability had been lowered by his mental disorders as both had operated to contribute to the commission of the offences.

49     Keeping in mind that the court’s assessment was not a quantitative exercise, I noted that Dr Goh opined that the accused suffered from two mental disorders, and he had characterised the depression as a “major” depressive episode. Dr Goh had explained that both the mental disorders had contributed to the commission of the offences and elaborated on how they had affected the accused resulting in dysfunctional responses. Both disorders had adversely affected his ability to cope with his life stressors. His poor sleep, appetite, concentration and lethargy from his depression together with his OCPD preoccupations had caused him difficulties in coping effectively with his life stressors and had impaired his judgment as regards the criminal acts, and the criminal acts were his dysfunctional ways of coping with his stress and depressive mood. Dr Lim described the accused’s OCPD as being aggravated at the relevant time by the stressful life events he had been experiencing for two years which had affected his good judgment, and his repetitive use of the credit cards was a cry for help akin to depressed patients who shoplifted until they were caught. I was satisfied that the accused’s state of mind and thinking processes were operating under the weight and impact of two mental disorders at the relevant time which had impaired his judgement and ability to make proper choices.

50     The extent of the accused’s disordered and warped thinking about the repeated use of the credit card was also revealed in the reports. The accused said he thought the credit cards were some sort of serendipitous “godsend” as he could keep using it without anyone stopping him. He also rationalised that he was not harming anyone, and had felt guilty after first using the credit card not because of the wrongfulness of his acts, but because he did not buy anything for his mother but had bought shoes for his wife. His mental preoccupations to square-up the gift purchases for his wife and his family were a product of his disordered mind. His actions were not merely maladaptive responses to his life stressors but emanated from his impaired mind and judgement arising from his mental disorders. The accused had said that he had struggled for two days before using the credit card and had also felt bad about using it. While this showed that the accused had some sensing that using the credit cards was improper, he was unable because of his mental disorders to make proper and rational judgment as ordinary people with ordinary cognitive and rationality could. The acts were wholly out of character with the account of his background, and the accused was also gainfully employed at the relevant time and harboured no animosity towards his boss. I was satisfied that the two mental disorders were serious enough to have hampered his good judgement and had contributed to the offending conduct in diminishing his capacity to fully appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his choices and to make proper and rational decisions.

## Issue 2: The relevant sentencing considerations on the facts of this case

### Deterrence the primary sentencing consideration in credit card offences

51     Whilst there is a need for rehabilitation in this case, it must be weighed against deterrence as the key sentencing consideration. The court in _Fernando Payagala_ had considered the general principles for credit card offences under section 420 of the Penal Code and stated at \[88\] :

> …Offences involving credit cards inevitably warrant severe treatment, save in exceptional cases. Given the pre-eminence and pervasiveness of credit cards as a preferred mode of payment in day-to-day commerce, such recurrent offences threaten to grievously undermine both its reliability as a mode of payment as well as the entire security of our credit infrastructure……Offenders must expect to face harsh custodial sentences; general deterrence is a vital if not paramount consideration in assessing how severe the sentence should be in any given case.

52     Although _Fernando Payagala_ involved an accused facing misappropriation and aggravated cheating charges under section 420, the court’s observations on how credit card offences undermine the security of our credit infrastructure are applicable to credit card offences generally and deterrence would be the key sentencing consideration.

53     As for the sentencing benchmarks, the court at \[86\] opined that sentences of imprisonment in the range of two to six months jail would be appropriate for first offenders facing section 403 charges involving credit cards. The accused had misappropriated a credit card belonging to a passenger seated next to him while on-flight from New Zealand to Singapore and had whilst on transit in Singapore made fraudulent purchases with the misappropriated credit card. His sentence was enhanced to two months jail on appeal in respect of the section 403 charge.

54     As for section 417 cheating charges, the court in _Idya Nurhazlyn_ at \[47\] and \[48\] stated that the primary yardstick will be the value of the property involved, and noted that where the misuse of a financial instrument or facility threatens the conduct of commerce the need for general deterrence is likely to take centre stage, citing _Fernando Payagala_. For section 417 Penal Code offences a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate if the victim parts with property that has more than negligible value.

55     The court observed that jail terms of between four to eight months jail had been imposed for cheating offences that resulted in losses of between $1000 and $15000. In _Idya Nurhzlyn_, the accused drew a cheque knowing it would be dishonoured and ordered electronic goods worth $10,509. The 3-month jail sentence was affirmed on appeal. The court was of the view that the substantial aggravating factors on the facts : use of a dud cheque, committing the offence whilst under investigation for another cheating offence, and the careful planning involved, had negated the mitigating value of the restitution made by the accused, at \[51\].

56     Therefore in the case of credit card offences, the key sentencing consideration is deterrence and offenders can generally expect a substantial custodial sentence.

#### Prosecution’s submissions that the accused was motivated by greed and that his acts were premeditated and deliberate

57     Prosecution submitted that the accused was motivated by greed. He had used the credit card to purchase luxury items for his wife and family, and for himself as well, and deterrence was paramount. The offences were also premediated and deliberate and specific deterrence was relevant.

58     It was not disputed that the accused had used the credit card to purchase some items for himself. He said this comprised four of the items in the proceeded charge, and Prosecution did not dispute that most of the items were purchased for his wife and his parents. That the items purchased were luxury items was disputed by the accused. The accused had also told Dr Lim that he had made up his own rules to only purchase items he could afford as he intended to return the money to his boss. Whether the items were luxury items or not did not easily lend itself to objective classification on the facts of this case. What could be said was that many of the items the accused purchased were of substantial value, and ranged from tens of dollars to hundreds of dollars. In addition to the two vacuum cleaners the accused said he bought to clear up his father’s dry skin from the cancer treatment, the vast majority of the purchases comprised copious quantities of apparels, shoes and other wearables for both sexes, and he had revisited some of the shops over and over again to buy more things[^20]. The accused was enmeshed in a gift-buying cycle for his wife, then his mother, his father, driven by recurring thoughts and guilt of why he did not buy for his wife after buying for his parents, and vice versa[^21]. Having regard to all the circumstances I was unable to find from the facts or to infer that the accused was indeed driven by greed or pecuniary benefit. Although he derived some personal gain from a few of the purchases, the buying spree was driven by multiple motives under the haze of his mental disorders.

59     I agreed with Prosecution that the offences were premeditated, in the sense that the acts were not committed at the spur of the moment and the accused had time to consider his actions, both before he started using the credit card and over the several weeks that he continued to use it. His acts were deliberate and I agreed with Prosecution that specific deterrence remained relevant although to a far more limited extent because of his mental disorders. However unlike the accused in _Idya Nurhazlyn_, the facts did not suggest that the premeditation here had involved any careful or high degree of planning or detailed execution by the accused. Rather the accused had made repeated visits to a number of the merchants to make purchases and Dr Lim had described his acts as repetitive and careless as they increased his chances of being caught. And although the accused had time to contemplate his acts, his capacity to weigh and make rational choices was diminished by his mental disorders which had hampered his judgement. The accused was far less culpable than the accused in _Idya Nurhazlyn_, and his offending lacked many of the aggravating features present in that case.

### Deterrence, Retribution and mentally disordered offenders

60     General deterrence is premised on the cognitive normalcy of the offender and the potential offenders sought to be deterred, as it “assumes persons of ordinary emotions motivations and impulses who are able to appreciate the nature and consequences of their actions and who behave with ordinary rationality, for whom the threat of punishment would be a disincentive to engage in criminal conduct”: _Soh Meiyun_ at \[43\].

61     As for specific deterrence, this assumes that the offender can weigh consequences before committing an offence and is unlikely to be effective when the offender’s mental disorder “seriously inhibited his ability to make proper choices or appreciate the nature and quality of his actions_”_: _Lim Ghim Peow_ at \[36\].

62     The weight to be accorded to deterrence as a sentencing consideration when dealing with a mentally disordered offender is a multi-factorial exercise and depends on all the facts of the case, including the nature and seriousness of the mental disorder, how the mental disorder impacted the commission of the offences, the likelihood of recidivism and the seriousness of the crime.

63     Retribution is also a relevant sentencing consideration. The section 417 charge involved 103 victims defrauded and a total sum of $20,642.48 and had spanned several weeks, and the two other section 417 charges taken into consideration involved 26 victims and a sum of $2,276.37. The punishment should reflect both the harm done by the offence and the offender’s culpability in committing the offence, and the punishment should fit the crime. While retribution generally does not easily lend itself as the dominant sentencing consideration,[^22] where the offence is serious, retribution may prevail against the needs of rehabilitation for a mentally disordered offender: see _Lim Ghim Peow_ at \[39\] and _PP v ASR_ \[2019\]1 SLR 941 _(“ASR”_) at \[131\] and \[132\].

64     The court in _GCX v Public Prosecutor_ \[2019\] 3SLR 1325 _(“GCX_”) at \[78\] had rejected the argument that rehabilitation can only be found to be the dominant consideration if there was a causal link between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence. Whether rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration would involve finding the right balance between the various sentencing considerations.

65     Although deterrence was engaged as the primary sentencing consideration as credit cards were involved in the offences, Dr Goh’s report had identified that the accused was suffering from two mental disorders, with both disorders contributing to his offending. The accused’s mental disorders were serious enough to impact affect his ability to make proper and rational choices and decisions and to fully appreciate the wrongfulness of the acts, and both had operated on his state of mind and contributed to the commission of the offences. This not only substantially diminished his culpability, it also reduced the significance of both general and specific deterrence on the facts of this case.

66     General deterrence does not seek to make an example of an offender whose disordered state of mind impairs his ability to make proper and rational choices and decisions, and carries substantially less weight in the circumstances of this case. The ordinary person will be aware that this case involves an accused whose mental judgement is impaired and offenders involved in credit card offences will still generally expect to face harsh custodial sentences. Specific deterrence also assumes less significance because the accused’s mental disorders inhibited his ability to make proper and rational choices and contributed to his dysfunctional responses.

67     As for retribution, I had weighed the numerous occasions he had used the credit card, the span of several weeks over which the offending had taken place, the number of victims and the sums involved. In this case the weight to be given to retribution was reduced as the accused bore a substantially diminished culpability for his actions. He was suffering from mental disorders during that period which had bearing both on his mind and his actions which emanated therefrom. Dr Lim had described his use of the credit cards as repeated persistent and careless, akin to depressed patients who shoplifted repeatedly until they were caught. His aggravated OCPD had also accounted for some of his peculiar behaviour in buying many similar items and using the card repeatedly for “obsessive buying”.[^23]

68     As for the harm caused by his actions, without doubt the accused’s acts had the effect of undermining the reliability of the credit cards as a mode of payment, and the amalgamated sum involved was large. However the accused had made full restitution and the economic harm suffered by the victims had been ameliorated by the full and voluntary restitution made by the accused.

69     There were also many positive factors pointing to a rehabilitative sentence. The prospects of rehabilitation for the accused were good. His lack of any previous offending strongly indicated that his criminal acts occurring in the midst of stressful life events and whilst suffering what Dr Goh had opined to be a major depressive episode were out of character and one-off in nature. The accused was also receiving treatment at IMH, and he had found employment again. His wife had also returned to live with him and could provide him the necessary familial support.

70     All things considered, I was of the view that rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration, and deterrence and retribution had diminished in significance, and neither demanded a custodial sentence of imprisonment on the fact of this case.

71     As the accused had good rehabilitative potential and rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration, the court should call for a Mandatory Treatment Order suitability report, unless community orders were statutorily excluded: _GCX_ at \[31\] \[37\] and \[41\].

## Issue 3: Were community orders available as a sentencing option?

72     A section 417 Penal Code cheating charge is punishable with an imprisonment term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Ordinarily a court may sentence such an offender to community orders as it is not an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds three years jail and does not fall within the ambit of section 337(1)(i) of the CPC. However as the accused faced a section 417 Penal Code cheating charge amalgamated under section 124(4) of the CPC, section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC provides that the court may sentence such an offender to two times the amount of punishment to which he would be liable if he had been charged and convicted of any one of the incidents. The issue was whether the section 417 offence the accused faced was to be considered an offence “punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds 3 years” within the meaning of section 337(1)(i) of the CPC in these circumstances. If it was, then the court is statutorily excluded from making any community orders, unless the exceptions in sections 337(2) and 337(3) of the CPC apply.

73     The issue turned on the statutory interpretation to be given to section 337(1)(i) of the CPC.

74     Prosecution submitted that as the amalgamated cheating charge was punishable with a term which may extend to six years by virtue of section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, community orders cannot be imposed. Not all amalgamated offences will necessarily disallow the passing of community orders, but where the sentencing jurisdiction of the court is enhanced above the three-year statutory limit, community sentences cannot be imposed because of the relative gravity of the amalgamated offence. This coheres with parliamentary intent that community-based sentences are for minor offences. Any series of acts amalgamated under section 124(4) of the CPC would be more serious than any of the stand-alone acts, and the undertaking of an extended criminal course of conduct would typically engage the sentencing consideration of deterrence. Defence submitted that the accused was entitled to the “protection” of section 337(1) of the CPC and “Even if the Court takes the position that **section 124(4)** is applicable and so also **Section 124(8)**, **this would be subject** to defences that can be raised for the accused”.

75     If Prosecution’s interpretation were correct, an amalgamated charge comprising even the minimum two instances of offending of any offence which attracts a maximum sentence of anything above eighteen months imprisonment would fall within the ambit of section 337(1)(i) of the CPC and the regime of community orders statutorily excluded for an accused. Such a charge would attract the courts’ enhanced sentencing powers under section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC to sentence such an accused to more than three years jail. As for Defence, I had much difficulty making out their arguments as to how section 337(1)(i) should be interpreted.

### Statutory interpretation framework

76     As the issue was one of statutory interpretation, I turned to _Tan Cheng Bock v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 850</span> (“_Tan Cheng Bock_”) at \[37\] which set out the three-step approach to purposive interpretation of statutes:

> (a)    First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole.

> (b)    Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute.

> (c)    Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.

77     In determining the possible interpretations of a provision, the court interprets the words of the provision and can be aided by a number of rules and canons of statutory interpretation. The court further guided that in formulating the legislative purpose of a provision one turns first to the text of the relevant legislative provision itself and its statutory context, and the textual sources from which one can derive the purpose of a particular provision such as the long title of a statute, the words used in the legislative provision, other legislative provisions within the statute, and the structure of the statute and the location of the provision within the statute may also be relevant. Consideration of extraneous material like Parliamentary debates may only be had in three situations: _Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[38\],\[42\], \[44\] and \[54\]

### Plain and ordinary meaning of Section 337(1)(i) of the CPC

78     So did the plain and ordinary meaning of the text in section 337(1)(i) within its statutory context refer to the punishment for an offence as prescribed in the offence-creating section (“prescribed punishment”), or to the enhanced punishment that a court could mete out to an accused under section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC when an accused faces an amalgamated charge?

79     The plain and ordinary words in section 337(1)(i) would in the ordinary case be read as referring to the prescribed punishment for the offence under the offence-creating provision. If the prescribed punishment for an offence exceeds three years, it is an offence falling within section 337(1)(i) and the court cannot exercise any of its powers to make community orders unless the exceptions in subsection (2) or (3) of section 337 apply. The second possible interpretation of section 337(1)(i) arises where, as in this case, an accused faces an amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the CPC, which engages the courts’ enhanced powers under section 124(8)(a)(ii) to sentence the accused to two times the amount of punishment to which the accused would have been liable.

80      _Tan Cheng Bock_ had guided that a purposive and not a literal approach should be adopted. Further in ascertaining the possible interpretations of legislative text, this is done not by examining the provision in isolation but by having regard to the context of that text within the statute as a whole.

81     Section 337(1) is contained in Part XVII of the CPC titled “Community Sentences”. Section 337(1) is the first operative provision in Part XVII and appears under the title “Community Orders”, and immediately after the interpretation and meaning provisions in sections 335 and 336 respectively.

82     I reproduce section 337(1) of the CPC :

> **Community orders**

> **337.—(1**)    Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a court shall not exercise any of its powers under this Part to make any community order in respect of —

>> (_a_)    an offence for which the sentence is fixed by law;

>> (_b_)    an offence for which any of the following is prescribed by law:

>>> (i)    a specified minimum sentence of imprisonment or caning;

>>> (ii)   a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, fine or caning;

>> (_c_)    an offence which is specified in the Third Schedule to the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap. 268);

>> (_d_)    a person who had previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 3 months, other than a term of imprisonment served by him in default of payment of a fine;

>> (_e_)    a person who had previously been sentenced to corrective training or preventive detention;

>> (_f_)    a person who had previously been detained or subject to police supervision under section 30(1) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap. 67);

>> (_g_)    a person who has been admitted —

>>> (i)    at least twice to an approved institution under section 34 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (called in this section an approved institution);

>>> (ii)   at least twice to an approved centre under section 17 of the Intoxicating Substances Act (Cap. 146A) (called in this section an approved centre); or

>>> (iii)   at least once to an approved institution, and at least once to an approved centre;

>> (_ga_)   an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations (Cap. 185, Rg 1) or the Intoxicating Substances Act, if the offender had previously been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre;

>> (_h_)    a fine-only offence; or

>> (_i_)    an offence which is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds 3 years.

> (2)  A court may not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of any case referred to in subsection (1) except that it may do so under section 339 even if the offender —

>> (_a_)    is a person mentioned in subsection (1)(_d_) or (_g_);

>> (_b_)    is convicted of an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations or the Intoxicating Substances Act, after having previously been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre; or

>> (_c_)    is convicted of an offence that is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 3 years but not exceeding 7 years, and is prescribed.

> (3)    A court may not make a community work order in respect of any case referred to in subsection (1) except that it may do so under section 344 even if the offender is convicted of ––

>> (_a_)    a fine-only offence; or

>> (_b_)    an offence for which a mandatory minimum sentence of fine is prescribed by law.

83     Section 337(1) sets out ten instances where the court shall not exercise its powers to make any community orders. These ten instances are defined by reference either to offence-type or to the offender’s antecedent, and in the case of section 337(1)(ga) by reference to both offence-type and the offender’s antecedent conduct.

84     Of the six exclusionary instances in section 337(1) defined by reference to offence-type (limbs (a),(b),(c),(ga),(h) and (i)), four of them are expressed by reference to the sentences that the offence carries (limbs (a), (b), (h) and (i)).

85     Section 337(1) is subject to sections 337(2) and 337(3). These latter two subsections provide for selected situations where the court may still make a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) and a community work order (“CWO”) respectively. In particular, section 337(2)(c) provides that a court may not order an MTO in a case falling within subsection (1) except that it may do so if the offender is convicted of a prescribed offence that is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years.

86     Section 337(1)(i) is the last exclusionary limb within section 337(1). As regards the preceding three limbs in section 337(1) defined by reference to the sentences the offence carries (that is, limbs (a), (b), (h)) the plain and ordinary reading of each of these limbs is that they refer to the sentences in the prescribed punishment laid down for the relevant offences. In a similar way, the reference to an offence which is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds three years in limb (i) would on a plain and ordinary reading refer to the prescribed punishment for the offence.

87     The textual formulation used in section 337(1)(i) _“_an offence which is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds 3 years” is also used in section 337(2)(c) of the CPC:_“_ an offence that is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 3 years but not exceeding 7 years, and is prescribed_”_. These two provisions are closely linked, as Section 337(2)(c) empowers a court to make an MTO even if the offender is convicted of an offence that is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding three years under section 337(1)(i), if the offence does not exceed seven years and is prescribed by regulations.

88     It is notable that Section 337(2)(c) specifically sets out a lower limit of “a term exceeding 3 years” in respect of offences that may be prescribed for the making of an MTO. Under prosecution’s proposed reading of section 337(1)(c), there will be a substantial group of offences with a maximum term of imprisonment above eighteen months and up to three years that will be excluded from community orders when an accused faces an amalgamated charge, yet these offences cannot be prescribed under section 337(2)(c) which only provides that offences carrying imprisonment terms of more than three years and less that seven years jail can be prescribed. Parliament shuns tautology and redundancy, and the court should attempt to give significance to every word in a statute: _Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[38\]. The lower limit of “a term exceeding 3 years” in section 337(2)(c) has significance. Reading sections 337(1)(i) and 337(2)(c) together, the plain and ordinary meaning is that section 337(2)(c) enables MTOs to be ordered, without leaving any lacuna, that group of offences with maximum prescribed punishments exceeding three years which would otherwise be excluded from all community orders under section 337(1)(i).

89     Parliament is also presumed not to have intended an unworkable or impracticable result, so an interpretation that leads to such a result would not be regarded as a possible one: _Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[38\]. Prosecution’s reading of section 337(1)(c) would result in an anomalous situation of mentally disordered offenders facing amalgamated charges for offences carrying maximum prescribed punishment of more than eighteen months and up to three years jail who will not be eligible for any sort of community orders at all, while mentally disordered offenders in similar circumstances committing more serious offences carrying maximum prescribed punishments above three years and up to seven years jail are eligible for MTOs.

### Legislative purpose of section 337(1)(i) and section 124(8) of the CPC

90     The CPC is “An Act relating to criminal procedure” and sets out the procedures to be followed in the conduct of criminal cases in Singapore. Part XVII lays out the Community Sentences regime introduced in 2010, and lays out the types of community orders that can be made by a court including the procedures for making them, conditions that may be imposed, powers to vary the orders, and the consequences of non-compliance with the orders. The purpose of Part XVII as gleaned from the text is to expand the sentencing options by empowering the court to pass community-based sentences in appropriate cases.

91     The courts’ powers to make community orders is statutorily circumscribed by the ten instances laid down in section 337(1)(c) of the CPC, subject to the limited exceptions in sections 337(2) and (3) to make MTOs and CWOs respectively. If a case does not fall within the ten instances, it is a matter of sentencing discretion for the court whether or not to make any community orders in any particular case.

92     The legislative purpose of section 337(1) is to exclude certain offence-specific and offender-specific instances from the community sentence regime, where Parliament has decided as a matter of policy that the community-based regime and rationale should not apply. Parliament has deemed offenders with certain antecedent-type, for example offenders who have undergone corrective training, preventive detention, drug-related admissions to approved institutions and centres as being unsuitable for community orders whatever their current offences and circumstances of offending may be, and disqualified from the courts’ consideration for community orders. As regards the other section 337(1) offence-specific exclusions, Parliament has also deemed such offences, whether by the nature of the offences or the sentences that they carry, for example, an offence specified in third Schedule of the Registration of Criminals Act, an offence where the sentence is fixed by law or a fine-only offence, as unsuitable for consideration of community orders by the court.

93     As regards limb (i) of section 337(1), Parliament has decided that an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds three years is unsuitable for punishment by any sort of community orders. However section 337(1)(i) is made subject to section 337(2)(c) which provides for a limited exception by permitting only MTOs to be ordered where an offender is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years, where the offence is prescribed by regulations. From its text and context, the purpose of section 337(2)(c) is to expand MTO-eligibility to offenders facing more serious charges, which will otherwise be excluded by section 337(1)(i). The legislative intent is that MTOs may in suitable cases be ordered both for mentally disordered offenders convicted of offences punishable by maximum jail terms of up to three years, as well as for those who are convicted of more serious prescribed offences punishable by maximum jail terms exceeding three years and less than seven years, which Parliament deems suitable for the community-based sentencing regime despite the more serious nature of the offences.

94     I turn now to the text and legislative purpose of sections 124(4) and 124(8) of the CPC.

95     Section 124 is contained within Part VII of the CPC under the chapter title “The Charge”. Section 124 is titled “Details of time, place and person or thing”. Section 124(1) sets out the general requirement that charges must contain details of the time, place, person and thing, such as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of what he is charged with. Section 124(2) provides that despite section 124(1), in relation to the specified offences, it will be sufficient to specify the gross sum involved in the offence and the 12-month period within which the offence was committed, and the charge so framed is deemed to be a charge of one offence. As for section 124(4) it provides that where an accused commits two or more incidents of the same offence which amount to a course of conduct it is sufficient to frame one charge for all the alleged offences if certain conditions are met, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence. Section 124(8) provides that where a charge is framed under subsections (2) or (4) of section 124 of the CPC, the court may sentence a person convicted to two times the amount of punishment the accused would otherwise have been liable.

96     Sections 124(4) and 124(8) are reproduced:

> **124-(4**)    Despite subsections (1) and (2) and section 132, where 2 or more incidents of the commission of the same offence by the accused are alleged, and those alleged incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct (having regard to the time, place or purpose of each alleged incident) —

>> (_a_)    it is sufficient to frame one charge for all of those alleged incidents, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

>>> (i)    the charge —

>>>> (A)    contains a statement that the charge is amalgamated under this subsection;

>>>> (B)    either —

>>>>> (BA)   specifies the number of separate incidents of the commission of that offence that are alleged, without specifying each particular alleged incident; or

>>>>> (BB)   if the causing of a particular outcome is an element of that offence, contains details of the aggregate outcome caused by all of those alleged incidents, without specifying the particular outcome caused by each particular alleged incident;

>>>> (C)    contains a statement that all of those alleged incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct; and

>>>> (D)    specifies the dates between which all of those incidents are alleged to have occurred, without specifying the exact date for each particular alleged incident;

>>> (ii)   if a separate charge had been framed in respect of each of those incidents, the maximum punishment for the offence specified in each separate charge would be the same maximum punishment;

>>> (iii)   the charge so framed does not specify any offence punishable with death; and

>> (_b_)    the charge so framed is deemed to be a charge of one offence.

> **124-(8**)    Subject to subsection (7), where a charge is framed under subsection (2) or (4), and a person is convicted of the offence specified in that charge —

>> (_a_)    the court may sentence that person —

>>> (i)    in any case where the charge is framed under subsection (2) — to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable for that offence; or

>>> (ii)   in any case where the charge is framed under subsection (4) — to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would otherwise have been liable if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence mentioned in that subsection; but

>> (_b_)    any sentence of caning imposed by the court in respect of that offence must not exceed the specified limit in section 328.

97     The legislative purpose of sections 124(2) and (4) of the CPC as gleaned from the text and context is to permit the framing of amalgamated charges against an accused when certain conditions are met to ensure that the accused is not prejudiced and has sufficient notice of the offences he is facing, without requiring prosecution to specify the time place date person or thing of each offence. As for section 124(8) the court is empowered to sentence an accused facing amalgamated charges under sections 124(2) and 124(4) to double the maximum sentence in appropriate cases.

98     Statutorily there is no numerical upper limit placed on the number of offences that can be amalgamated within a single charge. Therefore a series of serious offending contained in a single amalgamated charge may potentially result in a sentencing discount to the accused if the sentence is limited to the maximum permitted under a single offending instance. The distinct and specific purpose of section 124(8) of the CPC is directed at ensuring that the court’s sentencing powers are enhanced to address the mischief of an accused possibly receiving as sentencing discount when the amalgamated charge is of sufficient gravity to merit a sentence beyond the maximum sentence for a single offending instance.

99     Conversely a section 124 amalgamated charge may comprise only a minimum of two incidents. Under Prosecution’s proposed interpretation that section 337(1)(c) be read by reference to the court’s enhanced sentencing powers in section 124(8), an amalgamated charge consisting of even two such incidents would be automatically statutorily excluded from the community sentences regime should the maximum prescribed punishment for that offence exceed eighteen months’ imprisonment. Moreover in the case of an accused facing an offence carrying a maximum prescribed punishment of three years jail, he would also be statutorily excluded from community orders if his two charges were amalgamated, but not if he had been separately charged. If it was indeed the legislative intent that the purpose of section 124(8) was also to circumscribe the community orders regime in such material ways beyond addressing the specific mischief of a potential sentencing discount arising from charges amalgamated under section 124, clear legislative text would have been used to make that legislative purpose plain.

100    From its text, context and legislative purpose, Section 124(8) is essentially an enabling provision to increase the sentencing powers of the court when dealing with amalgamated charges framed under sections 124(2) and 124(4). There is nothing from the text, context and legislative purpose of section 124(8) to suggest that it was intended to be have anything to do with the regime of community sentences under Part XVII, nor with section 337(1)(i) to restrict community orders to offences carrying a maximum punishment of up to eighteen months jail only whenever an accused an amalgamated charge is framed against an accused.

101    The meaning I have ascribed to section 337(1) aligns with the legislative purpose of the relevant provisions in Part VII and Part XVII of the CPC. As for extraneous material, at this stage the court may consider extraneous material only to confirm the plain and ordinary meaning of the text, to ascertain the meaning of the text when the provision on its face is ambiguous or capable of more than one meaning, or to ascertain the meaning of the text where the ordinary meaning is absurd or unreasonable. As it was my view that the legislative purposes of the relevant provisions support the one plain and ordinary reading of section 337(1)(i) of the CPC, extraneous material may be considered to confirm but not to alter that textual reading. The weight to be placed on such extraneous material will depend on the clarity of the material and whether the material is directed to the very point in dispute: _AG v Ting Choon Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 373</span> (“_Ting Choon Meng”_) at \[71(h)\].

### Extraneous materials align with reading of the text and the legislative purpose

102    I briefly set out the legislative history of sections 337 and 124 as they shed light on and are consistent with the legislative purpose of the provisions as gleaned from the text.

103    The regime of community sentences was introduced via the Criminal Procedure Code Bill in 2010 (“CPC Bill 2010”) and section 337(1) had set out nine instances in limbs (a) to (i) where community orders are statutorily excluded. Section 337 in CPC Bill 2010 provided that community orders shall not be passed in respect of offences for which the sentence is fixed by law, or which attract a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning, the serious offences set out in the Third Schedule of the Registration of Criminals Act, offences punishable with a maximum sentence of more than three years jail. Community orders were also excluded for offenders who have been detained or under police supervision orders made under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, detained in a drug or substance abuse institution, or sentenced to imprisonment, reformative training, corrective training or preventive detention.

104    Section 337(1)(i) in its present textual form was introduced via the CPC Bill 2010 and has remained unchanged. The 2010 version of Section 337(2) had set out in two instances in limbs (a) and (b) where a MTO can be ordered, that is, if an offender had previously been sentenced to a jail term, or if he had been previously detained in a drug or substance abuse institution. Section 337(3) provided that a CWO could be ordered in two instances set out in limbs (a) and (b), that is, an offender is convicted of an offence which is punishable by fine only or for which the specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence is a fine.

105    The explanatory notes to the CPC 2010 Bill do not shed light on the interpretation issue. However the Second Reading of the 2010 CPC Bill [^24] stated that the nine exclusionary instances in section 337(1) represented offences or offenders who had been deemed by Parliament not to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum. Minister of Law Mr K Shanmugam said:

> CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such cases, it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefits from the focused treatment.

> ….Community sentences cannot be handed down for the serious offences which are specified in the Third Schedule of the Registration of Criminals Act. Offences which are punishable with a maximum sentence of more than three years’ imprisonment are also excluded from the community sentencing framework.

106    Amendments were made to sections 337 of the CPC via the Criminal Justice Reform Act in 2018. Section 337(1) was amended such that community orders can be made for offenders who have been sentenced to short imprisonment terms not exceeding three months, or to reformative training, or who have who have been admitted once to an approved institution for drug abuse and never been admitted to an approved centre for substance abuse, and vice versa.

107    As regards section 337(2) this was amended to provide that an MTO can be now ordered in three instances for a case falling within section 337(1), that is, even if an offender had previously been sentenced to a jail term exceeding three months or who had two previous admissions for drug or substance abuse (new limb (a)), or if he had one previous drug or substance abuse conviction and one previous drug or substance admission (new limb (b)), and for offences which are punishable with jail terms exceeding three years but not exceeding seven years which have been prescribed (new limb (c)).

108    These 2018 amendments expanded the pool of offences and offenders for whom community orders could be considered by the courts, both by reducing the scope of the exclusionary provisions in section 337(1), as well as expanding the exceptions to section 337(1)(i) where an MTO can be ordered under section 337(2)(c).

109    The explanatory notes to the Criminal Justice Reform Bill do not shed light on the interpretation issue. However the Parliamentary intent of these amendments was articulated during the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill[^25]. Specific mention was made of MTOs, that they should be expanded and made available for certain more serious offences. The Senior Minister of State for Law Ms Indranee Rajah cited the case of a pharmacy student charged for theft of laptop at the university hostel who was diagnosed with major depressive order, sentenced to two years MTO and successfully completed his studies. She said :

> It is because of cases like this, that we see value in expanding the eligibility criteria for community sentences, so that more offenders can benefit from the rehabilitative opportunities offered by the community sentences. This will have to be done in a controlled manner, to strike the right balance with deterring crime.

> …Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) will be made available for a prescribed list of more serious offences, which are punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment. This is up from the current availability of MTOs only for offences punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment.

110    As for section 124(4) of the CPC, this was a new provision introduced into the CPC via the same Criminal Justice Reform Act in 2018, which expanded the eligibility pool of offences and offenders for community orders. Prior to the 2018 amendments, section 124 of the CPC consisted only of two subsections: subsection (1) in its present textual form and subsection (2) which provided that a charge for criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation need only specify the gross sum and the dates between which the offences occurred in a 12-month period.

111    When community sentences and section 337(1)(i) were first introduced via CPC Bill 2010, the court did not have enhanced sentencing powers to deal with amalgamated charges. At that time the text of section 337(1)(i) could only have referred to the prescribed punishment in the offence-creating section for the offence faced by an accused, even if the charge was amalgamated under the then section 124(2).

112    The Criminal Justice Reform Act expanded section 124 of the CPC from two subsections into ten subsections. Subsection (2) was amended to widen the list of offences that could be framed in a single charge, subsection (4) was introduced to permit amalgamation of charges constituting a course of conduct into a single charge under certain conditions, and subsection (8) was introduced to double the court’s sentencing powers when dealing with charges amalgamated under subsections (2) and (4).

113    Section 124(8) was in fact introduced at the same time that the scope for amalgamating charges was expanded under section 124(2) and the new section 124(4) introduced, and this further reinforced that the legislative purpose of section 124(8) as gleaned from the text was to address the specific mischief of sentencing discounts that may arise with the expanded powers to amalgamate charges.

114    The explanatory statement to the Bill introducing section 124(8) also reinforced that its purpose was to deal with the expanded amalgamation powers contained in sections 124(2) and (4):

> to provide (in the new section 124(8)) that where a person is convicted of an offence specified in an amalgamated charge framed under the new section 124(2) or (4) —

>> (i)    the court may sentence that person to 2 times the amount of punishment to which that person would (apart from the new section 124(8)) have been liable for that offence (if the charge is framed under the new section 124(2)), or if that person had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence mentioned in the new section 124(4) (if the charge is framed under the new section 124(4)); but

115    Aside from the Parliamentary speeches and the timeline of the amendments, I observed that the offences that have in fact been prescribed by regulations pursuant to section 337(2)(c) for which the court may consider making a MTO are consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning ascribed to both section 337(1)(i) and 337(2)(c) of the CPC and align with the legislative intent of these provisions.

116    The prescribed offences under the Criminal Procedure Code (Prescribed Offences For Mandatory Treatment Orders) Regulations 2018 include sections 281, 295, 379A, 380, and 428 Penal Code offences, as well as under sections 6A(b) or 6C of the Women’s Charter. These prescribed offences encompass a wide spectrum ranging from theft in dwelling, theft of motor vehicle, causing mischief by killing or maiming any animal, using public telephone to make obscene or indecent communications to emergency telephone numbers, and commission of bigamy. Notwithstanding that these are more serious offences carrying maximum imprisonment terms of either five or seven years as specified in their respective offence-creating provisions, they have been deemed by Parliament to still be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum and suitable for consideration for MTOs in the case of mentally disordered offenders.

117    Even if Prosecution’s proposed reading of section 337(1)(i) could somehow be cascaded into the reading of section 337(2)(c) to cater for amalgamated charges and permit for offences with a maximum punishment of up to three years imprisonment to be prescribed to address the lacuna caused by the proposed reading, not a single offence that has in fact been prescribed under section 337(2)(c) carries a maximum jail term of anything less than five years.

118    For example theft of motor-vehicles and shop theft under sections 379A and 380 of the Penal Code have both been prescribed under section 337(2)(c) of the CPC. These are generally regarded as aggravated forms of theft carrying jail terms of up to seven years, compared to what is generally regarded as simple theft in section 379 of the Penal Code which carries a jail term of up to three years jail. That only aggravated forms of theft have been specifically prescribed as permitted for the making of MTOs and not simple theft under section 379 is consistent with the plain meaning and legislative intent that section 337(1)(i) refers only to the prescribed punishment, the underlying premise being that simple theft under section 379 of the Penal Code does not in any event fall under the section 337(1)(i) exclusion in the first place. Otherwise the resulting anomaly would be that a mentally disordered accused facing an amalgamated charge for simple theft is excluded from community orders, whereas a similarly mentally disordered accused facing an amalgamated charge for aggravated theft under sections 379A or 380 of the Penal Code would be eligible for an MTO as these aggravated forms of theft have been prescribed.

119    All things considered, the reading proposed by Prosecution did not align with the general legislative intent articulated in the 2018 Second Reading speeches that community orders in general and also MTOs should be made available to a larger pool of offences and offenders. Section 124(8) enhancing the courts’ sentencing powers to deal with amalgamated charges was introduced in the same Criminal Justice Reform Bill that expanded the criteria of offenders eligible for community orders. Yet there was nothing in the Second Reading speech that suggested section 337(1)(i) should be read with reference to section 124(8) in the case of amalgamated charges, so as to reduce the eligibility of offences for community orders to only offences with a maximum prescribed punishment of eighteen months jail, at a time that Parliament was clearly seeking to expand the eligibility criteria for community orders. The extraneous material examined align with and fortified the plain and ordinary meaning and the legislative purposes of sections 337 and 124 of the CPC as gleaned from the text.

120    As community orders remained a sentencing option and the case satisfied the guidelines for calling for a MTO suitability report, I called for a MTO suitability report.

## Issue 4: Were community orders the appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case?

121    Under section 339(3) a court may make a MTO only if the MTO suitability report states that the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment, the offender is suitable for treatment, and the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for the commission of the offence.

122    The appointed psychiatrist was Dr Goh. In his MTO suitability report dated 13 July 2020, Dr Goh confirmed his previous opinion that the accused was suffering from both OCPD and a major depressive episode around the time of the offence, and that both conditions were contributory factors to the offences. He was also of the view that a MTO was viable and that the accused was on the balance suitable for a MTO, and recommended a 24-month MTO.

123    Pursuant to the court’s request for clarification on whether the mental disorders were susceptible to treatment, Dr Goh submitted a second report dated 16 July 2020, stating that the accused’s major depressive episode was susceptible to treatment while his OCPD was susceptible to treatment “to a more limited extent”. I understood this to mean that both the OCPD and the major depressive order were susceptible to treatment, although to different extents. Dr Goh recommended antidepressants to continue, and for psycho-social interventions to help the accused with his depression and to mitigate the impact of his OCPD. Dr Goh also summarised and repeated his first IMH report of 3 March 2020 about how the mental disorders had affected the accused and contributed to the commission of the offences. The summary did not include the further explanations and elaborations contained in his second IMH report of 30 April 2020, but nothing turned on this as Dr Goh was essentially re-affirming his previous opinion, and he again repeated that the accused was suitable for treatment.

124    Dr Goh’s MTO suitability report met the 3 statutory conditions under section 339(3) for the court to consider making a MTO. As to whether a MTO should be ordered is a matter of legal consideration for the court: _GCX_ at \[61\]. Under section 339(1) of the CPC the court may order a MTO if it is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so. At this stage, the court undertakes a balancing exercise again between the various sentencing principles with the benefit of the MTO report and with a clearer picture of the relative significance of rehabilitation as a sentencing principle and for the weight to be given to rehabilitation. The court also guided that an MTO should only be ordered where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration on the facts of the case: _GCX_ at \[32\] and \[42\].

125    The contents of the MTO suitability report had reinforced the rehabilitative potential of the accused. All things considered I was satisfied that rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration in this case. Deterrence was little served by making an example of a mentally disordered offender like the accused.

126    Aside from the accused’s diminished culpability arising from his mental orders, there were substantial mitigating factors. I accepted that the accused was deeply remorseful – he had pleaded guilty, made full restitution and written to the victims to apologise. There were also multiple factors fortifying a rehabilitative sentence. The accused was not to be considered a first offender because of the number of charges he faces. However his lack of antecedents pointed to this offending episode in his life being a one-off aberration committed in the midst of stressful life events which he was unable to effectively cope with because of his previously undiagnosed OCPD coupled with his suffering a major depressive episode at the same time. Despite his previously undiagnosed OCPD, there was nothing in his background that suggested any criminal proclivity and he had stayed out of any brushes with the law up until the time he committed these offences when he was nearly 34 years old. From all accounts the accused seemed to an industrious person, financially supporting his wife and his family, putting himself through higher education whilst with the SAF, and he also had received positive testimonials from a former boss and his SAF commander who had commended him. The accused had also actively sought out re-employment again despite the pending criminal proceedings and treatment for his psychiatric conditions. His wife was supportive and had accompanied him to IMH for the MTO assessment and had been advised as to how she could help and monitor him. They were once again living together at his parents’ home, which would provide the family support framework for rehabilitation. I was of the view that the accused was deserving of the chance to move ahead with his life that a rehabilitative sentence offered.

127    There was nothing to suggest that the objectives of rehabilitation would be better or equally served within the structured confines of prison for this accused. Bearing in mind also the principle of proportionality which runs through the gamut of sentencing, I was satisfied that the relevant sentencing considerations did not demand a custodial sentence in the form of imprisonment on the facts of this case.

128    However deterrence remained a relevant sentencing consideration. The accused had not committed the offences at the spur of the moment and he had time to consider his acts. I was of the view that a Short Detention Order of ten days should be imposed. The prison confines and the custodial experience will in my view be sufficiently deterrent for the accused, and remain with him as a reminder of this offending episode in his life.

## Conclusion

129    All things considered I was of the view that the appropriate sentence was a 24-month MTO and a 10-day Short Detention Order, and sentenced the accused accordingly.
