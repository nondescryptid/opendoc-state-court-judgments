\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9272/2019/01.\]

18 February 2020

### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused, a 50-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to:

> (i)     a charge under section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) for voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant, Sgt Darius Foo Shi Hong (“Sgt Darius”), in the discharge of his duty as such public servant (“the 1st VCH charge”);

> (ii)     a charge under section 332 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant, Sgt Nur Hernani bte Razni (“Sgt Hernani”), in the discharge of her duty as such public servant (“the 2nd VCH charge”); and

> (ii)     a charge under section 186 of the Penal Code for voluntarily obstructing Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, who were public servants, in the discharge of their public functions (“the obstruction charge”).

##### The Accused was represented.

2       I convicted the Accused on 11 October 2019 after a full trial. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation presented by the Accused, I sentenced the Accused to a total of 60 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 (in default one week’s imprisonment).

3       The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the sentence is stayed pending appeal. I now set out my reasons for my decision.

## (2)   The Prosecution’s Case

4       The Prosecution adduced evidence that, on 13 May 2017 at about 2.17 am, Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius were despatched to a car park located at Block 130 Jurong Gateway Road (“the Car Park”), pursuant to information received by the police that a car, with its lights turned on, was spotted at the Car Park, “driver is inside seems to be sleeping \[sic\]”.

5       When Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius arrived at the Car Park, they saw the Accused in his car. They opened the driver’s door and found that it reeked of alcohol. After some effort, they managed to wake the Accused. Sgt Darius then identified himself as a police officer to the Accused. The Accused was instructed to turn off the car engine and alight from the car. However, the Accused disregarded the instructions of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, and instead drove off suddenly, which resulted in Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani being injured.

6       The Accused was eventually arrested on the same day at about 2.40 pm.

7       I will set out the Prosecution’s case in three parts:

> (a)     the events at the Car Park and the Accused’s arrest;

> (b)     the medical evidence; and

> (c)     the video clips retrieved from the body-worn cameras of Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius.

### (a)   The events at the Car Park and the Accused’s arrest

8       In the early hours of 13 May 2017, while Sgt Darius (PW2) was performing police patrol duty with his partner[^1], Sgt Hernani (PW3), they responded to a message (the “FIR”)[^2] from the “ops room” and proceeded to the Car Park[^3]. Both of them were in their police uniforms with their police passes and wearing their body-worn cameras (“BWCs”)[^4]. Upon arrival at the Car Park, they spotted the Accused’s car which was parked in the motorcycle lots. The rear of the car was also observed to have mounted the kerb[^5]. Sgt Darius was able to recognise the Accused’s car from the description that was given in the FIR – that the car lights and engine of the car were turned on[^6].

9       Sgt Hernani approached the Accused’s car, and Sgt Darius joined her after parking the police vehicle. They tried to get his attention using a torchlight but were unable to get a response from the Accused[^7]. They then proceeded to open the door on the driver’s side. Upon opening the car door, Sgt Darius identified himself as a police officer[^8] and the Accused responded by saying, “okay”[^9]. It was also the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani that there was a smell of alcohol emanating from the car when Sgt Darius opened the car door[^10].

10     After introducing themselves, Sgt Darius instructed the Accused to turn off the car engine and step out of his car. When the Accused failed to comply, Sgt Darius told Sgt Hernani that they might have to pull the Accused out of his car in order to conduct “checks on” the Accused[^11].

11     It was also the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, that when they continued to ask the Accused to turn off the car engine, the Accused responded by saying, “I switch off, I switch off”[^12]. However, Sgt Darius noticed that the Accused did not make any attempt to turn off the car engine[^13]. Instead, Sgt Darius saw that the Accused appeared to be reaching for the gearshift[^14].

12     As the Accused was not complying with their instructions to turn off the car engine and step out of his car, Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani proceeded to instruct him to do so in a sterner and raised tone[^15]. At the same time, both of them also caught hold of the Accused and made preparations to pull the Accused out of the car if he continued to ignore their instructions[^16]. However, while their arms were on the Accused, the Accused suddenly drove off[^17], and Sgt Darius was “pulled together with the vehicle”. As a result, both he and Sgt Hernani were hit by the door frame of the car[^18].

13     Sgt Hernani testified that she hit her left arm against the door frame when the Accused drove off[^19], while Sgt Darius testified that he felt a sharp pain on his left arm where he was hit[^20]. However, Sgt Darius continued to run after the Accused’s car so that he could take down the licence plate[^21]. Sgt Darius managed to catch up with the Accused’s car when the Accused stopped after driving away from where he was parked[^22]. But as Sgt Darius attempted to open the Accused’s car door, the Accused suddenly drove off towards the exit of the Car Park, and Sgt Darius was compelled to let go of the car door[^23].

14     When Sgt Darius saw the Accused driving away, he immediately got into the police vehicle with Sgt Hernani to give chase. Sgt Darius switched on the blinkers in the police vehicle and chased the Accused’s car along Jurong Gateway Road to Jurong East Street 13, where he tried to block the Accused’s car using the police vehicle. However, the Accused mounted the kerb and drove on[^24]. Subsequently, when backup resources arrived from the opposite side of the road to block the Accused’s car, the Accused drove against the flow of traffic to get away from the police. Sgt Darius and the backup resources continued chasing the Accused for about two kilometres before losing sight of him along Jurong Town Hall Road[^25]. In total, there were three police vehicles chasing the Accused’s car[^26], and it was the evidence of Sgt Darius that the sirens were turned on briefly and the Accused was driving in excess of 100 km/h[^27].

15     After the Accused’s escape, on the same day, ASP Muhammad Faizal bin Ismail (“ASP Faizal”) (PW8) conducted follow-up investigations based on the licence plate of the Accused’s car. The licence plate was traced to the Accused, and an “address at Jelapang”[^28]. ASP Faizal then proceeded to Jelapang Road with SSgt Fang Weichen (PW6) and another colleague where they spotted the Accused. At 2.40 pm, the Accused was placed under arrest at the multi-storey car park at Block 505A Jelapang Road[^29].

16     Pursuant to the Accused’s arrest, the Investigation Officer Inspector Ong Shing Lin Steffany (“Insp Ong”) (PW7) obtained the relevant video recording from the BWCs of Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius. However, she was unable to retrieve the footage from the in-car camera of the police vehicle driven by Sgt Darius as the camera was faulty[^30]. In addition, Insp Ong prepared a sketch plan of the Car Park (P3)[^31].

### (b)   The medical evidence

17     On 13 May 2017 at 5.29 am, Sgt Darius was seen by Dr Khanijow Kaajal (“Dr Kaajal”) (PW4) at the Emergency Medicine Department of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Dr Kaajal testified that Sgt Darius informed her that the driver of a vehicle suddenly drove off when Sgt Darius was trying to wake him up. As a result of the driver’s actions, Sgt Darius sustained injury to his left arm and he complained of tenderness over his left arm. Dr Kaajal diagnosed Sgt Darius to be suffering from upper left arm strain, which injuries were consistent with the account given by Sgt Darius. She discharged him on the same day with painkillers and gave him two days’ outpatient sick leave[^32].

18     On the same day at 5.39 am, Sgt Hernani was attended to by Dr Michael Chu (“Dr Chu”) (PW1) at the same hospital. Dr Chu testified that he was told by Sgt Hernani that she was injured when a driver drove off while her arms were in the driver’s car. She and her colleague were checking out the car as the driver was seen sleeping in it. When she and her colleague opened the car door, she smelt alcohol. They then woke the driver up and tried to get him out of the car. While her arms were still in the car, the driver drove off which resulted in her arms being hit by the door frame. Dr Chu examined Sgt Hernani and diagnosed her with “bilateral elbow contusion and ankle sprain”. In addition, he noted “a small area of broken skin at the proximal forearm on the left” arm. In Dr Chu’s opinion, Sgt Hernani’s injuries were consistent with her account of how her injuries were sustained. Sgt Hernani was offered analgesia and discharged with two days’ medical leave[^33].

### (c)   The video clips retrieved from the body-worn cameras of Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius

19     The CD-ROM (P4) produced by Insp Ong contained two video clips obtained from the body-worn cameras of Sgt Hernani (under file name “Hernani BWC”) and Sgt Darius (under file name “Darius BWC”). The video clips showed, _inter alia_, the movements of Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius when they were at the scene and captured their interaction with the Accused.

#### (i)   Hernani BWC

20     The video clip obtained from Sgt Hernani’s body-worn camera (“BWC”) showed Sgt Hernani approaching the Accused’s car at time-stamp 2:35:16. At time-stamp 2:35:37, Sgt Darius was seen shining a torchlight at the window of the driver’s side of the car. During that time to time-stamp 2:35:53, Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius could be heard discussing whether the Accused was an Uber Driver and trying to ascertain if there was a “Lion City” logo.

21     At time-stamp 2:35:54, Sgt Darius was seen approaching of the front of the Accused’s car and shining his torch at the bumper portion. Between time-stamps 2:35:55 and 2:36:01, Sgt Hernani shone her torchlight at the Accused. At time-stamp 2:35:03, Sgt Hernani was conversing with Sgt Darius and moving towards the back of the Accused’s car. Sgt Hernani then told Sgt Darius not to flash his torchlight too brightly, at time-stamp 2:35:25. At time-stamp 2:36:11, Sgt Darius could be seen pointing at the ground where the back portion of the Accused’s car was, and Sgt Hernani commented, at time-stamp 2:36:13, on the manner in which the Accused had parked his car.

22     At time-stamp 2:36:13, Sgt Darius was seen opening the driver’s door of the Accused’s car. At time-stamp 2:36:21, Sgt Darius asked Sgt Hernani if she could smell alcohol, and Sgt Hernani answered in the affirmative. At the same time, the Accused could be seen at the driver’s seat, with the seat reclined. At time-stamp 2:36:24, Sgt Darius said to the Accused, “hello, police here”. The Accused could be heard muttering a reply. Sgt Darius continued to engage the Accused by asking him if everything was okay. The Accused responded by saying “okay”, and at the same time, moved from his reclined position to a sitting position at time-stamp 2:36:29.

23     When the Accused was at a sitting position, Sgt Darius asked the Accused to alight from his vehicle. The Accused responded by saying “yah” and placed his right hand on the steering wheel and his right foot on or near the accelerator. Sgt Hernani then repeated Sgt Darius’s instructions, telling the Accused to alight from the vehicle, at time-stamp 2:36:38. The Accused remained seated in his car. Between time-stamps 2:36:40 and 2:36:36, Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani repeatedly told the Accused to turn off the car engine, in progressively louder voices. At time-stamp 2:36:45, the Accused stretched out his right arm to the side of the car door. When he did so, Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius both reached out for the Accused with their arms. At time-stamp 2:36:51, Sgt Hernani’s left hand was on the Accused’s back, and Sgt Darius’s left hand was on the Accused’s right arm. Sgt Darius was repeatedly telling the Accused to turn off his engine. The Accused’s head was turned towards them, and at time-stamp 2:36:52, the Accused said, “I switch off, I switch off.”

24     From time stamps 2:36:55 to 2:37:06, the Accused appeared to be, intermittently, reaching for the ignition and gearshift with his left hand. The Accused said again “I switch off” as he turned towards Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius. He continued remaining in his car despite the instructions of Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius to step out of his car and turn off the car engine. At time-stamp 2:37:08, Sgt Hernani could be heard signalling to Sgt Darius to pull the Accused out of the car. Sgt Darius raised his voice and again commanded the Accused to “switch off” the car engine and step out of the car. The Accused responded by saying, “I switch off – you hold on”, at time-stamp 2:37:16, while reaching out for the gearshift with his left hand. At that time, Sgt Darius left hand was held onto the Accused’s lower right arm.

25     When Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani continued to hold onto the Accused while commanding him to step out of his vehicle, the Accused responded, “I switch off now, okay”, at time-stamp 2:37:37. At time-stamp 2:37:39, the Accused’s car suddenly moved off and there was a screeching sound. Sgt Darius could be seen running after the Accused’s car, at time-stamp 2:37:41, and attempting to open the Accused’s car door. The video clip ended with the Accused driving out of the Car Park, at time-stamp 2:37:56.

#### (ii)   Darius BWC

26     The video clip obtained from Sgt Darius’s BWC showed Sgt Darius approaching the Accused’s car, at time-stamp 2:35:30, with his torchlight shining into the car. Sgt Darius then told Sgt Hernani, “I want to ‘strobe’ him first.”

27     Sgt Darius continued shining his torchlight into the car and on the Accused’s face for the next couple of seconds. The Accused was in a reclined position with his eyes closed, and remained unresponsive to the torchlight. Sgt Darius could be hearing saying “Uber”. At time-stamp 2:35:51, Sgt Darius moved to the front of the Accused’s car and shone his torchlight at the licence plate SLL 7307 P. Sgt Darius then walked to the back of the Accused’s car and observed, at time-stamp 2:36:05, that the Accused had mounted the kerb. Sgt Hernani could also be seen moving to the back of the Accused’s car, and Sgt Darius could be heard saying, “drunk”. At time-stamp 2:36:14, Sgt Darius approached the Accused’s car and opened the driver’s door. Upon opening the car door, Sgt Darius asked Sgt Hernani if she could smell alcohol. At time-stamp 2:36:24, Sgt Darius called out to the Accused by saying, “hello, police here. Is everything okay?”

28     The Accused responded, “okay”, and moved to a sitting position. Sgt Darius then requested the Accused to step out of the car. From time-stamps 2:36:29 to 2:36:39, Sgt Darius’s torchlight was pointed at the legs of the Accused, and Sgt Hernani could also be heard telling the Accused to turn off the car engine. During this period, the Accused’s left hand was reaching for the gearshift, with his right hand on the steering wheel while his right leg appeared to be on the accelerator. Sgt Darius’s repeated requests for the Accused to turn off his car engine could be heard, and the Accused’s right arm was seen reaching out for the car door at time-stamp 2:36:42.

29     Between time-stamps 2:36:46 and 2:36:53, Sgt Darius’s requests that the Accused turn off his car engine became increasingly urgent, and at time-stamp 2:36:52, the Accused said, “I switch off, I switch off.”

30     The Accused could be seen reaching for the ignition, at time-stamp 2:37:02, with Sgt Darius telling him repeatedly to turn off the car engine and step out of his car. At time-stamp 2:37:06, the Accused again said, “I switch off, I switch off” while remaining seated in the car. The Accused repeated the same response at time-stamps 2:37:12 and 2:37:16 to Sgt Darius’s instructions. Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius persisted in telling the Accused to turn off his engine and step out of his car for the next 10 seconds. At time-stamp 2:37:37, the Accused said that he would turn off the car engine. At time-stamp 2:37:39, there was a commotion and the Accused’s car was seen moving. A screech could be heard at time-stamp 2:37:41.

31     The video clip ended with Sgt Darius calling for assistance.

## (3)   The Defence

### (a)   The evidence of the Accused

32     The Accused testified that he was working as a Grab driver at the material time. On 12 May 2017, he had started his day at 7.00 am. At 9.00 pm, the Accused decided to stop work, and had a bottle of beer. After the beer, the Accused felt tired and did not have the “confidence” to drive. He then parked his car at the Car Park and slept in his car[^34].

33     The Accused claimed that he had slept for about two hours[^35] when he was awakened by two persons. He further claimed that he did not know who they were as he was “still in a subconscious state”[^36]. As they were grabbing his hand “so forcefully”, he decided to drive off as he was frightened[^37]. Had he known that they were police officers, he would not have driven his car away[^38]. The Accused also claimed that he had no impression of being pursued by three police cars after he left the Car Park.

34     On 13 May 2017, the Accused was arrested at the car park at Jelapang Road. The Accused alleged that he was arrested and handcuffed by the police officers before he even had the chance to ask them why he was being arrested[^39].

35     In cross-examination, the Accused claimed that he had no recollection of what transpired between him and the two officers[^40]. He also disputed the evidence of Sgt Hernani and Sgt Darius that they were hit by the door frame of his car when he drove off[^41]. In addition, the Accused disagreed with their evidence that he was chased by three police cars, one of which was driven by Sgt Darius[^42].

### (b)   The Accused’s statement

36     In the course of cross-examination, the Prosecution sought to confront the Accused with a statement (P7) which the Accused had given to ASP Faizal on 12 December 2017. ASP Faizal was the initial Investigation Officer. The Defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the statement[^43].

37     In his statement, the Accused claimed that he was unable to recall anything in relation to the events in the early hours of 13 May 2017. This was despite the video clips being shown to him.

## (4)   Closing Submissions

### (a)   The Prosecution’s submissions

38     The Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that both Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were credible witnesses whose evidence was internally and externally consistent, and their injuries were supported by objective medical evidence presented by the relevant doctors. The Accused was aware that they were police officers and had voluntarily caused hurt to Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani when he drove his car off suddenly, while the officers were holding onto him.

39     The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused was not a credible witness and his evidence was internally inconsistent. He was evasive when testifying in court and had to be reminded multiple times to answer the questions.

### (b)   The Defence’s submissions

40     The Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that the Accused was not aware that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers when they approached him on 13 May 2017. He was blinded by Sgt Darius’s torchlight and did not hear Sgt Darius when he said that they were police officers.

41     In addition, the Defence submitted that the Accused had driven away as he thought that the police officers were strangers trying to harm him, and that he was unaware that his car door would hit Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, thereby causing injuries to them.

## (5)   My decision

### (a)   Joinder of charges

42     The Accused was charged with voluntarily causing hurt to Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani on 13 May 2017, in the discharge of their duties as public servants, and for voluntarily obstructing them, in the discharge of their public functions.

43     Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) states:

> **Trial for more than one offence**

> 134\. If, in one series of acts connected so as to form the same transaction, 2 or more offences are committed by the same person, then he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence.

44     I was satisfied the VCH charges (comprising the 1st VCH charge and the 2nd VCH charge) and the obstruction charge were so connected that they formed the same transaction, and the Accused could be tried for all the offences at one trial.

### (b)   The ingredients of the charges

45     The ingredients for the VCH charges are:

> (a)     the accused voluntarily caused hurt;

> (b)     the person who was hurt was a public servant;

> (c)     the public servant was then discharging his duty as a public servant; and

> (d)     that the accused caused hurt voluntarily, with the knowledge that that person was a public servant in the discharge of his duty.

46     In relation to the obstruction charge, the ingredients are:

> (a)     the accused voluntarily obstructed a public servant in the discharge of his public functions; and

> (b)     the accused did so, with the knowledge that that person was a public servant.

47     Having dealt with the preliminary point of joinder of the charges and the ingredients of the charges, I next considered whether the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The charges against the Accused did not present any complex issue of law.

48     Save for Sgt Darius, Sgt Hernani and the Accused, there were no other independent witnesses to the incident. There were, however, two video clips retrieved from the BWCs of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani.

49     In assessing the evidence of Sgt Darius, Sgt Hernani and the Accused, I took into account their demeanour in court, which was important in cases such as this, where it was one person’s word against the other.

### (c)   The Accused knew that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers

50     It was not disputed that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers discharging their duties at the material time. However, the Defence submitted that the Accused was not aware that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers as the Accused had just been woken up by them, having fallen asleep in his car.

51     First, I considered whether there was evidence that the police officers identified themselves to the Accused. It was clear from the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani that Sgt Darius had identified himself as a police officer when he opened the Accused’s car door. That Sgt Darius called out to the Accused by saying “hello, police here” was also captured by the BWC of Sgt Darius, at time-stamp 2:36:24. Indeed, it was not disputed by the Defence that Sgt Darius had identified himself before engaging the Accused as it was not put to Sgt Darius that he had not identified himself. It is trite law that any “matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to \[the witness\]”[^44]. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67[^45] is clear:

> It seems to me to be _absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made_, and not to take his evidence and passed it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit…

> \[emphasis added\]

52     Next, I assessed whether the Accused had heard Sgt Darius when Sgt Darius identified himself. It was clear from the video clip retrieved from Sgt Darius’s BWC that when he identified himself as a police officer, the Accused responded by saying “okay” and moved to a sitting position.

53     I further accepted the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani that they repeatedly instructed the Accused to turn off his car engine and step out of the car, and that the Accused had responded by saying, “I switch off” on various occasions. While the Accused may have just woken up from his sleep, his responses to the officers were coherent and showed that he was aware of his surroundings, and what was being said to him by them[^46]:

(i) Time-stamp 2:36:24

Hello, police here. Is everything okay?

 |
| 

Sgt Darius:

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

I switch off. You hold on, you hold on.

 |
| 

(v) Time-stamp 2:37:34

Accused:

 |

  
  

54     It could be seen from the video clips that the Car Park was not in complete darkness. The block of flats, the police vehicle and the car that was parked opposite the Accused’s car were clearly visible. Given that the Accused was aware of his surroundings and was responding to Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, his claim that he did not realise that they were police officers was not believable. This was especially so since both Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were wearing police uniforms and their lanyards which would have been visible to the Accused. In addition, the Accused’s reaction towards them did not suggest that he thought they were strangers who were out to harm him. The Accused did not, at any time, ask Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani who they were. Nor did he struggle when they held onto his arm and shoulder.

55     The Accused’s behaviour after he drove away from the Car Park was also telling. It was the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani that they gave chase when the Accused drove off suddenly. They were joined by two other police cars in the chase (“the Chase”), with their blinkers and sirens turned on. The Accused, in his bid to escape, mounted a kerb and drove against the flow of traffic. I accepted the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani as I found them to be credible witnesses. They were consistent in their description of the Chase, and had no reason to concoct such an elaborate story against the Accused. With regard to the Chase, the Accused’s evidence was that he had “no impression” of it. Since the Accused had no impression of the Chase, he would not be able to refute the version presented by Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani.

56     In determining whether or not the Accused had knowledge that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers discharging their duties, I found the case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> at \[35\] instructive:

> Although knowledge that the victim is a public servant going about his duties is not stated explicitly in s 332, it cannot be right that someone who hit another person without even knowing that that person was a public servant going about his duties would be guilty of an offence under s 332. _However, the knowledge required is objective and not subjective knowledge. Therefore, if an ordinary person would have such knowledge in the circumstances of the case, it is not open to the accused person to claim that he did not know_. Hence, an intoxicated accused person would not be permitted to say that he was so drunk he was not aware of the status of the victim and was merely lashing out at any person who was in his proximity or who went near him. Being in a state of intoxication would afford no defence to a charge under s 332 unless he could bring himself within the defence of intoxication in ss 85 and 86 of the Penal Code.

> \[emphasis added\]

57     Based on the evidence before me, I rejected the Accused’s claim that he was unaware that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers – an ordinary person would have had such knowledge in the circumstances of the case.

### (d)   The Accused voluntarily caused hurt to Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani

58     It is the evidence of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani that they suffered injuries when the Accused drove his car off suddenly, causing them to hit against the door frame. In addition, Sgt Hernani sustained a sprained ankle when she “pulled \[her\]self back” in order not to be dragged by the Accused’s car[^47].

59     Their evidence that they sustained injuries as a result of the Accused’s actions was corroborated by the evidence of Dr Kajaal and Dr Chu who examined Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani respectively. In their opinion, the injuries suffered by them were consistent with the account presented by them. I therefore accepted that their injuries were caused by the Accused. Dr Kajaal and Dr Chu were independent witnesses and there was no reason for them to give evidence in favor of the officers. In any event, the Defence did not put to Sgt Darius or Sgt Hernani that their injuries were not caused by the Accused.

60     I further accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused had intended to cause hurt[^48] to Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, or minimally had the knowledge that he was likely to do so, when he drove his car off without any prior warning. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the Accused admitted that he knew that he would likely cause hurt to a person, who was in the same position as Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, if he had driven off in the manner that he did[^49].

### (e)   The Accused was not a credible witness

61     In the course of the trial, I was able to observe the demeanour of Sgt Darius, Sgt Hernani and the Accused at close proximity. Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani came across as forthcoming and truthful. I found them to be credible witnesses and their narration of how they had approached the Accused’s car and subsequently, the Accused, remained consistent under cross-examination.

62     With respect to the Accused’s defence that he was unaware that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were police officers, and thought that they were hostile, I disbelieved his testimony, which was not borne out by the footages retrieved from the BWCs and his reaction at the material time. From the footages, it could be observed that:

> (i)     Sgt Darius’s identification of himself and Sgt Hernani as police officers was acknowledged by the Accused;

> (ii)     the Accused did not show any fear or anxiety when he was instructed by Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani to turn off the car engine and step out of his car;

> (iii)     the Accused did not, at any time, question the identities of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, and responded to their instructions in a calm and collected manner;

> (iv)     the Accused did not, at any time, struggle or push away the arms of Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani when they placed their arms on him in preparation to pull him out of the car;

> (v)     the Accused had the presence of mind to pretend that he was cooperating with Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani, before driving his car away suddenly.

63     I therefore found his version of events to be illogical and lacking in credibility. His behaviour after the incident at the Car Park was also inconsistent with his claim that he thought that strangers had approached him and tried to harm him:

> (i)     The Accused did not make a police report, or inform the arresting officers that strangers were attempting to harm him hours before his arrest. If the Accused had truly believed that he was accosted by hostile strangers at the Car Park, he would have told the arresting officers or Insp Ong.

> (ii)     The Accused’s attempt to evade arrest during the Chase demonstrated that he was aware that he could possibly have committed an offence or offences at the Car Park. It was not believable that the Accused was unaware that he was being chased by three police cars which had their blinkers and sirens turned on.

> (iii)     The Accused should, logically, have driven to the nearest police post or police station to seek help after driving away from the Car Park, if he had indeed been ambushed by strangers. Yet, his evidence in relation to the aftermath of the Car Park incident was that he had no recollection of what took place.

64     The Accused was not known to Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani. There was, therefore, no reason for them to fabricate evidence against the Accused in relation to the Chase.

65     The Accused’s defence that he thought Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were hostile strangers was also internally inconsistent. The Accused had said, on various occasions[^50], in court that he was unable to remember what transpired between him and the officer. This was also reflected in the statement (P7) that he gave to ASP Faizal. If the Accused had no recollection of the day’s events, why then would he assume that Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were hostile strangers?

66     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the Accused accordingly.

## (6)   The sentence

67     An offence under section 186 of the Penal Code is punishable with a term of imprisonment of up to 3 months, or with a fine which may extend to $2,500, or with both.

68     An offence under section 332 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine or to caning.

### (a)   The Accused’s antecedents

69     The Accused was traced as follows:

> (a)      **16 January 1997**: an offence of affray under section 160 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).

> The Accused was fined $1,000.

> (b)      **16 June 2007**: an offence under section 4(1)(_b_) of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) for permitting a place, which he was the owner or occupier, to be used as a common gaming house.

> He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment and fined $10,000, in default two months’ imprisonment. The fine was not paid.

> (c)      **16 September 2014**: an offence under section 337(_b_) of the Penal Code for causing hurt by a negligent act, and an offence under section 13D(1)(_a_) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) for using indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour towards a public servant.

> He was fined a total of $3,500. (d)     **7 July 2016**: an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code for causing hurt to a public transport worker.

> He was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

70     The Accused also had multiple traffic infractions between 1994 and 2018, including offences for speeding, inconsiderate driving and failure to conform to red light signal.

### (b)   Prosecution’s position on sentence

71     The Prosecution argued that the present case was a Category 2 case under the sentencing framework laid down by the Court of Three Judges (“the High Court”) in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_[^51] and submitted for a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for each of the VCH charges. As for the obstruction charge, the Prosecution submitted for a short custodial term without specifying the length.

### (c)   The mitigation plea

72     The Defence’s mitigation was unremarkable and submitted, _inter alia_:

> (i)     the Accused and his wife had to support their children and his aged mother;

> (ii)     the Accused was not actually guilty of the offence for which he was convicted in 2016;

> (iii)     that the present case fell within Category 1 of the sentencing framework.

73     The Defence submitted for a custodial term of two months for each of the VCH charges, and a fine of $1,000 for the obstruction charge.

### (d)   Decision on sentence

#### (i)   Sentencing framework for cases under section 332 of the Penal Code

74     In _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_, the following sentencing bands were set out by the High Court at \[59\][^52]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.12%"> <col width="46.94%"> <col width="33.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing band</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to one year’s</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater ham and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to seven years’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

The High Court added, at \[61\], that the bands were “premised on offenders pleading guilty and not having relevant criminal antecedents”[^53].

75     In determining the degree of harm and culpability, a non-exhaustive list of factors was suggested by the High Court at \[60\][^54]:

> (a)     The degree of hurt caused and its consequences;

> (b)     The use or attempted use of a weapon or other dangerous implement or means (_eg_, biting) and its capacity to do harm;

> (c)     The age, lack of maturity or presence of mental disorder where it affects materially the responsibility of the offender;

> (d)     The circumstances leading to the commission of the offence (_eg_, the offender’s motivations for causing hurt to the victim, whether the offence was planned or premeditated, whether it demonstrated contempt for police officers and their authority);

> (e)     The timing and location of the offence, in particular whether it was committed within the public’s view and hearing;

> (f)     Whether the offence involved a sustained or repeated attack;

> (g)     The number of offenders involved;

> (h)     Whether any steps were taken to avoid detection or prosecution; and

> (i)     The offender’s criminal history and propensity.

#### (ii)   The present case fell within Category 2 of the sentencing framework

76     I observed the following aggravating features in the present case:

> (a)     The Accused’s actions were dangerous when he drove off suddenly while Sgt Darius and Sgt Hernani were still holding onto him. Both officers suffered injuries as a result of the Accused’s dangerous acts, and it was only fortuitous that they did not suffer serious injuries due to their quick reflexes. The Defence argued that the injuries of the officers were minor. While I note that the officers did not suffer serious injuries, I did not think that the Accused should be allowed to claim credit for the quick reflexes of the officers.

> (b)     The Accused admitted that he had a bottle of beer before driving to the Car Park, and the officers had observed that the car was reeking of alcohol when Sgt Darius opened the door. It could, therefore, be inferred that the Accused had driven his car away suddenly in the hope that he would not be investigated for a possible offence of drink driving and to evade arrest.

> (c)     Sgt Darius chased after the Accused’s car, and managed to catch up with the Accused when the Accused stopped his car after driving a few meters. However, when Sgt Darius tried to open the car door, the Accused drove his car away suddenly, a second time, when Sgt Darius was still holding onto the car door. Clearly, the Accused had no regard for the safety of Sgt Darius, and his behaviour demonstrated contempt for Sgt Darius’s office.

> (d)     After driving out of the Car Park, the Accused drove in a reckless manner without any consideration for the safety of other road users. In his desperation to evade arrest, the Accused mounted a kerb, drove against the flow of traffic and drove way in excess of the speed limit.

> (e)     The Accused was traced for similar offences and committed the present offences less than a year after his release from prison. The facts relating to the Accused’s 2014 antecedent were similar to the present case. In the 2014 case, the Accused had used his car to inch towards the victim, causing her to fall and hurt herself. As for the 2016 antecedent, the Accused had kicked the door of a taxi, causing it to slam against the leg of the victim. The Accused had also punched the victim’s face, causing injuries to the victim.

77     Given the above aggravating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case fell within Category 2 of the sentencing framework.

#### (iii)   The appropriate sentence

78     In submitting for a sentence of two months’ imprisonment, the Defence cited 11 cases, including _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_[^55]. Of the ten cases, five of them pre-dated _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_[^56]. For the remaining five cases, they were distinguishable from the present case, which I found to be a Category 2 case. In _PP v Ganesan Alagappan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 74</span>, _PP v Khoo Wai Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 55</span>, _PP v Kho Sock Buay_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 38</span> and _PP v Wan Li_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 1</span>, the offenders were untraced and had pleaded guilty. More importantly, the court found that the offences fell within Category 1 of the sentencing framework. As for _PP v Wong Hwee Ling Patricia_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 297</span>, while the offender had claimed trial and had related antecedents, her act of aggression (in relation to the charge under section 332 of the Penal Code) was relatively minor compared to the Accused’s acts in the present case. Accordingly, the trial judge found that the offence fell within Category 1 of the sentencing framework.

79     Given the differences, I did not find the cases cited by the Defence to be supportive of the Defence’s submission for a short custodial term of two months for each of the VCH charges. According to _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_[^57], the starting point for a Category 2 case is a 12-month imprisonment term.

80     While it was the Accused’s right to claim trial to the charges, it would mean that the Accused was not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of an accused pleading guilty to his charges in a timeous manner. In addition, the Accused had similar offences and the present offences were committed within a year of his previous incarceration. An uplift of the sentence from the starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment for Category 2 cases was therefore warranted.

81     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence of 60 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the VCH charges, was appropriate. The Accused did not raise any exceptional mitigating factors, and in fact, did not appear to show any contrition in relation to the present offences, and the 2016 antecedent – by maintaining his innocence despite his conviction[^58].

82     As for the obstruction charge, I did not think that the custodial threshold was crossed. However, given the rather prolonged period of non-compliance on the Accused’s part, I was of the view that a high fine was appropriate. I therefore imposed a fine of $2,000, in default one week’s imprisonment.

## (7)   Conclusion

83     Having considered the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, the charges against the Accused, and a global sentence of 60 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 (in default, one week’s imprisonment) was fair.
