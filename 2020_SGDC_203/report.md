Criminal Law – Offences – Cheating – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9776/2020/01.\]

3 September 2020

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Hogberg Marc Eric Rickard, a 34 year-old Swedish national had initially claimed trial to two cheating charges under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) namely:

> (a)     **DAC-903336-2018** -1st Charge (Amended)

> are charged that you, on or about 9 January 2014, in Singapore, did cheat one Robert Ian Cohen (“Robert”), to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you were a shareholder of “The Polo Room Entertainment Pte. Ltd.” (Singapore Company registration no. 201323317M) and that you would sell to Robert 50,000 shares, purportedly owned by you, in the said company for S$50,000, facts which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced Robert to deliver property, to wit, a Citibank cheque (number: 000199) for a sum of S$50,000 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> (b)     **DAC-903337-2018** - 2nd Charge (Amended)

> are charged that you, on or about 5 February 2014, in Singapore, did cheat one Robert Ian Cohen (“Robert”), to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you were a shareholder of “The Polo Room Entertainment Pte. Ltd.” (Singapore Company registration no. 201323317M) and that you would sell to Robert an additional 50,000 shares, purportedly owned by you, in the said company, for S$25,000, facts which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced Robert to deliver property, to wit, a Citibank cheque (number: 000200) for a sum of S$25,000 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       On 29 July 2020, at the start of the second day of the trial where the Defence was to begin its cross-examination of the victim, Mr Robert Ian Cohen (PW2), Counsel for the accused informed the court of his intention to plead guilty.

3       Hence, on 29 July 2020 the accused pleaded guilty to the first amended charge in DAC-903336-2018 with the second amended charge in DAC-903337-2018 taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. An adjournment was then sought to 30 July 2020 for the Prosecution to prepare its address on sentence and for his Counsel to prepare his written plea in mitigation.

4       On 30 July 2020, after a careful consideration of the nature and circumstances of the case, the Prosecution’s address on sentence as well as the accused’s written plea in mitigation, I sentenced him to five months’ imprisonment in respect of the proceeded charge in DAC-903336-2018.

5       His Counsel then sought a deferment of his sentence for eight weeks’ to enable the accused to settle his personal affairs as well as his work commitments. As the accused was on a Special Pass, the Prosecution had indicated that it had no objection to a six weeks’ deferment. I then ordered his imprisonment term to commence on 11 September 2020 and ordered that court bail to be fixed at $15,000 with one surety.

6       Nevertheless, on 12 August 2020, the accused through his Counsel filed a notice of appeal against his sentence. The accused appeared before me for a post-sentence mention on 14 August 2020 and I ordered bail pending appeal at $15,000 with one surety. The accused is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

7       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Statement of Facts

8       The accused had admitted the following Statement of Facts without any qualification:

> 1.    The accused is **Hogberg Marc Eric Rickard**, a 34-year-old male Swedish citizen.

> 2.    The 1st witness is Carver Andrew Edward (“Carver”), a 36-year-old Singapore citizen.

> 3.    The complainant and 2nd witness is Robert Ian Cohen (“Robert”), a 49-year-old male Australian citizen.

> Background Facts

> 4.    Carver was in the business of setting up and operating bars and night clubs in Singapore. Sometime before 28 August 2013, Carver and the accused discussed setting up a bar in Singapore to be called the “The Polo Room”. The terms of this agreement were as follows:-

>> (a)    Carver was to incorporate a company and set up the company’s bank account for the purpose of the business;

>> (b)    The accused was to invest into the business by transferring S$400,000 into the said company’s bank account (“the Transfer”); and

>> (c)    In return, the accused would be given 40% of the shares in the said company after he had made the transfer of S$400,000.

> 5.    Pursuant to the said agreement, Carver incorporated the company known as “The Polo Room Entertainment Pte. Ltd.” (Singapore Company registration no. 201323317M) (“Polo Room”) on 28 August 2013.

> 6.    On 29 August 2013, Carver sent the accused a term sheet for the proposed investment into Polo Room by way of email. As stated in the term sheet, parties to the proposed investment included the accused as a contributing party, who would contribute S$400,000 in return for 40% of the shares in Polo Room. In this term sheet, a condition precedent to the agreement was that the accused, as a contributing party, must pay the said S$400,000 as agreed upon. The term sheet further stated that if any contributing party is unable to make payment of the investment sum by 30 September 2013, Carver had the right to terminate the said agreement.

> 7.    Carver also set up Polo Room’s corporate bank account and informed the accused on 5 September 2013 of the details of the said bank account, for the accused to make the Transfer.

> 8.    After the incorporation of Polo Room, the accused informed Carver that he had made the Transfer. However, later that same day, Carver discovered that the accused had not, in fact, made the Transfer.

> 9.    Following this, the accused did not contact Carver over his proposed investment into Polo Room.

> 10.    At no time was the accused a shareholder of Polo Room.

> 11.    As at 9 January 2014 and 5 February 2014, there were no discussions between Carver and the accused for the latter to acquire shares in the Polo Room.

> **Facts in relation to DAC-903336-2018**

> 12.    The accused and Robert were first acquainted in early 2013.

> 13.    Sometime in December 2013, the accused held discussions with Robert, in person, and over the WhatsApp messaging application (“WhatsApp”), during which the accused indicated that he was a shareholder in Polo Room, and that Polo Room would be establishing an exclusive nightclub in Singapore for private guests. The accused offered to sell to Robert 50,000 of his purported shares in Polo Room for S$50,000 (“the First Proposal”).

> 14.    Between 2 December 2013 and 9 January 2014, the accused sent the following WhatsApp messages to Robert:-

> 15.    Between 4 December 2013 and 9 January 2014, following the events referred to in paragraphs 13 to 14 above, Robert agreed to purchase 50,000 shares in Polo Room for S$50,000, from the accused, which shares were purportedly owned by the accused.

> 16.    On 9 January 2014, Robert gave the accused a Citibank cheque (number: 000199) for a sum of S$50,000 at Robert’s residences at Waterfall Gardens, Singapore, and they both signed a document pertaining to the transaction.

> 17.    At the material time, the accused knew that he did not own shares in Polo Room, and that he was in no position to sell 50,000 shares in Polo Room to Robert.

> 18.    By such manner of deception, on 9 January 2014, the accused dishonestly induced Robert to deliver property, to wit, a Citibank cheque (number: 000199) for a sum of S$50,000 as payment for 50,000 of the accused’s purported shares in Polo Room.

> 19.    Sometime between 9 January 2014 and 5 February 2014, the accused proposed to sell to Robert an additional 50,000 shares, purportedly owned by the accused, in the Polo Room for S$25,000 (“the Second Proposal”). Robert agreed to the Second Proposal.

> 20.    On 5 February 2014, the accused and Robert signed a sale agreement relating to the First and Second Proposals, which was prepared by the accused with inputs from Robert. The accused also signed a declaration of trust relating to 100,000 shares in Polo Room, which was also prepared by the accused with inputs from Robert. A copy of the sale agreement and declaration of trust are enclosed as annex A and annex B respectively.

> 21.    By virtue of the events referred to in paragraphs 13 to 17 above, the accused did commit an offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224).

> 22.    On 21 January 2019, the accused made full restitution of S$75,000 (for both proceeded and TIC charges) to Robert.

## Antedecents

9       The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

10     The Prosecution had highlighted that prescribed punishment for an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term which may extend to three years, or a fine, or both. It was the Prosecution’s case taking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances, the court was urged to impose a custodial sentence of not less than five months’ imprisonment.

### The Custodial Threshold Has Been Crossed

11     It was submitted that the custodial threshold in the current matter had been crossed. It was highlighted that the High Court had held that for offences under s 417 of the Penal Code, a custodial sentence is generally appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value (_Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Idya_”) at \[47\]).

12     It was further submitted that the proceeded charge involved a sum of S$50,000.00. As this figure was _clearly_ more than negligible, the offence warranted a custodial sentence to be imposed.

### The Aggravating Factors Outweigh the Mitigating Factors

#### Value of Property Involved is Significant

13     It was submitted that the value of the property involved in the current matter constituted an aggravating factor that justified an uplift in sentence. The High Court had held that in sentencing for financial and property related offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence (_Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> (“_Gan Chai Bee_”) at \[42\]). In the current matter, the accused had deceived the victim into delivering a cheque of S$50,000. This represented a substantial sum and ought to be reflected in sentence.

#### High Degree of Premeditation and Planning

14     It was further submitted that the premeditation and high level of deception involved in the current matter constituted an aggravating factor that justified an uplift in sentence. The High Court had held that the level of premeditation and deception involved would be a factor that is relevant to sentencing (_Idya_ at \[48\]). In the current matter, the accused made sustained representations to the victim that he was a shareholder in The Polo Room. It was highlighted that these representations were conducted over the course of one month.

15     It was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence of the accused’s sustained representations to the victim were:-

> (a)     Sometime in December 2013, the accused held in-person discussions with the victim representing that he was a shareholder in The Polo Room;

> (b)     The accused sent to the victim Whatsapp messages on 2 December 2013, 3 December 2013, 4 December 2013 and 9 January 2014 representing that he was involved in meetings with investors and shareholders.

> (c)     At the time the victim delivered the cheque to the accused on 9 January 2014, both of them had signed a document pertaining to the transaction.

16     It was submitted that in this regard, the accused’s sustained representations to the victim evidenced a high degree of premeditation and planning and this ought to be reflected in the sentence.

#### Mitigating Factors are not Exceptional

## Plea of Guilt

17     It was submitted that the accused’s plea of guilt is a recognised mitigating factor that ought to be taken into account by the court. However, any discount afforded by the court must be moderated by the fact that the plea of guilt was only entered after the trial had commenced and after the principal witness _ie_ the victim had commenced giving testimony. Therefore, the rational for a sentencing discount (i.e. saving the court’s time) was not fully met in this instance.

## Voluntary return to Singapore

18     It was further submitted that some weight should be accorded to the accused’s voluntary return to Singapore, but not inordinately so. While the accused was overseas, the police had contacted the accused on several occasions requesting that he return to Singapore to assist in investigations. The accused eventually contacted the police upon his return in December 2017.

19     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s father is a Singapore Permanent Resident who has resided in Singapore for many years. The accused therefore has some roots in Singapore. His return to Singapore to assist in investigations cannot therefore be viewed as an exceptional mitigating circumstance.

## Restitution

20     It was submitted that the accused’s act of making full restitution constitutes a mitigating factor that ought to be taken into account by this court. The High Court had held that the making of restitution to reduce the victim’s degree of economic harm is relevant to the accused’s sentence (_Gan Chai Bee_ at \[61\]).

21     It was further submitted that the accused had made full restitution of S$75,000 to Robert on 29 January 2019. The Prosecution accepted that the making of full restitution reduced the degree of economic harm that the victim had suffered and was relevant to the accused’s sentence.

### A Sentence of Not Less Than Five Months’ Imprisonment is Appropriate

22     The Prosecution had sought a custodial sentence of not less than five months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the High Court had held that in determining an appropriate sentence for s 417 of the Penal Code offences, the primary yardstick will often be the value of the property involved (_Idya_ at \[48\]).

23     It was further submitted that in arriving at its sentencing position, the Prosecution has relied on three sentencing precedents.

> (a)      _PP v Seriwati Binte Salim_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 273</span> (“Seriwati”). In _Seriwati_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 417 PC involving S$45,000. One charge under s 465 PC was taken into consideration. Full restitution was made to the victim. The court imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment. The sentence was upheld on appeal.

24     It was highlighted that in _Seriwati_, the accused forged three invoices and a notice of assignment to deceive a factoring company into extending a loan of $45,000 to her business on the security of the invoices. She defaulted after two weekly repayments of the loan. In arriving at its decision, the court in _Seriwati_ considered the fact that the offender was untraced and had made full restitution, and that the offence was pre-meditated and planned.

25     It was submitted that these factors were similarly present in the current case. In the present case, the amount involved in the proceeded charge (S$50,000) was close to the amount in _Seriwati_ (S$45,000). It was the Prosecution’s case that as a starting point, the sentence for the proceeded charge should be four months’ imprisonment.

26     It was further submitted that an uplift of at least one month was appropriate to take into account the difference in the amount involved in the proceeded charge, and the significant sum ($25,000) involved in the TIC charge.

> (b)      _PP v Lee Hwai San Adrian Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 271</span>. (“Lee Hwai San”). In _Lee Hwai San_, the accused had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 417 Penal Code involving S$25,000 each. A third s 417 Penal Code charge involving S$15,000 was taken into consideration. Full restitution of S$65,000 was made to the victim. The court imposed a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for each of the two proceeded charges, with the sentences ordered to run concurrently. The sentence was upheld on appeal.

27     It was highlighted that in _Lee Hwai San_, the accused had deceived the victim into believing that the victim needed to pay an acquisition fee for the victim’s company to be acquired by a third party. To lend credence to his claims, the accused registered an internet domain and used this domain to send email correspondence to the victim. The victim also adopted a persona to correspond with the victim over email to convince the victim that there was genuine interest in acquiring the victim’s company. In arriving at its decision, the court in _Lee Hwai San_ had considered the fact that the offender was untraced and had made full restitution, and that there was a high degree of premeditation and planning. It was the Prosecution’s case that these factors were similarly present in the current case.

28     It was submitted that a sentence of at least five months’ imprisonment for charges amounting to a total of S$75,000 is in line with the decision in _Lee Hwai San_. In particular, an uplift of at least one month was appropriate to reflect the S$10,000 difference between the cases.

> (c)      _PP v Rachel Ann Fernandez_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 50</span> (“Rachel Ann Fernandez”). In _Rachel Ann Fernandez_, the accused had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 417 Penal Code involving S$56,000. One charge under s 471 read with s 465 Penal Code was taken into consideration. Full restitution was made to the victim. The court imposed a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment. An appeal was filed by the accused but the appeal has yet to be dealt with.

29     In _Rachel Ann Fernandez_, the accused had deceived the victim by representing that she could assist the victim to participate in a gold investment opportunity purportedly offered by DBS. This investment opportunity required the victim to hand over gold bars that would be deposited with DBS. In return, the victim would receive a monthly return of 4% of the value of the gold bars, each month, over a period of three months. In arriving at its decision, the court in _Rachel Ann Fernandez_ considered the fact that the offender was untraced and had made full restitution, and that there was clear planning by the accused in the commission of the offence. It was submitted that these factors were relevant in the current matter.

30     It was highlighted that the court in _Rachel Ann Fernandez_ had also considered the offender’s misuse of financial instruments and targeting of an elderly victim as aggravating factors. These factors were not present in the current matter. It was submitted that in the present case, the amount involved in the proceeded charge (S$50,000) was close to the amount in _Rachel Ann Fernandez_ (S$45,000). Nevertheless, the current matter also involves a TIC charge involving $25,000. Taking these into consideration, it was further submitted that a reduction of two months from the sentence in _Rachel Ann Fernandez_ would be appropriate in the current matter.

31     In conclusion, for the above reasons, it was submitted that a sentence of at least five months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the current matter.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

### Charges

32     In his written plea in mitigation, it was highlighted by Counsel that the accused had pleaded guilty and admitted to the first charge and the Statement of Facts. He had agreed to the second charge being taken into consideration but was unable to recall the events stated in \[8\] of the Statement of Facts involving Carver Andrew Edward in 2013.

33     It was submitted that the accused had initially claimed trial but elected to plead guilty after the charges and particulars were amended and the sentencing positions were reviewed. The accused had made full restitution of SGD75,000 to the victim in January 2019, a strong mitigating factor warranting leniency.

## Background

34     It was the Defence’s case that the accused and the victim became friends in 2013, socialising and travelling with each other regularly. He was 28 years’ old with an educational qualifications equivalent to secondary school while the victim was 15 years older and holding the position of Director and Head of Sales and Trading for Futures, Singapore and Hong Kong at Citibank.

35     It was submitted that the accused knew Carver Andrew Edward (“Carver”) and socialised with the victim at DOM Lounge where Carver worked. Carver and the accused had discussed starting a bar called “The Polo Room”. Our client was a polo player with strong networks within the polo community and the idea was to create a luxury experience for high net worth individuals in Singapore.

36     It was futher submitted that Carver had prepared a proposal as well as the operating budget and incorporated The Polo Room Entertainment Pte Ltd (“Company”). Carver had sent the accused the term sheet outlining that the accused would have 40% share of the Company for $400,000 and the receipt of transfer of $400,000 (with $200,000 contributed by the accused).

## Offence

37     It was the Defence’s case that the accused did not transfer the funds and was not a shareholder of the Company. However, the concept of The Polo Room remained viable if there were investors. It was submitted that it was in this context, the victim was approached and he was interested. In fact, the accused and the victim even scouted possible locations for the bar at Duxton and Botanic Gardens.

38     It was further submitted that the accused recalled signing a document upon receiving the SGD50,000 cheque from the victim in January 2014. However, neither the accused nor the victim could recall the terms/contents of this document which may have been no more than acknowledgement of receipt. Subsequently, two documents were prepared with the victim and signed by both in February 2014.

39     It was the Defence’s case that the accused conceded making the false representation that he owned shares in the Company that would be sold to the victim. It was submitted that even though the funds were used for other expenses/projects, the accused did intend to repay the victim. It was submitted that in March 2014, the accused moved to Indonesia for another business project but continued to socialise and travel with the victim.

40     It was further the Defence’s case that the victim was interested in this business project as well and had extended a personal loan (with interest) to the accused. Unfortunately, the accused was cheated in this business in Jakarta and lost the investment of about SGD500,000 which resulted in the accused lodging a police report in November 2014 and being unable to repay the victim.

41     It was submitted that between November 2014 to November 2017, the accused maintained contact with the victim and attempted to repay him. However, the accused could only repay about SGD20,000 of the loan and the victim contacted our client’s father, obtained legal advice, lodged a police report, started civil proceedings and engaged debt collectors that went to the accused’s father.

42     According to his Counsel, the accused understood that the victim had financial difficulties during this period and had limited options himself but did not disconnect from the victim during this period even though there was a risk of exposure in social media and the accused was outside jurisdiction. It was submitted that by then the accused had matured and wanted to make amends.

43     It was further submitted that in December 2017, the accused voluntarily returned to Singapore, knowing there was a pending investigation and accepted the risk that he would not be able to leave Singapore. His girlfriend was pregnant and a wedding was on the cards then but he elected to face the music in Singapore because that was the responsible decision.

44     It was highlighted that the accused was charged in January 2018 and has not been allowed to leave jurisdiction since and has been reporting for monthly renewal of his Special Pass. Consequently, his girlfriend (now wife) came to Singapore and his daughter was born in June 2018. The accused, his wife and daughter have been receiving his father’s support.

45     It was submitted that while in Singapore, the accused has continued working on projects with his father’s help and had made restitution in January 2019 of the subject matter of the charges as well as a settlement in January 2020 the personal loan (with interest). The accused was adjudged bankrupt over the loan but annulment of bankruptcy was pending.

## Offender

46     It was submitted that the accused is 34 years old (DOB : 15 November 1985) and Swedish but was born in Singapore. His father is a Permanent Resident and has been in Singapore for over 30 years. His father is a successful businessman and the accused had aspired to be an entrepreneur too. Unfortunately, the accused went too far with The Polo Room and crossed the line.

47     It was submitted that the accused is no longer the same person that committed this offence in 2014. This was demonstrated by the fact that:

> (a)     he maintained contact with the victim;

> (b)     he attempted to repay the victim;

> (c)     returned to Singapore instead of remaining outside jurisdiction cooperated with the police and

> (d)     made restitution/settlement with the victim.

## Sentence

48     It was submitted that s 417 of the Penal Code provides:

> Whoever cheats shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.

49     It was highlighted that in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR 653</span>, the appellate court examined the consideration of “public interest” in sentencing.

> (1)    Public interest per se does not constitute an autonomous and distinct sentencing principle.It is merely an all-embracing reference to the conventional sentencing considerations of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation and prevention that continued to operate in all cases.Even after determining what is meant by the public interest, sentencing judges still had to ensure that the sentences passed are not disproportionate to both the severity of the offence committed as well as the moral and legal culpability of the offender: at \[21\], \[24\] and \[25\].

50     In _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span>, the appellate court made observations on sentencing for cheating cases:

> 48    As observed in Sentencing Practice, there are numerous factors that must be taken into account in every case. The primary yardstick will be the value of the property involved. However, where the offence entails the misuse of a financial instrument or facility which threatens the conduct of legitimate commerce, the need for general deterrence is likely to take central stage: see Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“Fernando Payagala”) at \[88\] in relation to the misuse of credit cards. Other factors such as the number and vulnerability of victims and the level of premeditation and deception involved will also feature to varying degrees in different cases: see Sentencing Practice at pp 834 to 838.

51     It was further highlighted in _PP v Lee Hwai San Adrian Matthew_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 271</span>, the court had referred to Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, Third Edition Volume I at \[837 to 838\] for the factors affecting sentence for an offence of cheating simpliciter or its more serious form. The offender pleaded guilty to two charges under s 417 of the Penal Code with a similar charge taken into consideration. The offender had cheated the victim into believing that the offender could help the victim’s company become acquired by a Malaysian public-listed company, “Sapura”. The accused deceived the victim into believing that he needed to pay an acquisition fee for his company to be acquired by Sapura and induced the transfer of two sums of $25,000 and an additional $15,000 into the accused’s own bank account ie. $65,000. The accused had taken multiple steps to deceive the victim such as creating fictitious accounts to correspond with the victim and giving the victim false documents. The false documents included a letter of intent purportedly issued by Sapura as well as a sale and purchase agreement purportedly setting out the terms of Sapura’s acquisition of the victim’s company. The letter of intent was on Sapura’s letterhead, and was signed off in the name of a fictitious persona the accused had invented. The offender acquired an internet domain and used this domain to send email correspondence to the victim. The accused posed as a fictitious persona and corresponded with the victim, and sent the sale and purchase agreement from the email account of this fictitious persona. The Court found that these circumstances reflected premeditation and a high degree of planning and imposed concurrent sentences of four months’ imprisonment.

52     It was the Defence’s case that The Polo Room was not a phantom construct devised to cheat the victim and the present methods were far less scheming/elaborate. It was submitted that the present case involved a lesser degree of planning/premeditation and a lower level of culpability. It was further submitted that although the global sum in the present case was SGD10,000 more, this would not warrant an uplift of one month’s imprisonment. Instead, the present circumstances warranted a similar or lower sentence.

## Conclusion

53     It was submitted in _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 63</span>, the appellate court espoused the calibrated approach to achieve “individualized justice” :-

> 24.    The circumstances of each case are of paramount importance in determining the appropriate sentence. Benchmarks and/or tariffs ... have significance, standing and value as judicial tools so as to help achieve a certain degree of consistency and rationality in our sentencing practices. They provide the vital framework of reference upon which rational and consistent sentencing decisions can be based. They ought not, however, to be applied rigidly or religiously. No two cases can or will ever be completely identical or symmetrical. The lower courts, while obliged to pay careful and thoughtful attention to tariffs and/or sentencing precedents, must not place them on an altar and obsessively worship them. The judicial prerogative to depart in a reasoned and measured manner from sentencing and precedent guidelines in appropriate cases should not be lightly shrugged off. Sentencing is neither a science nor an administrative exercise. Sentences cannot be determined with mathematical certainty. Nor should they be arbitrary. The sentence must fit the crime. Every sentence reflects a complex amalgam of numerous and various factors and imponderables and requires the very careful evaluation of matters such as public interest, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the identity of the offender. Most crucially, it calls for the embodiment of individualized justice. This in turn warrants the application of sound discretion. General benchmarks, while highly significant, should not by their very definition be viewed as binding or fossilised judicial rules, inducing a mechanical application.

54     It was further highlighted in _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v. PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 250</span>, the appellate court made observations on deterrence and proportionality in sentencing:-

> 25.    While a firm view should be taken of the offence under s 47(3) of the current Passports Act (and, indeed, the offences under s 47 of that Act in general), much will turn on the nature of the offence involved (in terms of, inter alia, the specific criminal conduct of the accused) and the culpability of the accused. The court should refrain from imposing a punishment that is disproportionate to the actual or potential harm or damage done to society. There is an established role for deterrent sentencing vis-à-vis certain types of offences (for instance, where it is sought to stem the incidence of a particular type of offence). But, even where this objective applies, there will arise from time to time cases in which it may not necessarily be appropriate to impose a deterrent sentence. The culpability of the accused should cross a certain threshold before a deterrent punishment is imposed on him or her. What that threshold is depends very much on the nature of the offence which has been designated or identified as warranting the imposition of a deterrent sentence. In the present case, on the evidence before the court, I did not consider that the Appellant had crossed the requisite threshold. Judges should not blindly apply any sentencing principle without considering all the circumstances of the case at hand, especially the culpability of the accused in that particular case. It cannot be over-emphasised that the court must apply its mind to the facts of each case before it and determine the appropriate sentence accordingly.

55     It was the Defence’s case that the accused had no antecedents of any kind in any jurisdiction and had chosen to return to Singapore to resolve this matter, face the music and start afresh with a clean slate. It was submitted that a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for this offender, commensurate for this offence and proportionate with the precedents.

## The Prosecution’s Reply

56     In response to the Defence’s address on sentence, it was highlighted that the main trust of their argument was that the culpability of _Lee Hwai San_ was higher and that Prosecution accepts that was so. It was submitted that the degree of premeditation and planning in the present case was ultimately still high due to the sustained representation. It was further submitted that the WhatsApp messages was over one month.

57     It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that the document had been disposed off. It was submitted at paragraph 14 of the Statement of Fact the message on 4 December 2013 had made reference to a trust and sales agreement. It was further submitted that the documents had been signed at the same time.

58     It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that the accused's voluntary return should be considered. In response, it was submitted that the accused had been born in Singapore and was in Singapore until he was 18. As such his return in Singapore cannot be considered exceptional.

59     It was further submitted that apart from the complainant, another witness, an Investigating Officer had given evidence. Hence the rationale of saving the Court's time has not been fully met.

## The Defence’s Reply

60     In response to the Prosecution’s reply it was highlighted that on the issue of the documents signed in January 2014 upon receipt of first cheque, the Prosecution had referred to chat messages in December 2013. It was submitted that it referred to the accused asking his office to prepare the documents but it was not prepared.

61     It was highlighted that Prosecution had accepted that the culpability of the offender in _Lee Hwai San_ was higher. It was the Defence’s case that while the quantum is a significant factor, the actual mechanism is significant. Ultimately, the accused did not deny that he made mistakes. He accepted that he has to face the music and he had repaid the victim when he could.

62     The court was urged to consider what was the calibrated sentence that balances deterrence and culpability and it was submitted that three to four months’ imprisonment would be adequate and commensurate.

## Sentence

#### Prescribed Penalty

63     The prescribed punishment for an offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with a fine, or to both.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

64     In the present case, the accused had deceived the victim into delivering a cheque of S$50,000. Another charge of cheating involving the delivery of a cheque of $25,000 was to be taken into consideration in sentence. I agreed with the Prosecution that this represented a substantial sum and ought to be reflected in sentence.

65     For an offence under s 417 of the Penal Code, a custodial sentence would generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value (see _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> at \[47). In addition as highlighted by the Prosecution, the High Court in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> at \[42\] had held that in sentencing for financial and property related offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence.

66     In the present case, I was mindful that both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement on this aspect and the divergence of views was only on the appropriate length of the sentence for the proceeded charge. The Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least five months’ imprisonment while the Defence had sought a sentence of between three to four months’ imprisonment.

67     In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the present case, I had considered the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution. I had also considered the twin factors of harm and culpability. In terms of the harm caused, in the present case a substantial amount was involved namely, $50,000 for the proceeded charge and $25,000 for the charge that was taken into consideration. As the amounts involved in the present case was clearly substantial, I was of the view that this should point towards a significant custodial sentence being imposed.

68     In terms of the accused’s culpability, I was of the view the present case involved a high degree of planning and premeditation although the scheme was not as elaborate as in _Lee Hwai San Adrian Matthew_. The accused had made sustained representations to the victim over the course of one month that he was a shareholder in The Polo Room when in fact he was not. This discussion culminated with the signing of the Sale Agreement (_Exhibit P11_) and Declaration of Trust (_Exhibit P12_) provided by the accused that were signed by both the victim and the accused on 5 February 2014. I noted that the funds provided by the victim were in actual fact used for the accused’s other expenses/projects.

69     It was highlighted in his plea in mitigation that the accused had voluntary returned to Singapore in 2017, he had pleaded guilty and had made full restitution in January 2019 . In the present case, I was of the view that the accused was not entitled to any significant sentencing discount for pleading guilty as he had done so only on the second day of the trial and after the victim (PW2) had given evidence and was therefore weak evidence of his remorse.

70     In addition, while I accepted that the making of full restitution reduced the degree of economic harm that the victim had suffered and was relevant to the accused’s sentence, I was mindful that it was only made on 29 January 2019 after the victim had lodged a police report and had commenced civil proceedings to recover the monies. Hence I placed limited mitigatory weight on this factor. Nevertheless, I took into account the fact that he was a first offender and had cooperated with the police.

71     Accordingly, after a careful consideration the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct, I imposed a sentence of five months’ imprisonment for DAC-903336-2018. In my view, this sentence was just and appropriate as a form of general deterrence having regard to the nature and circumstances of the present case.
