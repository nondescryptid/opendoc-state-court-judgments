Employment Law – Safety at work

Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/ DCA 42/2021.\]

30 November 2021

### District Judge Ng Tee Tze Allen:

1       This action arose from a workplace accident. The plaintiff fell from a metal plank which was placed at the first tier of a three-tier scaffold, sustained injuries, and sued.

2       The suit was bifurcated and I heard the trial on liability. The principal issues were whether the defendants were negligent, and whether (and if so, the extent) the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. At the end of the trial, I found the defendants to be negligent. I also found the plaintiff contributorily negligent and entered interlocutory judgment at 80% in favour of the plaintiff.

3       The plaintiff has appealed and I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## Background facts

4       The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise stated.

5       The accident took place on 29 January 2019 at Bidadari Park Drive (the “**worksite**”).[^1] The 2nd defendant was the main contractor of the project and the occupier of the worksite,[^2] and the 1st defendant was its subcontractor.

6       The plaintiff was a construction worker who was employed by the 1st defendant in or around September 2017. Prior to this engagement, he was employed by the 1st defendant in or around 2007. All in, he had worked with the 1st defendant for about six to seven years.[^3]

7       On the day of the accident, the plaintiff was assigned to help install metal formwork. This involved guiding a metal form that would be lowered by a tower crane. To do so, the plaintiff needed to work at some height. As such, he placed a single metal plank onto the first tier of a three-tier scaffolding (essentially, a three-tier metal frame). This metal plank served as the work platform from which the plaintiff was supposed to work.[^4] I pause to note that all parties agreed, and I accept, that this was not a safe way to work. The precise reasons are set out at \[17\]-\[24\] (below).

8       Returning to the narrative, the plaintiff climbed onto the metal plank after placing it on the scaffolding and started to guide the metal form.[^5] Whilst doing so, he fell and sustained injuries.[^6]

## The key issues

9       Both defendants accepted that they owed the plaintiff a duty of care—the 1st defendant because it was the plaintiff’s employer, and the 2nd defendant because it was the main contractor and occupier of the worksite.[^7] It was also the plaintiff’s case that the 2nd defendant was his _de facto_ employer.[^8] The defendants did not contest this in their closing or reply submissions. Instead, they proceeded on the basis that they both owed the plaintiff the duty to: (a) devise and implement a safe system of work, and (b) take reasonable steps to ensure that the system was complied with.[^9]

10     Here, a “system” includes the method of using or carrying out of particular processes, the instruction of apprentices, and the general conditions of work: _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 377</span> at \[48\].

11     However, the parties disagreed on the following broad issues:

> (a)     whether the defendants discharged their duty of care; and

> (b)     whether (and if so, the extent) the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.

12     I consider these broad issues in turn.

## Whether the defendants discharged their duty of care

13     Broadly, the plaintiff’s case was that the defendants breached their duty of care because they:[^10]

> (a)     required / permitted the plaintiff to work on an unsafe scaffold. In this respect, the plaintiff argued that the scaffold was not installed by properly trained and qualified personnel;[^11]

> (b)     failed to ensure the use of a proper fall arrest or fall restraint system;[^12]

> (c)     failed to ensure that the plaintiff was adequately trained and qualified before instructing and / or allowing him to work from the scaffold;[^13]

> (d)     failed to conduct a proper risk assessment of the worksite and the work to be carried out;[^14] and

> (e)     failed to ensure that the plaintiff was adequately supervised.[^15]

14     These assertions, together with the defendants’ responses, are considered below.

### Whether the defendants required / permitted the plaintiff to work on an unsafe scaffold

#### The parties’ cases

15     The plaintiff submitted that the defendants required / permitted him to work on an unsafe scaffold. His case was that (a) the work platform was too narrow;[^16] (b) the work platform was not secured to the scaffolding (i.e., the metal frame);[^17] and (c) the toe-boards and guardrails were not installed.[^18] He also argued that the scaffold was not installed by properly trained and qualified personnel. Here, the plaintiff did not take issue with the erection of the scaffolding (i.e., the metal frame). His complaint was that he was tasked to install the work platform on the scaffold even though he was not trained to.[^19]

16     The defendants agreed that the scaffold was unsafe. In this respect, they accepted that the work platform was too narrow and that it should have been secured to the scaffolding (i.e., the metal frame). However, they disagreed that toe-boards and guardrails were required. It was also the defendants’ case that the plaintiff was trained to install the work platform,[^20] and that the 1st defendant’s Senior Site Manager, Mr Jiang Yuanding (“**Mr Jiang**”) had scolded the plaintiff and told him to address the safety breaches about 15 minutes before the accident.[^21]

#### Reasons the scaffold was unsafe

17     Before considering whether the defendants required / permitted the plaintiff to work on an unsafe scaffold, I consider the precise reasons why the scaffold was unsafe.

18     As stated, it was common ground that the work platform that the plaintiff was working on was unsafe because it was too narrow and unsecured to the scaffolding (i.e., the metal frame). I agreed. Starting with its width, the Singapore Standard Code of Practice for Scaffolds (the “**Code**”) states at paragraph 9.8.1 that “_work platforms shall have a minimum width of 500 mm_”.[^22] However, the work platform which the plaintiff was standing on comprised a single plank that was only 240mm to 250mm wide. This was clearly not wide enough. I also accept that the metal plank should have been secured to the scaffolding. Otherwise, it might slip / shift and fall off the scaffolding.

19     I also accept the plaintiff’s submission that toe-boards, guardrails, and/or similar barricades (collectively, “**barricades**”) should have been installed. I explain.

20     First, the requirement for barricades at work platforms and workplaces from which a person may fall more than 2 metres is evident from the Workplace Safety and Health (Scaffolds) Regulations 2011 (the “**Scaffolds Regulations 2011**”) and the Workplace Safety and Health (Work at Heights) Regulations 2013 (“**Work at Heights Regulations 2013**”). In this respect, the defendants’ submission—that breach of a statutory duty does not in itself lend to a finding that there has been negligence[^23]— did not assist them much. It is trite that legislation and subsidiary legislation are relevant in ascertaining the appropriate standard of care: _Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd v Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 360</span> at \[43\]; _Miah Rasel v 5 Ways Engineering Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 480</span> (“**_Miah Rasel_**”) at \[30\]. In any event, the same requirement is also found in the Singapore Code of Practice for Scaffold (the “**Code**”) and their own internal SWP-Formwork. Extracts of the relevant regulations, Code and SWP-Formwork are set out below:

> Scaffolds Regulations 2011

> Toe-boards and guard-rails

> 22.—(1)    It shall be the duty of the responsible person to ensure that the requirements of paragraphs (2) to (6) are complied with.

> (**2**)     **Every side of a work platform or workplace from which a person is liable to fall more than 2 metres shall be provided with toe-boards and 2 or more guard-rails.**

> …

> (emphasis in bold)

> Work at Heights Regulations 2013

> Open sides and openings

> 8.—(1)    It shall be the duty of the occupier of a workplace to comply with paragraphs (2), (4) and (5).

> (2)    Subject to paragraphs (3) and (5), **every open side or opening into or through which a person is liable to fall more than 2 metres shall be covered or guarded by effective guard-rails or barriers to prevent fall.**

> …

> (5)    Where it is not reasonably practicable to comply with paragraph (2), or where a cover, guard-rail or barrier is removed under paragraph (3), or during the installation, alteration or removal of the covers, guard-rails or barriers —

>> (a)    a travel restraint system shall be used to prevent a person falling into or through the open side or opening referred to in paragraph (2); or

>> (b)    where it is not reasonably practicable to comply with sub-paragraph (a), a fall arrest system shall be used.

> (emphasis in bold)

> The Code [^24]

> 9.8.5 Toeboards

> Toeboards and end toeboards should be suitably fixed to all work platforms where a person may fall. The toeboard should have a minimum height of 150 mm and placed within the standards.

> …

> 9.8.6 Guardrails

> 9.8.6.1 Work platforms from which a person may fall should have a guard rail and end guardrails fixed inside the standards at a height of 1 m above the level of the decking.

> The 1st defendant’s SWP-Formwork _[^25]_

> 6\. Usage of Fall Protection Devices:

>> 1\. …

>> …

>> 4\. All openings whereby a person is liable to fall more than 2m, effective barricades must be provided with at least 2 guard rails with a rail at 1.0m and a mid rail.

>> …

21     In the present case, it was clear that the plaintiff was working at a height exceeding 2 metres. The plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence was that he was working on the first tier of the scaffold, which was in turn installed on the top of base jacks.[^26] And this, the 1st defendant’s Mr Jiang accepted, meant that the plaintiff would have been working at a height of more than 2 metres:[^27]

> Q:    Correct. So, if you were stand---if you were building a 1st tier, that is 1.9 metres scaffolding, you will put it on the jack and the height of that scaffolding will be more than 2 metres because of the jack. Because the jack itself is 20cm.

> A    Correct, will be over 2 metres.

> Q    Correct. So, 20cm plus the 1.9 scaffold, yes.

> A    Correct.

> Q    So, anybody standing on the 1st tier will be standing at the height of above 2 metres.

> A    Yes.

22     In the circumstances, I find that barricades were required unless the defendants could establish some basis for non-compliance.

23     In this respect, the defendants attempted to rely on Regulation 8(5) of the Work at Heights Regulations 2013.[^28] Regulation 8(5) permits non-compliance when it is not reasonably practicable to install barricades (see \[20\] above). And here, the defendants’ submitted that Mr Jiang “_testified that the progress of the work then was at the building stage, where guardrails were not existent. It was only when everything was done then guardrails can be arranged_”.[^29] I rejected this submission. Amongst other things, it did not explain why the defendants could not ensure that the scaffold was properly built before having the plaintiff work on it.

24     For the reasons above, I find the scaffold to be unsafe because: (a) its work platform was too narrow, (b) the work platform was not secured to the scaffolding, and (c) the necessary barricades were not installed. I turn to the issue of whether the defendants permitted / required the plaintiff to work on the unsafe scaffold.

#### The defendants permitted / required the plaintiff to work on a scaffold without the necessary barricades

25     In my judgment, the defendants had permitted / required the plaintiff to work on a scaffold that did not have the necessary barricade(s).

26     There was no question that the plaintiff was required to work on the scaffold,[^30] or that the scaffold did not have the necessary barricades.

27     Moreover, it was clear that the defendants had no objections to the plaintiff working on a scaffold without barricades. Indeed, their case was that such barricades were not needed at all. I have, however, found otherwise for the reasons at \[19\]-\[23\] above.

#### The defendants permitted / required the plaintiff to build the scaffold even though he was not properly trained

28     Next, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendants did not ensure that the scaffold was built by properly trained and qualified persons.

29     As mentioned, the plaintiff did not take issue with the erection of the scaffolding. Instead, his complained that he should not have been allowed to install the work platform because he was not trained to do so in accordance with Scaffolds Regulations 2011.[^31] The Scaffolds Regulations 2011, regulation 5 states:

> Scaffold erectors

> 5.    It shall be the duty of the responsible person to ensure that **no person is involved in the construction**, erection, **installation**, re-positioning, **alteration**, maintenance, repair or dismantling **of a scaffold** in a workplace **unless he has successfully completed a training course acceptable to the Commissioner, to equip him to perform the work of a scaffold erector**.

> (emphasis in bold)

30     The defendants did not argue that installing the work platform on the scaffold fell outside of regulation 5’s ambit. Instead, they argued that the plaintiff was adept and experienced in erecting scaffold and that he was aware of the safety requirements surrounding the building of the work platform.[^32]

31     I agreed with the plaintiff. His unchallenged evidence was that he was only a timber formworker,[^33] and that he did not have a scaffold erector permit.[^34]

32     There was also no evidence of the plaintiff attending any official training courses to erect scaffolds. The only scaffold erection training which the defendants brought to my attention was the 1st defendant’s own internal training.[^35] However, they did not explain what this “internal training” comprised or prove that this “internal training” was “a training course acceptable to the Commissioner” per Scaffolds Regulations 2011, regulation 5.

#### Mr Jiang’s alleged scolding not proved

33     I turn to the defendants’ defence that Mr Jiang had scolded the plaintiff for working on an unsecured metal plank shortly before the accident and instructed him to rectify the safety breaches before carrying on his work.

34     This assertion was not supported by the evidence. According to the defendants, the alleged scolding took place between 17:29:58 to 17:30:13.[^36] However, Mr Jiang testified that he “wasn’t there”[^37] when plaintiff’s counsel directed him to relevant part of the video. Further, when I asked Mr Jiang if he was able to identify himself in the video, he stated that he could not.[^38]

35     For the reasons above, I find that the defendants find that the defendants required / permitted the plaintiff to work on an unsafe scaffold.

### Whether the defendants ensured the use of a proper fall arrest or fall restraint system was provided or implemented

36     I turn to the question of whether the defendants failed to ensure the use of a fall arrest or fall restraint system. Briefly, a fall arrest or fall restraint system is a system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of injury to a person in the event of a fall. Such systems may comprise a safety net, full-body harness, lanyard, and anchorage line and anchorage.

37     In the present case, the parties agreed that a fall arrest or fall restraint system should have, but was not, used. As such, the question was whether the defendants ensured the use of such a system.

38     The plaintiff’s case was that he was not provided with suitable equipment. Accordingly, the full body safety equipment / harness provided was designed for falls from heights exceeding 5 metres. However, he was only working just above 2 metres. As such, a safety belt should have been used instead. The defendants disagreed.[^39] They took the position that appropriate equipment was provided, and that Mr Jiang had scolded the plaintiff when he was seen not using the safety harness.[^40]

39     In my judgment, the defendants did not ensure the use of a fall arrest or fall restraint system, even if the appropriate full body safety equipment / harness had been provided. As stated at \[33\]-\[35\] above, I was unable to find that the alleged scolding took place.

40     More importantly, even if Mr Jiang had scolded the plaintiff for working unsafely and had told him to rectify the safety breaches, he did not take issue with missing fall arrest or fall restraint system. This is clear from his evidence:

> (a)     In his AEIC, Mr Jiang stated that he had ordered the plaintiff “to stop working and demanded that they put the three pieces of metal planks together and tie the same tightly with wires before they continued working.”[^41] There was no mention of the missing fall arrest or fall restraint system.

> (b)     Mr Jiang’s “Report on worker Zhang Mingjun’s incident” described the incident in similar terms. After stating that he saw the plaintiff working unsafely, he stated “I ordered them to stop working and demanded that they put 3 pieces of footboard and tie the same tightly with wires before they could continue work.”[^42] Again, there was no mention of the missing fall arrest or fall restraint system.

### Whether the plaintiff was trained to work on the scaffold

41     The plaintiff pleaded that he was not adequately trained or qualified to work from the work platform on the scaffold.[^43] I reject this assertion.

42     The plaintiff’s own evidence made clear that he had received such training. When cross-examined, the plaintiff testified that he attended a safety orientation course at Wong Fong Academy where he learnt “about scaffolds” and the need for “personal attention for safety”.[^44] When re-examined, he explained that the training involved learning how to negotiate the scaffold safety and how to “_use the full body safety equipment_”.[^45]

43     His evidence also made clear that the plaintiff was experienced working on scaffolds. In his AEIC, he stated that he was trained as a timber formworker.[^46] When cross-examined, he testified that he had 6 to 7 years of experience working as a formworker,[^47] and had climbed scaffolds at least 600 to 700 times during the course of his work.[^48]

44     Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff was trained to work on scaffolds and had considerable experience doing so.

### Whether the defendants conducted a risk assessment

45     The plaintiff pleaded that the defendants failed to conduct a proper risk assessment of the worksite and the work.[^49] He submitted that:- (a) a proper risk assessment would have identified and eliminated the risks which the plaintiff undertook, and (b) the defendants’ failure to disclose the risk assessment proved that none was conducted.[^50]

46     The defendants denied the plaintiff’s allegations in their Defence (Amendment No. 2).[^51]

47     In considering the parties’ submissions, the High Court’s approach in _Miah Rasel_ is instructive. In that case, the court had to determine, amongst other issues, whether the defendant had conducted a preliminary risk assessment of works done by its employee. In finding that the defendant did not, the court stated at \[37\]-\[38\] that no evidence was produced to substantiate or corroborate the defendant’s bare assertions of any such risk assessments being done. As such, the court inferred that the defendant had withheld evidence because either: (a) the evidence would have been unfavourable to the defendants if produced, or (b) they did not exist.

48     Similarly, in the present case, the only evidence before me was the testimony of the 2nd defendant’s Mr Hariharan on cross-examination that the risk assessment was done by the 1st defendant and that he had a copy of the risk assessment.[^52] This was, however, a bare assertion. The risk assessment was not produced.[^53] Further, even though the defendants acknowledged the plaintiff’s allegation that “_the Defendants have breached their duty of care … by failing to perform a risk assessment_”[^54] in in their reply submissions, they said nothing to rebut it. In the circumstances, I accept the plaintiff’s submissions that a proper risk assessment was not conducted.

### Whether the defendants failed to supervise the defendant

49     In _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 377</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at \[46\] that “the employer should be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, as far as possible, reduce the effects of an employee’s own careless.” This is why employers owe a duty to supervise their employees to ensure compliance with the system: _Lu Bang Song v Teambuild Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 49</span> at \[21\].

50     In the present case, the plaintiff’s case was that the defendants failed to supervise him when he was: (a) installing the work platform,[^55] and (b) when he was working on it.[^56] I accept these points.

51     I start with the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendants failed to supervise him when he was installing the work platform. In this regard, the defendants accepted that the plaintiff was not supervised when he was constructing the work platform. However, the defendants submitted that:

> (a)     the plaintiff should not be allowed to argue that the defendants failed to supervise the plaintiff in building the work platform because the alleged breach of regulation 6 was not pleaded;[^57] and

> (b)     the law did not impose a duty of constant supervision and that it was sufficient that instructions on how to carry out the works safely and properly were given especially if the work in question was simple and done frequently.[^58]

52     I consider the defendants’ submissions in turn.

53     Starting with the defendants’ pleading point, I did not agree that the failure to plead regulation 6 was fatal to the plaintiff’s case. Regulation 6 concerned the appointment of a scaffold supervisor, not the duty to supervise. That duty is governed by regulation 8. And here, the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) stated at \[19.43\] “\[i\]n breach of Regulation 8 of the Scaffolds Regulations, failing to ensure that no scaffold is constructed, erected installed, re-positioned, altered, maintained, repaired or dismantled in a workplace except under the immediate supervision of a scaffold supervisor.” Regulations 6 and 8 are set out below for ease of reference.

> Scaffold supervisor

> 6.—(1)    It shall be the duty of the responsible person to **appoint** a scaffold supervisor before any construction, erection, installation, re-positioning, alteration, maintenance, repair or dismantling of a scaffold in a workplace.

> (2)    The responsible person shall not appoint any person as a scaffold supervisor unless the person is one —

>> (a)    who has successfully completed a training course acceptable to the Commissioner, to equip him to be a scaffold supervisor; and

>> (b)    whom the responsible person reasonably believes is competent to perform the functions and duties of a scaffold supervisor.

> Supervision of construction, erection, installation, re-positioning, alteration, maintenance, repair or dismantling of scaffolds

> 8.    It shall be the duty of the responsible person to ensure that no scaffold is constructed, erected, installed, re-positioned, altered, maintained, repaired or dismantled in a workplace except under the **immediate supervision** of a scaffold supervisor.

> (emphasis in bold)

54     I turn to the defendants’ second argument. While I accept that the law did not impose a duty of constant supervision for simple tasks, I did not think that the principle assisted the defendants. Scaffolds Regulations 2011, regulation 8 clearly required, amongst other things, the construction, installation, and alteration to be conducted under the immediate supervision of a scaffold supervisor. Moreover, I did not think that the installation of the work platform could be considered a “simple task” on the facts before me. The plaintiff was **not** a scaffold erector and should not have been constructing the scaffold to begin with (see \[28\]-\[32\] above).

55     I also find that the defendants failed to properly supervise the plaintiff whilst he was working on the scaffold. In this respect, I was prepared to accept that a more general level of supervision was sufficient when the plaintiff was simply doing formwork for which he was trained. However, there was no evidence of even this being done. Their sole submission was that they had discharged this duty because Mr Jiang had allegedly scolded the plaintiff for his safety breaches about 15 minutes before the accident. However, I rejected this submission for the reasons at \[33\]-\[34\] above. In any event, even if the alleged scolding took place, it was insufficient. As seen at \[39\]-\[40\] above, Mr Jiang did not ensure the use of the fall restraint or fall arrest system even though it was an important safety feature.

### Conclusion

56     For the reasons above, I find that the defendants had breached their duty of care to the plaintiff by requiring / permitting the plaintiff to work on an unsafe scaffold, failing to ensure the use a proper fall arrest or fall restraint system, failing to conduct a proper risk assessment, and failing to supervise the plaintiff adequately.

57     I turn to consider whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.

## Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent

58     The law on contributory negligence was not in dispute. It is encapsulated in s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) which provides for a partial defence by reducing the quantum of damages payable to a claimant who failed to take care of his of safety, thereby causing loss to himself:

> Apportionment of liability in case of contributory negligence

> 3.—(1)    Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.

59     In this regard, the plaintiff’s counsel sought to rely on _Zheng Yu Shan v Lian Beng Construction (1988) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 587</span> (“**_Zheng Yu Shan_**”) at \[51\] to argue that “_an employee can never be found to be contributorily negligent when his employer has been remiss in its duty to provide a safe system of work.”[^59]_ I reject this argument. The plaintiff’s counsel has misread _Zheng Yu Shan._ The court had held the exact opposite:

> 51    I would hasten to add, however, **that this is** **not to say** **that an employee can never be found to be contributorily negligent when his employer has been remiss in its duty to provide a safe system of work.** One can readily think of instances where the action undertaken by the employee is so reckless or in such total disregard for his own safety that he ought to be held liable for and/or contributorily negligent vis-à-vis his resultant injury. A possible example would be where an employee gets involved in a fight with his fellow employees and engages in retaliatory destructive acts (see, eg, the fact situation in China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd v Shao Hai <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 479</span>). The court will, in the final analysis, take a common-sense approach in assessing the culpability (if any) of an employee vis-à-vis an injury which he has suffered while working in cases where his employer itself has been found wanting.

> (emphasis added)

60     Further, the courts have on many occasions found an employee contributorily negligent despite his employer’s failure to provide a safe system of work: _Lee Swee Chon v Kiat Seng Metals Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 22</span> (“**_Lee Swee Chon_**”) at \[35\]-\[38\], \[47\], \[51\]; _Chen Qiangshi v Hong Fei CDY Construction Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 177</span> (“**_Chen Qiangshi_**”) at \[204\]-\[206\], \[226\]; _Krishnamoorthy Kumar v Nam Hong Builders Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 25</span> (“**_Krishnnamoorthy Kumar_**”) at \[41\]-\[54\]; _Miah Rasel_ at \[44\]-\[48\].

61     In the present case, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent because he operated in an unsafe manner even though he knew how to work on scaffolds safely. The defendants contended that this was because the plaintiff had: (1) attended safety training courses where he learnt to work on scaffolds safely, (2) attended daily toolbox talks where he was reminded about the safety requirements, and (3) been scolded 15 minutes about his safety breaches before the accident.

62     I accept the defendants’ first contention. The plaintiff admitted to attending training courses where he learned to navigate scaffold[^60] and the safety precautions that should be taken. In particular, he knew that work platforms should comprise at least 2 planks,[^61] and that it was important that the metal planks comprising the work platform be secured to scaffolding (i.e., the metal frame).[^62] He also admitted that he was an experienced worker with about six to seven years under his belt and who had worked on scaffolds on numerous occasions.[^63] Notwithstanding his training and experience, he took the risk of working in an unsafely.

63     I was not able to accept the defendants’ second contention. First, it was not pleaded. Moreover, I was not prepared to place much weight on the 29 January 2019 attendance sheet[^64] which the defendants relied on. Indeed, the undisputed facts casted considerable doubt on the veracity of supposed contemporaneous documents. I explain.

> (a)     More than a month after the accident on 6 March 2019, the 1st defendant submitted a false WSH Incident Report which incorrectly stated that the plaintiff “trip and fall lead to right foot affected with pain”.[^65] This incorrect statement was made notwithstanding the 1st defendant’s stated rationale in the WSH Incident Report that it had reported this incident late because “additional time required for investigations to determine it is work-related”.[^66]

> (b)     Furthermore, the plaintiff’s uncontested evidence revealed that the 1st defendant had required the plaintiff to sign a statement which falsely describe how he fell. According to the plaintiff, the 1st defendant’s safety supervisor, had on 14 March 2019, handed the plaintiff a statement to sign. The statement falsely stated that the plaintiff had “slipped on the staircase and injured \[himself\].”[^67] As this was not true, the plaintiff refused to sign it.

> (c)     This led to a visit from the 1st defendant’s Ms. Evelyn Tham the next day. And despite the plaintiff explaining to Ms Tham what had happened, Ms Tham assured him that signing the false statement was for his own benefit because if “\[he\] stated that \[he\] had fallen from the Decking, it would be \[his\] “own responsibility” and that will affect \[his\] injury compensation.”[^68] Eventually, the plaintiff signed the false statement.[^69]

64     Finally, I also reject the defendants’ third contention that Mr Jiang had scolded the plaintiff and directed him to rectify his safety breaches for the reasons at \[33\]-\[35\] above.

## How liability should be apportioned

### The relevant cases

65     In apportioning liability, the law tends to lean in favour of the employee who suffered damage due to his employer’s negligence. This is because the primary responsibility for ensuring safety rests with the employer: _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 377</span> at \[44\]_._ This is illustrated by the following cases.

66      _Lee Swee Chon_ concerned a workplace accident where a heavy stack of aluminum sheets fell on the claimant. The claimant was supporting the aluminum sheets whilst his colleague flipped through them to look for a sheet of the appropriate dimensions. Eventually, the weight of the aluminum sheets exceeded the claimant’s ability to support them, and they fell on him.[^70] The court found the claimant found to be 35% liable, and the defendant 65% liable:[^71]

> (a)     The court found the claimant’s employer negligent because it allowed the aluminum sheet to lean against the wall without any supporting structure or rack which would prevent or minimize the likelihood of an accident.[^72]

> (b)     The court also found the claimant contributorily negligent because he had previously been instructed on how to retrieve the sheets safely.[^73]

67     In _Chen Qiangshi_ an experienced rebar construction worker was severely injured when an incorrectly positioned and improperly rigged rebar cage collapsed on him when it was lifted by a tower crane.[^74] The High Court found the claimant 50% liable for the accident because he had rigged up the rebar cage in an improper and unsafe manner and had released the remaining wire ties holding the rebar cage. The Court of Appeal adjusted the claimant’s share of liability to 20% without any written grounds. However, the Court of Appeal’s observations were summarised in _Lee Swee Chon_ at \[46\], which I gratefully adopt:

> (a)     The claimant must have appreciated that the rebar cage was not properly done.

> (b)     It was known to everyone that the claimant was not a qualified rigger and should not have been asked to do the rigging.

> (c)     There was a particular obligation on the contractors having control of the site to establish and maintain systems to ensure workplace safety and health. As such, damages were reduced to underscore the primary responsibility that is on the defendants.

68     The next case is _Krishnnamoorthy Kumar_. This case concerned an industrial accident at Fullerton Hotel. The claimant was a construction worker employed by the defendant. He was instructed to cut a timber skirting but was not provided with the appropriate timber cutting tools. As such, the claimant modified the tools that he had to carry out the work.[^75] This led to the accident and the claimant sustaining injuries. The court found the defendant 80% liable and the claimant 20% liable:

> (a)     The defendant was found to be negligent for failing because it failed to provide the appropriate tools. It also transpired that the defendant did not brief its employees on safety during the toolbox meetings, but instead focus on the work for the day. Further, its foreman was unsure of the relevant safety procedures.[^76]

> (b)     The claimant was found to be contributorily negligent because he was an experienced worker who had attended safety courses. Notwithstanding, he was prepared to compromise safety for convenience and had modified the inappropriate tools to do the job.[^77]

69     The final case I considered was _Miah Rasel_. In this case, the defendant had deployed the claimant and his supervisor to replace sprinkler pipes on the ceiling of a worksite. Whilst replacing the sprinkler pipes, the claimant stepped out onto an air conditioning duct. The duct gave way, and the claimant fell, sustaining injuries. The court found the claimant 25% contributorily negligent, and his employer 75% liable:

> (a)     The defendant was negligent because its supervisor had instructed the claimant to step onto the air conditioning duct,[^78] and lackadaisical in adherence to its obligations under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) and its accompanying regulations. Accordingly, the daily toolbox briefings were perfunctory affairs, and the defendant failed to provide adequately for the relevant personal protective equipment for working at height.[^79]

> (b)     The claimant was found to be contributorily negligent because he (i) was trained and sufficiently experienced to know the risk involved, and (ii) could have refrained from complying with the instructions and escalated the matter. Notwithstanding, he decided to undertake the risk.[^80]

### Apportionment of liability

70     Returning to the facts before us, it was clear to me that the defendants should bear greater liability for the plaintiff’s injuries. Even though they bore primary responsibility for safety, they required / permitted the plaintiff to work on an unsafe scaffold without a proper fall arrest or fall restraint system, failed to conduct a proper risk assessment, and failed to supervise the plaintiff adequately. They also permitted the plaintiff to build the scaffold’s work platform even though he was not properly trained to do so.

71     That said, the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. He worked unsafely despite his training and experience (see \[62\] above). Here, I find that the plaintiff’s circumstances to be less similar to the claimant in _Miah Rasel_ who was found 25% liable (see \[69\] above), and more similar to the claimants in _Chen Qiangshi_ (see \[67\] above) and _Krishnnamoorthy Kumar_ (see \[68\] above) who were found to be 20% liable.

72     Unlike the claimant in _Miah Rasel_ who appeared to be fully trained, the plaintiff was not a trained scaffold erector. As such, I was prepared to accept that he might not be fully aware of all the safety features required of the scaffold (such as the toe-boards and guardrails).

73     However, like the claimants in _Chen Qiangshi_ and _Krishnnamoorthy Kumar_, the plaintiff must have appreciated at least some of the risks involved. On his own evidence, he was an experienced formworker with six to seven years’ experience who had attended the relevant safety courses. Indeed, on his own evidence, he knew that the work platform was unsafe and that he should have used at least two metal planks and secured it with metal wires:[^81]

>   
| 

Tan:

 | 

Okay. Now, can you ask Mr. Zhang, how does he secure the 2 pieces of metal plank on top of the platform?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**To secure the metal planks on top of the platform, our company’s safety officer has said that we use metal wires.**

 |
| 

Tan:

 | 

Okay. I’m putting it to Mr. Zhang that it is the 1st Defendant’s standard operating procedure that there must be a minimum of 2 metal planks on the platform. Does he agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**According to safety regulations, yes, it cannot be less than 2.** But sometimes when working onsite, there are insufficient metal planks. And perhaps due to the supervisor rushing us or due to other reasons, workers would sometimes put 1.

 |
| 

(emphasis in bold)

 |

  
  

74     Notwithstanding, the plaintiff chose to use only 1 metal plank and to work on it before securing it to the scaffolding. Now, while I appreciate that the work may have been urgent, that is an insufficient basis to disregard safety: _Krishnnamoorthy Kumar_ at \[53\]-\[54\].

75     As such, I find the defendants 80% liable, and the plaintiff 20% liable.

## Conclusion

76     Interlocutory judgment is given to the plaintiff to the extent of 80% of the damages to be accessed. Issues of interest and costs are reserved to the hearing of the assessment of damages.
