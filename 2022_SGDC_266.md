Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Trials – Recusal or disqualification of deputy public prosecutors

Evidence – Witnesses – Privilege

8 November 2022

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       In these grounds of decision I explain in writing why I dismissed an application made by the defence in the midst of an ongoing trial for the recusal or disqualification of the deputy public prosecutors (“DPPs”) having conduct of the trial. The two co-accused in this trial, who are represented by the same team of defence counsel, stand charged as follows:

> (a)     Mr Selliaya Suresh (“Mr Suresh”) faces 23 charges for cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and 96 charges for forgery punishable under s 465 of the Penal Code.

> (b)     Mr Pirabu s/o Selliaya (“Mr Pirabu”) faces nine charges for cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code.

2       The defence made this recusal application orally in the afternoon of 25 August 2022, in the course of the prosecution’s re-examination of its 26th witness Mr Kishore Menon (“Mr Kishore”). In brief, the ground for the application was that the recusal of the DPPs was necessary in the interests of justice because they might be called as witnesses of fact in respect of what might be an allegation by Mr Kishore that, during an interview prior to his appearance in court as a witness in this trial, a DPP, or DPPs, gave him instructions as to how he should give his evidence in court. This supposed allegation – which for convenience I will refer to as the “Allegation” – was contained in the following exchange during the re-examination of Mr Kishore:

> \[Mr Kishore\]: Yes, okay. I was told, “Okay, what you tell in your statement, go to Court, you tell the same thing.” So---.

> \[DPP Tan Hsiao Tien\]: Mr Kishore, when were you told that?

> \[Mr Kishore\]: When I came to your office, we---we---

3       After the defence made the application I stood down the trial to give the parties time to prepare their submissions. The next day, 26 August 2022, I heard oral submissions in the morning and gave my decision orally in the afternoon dismissing the application.

4       The defence’s application appeared to be a novel one in that there are no local published decisions on the recusal or disqualification of DPPs in criminal proceedings. Hence, although I gave fairly detailed reasons orally at the time I dismissed the application, I take the liberty now to publish a written version of my reasons.

## Background

5       During the prosecution’s examination-in-chief of Mr Kishore it applied under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act 1893 to impeach his credit using a statement he had made to the police on 12 September 2017. I agreed that there were material differences between Mr Kishore’s testimony in court and the contents of this statement and accordingly admitted the statement pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act 1893.

6       One of the main areas of variance related to the identity of the individual (or individuals) who had instructed him to deliver, and collect, documents and other items to, and from, Mr Muhammad Salleh Bin Romdan, the prosecution’s ninth witness also known as “Alfie”, at One Fullerton. In his testimony in court Mr Kishore identified Mr Pirabu as that individual but in his statement of 12 September 2017 he had identified Mr Suresh.

7       In his subsequent examination-in-chief by the prosecution, cross-examination by the defence and re-examination by the prosecution, Mr Kishore was asked on multiple occasions to revisit this issue of fact. In fact, the defence also applied to impeach Mr Kishore’s credit using statements he had made to the police on 7 September 2017 in which he identified yet another person– Mr Sivanathan s/o Segaran, the prosecution’s 28th witness – as the individual who had instructed him concerning Alfie.

8       It eventually became clear that Mr Kishore was persisting in his testimony that Mr Pirabu was the individual who had instructed him in that regard. During re-examination the prosecution repeatedly confronted Mr Kishore with the inconsistency between this testimony and what he had said in his statement of 12 September 2017 and invited him to explain the inconsistency. It was in this broad context that Mr Kishore made the Allegation.

9       As a preliminary matter I agreed with the prosecution’s point that the Allegation was ambiguous. Although the Allegation was to the effect that on some occasion when Mr Kishore went to the DPPs’ office he was given some form of instruction to go along with his statement of 12 September 2017 when giving evidence in court, Mr Kishore did not go so far as to identify the specific individual or individuals who had given him this alleged instruction, or to state that a DPP was that individual or among those individuals, and he did not give any details of date and time.

10     While both the prosecution and the defence expressed at the commencement of the hearing on 26 August 2022 a desire to clarify the ambiguity in their favour, either with Mr Kishore himself or with the investigation officer who was said to have been present at the DPPs’ office, for reasons concerning litigation privilege that I will elaborate on at the conclusion of these grounds of decision, I thought that it was neither necessary nor desirable to obtain clarification at that time from Mr Kishore or anyone else. In deciding this application I took the defence’s case at its highest and assumed that the Allegation was that during the relevant interview at least one DPP instructed Mr Kishore to go along with his statement when testifying in court.

## The applicable legal principles

11     There was no dispute between the prosecution and the defence as to the applicable broad legal principles. Accordingly I proceeded on the basis that, in criminal as in civil proceedings, the court has an inherent jurisdiction or power to recuse or disqualify DPPs or defence counsel from acting in a case before it if it would be in the interests of justice to do so. The test for the exercise of that inherent jurisdiction or power is, in the words of Quentin Loh J (as he then was) in _Then Khek Khoon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 451</span> (“_Then Khek Khoon_”) at \[22\], whether “on an objective view, a reasonable, fair minded observer would think that a fair trial would not be possible without the court’s intervention and restraint of the advocate or solicitor \[or DPP\] from continuing to act”.

12     To recapitulate, the defence’s application was premised on the possibility that the DPPs having conduct of the trial might be called as witnesses of fact regarding the veracity of the Allegation. In this there was some similarity with _Then Khek Khoon_, in that in _Then Khek Khoon_ one of the grounds on which the applicant sought to restrain a law firm from acting was that one or more members of that law firm might become witnesses on a material question of fact in the proceedings, which might contravene r 64 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed) then in force. I have since realised that the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015), which is the version now in force, does not appear to contain an equivalent rule. Nonetheless, at the time I heard and decided this application, I assumed in the absence of objection from the prosecution that as a matter of professional conduct it would not be proper for a DPP to continue acting in a trial should it be a real possibility that the DPP might be called as a witness of fact in that trial.

13     Ordinarily, where there is no issue of protection of confidential information or breach of legal professional privilege such as would engage the wider public interest, an allegation that a DPP or advocate and solicitor has engaged in improper professional conduct would be a matter for separate disciplinary proceedings: _Then Khek Khoon_ at \[17\]–\[21\]. But in “special or exceptional circumstances”, as Loh J put it at \[22\], where that alleged conduct would affect the fairness of the ongoing trial, it may furnish a basis for the court to restrain the DPP or advocate and solicitor from continuing to act in the trial. The test or touchstone, to reiterate, is whether the fairness of the trial would be affected in the eyes of a reasonable, fair-minded observer.

## Whether the fairness of this trial would be affected

14     Given this focus on the fairness of the trial, I had to consider how material the Allegation was in the overall context of the entire trial. I started by looking at how material it was in the context of Mr Kishore’s evidence. To reiterate, the Allegation, at the very most, was that some form of pressure was applied on him by a DPP to go along with his statement of 12 September 2017 when testifying in court.

15     But the crucial fact was that in his evidence in court Mr Kishore patently did not go along with the statement. Whereas in the statement he had identified Mr Suresh as the individual who instructed him to deliver, and collect, documents and other items to, and from, Alfie, in court he testified that it was in fact Mr Pirabu who had so instructed him. He not only maintained this position under repeated hostile examination by the prosecution, but also provided on multiple occasions a thorough explanation as to why his statement had referred to Mr Suresh. This explanation was that he had initially identified Mr Pirabu, but the recording officer asked “Pirabu or Steven”, and when he persisted with Mr Pirabu she asked “are you sure”, and by reason of this exchange he was under the impression that the recording officer wanted him to identify Mr Suresh instead, and being under stress and pressure he went along with that.

16     The fact that Mr Kishore disavowed his statement of 12 September 2017 during his testimony in court meant that, even if there had been some instruction given by a DPP to Mr Kishore during an interview to go along with that statement, there could be no doubt that Mr Kishore’s evidence in court was not influenced by that instruction. That is, I had no doubt that the evidence he gave in court was his own and had not been supplanted or supplemented by any instruction or pressure from any DPP, assuming there had been any. Hence I did not see arising in this case the dangers articulated by the Court of Appeal in respect of witness preparation in _Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 894</span> (“_De La Sala_”) at \[136\]–\[142\]. Of course this in no way amounts to a finding that Mr Kishore’s evidence in court was completely independent and thus reliable – all I mean is that there could be no doubt that in giving his evidence in court he said what he genuinely and sincerely wanted to say and was not complying with any direction or suggestion from any DPP.

17     Leaving aside this issue of whether Mr Kishore’s evidence in court was his own, the defence argued, as I understood it, that this question of whether Mr Kishore was given an instruction to go along with his statement might be relevant to my assessment of his credibility, and so be relevant to whether I believe or disbelieve his evidence, which is a determination I will have to make eventually in deciding whether Mr Suresh and Mr Pirabu are guilty of the charges against them. But I had difficulty seeing how that was so. It is true that, at a high level of generality, I will have to consider the totality of the evidence and the circumstances in deciding whether and to what extent Mr Kishore’s evidence is reliable. But I was not able to see a clear line of reasoning that would lead from the events of the relevant interview to an increased or decreased likelihood that any part of Mr Kishore’s evidence is true.

18     Taking a step back, I thought it could not be disputed that Mr Kishore’s evidence will be challenging to evaluate when the time comes to do so. After all, both the prosecution and the defence applied to impeach his credit using previous inconsistent statements, which amounted effectively to a common position that Mr Kishore’s testimony in court cannot be believed in its entirety. On the issue of the identity of the individual who instructed him concerning Alfie, Mr Kishore took no fewer than three conflicting positions, one in his police statements given on 7 September 2017, another in his statement of 12 September 2017, and yet another in his testimony in court. Thus, in Mr Kishore’s case, it is far from a binary question of whether I do or do not believe him, or whether he is or is not reliable as a witness. It is instead a question of which, if any, of the versions he has advanced I should believe.

19     When I evaluate the reliability of Mr Kishore’s police statements, it is completely irrelevant what might have happened at an interview with DPPs that would have taken place years after. When I assess the reliability of his testimony in court, as I explained earlier, I am satisfied that, even if there was any instruction given or pressure applied by a DPP at an interview, that instruction or pressure did not affect in any way Mr Kishore’s testimony in court, and so Mr Kishore’s allegation as to such instruction or pressure – that is, the Allegation – is not at all a factor I would take into account in my assessment. Given these considerations, it seemed to me that the question of the veracity of the Allegation would not assist me in any way to accept or reject any of the competing accounts Mr Kishore has given. Therefore, from an objective point of view, I thought that the Allegation was ultimately irrelevant and immaterial to the trial and the matter of Mr Suresh’s and Mr Pirabu’s guilt or innocence that is the true focus of the trial.

20     In evaluating Mr Kishore’s evidence, I will doubtless need to consider the explanations he has given for the inconsistencies between his police statements and his testimony in court, as well as his explanations for any internal inconsistencies within his testimony in court. I will also need to consider the evidence of other witnesses and the documentary evidence. In this regard I am cognisant of the fact that Mr Kishore’s evidence differs in various respects from that of Alfie and Mr Faizal bin Talib, the prosecution’s 25th witness.

21     What is important is that Mr Kishore has been given a fair opportunity to explain those inconsistencies and those differences, and I was amply satisfied from the way the examination proceeded before me that he has had every opportunity to do so. The Allegation, although made in response to the prosecution’s invitation to explain why his testimony in court differed from his statement of 12 September 2017, was in fact a _non sequitur_, in that, logically, being instructed to go along with the statement cannot explain why he did not eventually do so. Hence, even if there were to be no follow-up on the Allegation in Mr Kishore’s evidence after the resumption of his re-examination by the prosecution, I did not think that that would deprive Mr Kishore of any opportunity to explain the various inconsistencies in his evidence.

22     So far I have been considering the probative value of the Allegation to an evaluation of Mr Kishore’s evidence as a whole, and I have concluded that it is of negligible probative value. Taking another step back and looking at the context of the entire trial, its probative value diminishes still further. Mr Kishore is but one of many witnesses in this trial, and there is a substantial amount of documentary evidence in these proceedings. In determining whether Mr Suresh and Mr Pirabu are guilty of the charges against them, I will need to have regard to all that material, and so Mr Kishore’s evidence will ultimately form but one part of my overall assessment of the evidence. With that in mind, I did not think that any reasonable and fair-minded observer adopting an objective view would think that a fair trial would not be possible just because Mr Kishore alleged that he was given an instruction to go along with his statement.

23     To address directly the defence’s premise that the DPPs handling the trial might be called as witnesses of fact, for the reasons given above, I thought that the Allegation was of such negligible probative value that I could opine definitively at that juncture that, on the basis of what I knew at that point, I would reject any application to compel the DPPs to give evidence, the reason being that such an application would be frivolous and vexatious. This meant that I could safely say at that juncture that there was no realistic prospect of the DPPs being called to give evidence in this trial.

24     Hence, even though I was willing to accept that it might be appropriate to order the recusal or disqualification of a DPP if there was a reasonable possibility of the DPP becoming a witness on a material question of fact in the trial – because that would cause a reasonable and fair-minded observer to believe that the DPP might compromise on their duty to the court where it conflicts with their personal interests such that the fairness of the trial might be affected – the lack of any such reasonable possibility in this case meant that there was no basis to order the recusal or disqualification of the DPPs involved. To put matters in the language used by Loh J in _Then Khek Khoon_ at \[47\], in the absence of a realistic prospect of the DPPs being called as witnesses, I could not see any danger of “subconscious shaping of the evidence” by any of the DPPs to “suit \[their\] interest as against that of … the duty to the court”. I may be permitted to say that as at the time of writing the manner of carriage of the prosecution so far by all the DPPs involved has struck me as fair, even-handed, dispassionate and courteous throughout.

25     I concluded that the fairness of this trial would not be affected in the slightest if the DPPs who had hitherto had conduct of it were to continue handling the matter. This sufficed for me to dismiss the defence’s application and direct that the trial continue with the re-examination of Mr Kishore by those DPPs. I duly did so.

26     I did in closing express some scepticism as to the correctness of the prosecution’s argument that, if I had found the Allegation to be material enough to warrant further exploration at trial, it would suffice to have the investigation officer take the stand to give evidence of what transpired at the relevant interview. It seemed to me that it would be an unjustified constraint on the defence if they were not able to call as witnesses other individuals who might have been present at the interview just because it would affect the ability of those other individuals to continue with the case. I thought that the starting point must be that each party has the right to call any witness whose evidence might be relevant and material to the case, including the DPPs in question. But in any event this concern did not arise because I found that the Allegation was objectively not material to the trial.

## Litigation privilege

27     Having dismissed the defence’s application I ventured some remarks on the issue of litigation privilege because that issue seemed to me possibly pertinent to the future conduct of the trial. Following the High Court’s decision in _Public Prosecutor v Soh Chee Wen and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1435</span> (“_Soh Chee Wen_”), the starting position is that oral communications between DPPs and witnesses “made at a time when there was a reasonable prospect of litigation”, and “for the dominant purpose of litigation”, are protected by litigation privilege: at \[14\]–\[15\]. It was evident that any interviews between the DPPs and Mr Kishore leading up to Mr Kishore’s appearance as a witness in court in this trial would have been conducted at a time when there was at least a reasonable prospect of litigation, and it seemed to me natural and appropriate to assume that those interviews would have been conducted for the dominant purpose of the litigation in this trial. It followed that the starting point was that the oral communications that took place between Mr Kishore and the DPPs at those interviews are protected by litigation privilege and lines of examination on the contents of those communications should not be allowed.

28     The next question was whether any exception to privilege applied. One such exception is where there is “sufficient reason to think that the witness’s testimony is tainted by _misconduct_ or _abuse of process_, such as witness tampering or coaching”: _Soh Chee Wen_ at \[19\] (emphasis in original). It seemed to me that this reference to “witness tampering or coaching” was meant to encompass the sorts of concerns highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _De La Sala_ at \[136\]–\[142\], which might be distilled to the concern (at \[137\]) that witness preparation cannot compromise “the fundamental principle that the witness’s evidence must be his own independent testimony”. In this case, as I have endeavoured to explain above, given that Mr Kishore had evidently not complied with any instruction he might have been given or yielded to any pressure that might have been applied at the relevant interview, in spite of the Allegation it was clear that his testimony in court was not tainted by any witness tampering or coaching. That exception therefore did not apply in this case.

29     What this meant in my view was that I ought in this trial not to permit any further inquiry into what transpired at any interviews that the DPPs had with Mr Kishore. That is why I declined at the start of the hearing in the morning of 26 August 2022 to invite Mr Kishore to clarify the Allegation. It seemed to me that doing so could undermine litigation privilege.

30     Having said that, I recognised that another exception to litigation privilege is waiver, which would include implied waiver: _Soh Chee Wen_ at \[17\]. The prosecution was understandably keen to establish that no DPP ever gave Mr Kishore any instruction or put him under any pressure. Although I did not regard the prosecution’s offer in the morning of 26 August 2022 to put the relevant investigation officer on the stand to address the Allegation as a waiver of privilege because it was not sufficiently unequivocal, I opined that it was entirely the prosecution’s prerogative to waive privilege by re-examining Mr Kishore further on this point when he took the witness stand once more.

31     I informed the parties of my view that any evidence as to what transpired at interviews between the DPPs and witnesses in this trial prior to the appearance of those witnesses in court should be off limits by reason of litigation privilege, unless the prosecution waives the privilege or there is some reason to think there is witness tampering in the sense that the testimony of the witness in court might not be their own and might have been supplanted or supplemented by the DPPs. I indicated that I would accordingly close off any line of questioning relating to what transpired at such interviews, subject to any exception to privilege that might be applicable, and that this applied as much to future witnesses as it did to Mr Kishore.

32     I would like to record my appreciation to the prosecution and defence for their invaluable assistance in this application at such short notice.
