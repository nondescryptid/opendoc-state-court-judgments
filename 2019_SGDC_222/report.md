Sale of Goods – section 13 Sale of Goods Act – description of goods – section 14 Sale of Goods Act – satisfactory quality of goods – section 12B of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act

30 October 2019

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Background

1       The Defendant (“D”) is a company in the business of the sale of used vehicles. The Plaintiff (“P”) bought a used BMW 6 Series 640i Coupe (“the car”) from D on 12 March 2018 for the sum of S$127,000.

2       In this suit, P is claiming the sum of $8,386.00 in respect of the replacement of the alleged defective parts of the car and the sum of $1429.00 in respect of repair works with respect to the car that were undertaken at P’s own expense. The claim for these sums is on the basis that D has breached the condition of sale implied by operation of sections 14(2), 14(2A) and 14(2B) of the Sale of Goods Act (“SOGA”) in that the car was not of satisfactory quality. P also alleged that the car was not in roadworthy condition to be driven safely on the roads and was unfit for the purpose for which it was purchased. In addition, it is also P’s case that there was a breach of the implied condition that the car would correspond to its description and by virtue of that, P alleges that D has breached section 13(1) SOGA.

3       Additionally, P is also seeking to rescind the sale and purchase contract pursuant to section 12B of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (“CPFTA”).

4       P’s claim is based on the following alleged defects of the car:

> (a)     That the car had worn out rear brakes which could only last 180km and are in need of repairs;

> (b)     That the car came with failure of the front left headlights;

> (c)     That there was leakage of oil from the engine gaskets;

> (d)     That there was leakage of oil from the time belt; and

> (e)     That the remote control key was faulty.

5       The relevant chronology of events is as follows:

>   
| 

12 March 2018

 | 

P viewed and test-drove the car. After that, P purchased the car from D.

 |
| 

15 March 2018

 | 

The car was delivered to P. P raised the issue regarding the sunroof. D’s mechanic rectified the sunroof issue. P said he had indicated to D’s Roy Sng the issue with regard to the front left headlights at the time of delivery of the car. However, D disputes this fact.

 |
| 

17 March 2018

 | 

P signed the Vehicle Assessment Form and Hire Purchase Financing Form. It is not disputed that P wanted to indicate on the Vehicle Assessment Form the issue with regard to the front left headlights. The Performance Motors Limited Key Data Printout (“PMKD Printout”) on the car was generated on this date. It is to be noted however that the maker of this PMKD Report has not been called to give evidence on this Report.

 |
| 

19 March 2018

 | 

P drove the car to ICAR Motorwerkz Pte Ltd and he informed them that the left headlight was not working. Representative at ICAR Motorwerkz recommended that the headlamp be changed. As it was late in the day, P was told to bring the car down again the next day.

 |
| 

20 March 2018

 | 

P brought the car to ICAR Motorwerkz again. P was present at ICAR Motorwerkz while the car was being repaired. After the repairs to the left headlight, P tested the headlight and drove off.

 |
| 

23 March 2018

 | 

P contacted Justin Junwei Charles of ICAR Motorwerkz to say that he wanted to change or improve the car’s brake pads, as they were too soft. Eventually, the car’s brake pads were replaced on this day.

 |
| 

26 March 2018

 | 

Pursuant to P’s further complaints about the left headlight, Justin Junwei Charles of ICAR Motorwerkz went to P’s place of residence to pick up the car to drive the car back to ICAR Motorwerkz’ workshop for testing. The operation of the headlights was tested for about 10 times. As the headlights were found to be working, the car was driven back to P’s place of residence and returned to P on the same day.

 |
| 

(a few days later)

 | 

P called ICAR Motorwerkz and complained that the left headlight was not working. However, there was no further follow-up on this.

 |
| 

9 April 2018

 | 

P sent the car to Performance Motors Limited for another assessment. Another Performance Motors Limited Key Data Printout (“PMKD Printout”) was generated the next day.

 |

  
  

Subsequent to 9 April 2018, P had allegedly sent the car for further “repairs” a few more times. P is relying on his repair job requests with dates ranging from 13 April 2018 to 13 November 2018 and the Performance Motors Limited Key Data Printout (“PMKD Printout”) generated on the following dates – 16 April 2018, 21 May 2018, 19 June 2018, 28 August 2018 and 13 November 2018 to establish his case. While copies of these PMKD Printouts were adduced through P’s affidavit of evidence in chief, there was no explanation as to the contents of these PMKD Printouts in his affidavit, nor was the maker of these documents or any expert witness called to render evidence on the contents of these documents.

## Relevant Issues In This Case

6       P’s claim is brought on the basis of breach of the implied terms that the car will correspond with its description as required under section 13 of SOGA, that the car is of satisfactory quality and fitness of purpose as imposed under section 14 of the SOGA; and on the basis that the car did not conform to the contract for sale at the time of delivery under section 12B CPFTA. Accordingly, the issues are:

> (i)     Whether the car corresponds with the description at the time of sale

> (ii)     Whether D has breached the implied term that the car was of satisfactory quality and fitness of purpose at the time of delivery for the purposes of section 14 of the SOGA

> (iii)     Whether the car conforms to the contract for sale at the time of delivery.

## My Decision

#### Whether the car corresponds with the description at the time of sale

7       Section 13(1) of the SOGA provides, “(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods will correspond with the description.”

8       The evidence shows that P came to know of the sale of the car through an online advertisement at the website www.sgcarmart.com on or around 12 March 2018. In that advertisement, the car was described as “_perfect condition_”; “_well maintained by previous owner with all wear and tear done up_” and “_low mileage_”[^1]. P also says that he recalls that at the time of the advertisement, the mileage was stated as 42,000km. P says he relied on these descriptions including the description of “low mileage” and was induced thereby into buying the car. Subsequently, through the PMKD Printout dated 17 March 2018[^2], he discovered that the mileage shows “48,127 kilometres”. P also alluded to the fact that the STA Inspection Pte Ltd Report dated 24 November 2017 (this date was before P purchased the car) states the mileage as follows - “Mileage (Before Evaluation): 44844 KM”.[^3]

9       Though P said he recalls the mileage was stated as 42,000km, he has tendered no evidence to show that the mileage of the car was stated by D to be 42,000km. A copy of the online advertisement as extracted on 31 March 2018 (about two weeks after P took delivery of the car) shows that the car was described as, “_perfect condition_”; “_well maintained by previous owner with all wear and tear done up_” and “_low mileage_”[^4]. There was no specific statement about the mileage of the car. Thus, regarding the description that the mileage of the car was 42,000kim, other than P’s mere allegation, there is nothing in support of P’s allegation that the car’s mileage was stated to be 42,000km.

10     P does not dispute that he had inspected the car at D’s showroom on 12 March 2018 and had also test-driven the Car[^5]. Thus, P had purchased the car after a physical inspection of the car and a test drive of the car. During the physical inspection, P would have seen the mileage of the car from the car’s mileage odometer. If indeed, there was a statement about the car being of 42,000km mileage when the mileage in the car mileage odometer shows a higher mileage, it would be logical for P to have raised this issue before the purchase. However, there is no such evidence or any evidence to show that the actual mileage shown in the car mileage odometer was different from the stated mileage.

11     As the overall burden of proof falls on P to prove his case on a balance of probabilities, on this description of the car having only a 42,000km mileage, I find that P has failed to show that the car was sold to him with that description. Therefore, P has failed to prove that the car did not correspond with the alleged description of 42,000 mileage, as there is no evidence that there was such a description.

12     In addition to the general descriptions - “_perfect condition_”; “_well maintained by previous owner with all wear and tear done up_” and “_low mileage_”, I note that based on the online advertisement of the car (as extracted on 31 March 2018), at the top right hand corner, there was a section titled, “STA Evaluation” and it was stated there that - “_This vehicle has undergone a 120-point check by STA, and has received a Grade B for its overall condition_.” This description conforms to the STA Evaluation Report (dated 24 November 2017) on the car[^6]. The general descriptions - “_perfect condition_”; “_well maintained by previous owner with all wear and tear done up_” and “_low mileage_” in the online advertisement are to be read and understood in that context, that is, the vehicle has received a STA Grade B for its overall condition.

13     As for the general descriptions - “_perfect condition_”; “_well maintained by previous owner with all wear and tear done up_” and “_low mileage_”, I take guidance from what Chan Seng Onn J has said in the High Court case of **_Chan Chee Kien v Performance Motors Ltd_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 54</span>. That High Court case also involves the sale of a BMW car. In that case, Chan Seng Onn J held that there is no breach of section 13 of the SOGA just because the car that did not correspond to “general advertising puffs” in the defendant’s catalogue as he does not think that “such advertising puffs are meant to be construed as a “description” of the car for the purpose of section 13(1) of the SOGA”[^7].

14     Chan Seng Onn J also pointed out that, to invoke section 13 of the SOGA, it is important for the plaintiff to clearly identify any specific description (not mere general advertising puffs) that he takes issue with (such as any specific technical feature, accessory or component, technical specification that is not complied with)[^8].

15     In the instant case, P has raised only general descriptions - _perfect condition_”; “_well maintained by previous owner with all wear and tear done up_” and “_low mileage_”. In light of what Chan Seng Onn J has said, these are clearly general advertising puffs. P has not identified any specific description that he says the car does not correspond with.

16     Therefore, as P has not shown there was a description that the car was of 42,000km mileage and as P has not identified any other specific description that he takes issue with, P has not shown that the car does not conform to its description. Accordingly, I find that there is no breach of section 13 of the SOGA.

#### Whether D has breached the implied term that the car was of satisfactory quality and fitness of purpose at the time of delivery for the purposes of section 14 of the SOGA

17     Section 14 of the SOGA provides,

> “(2)  Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of satisfactory quality.

> (2A)  For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.

> (2B)  For the purposes of the Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of the goods:

>> (a)    fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied….”

18     In support of his claim that the car is not of “satisfactory quality” and is in breach of section 14(2) of the SOGA, P places his reliance on the Performance Motors Ltd Key Data Printouts (“PMKD Printouts”) dated 16 March 2018[^9], and dated 9 April 2018[^10]. A closer examination of the first PMKD Printout dated 16 March 2018 shows, inter alia, “rear brake – due – remaining distance: 180 kilometres”[^11]. Other than this, there is no other information that shows that the car is of “unsatisfactory quality” on the face of the printout. Regarding the indication on the PMKD Printout dated 16 March 2018 - “rear brake – due – remaining distance: 180 kilometres”, it is unclear how this shows that the car is of “unsatisfactory quality”. P has adduced no evidence whatsoever to substantiate his allegation that this printout shows that the car is of unsatisfactory quality.

19     More importantly, as the maker of PMKD Printouts dated 16 March 2018 and 9 April 2018 has not been called to give evidence on or to explain the contents thereof and as P has not called any expert witness to testify as to the contents of these printouts, the contents of these printouts is hearsay and inadmissible as evidence. These documents therefore do not assist the court in understanding how or in what way their contents show that the car was not of “satisfactory quality”.

20     Other than the PMKD Printouts, P also relies on various job requests for repairs to the car and the repair orders and service tax invoices with dates ranging from 13 April 2018 to 13 November 2018[^12]. An examination of these documents show that they appear to pertain to regular servicing of the car and there is nothing in them to show that the car was of “unsatisfactory quality” at face value. Again, as the makers of these documents have not been called, the contents therein are hearsay and are inadmissible evidence per se. In any event, I will put little or no weight on these documents as the contents therein have not been explained and no affidavit evidence of the implications of the contents has been given.

21     In any event, the standard for “satisfactory quality” is not the subjective standard from P’s perspective but is “the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all other relevant circumstances”[^13].

22     An examination of the relevant circumstances of the case shows the following:

> (i)     P had himself inspected and test-drove the car before the purchase. A reasonable person in his shoes would have satisfied himself that the car was of satisfactory quality before he purchased it.

> (ii)     On 15 March 2018, upon taking delivery of the car, P had signed on the official receipt which contains the statement, “I/WE HAVE INSPECTED AND TESTED THE SAID VEHICLE AS WELL AS THE METERS AND ACCEPT THE SAME KNOWING THAT THE VEHICLE IS SOLD WITHOUT WARRANTY FROM THE SELLER AND I/WE RELY WHOLLY ON OUR JUDGMENT AND INSPECTION.” By virtue of the acceptance of this term, P has acknowledged that he has inspected and tested the car and that he confirms that the car is of satisfactory quality.

> (iii)     The STA Evaluation Report of 24 November 2017[^14] (the evaluation was done soon after D purchased the car for the purpose of second-hand sale of the car) shows the car has passed checks and evaluation and is “in normal condition”. As it had been given an overall grading of “B” which is acceptable for a second-hand vehicle and generally, the highest grade awarded to a second-hand vehicle[^15], the objective evidence shows that the car was of satisfactory quality at the time of its evaluation, i.e, as at 24 November 2017.

> (iv)     P has also signed the Standard Vehicle Assessment Report on 17 March 2018 in which he acknowledged that, “the Buyer has found the vehicle to be satisfactory and of a reasonable quality, in good road-worthy condition and fit for its purpose as a motor vehicle”[^16]. Other than circling the item, “headlights”, P did not indicate any other issue he had with the car when he signed the said Report on 17 March 2018.

> (v)     The evidence shows that when P returned to D’s premises to take delivery of the car on 15 March 2018, he had inspected the car, tested the engine, and switched on the headlights and that he did not raise any complaints about the car other than the sun roof the car[^17]. As for P’s complaint with regard to the sunroof of the car, P raised the complaint just after he had picked up the car to drive off with the car. D’s mechanic immediately on the spot rectified this complaint. It was explained to P that the button for the sunroof failed to work because the controls had not been used for a long time. According to D’s witness, Roy Sng, the sales executive who sold the car to P, after the alignment of the sun blinds was fine-tuned, the sun blinds were tested and they opened and closed without any issues[^18].

> (vi)     As for the issue relating to “headlights” which P had circled on the Standard Vehicle Assessment Report, D’s evidence is that based on the computer diagnostic scan and the assessment of the operations manager of ICAR MOTORWERKZ, a car workshop company specializing in the repairs of BMW among other cars, the issue with the headlight could easily be fixed by changing the headlamp and this was done on 20 March 2018 in the presence of P[^19]. Thereafter, D as well as P tested the left headlight. After testing, P drove off with the car with no further complaint. Therefore, on the facts, the issue with regard to the left headlights has already been rectified. That said, between P’s version that the headlights issue existed at the time of the delivery of the car[^20] and D’s version that P only surfaced the headlights issue a few days later[^21], I find D’s version more credible. If the headlights issue had existed as at the time of the delivery, it is strange that P chose to take delivery and drive off with the car. In any event, regardless of when the headlights issue surfaced, the fact of the matter is that the headlights issue has already been resolved.

23     As for the issue with regard to the brake pads being too “soft”, P has not shown any evidence as regards thereto in support of P’s allegation that this makes the car to be of unsatisfactory quality or to be “un-roadworthy”. On the other hand, D’s unchallenged evidence from a car repair company shows that the brake pads were tested to be fairly “thick” and not in need of replacement[^22].

24     As for P’s other complaints - that there was leakage of oil from the engine gaskets; that there was leakage of oil from the time belt; and that the remote control key was faulty – for all of these complaints, P has not adduced any evidence to substantiate these. P’s allegation that the car was not of satisfactory quality because of these issues is therefore wholly unsubstantiated and unsupported by evidence.

25     In **_Speedo Motoring Pte Ltd v Ong Gek Sing_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1398</span>, George Wei JC noted that a certain degree of wear and tear would be acceptable to a reasonable purchaser of a second-hand motor car and a seller is not to be held responsible on that basis alone. The High Court further noted that whether or not a vehicle was of “satisfactory quality” was affected by whether “the defective part in question was an integral part of the vehicle” and that “it would not be easy for the court to find that the vehicle was not of satisfactory quality if the defect lies in minor components that are relatively easy to replace; such as the windshield wipers or the cabin light”[^23].

26     P has not adduced any evidence whatsoever to show that these defects complained of (i.e., that there was leakage of oil from the engine gaskets; that there was leakage of oil from the time belt; and that the remote control key was faulty) are integral parts of the car or that the defects are not in minor components that are relatively easy to replace.

27     As for the alleged defect concerning the headlight, as noted by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in **_Koh Wee Meng v Trans Eurokars Pte Ltd_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 663</span>[^24], “_a_ defect that can be remedied so as to put a vehicle back into an as-new position cannot render that vehicle of unsatisfactory quality unless there are exceptional circumstances”. On the facts of this case, there is no evidence to show this defect is one that cannot be remedied so as to put a vehicle back into an as-new position. In the circumstances, as the headlight issue has already been rectified and as it has not been shown that this defect cannot be remedied so as to put the car back into an as-new position, I find that P’s case concerning the headlight is not made out at all.

#### Whether the car conforms to the contract for sale at the time of delivery

28     As for this last issue, based on my findings above, I conclude that P has failed to show that the car does not conform to the contract for sale at the time of delivery. In addition, by signing the Vehicle Standard Assessment Form, P has also acknowledged that the car conforms to the contract of sale at the time of delivery. Accordingly, P’s claim based on his right to rescind the contract on the basis that the car did not conform to the applicable contract at the time of delivery pursuant to section 12B CPFTA, also fails. Section 12B CPFTA therefore does not apply and P is not entitled to rescind the contract.

## Conclusion

29     In conclusion, the Plaintiff has failed to establish his claim under section 13, 14 of the SOGA. The Plaintiff’s claim therefore fails completely and is dismissed with costs to the Defendant. Further, the Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to Section 12B CPFTA also fails and the Plaintiff has no right to rescind the contract. As for costs to the Defendant, after hearing both parties on the issue of costs, I have fixed costs at $10,000 plus reasonable disbursements plus GST. The Plaintiff shall therefore pay costs fixed at $10,000 plus reasonable disbursements plus GST to the Defendant.
