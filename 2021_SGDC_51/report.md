15 March 2021

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       Mdm Sandy Chua Ya Zi (“the Accused”), a 47-year old female Singaporean, had pleaded guilty to 1 charge under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed):

DAC 909784-2020

> You … are charged that you, between 1 September 2019 and 9 October 2019, at Universal Dining Singapore Tanglin Food Court located at 163 Tanglin Road #B1-17, Tanglin Mall, Singapore 247933, being employed by Select Group Pte Ltd (“the Company”), _to wit_, in the capacity of an Outlet Manager, and being entrusted in such capacity with property, _to wit_, cash amounting to S$41,319.90/- belonging to the Company, did dishonestly misappropriate the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       I took the Accused’s plea on 22 January 2021 and adjourned the matter for mitigation and sentencing on 1 February 2021.

3       On 1 February 2021, after hearing the Prosecution’s sentencing position and the Accused’s mitigation and sentencing position, I imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment on the Accused. The Accused had applied for deferment of sentence and I had granted the deferment of sentence to 16 February 2021.

4       The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed her Notice of Appeal against my sentence on 15 February 2021. I hereby set out my reasons for my sentence.

## Statement of Facts

5       The Accused had admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

### Introduction

6       At the material time of the incident, the Accused was employed by the Company as an Outlet Manager since 10 April 2018. On 1 April 2019, the Accused was deployed as an Outlet Manager at the Universal Dining (Singapore) Tanglin Food Court located at 163 Tanglin Road #B1-17, Tanglin Mall, Singapore 247933 (“the Location”).

7       The Company was in the business of running themed food courts in Singapore, such as that at the Location.

### First Information Report

8       On 11 October 2019, at about 4.41pm, an individual named “Tami” called the police to inform that “MY EMPLOYEE STOLE MORE THAN 20K, CAN SENT POLICE DOWN NOW? CALL ME WHEN THE POLICE IS HERE. THE EMPLOYEE IS COMING HERE AT 5PM”. The caller supplied the location as “APT BLK 24A SENOKO STH RD SELECT GROUP BUILDING SINGAPORE 758099”.

### Facts

9       The job scope of the Accused as an Outlet Manager at the Location was to ensure smooth operations of the ten food stalls and one drink stall at the Location.

10     Further, as an Outlet Manager, the Accused was entrusted with the daily cash proceeds from the stalls of the Location, which she counted and collected. The proceeds were safe-kept in a safe box (“the Sales Safe”), until they were handed over to TransNational Security, an agency engaged by the Company to assist in the transfer of money to the Company.

11     The Accused, as an Outlet Manager, was also entrusted with a cash float of $20,000, which was used for changing coins and notes, as well as for petty cash claims for the Location. The cash float was kept in a safe box (“the Float Safe”).

12     Only the Accused had the key to access to the Float Safe. The Accused and one other individual, the Assistant Manager of the Location, had keys to access the Sales Safe.

13     Sometime during October 2019, Lim Siew Ling @ Shelyn (“the Complainant”), who was employed by the Company as a Credit Control Manager, noticed that there were several discrepancies in the daily sales report of the Location. In particular, the Complainant found that the collection of daily sales proceeds was delayed by the Complainant on numerous occasions, including 26 September 2019, and that the sales proceeds for 28 September and 29 September 2019 were missing.

14     On 10 October 2019, the Complainant sent for her finance staff to make a check at the Location. They subsequently discovered that the Sales Safe did not contain any daily sales proceeds from 7 to 9 October 2019, and that the Float Safe was empty. Upon being questioned by the finance staff, the Accused confessed that she had taken funds from the Float Safe and Sales Safe since September 2019.

15     In total, the Accused had dishonestly misappropriated a total of $41,319.90 belonging to the Company, with which she had been entrusted in her capacity as an Outlet Manager at the Location. The Accused had spent all the money on gambling at the casino in Resorts World Sentosa.

16     No restitution had been made to date by the Accused.

### Offence Disclosed

17     By dishonestly misappropriating $41,319.90 belonging to the Company, which had been entrusted to her in her capacity as an Outlet Manager at the Location employed by the Company, the Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Sentencing

### Punishment prescribed by law

18     The punishment prescribed under section 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was imprisonment for a term, which would extend to 15 years, and also be liable to a fine.

### Antecedents

19     The Accused was untraced with any criminal antecedents.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence[^1]

20     The Prosecution had submitted for an imprisonment term of at least 11 months. As for compensation, the Prosecution noted that although section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code required the court before which a person was convicted of any offence to consider whether or not to make an order for the payment of compensation, the Prosecution was not submitting for any compensation order to be made against the Accused because the Accused was unable to pay any compensation.

21     The Prosecution submitted that her culpability was high as she had misappropriated the money to feed her gambling habit.

22     The Prosecution had also submitted the following sentencing precedents for my consideration:

### Mitigation and Defence’s submission on sentence[^2]

#### Mitigating factors

23     The Defence had urged me to consider the following mitigating factors:

> (a)     Genuine Remorse;

> (b)     Medical Condition;

> (c)     Family Circumstances;

> (d)     Personal Circumstances;

> (e)     Loss of Employment;

> (f)     Good Character; and

> (g)     No antecedents.

##### A. Genuine Remorse

24     The Defence submitted that the Accused was deeply and genuinely remorseful for the consequences of her actions and she felt extremely guilty. The Accused had accepted responsibility for her actions and demonstrated her deep contrition by entering an early plea of guilt, thus saving valuable time and state resources. The Defence highlighted that the Accused had admitted the offence when questioned by the company from which she had misappropriated the sums.

25     The Defence also submitted that it had been categorically established in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span>, inter _alia_, that genuine remorse and contrition was a valid mitigating factor.

##### B. Medical Condition

26     The Accused had suffered a heart attack on 25 October 2017and she was immediately brought to National University Hospital (“NUH”) in for emergency heart surgery. Her medical report had stated that she was “_diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarct and brought for emergency coronary angiography, which found an occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery.”_

27     The Accused was admitted for post procedure observation and was found to have “_preserved ejection fraction of 55% with regional wall motion abnormalities and a dilated ascending aorta_.”

28     On 10 July 2019, the Accused was again admitted for intermittent left sided chest pain and her scan showed that there were “_large sized moderate and severe intensity reversible perfusion defects consistent with abnormal coronary flow reserves_” indicating that blood was flowing into her heart more slowly due to narrowed or blocked arteries.

29     The Accused underwent surgery again on 30 December 2019. The doctor found that there were large obstructions, with one artery being 50% blocked and another artery 75% blocked.

30     The Accused was currently still on follow up with the Cardiology specialist outpatient clinic.

31     The Defence also submitted that in the case of _Chew Soo Chun v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> (“_Chew Soo Chun_”), the court had stated that ill-health could exist as a mitigating factor. The Accused had already suffered from a heart attack. In addition, she had suffered from several spinal issues which had caused severe pain in her back and numbness in her legs. The Defence was of the view that stresses of imprisonment could result in a disproportionate impact on the Accused given her numerous health issues.

32     In addition, the Accused was also suffering from high blood pressure, which caused her nose to bleed frequently. The Accused also had thyroid, high cholesterol (which required injections every 6 month) and spinal issues. As such, the Accused had been seeing numerous doctors for treatment.

33     The Defence had urged me to consider the Accused’s medical condition and impose a lighter sentence.

##### C. Family Circumstances

34     The Accused was the sole breadwinner in her family owing to her husband’s ill health. The Accused’s husband was a diabetic and his eyesight had been affected by his diabetic condition. The Accused’s husband also required surgery in both eyes. Unfortunately, his employment had been terminated as he had to take many days off due to his ill health. The Accused’s husband also relied on the Accused for his daily activities and he was unable to leave the house without a carer

35     Recently, the Accused’s father, who was diagnosed with colon cancer in the advanced stage, had suffered a relapse. The Accused was told to be mentally prepared for his imminent demise if chemotherapy was not suitable for him. Apart from the emotional turmoil, that situation had also contributed to her financial strain.

##### D. Personal Circumstances

36     Whilst working at Tanglin Mall in 2019, the Accused became increasingly stressed from the work environment. This was when her nose started bleeding frequently as her blood pressure rose. She was advised by her doctor to either change her job or to request for a transfer.

37     Unable to cope with the numerous stress factors, she began gambling at the casino leading to the commission of the offences. The Accused had since stopped gambling and she was extremely remorseful for her actions. The Accused recognized that gambling was an unhealthy means of coping with stress.

38     After the Accused’s employment was terminated following the incident, she was given a chance to run her friend’s food stall and she worked as hard as she could to slowly save up to make full restitution. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 period took a toll on the business, resulting in losses. The Accused had to struggle to pay the outstanding rent and to make ends meet. The Defence submitted that the Accused was not refusing to make restitution, but she was unable to do it due to her circumstances.

39     Due to her financial hardship, the Ministry of Social and Family Development Service Office in Woodlands had approved her application for financial assistance.

##### E. Loss of Employment

40     The Accused was offered a job recently. However, she had to give up the opportunity due to the imminent imprisonment term. The Defence submitted that it was trite law that loss of employment was a mitigating factor. In _Knight Glenn Jeyasignam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 523</span>, the court had emphasized that loss of employment and all financial benefits and a professional career were part of the circumstances that the court would consider in assessing sentence.

41     Furthermore, the Accused was the sole caregiver for her husband. If she had a job, she would be able to support her husband and pay for his eye surgery as well as her own father’s medical fees.

##### F. Good Character

42     The Accused had accepted the consequences of her offence. She had low proclivity to reoffend and had shown a desire to change for the better.

43     Prior to this incident, the Accused was untraced. She had always been a kind-hearted person. This could be seen from the testimonial of her former customer, who had highlighted that she always helped her customers, mainly those with physical defects and the elderly. The Accused had also demonstrated a high level of dedication, enthusiasm and honesty towards her food store business.

44     In addition, her ex-colleague, Mr Goh Chee Wah, who had known her for more than 20 years, had also given a testimonial that she was a “responsible, hardworking and caring colleague”. He had also emphasized the Accused’s strong value to the firm and that the Accused was a trustworthy person who could be entrusted with responsibilities. It was clear from his testimonial that the Accused had acted with integrity and honesty in the past.

45     The Defence had urged me to consider this a one-off incident and to consider the Accused’s good character in determining the appropriate sentence.

##### G. No antecedents

46     The Defence also highlighted that the Accused did not have any relevant antecedents with respect to the CBT Charge, and this was her first brush with the law. The Accused’s stressful financial situation at the material time of the offence, combined with the immense guilt she felt as a result of her offence, suggested that this should be taken as a situation caused by a lapse in judgement.

47     Considering the Accused’s medical conditions, unfortunate family and personal circumstances and loss of employment, the Defence urged me to consider imposing a lighter sentence.

#### Defence Submissions on Sentencing

48     The Defence submitted that a sentence of no more than 5 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the present case.

49     The Defence had also submitted the following sentencing precedents for my consideration:

50     In _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> (“_Lam Leng Hung_”), the court held that the starting consideration ought to be the value of the property misappropriated.

51     The Defence submitted that while the value of the property misappropriated ought to be the starting point when deciding the appropriate sentence, the High Court in _Lam Leng Hung_ had also emphasized that sentences for CBT offences do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the amounts involved. Aside from considering the value of the property in question, the appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived after having regard to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case.

52     The Defence also pointed out that the court in _Lam Leng Hung_ held that the following non-exhaustive factors were relevant to the offence of CBT: (a) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender; (b) the period over which the act was perpetrated; (c) the use to which the money or property that was dishonestly taken was put; (d) the effect on the victim; and the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence.

#### Application of the Law

53     The Defence submitted that while similar sums of money were involved, the facts in _Ang Siew Fah_ were more egregious that the present case:

> (a)     Firstly, the accused in _Ang Siew Fah_ did not seek to mitigate at all, whether by pleading guilty or by making restitution. In addition, he showed an utter lack of remorse or compunction for his actions. He did not plead guilty but chose to deny and claim trial to all the charges. There was thus no significant saving of time or resources.

> (b)     Secondly, the offences were premeditated and there was evidence that the offender forged documents in the course of committing the crime, which was undoubtedly an aggravating factor**.**

> (c)     Thirdly, the accused in _Ang Siew Fah_ had on two previous occasions committed theft under section 380 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to imprisonment on both occasions. The previous antecedents also involved dishonesty.

> (d)     Thus, the Court had imposed the sentence based on the aggravating factors and the absence of mitigating factors.

54     The Defence submitted that _Ang Siew Fah_ could be contrasted with the present case:

> (a)     Firstly, the Accused had entered an early plea of guilt, which showed her genuine remorse. The Accused had wanted to enter a guilty plea at the soonest possible opportunity, which is a manifestation of her very intense remorse and utter regret over the offence.

> (b)     Secondly, the Accused had worked as hard as she could but due to the COVID-19 situation and financial strain from paying for her husband’s and father’s medical bills, she was unable to make restitution to the victim.

> (c)     Thirdly, the Accused was a first-time offender with a clean record, as opposed to the previous similar antecedents of the accused _Ang Siew Fah_.

55     The Defence submitted that the clear implication was that the Accused was wracked by genuine remorse and there were no peculiar aggravating factors in the Accused’s case. As such, the Defence submitted that this court should impose a lighter sentence than the sentence imposed in _Ang Siew Fah_ to reflect the Accused’s guilt and remorse.

56     With regard to _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_, the Defence submitted the material facts in the present case were substantially similar, and even less egregious than in _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_:

> (a)     In _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_, the offender was also an employee who had misappropriated her company’s funds to pay for her personal bills. As noted above, the Accused had only done so due to the stress she was facing at the time, which led to her unfortunate urge to gamble to cope.

> (b)     The offender in _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_ had misappropriated $53,923.02. In contrast, the Accused had misappropriated a total of $41,319.90, about $10,000 less than the offender in _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_.

> (c)     In _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_, the offender had misappropriated for 4 years. In contrast, the Accused had misappropriated the money within a much shorter period of one month.

> (d)     The court in _Gopalakrishna Vinitha_ had highlighted that the accused had not sought to mitigate at all whether by pleading guilty or making restitution, when it upheld the imprisonment sentence of 18 months. In contrast, the Accused had pleaded guilty and was genuinely remorseful.

57     The Defence had urged me to follow the decision in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ for the following reasons:

> (a)     The offender in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ had misappropriated a sum of $67,679.05. In contrast, the Accused had misappropriated a total of $41,319.90, about $20,000 less than the offender in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_.

> (b)     The court in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ had also considered the offender’s status as a first-time offender and his advanced age as mitigating factors. In the present case, the Accused was also a first-time offender. Her medical conditions should also have mitigating value as well.

58     Given the above, the Defence submitted that the sentence to be imposed on the Accused should not be more than 5 months’ imprisonment.

#### Prosecution’s Sentencing Position

59     Regarding the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents, the Defence pointed out that the two cases cited, _Tan Teck Hock_ and _Chen Su Fen_, were _unreported_ cases. The Defence highlighted the honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon’s observation in _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terrene_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span> at \[86\] that “_unreported cases carry little if any precedential value because they are unreasoned_”.

60     The Defence also highlighted that in both _Tan Teck Hock_ and _Chen Su Fen_, the accused persons had falsified documentation to prevent their employers from noticing the misappropriation. This was clearly egregious conduct as compared to the present case, where no alteration of internal documents had occurred. In addition, in _Chen Su Fen_, other than misappropriating from the employer, the accused had also charged the customers more than the number of tyres they had purchased. The Defence also highlighted that the number of victims were larger, and the level of culpability higher. The sophistication of such a scheme also showed a greater degree of dishonesty.

#### Conclusion

61     In conclusion, the Defence submitted that the Accused had realized the gravity of her actions resulting from her lapse of judgement and had expressed remorse for her actions. The Defence therefore submitted that the sentence to be imposed should not be more than 5 months’ imprisonment.

### My decision on sentence

#### Sentencing Considerations for the section 408 offence

62     The editors of the Practitioner’s Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, 3rd Edition, LexusNexis 2013 had made the following comments at \[766\]:

> _“2 Commentary_

> The offence of criminal breach of trust may be committed in a number of ways: there is criminal breach of trust simpliciter (punishable under s 406); criminal breach of trust by a carrier, wharfinger or warehousekeeper (s 407); criminal breach of trust as a clerk or servant (s 408); criminal breach of trust by a public servant or by a banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent (s 409). Sentences of imprisonment are mandatory for offences under ss 407, 408 and 409. Even for the less serious charge under s 406, a sentence of imprisonment is usually given, even for a first offender, unless the property misappropriated is of low value. In cases involving offenders in the age group of 16 to below 21, where the value of the item is low and the offender has a clean record, the court is likely to see an order of probation as the best means of dealing with the offender. For offenders above 21 years of age, a probation order may also be suitable in certain such cases.

> **The relevant principles of sentencing are discussed in the Malaysian case of** **_PP v Mohammad Abdullah Ang Swee Kang_** **<span class="citation">\[1987\] 2 MLJ 368</span>. The two factors identified were the retributive factor in order to show the courts’ disapproval or abhorrence on behalf of the community of this type of criminal conduct, and the deterrent factor so as to discourage likely offenders. It was stated that an immediate imprisonment term is almost inevitable unless there were very exceptional mitigating circumstances or where the sum of money involved is small**. In _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span>, the High Court stated:

>> _In an offence like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court.’ The court also referred to the judgment in R v Barrick \[1985\] 81 Cr App R 78 which identified the following factors that the court will have regard to in determining the appropriate sentence:_

>>> (_i_)     _the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender including his rank; (ii) the period over which the fraud or the thefts have been committed; (iii) the use to which the money or property dishonestly taken away was put;(iv) the effect upon the victim;(v) the impact of the offences on the public and private confidence; (vi) the impact of the offences on fellow employees or partners; (vii) the effect on the offender himself; (viii) his own history; (ix) those matters of mitigation special to himself such as illness; being placed under great strain by excessive responsibility or the like; where, as sometimes happens, there has been a long delay, say over two years, between his being confronted with his dishonesty by his professional body or the police and the start of the trial; finally any help given by him to the police._

> The principles in _Wong Kai Chuen Phillip_ have been followed in numerous cases over the years, eg _PP v Serene Poh Kim Kheng_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 208</span> and _PP v Leong Wai Nam_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 284</span>.

> Criminal breach of trust which involves misappropriation of passports would be met with a stiff imprisonment term. The courts have consistently held that there is a public interest involved in the imposition of a custodial sentence for this category of offences as Singapore’s strict immigration laws are circumvented. The value of the passport lies in its ability to get its holder across state borders and in the case of a Singapore passport, probably get across with minimal fuss and enquiry. If such offences are stemmed, illegal immigration will fester in Singapore. General deterrence is hence a key principle in sentencing.

> The mitigation of previous good character, good employment record, model citizen carries minimal weight. The rationale for this, as explained in Andrew Ashworth’s book, _Sentencing and Penal Policy_ (1983) at p 194, is ‘that positions of trust are not normally given to individuals unless they have unblemished references, and so the offence may be seen as a betrayal of those very basis of trust, and one of the burdens of a position of trust is an undertaking of incorruptibility. The individual who puts himself forward as trustworthy, is trusted by others and then takes advantage of his power for his own personal ends can be said to offend in two ways — not only does he commit the crime charged (be it theft, false accounting or a sexual offence), but in addition he breached the trust placed in him by society and by the victims of the particular offence’.

63     In the present case, I was of the view that the main sentencing considerations for criminal breach of trust cases were retribution and deterrence. I was also of the view that for cases under section 408 of the Penal Code, the culpability of an accused would increase with the amount involved as well as his position held. For the present case, I was of the view that the Accused’s culpability and the harm caused were high.

#### Aggravating factors on the part of the Accused

64     I noted the following aggravating factors on the part of the Accused:

> (a)      The large number of monies involved

>> (i)       In the present case, the total amount involved was $41,319.90.

>> (ii)       The Accused had not made any restitution to date.

>> (iii)       The fact that there was a very large amount of money taken by the Accused of which no restitution was made was an aggravating factor.

> (b)      The period of the Accused’s criminal conduct

>> (i)       In the present case, the Accused had misappropriated money from the Company on several occasions over a period from 1 September 2019 and 9 October 2019. In the Statement of Fact, the Accused had admitted that she had taken money from the Float Safe since September 2019 and she also did not deposit the daily sales proceeds into the Sales Safe on 28 to 29 September 2019 and 7 to 9 October 2019.

>> (ii)       It was clear from the facts that the Accused had misappropriated monies from the Company over a period of 6 weeks. It was also clear that this was not a one-off event which was committed by the Accused on impulse but rather a continuous campaign by the Accused to carry on her illegal acts against the Company over a period.

>> (iii)       The period of offending and number of times that the Accused had misappropriated monies from the Company clearly pointed to the fact that the Accused was a persistent criminal offender.

> (c)      The Accused had committed the offence for her own benefit

>> (i)       It was clear from the Statement of Fact, that the Accused had used all the monies which she had misappropriated to feed her gambling habits at the casino at Resorts World Sentosa.

> (d)      The Accused was in a high position of trust

>> (i)       The Accused was given the responsibilities of handling monies belonging to the Company. The Accused was the Outlet Manager at the Location and she was entrusted with the daily cash proceeds from the stalls of the Location which she was supposed to collect and safe-keep in the Sales Safe before the monies were handed over to Transnational Security to be transferred to the Company.

>> (ii)       As Outlet Manager, the Accused was also entrusted with the cash float of $20,000 which was kept in the Float Safe and used for changing coins and notes, as well as petty cash claims for the Location.

>> (iii)       It was also clear from the Statement of Facts that only the Accused had the key to access the Float Safe and only the Accused and the Assistant Manager of the Location had keys to access the Sales Safe.

>> (iv)       Given the above, I was of the view that the Accused was placed in a high position of trust by her company.

#### The Accused’s mitigating factors

65     As for the Accused’s mitigating factors, I accept the Defence’s submission that she had pleaded guilty at the earliest instance. I also noted that the Accused was a first offender and she had no criminal antecedents.

66     It was also clear that the Accused’s personal and family problems could be regarded as a mitigation factor for the purposes of sentence. The Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> \[at 75\] had pointed out:

> _“An often-cited factor raised by offenders relates to the difficult personal circumstances that they faced at the time of the offences. This will, rarely, if ever, have mitigating value: see Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP \[1993\] 2 SLR ( R) 406 at \[10\](in the context of giving false information to a public servant) and PP v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 78</span> at \[8\](in the context of the offence of criminal breach of trust)”._

67     As regard to the Accused’s health, the Defence had urged me to show judicial mercy having regard to the Accused’s ill health. While I was sympathetic to the Accused’s ill health, I noted that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any causal link between the Accused’s illnesses and her commissioning of the offences.

68     Chao Hick Tin, JA had in the case of _Chew Soo Chun_ at \[21\] discussed the principles to be applied for reducing a sentence on account of ill-health:

> **_“Judicial mercy_**

> 21    Judicial mercy tempers the imposition of a punishment in the light of the offender’s personal circumstances. It is borne out of a humanitarian concern, one which reacts to the suffering of the offender of “some grave misfortune which will be cruelly exacerbated by the infliction in full measure of his just deserts”: John Tasioulas, “Mercy” (2003) 103 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 101 at p 117. In these exceptional circumstances, the court ameliorates the harshness of the punishment as a reflection of how society will react in the face of the offender’s plight and express its humanity. For example, in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Kim Hock_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 274</span> (“_Lim Kim Hock_”), the offender who was described as “facing a potential death sentence of another sort by virtue of his medical condition” was accorded some sympathy for the medical condition and was only sentenced to the minimum mandated by law (at \[11\]).

> 22    The conceptual basis for judicial mercy, which is humanity, should be emphasised. It explains the way the courts have in very serious situations, _ie_, where the medical condition of the offender is dire, found it just to alleviate the punishment that would otherwise have been warranted by the gravity of the offence committed. As was noted in _Lim Kay Han Irene v Public Prosecutor_ \[2010\] 3 SLR 340 at \[46\], judicial mercy had been exercised in these two situations. First, where the offender was suffering from terminal illness. Second, where the offender was so ill that a sentence of imprisonment would carry a high risk of endangering his life. There may be other situations arising in the future which also call for the exercise of mercy, but we need not and should not pronounce on them at this stage. Suffice it to say, it would not be right to anticipate or circumscribe the circumstances which would justify the exercise of mercy by the court. Given the wide and varied nature of human conditions, it is not possible to exhaustively state what are the exceptional circumstances or fully explain every circumstance which would qualify as exceptional. Each case stands on its own facts and has to be guided ultimately by the general principle that mercy is extended as a matter of humanity.

> 23    What would have to be guarded against, by the same token, is an unprincipled response. Judicial mercy is an exceptional jurisdiction. The effect of mercy is that the court displaces the culpability of the offender as one of the central considerations in its determination of the appropriate sentence by considerations of humanity and where benchmark sentences will effectively play no part. For the court to exercise mercy, there must be exceptional circumstances from which humanitarian considerations arise, outweighing the public interests in having the offender punished for what he had done wrong against the law.

> 24    As a general proposition, there are very weighty public interests in ensuring that those who are guilty of an offence be punished appropriately: (a) First, there is a dimension of retributive justice. The retributive norm is stated in the case of _R v Chan Kui Sheung_ \[1996\] 3 HKC 279 in these words (at 281): “Any sentence imposed must reflect public abhorrence of the crime committed and redress the grievance suffered by the victim, his friends and relatives.” The more heinous the crime, the greater the public interest in condemning the crime, and the more likely it would be that a court will hold that the sentence for that crime cannot countenance reduction on account of ill-health. So it was that in _HKSAR v Tsang Wai Kei_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] HKCA 141</span> (“_Tsang Wai Kei_”) and _HKSAR v Lkhaijav Bayanmunkh_ \[2012\] 2 HKC 233 (“_Bayanmunkh_”), the courts refused to exercise judicial mercy on account, _inter alia_, of the fact that the crime committed was drug trafficking. In coming to their decisions, the courts considered that public interest must prevail in offences of extreme gravity (_Tsang Wai Kei_ at \[18\]) and that, specifically, “drug trafficking is a crime where an offender’s personal circumstances are not given the same weight they might be given for other crimes” (_Bayanmunkh_ at \[14\]).

>> (b)    Secondly, there are social benefits to be derived from punishment, mainly, the protection of society from the particular offender, and deterrence. These valuable effects will be lost if there is no censure of those who commit offences. In cases involving “extremely grave offences”, it can even be said that “a court would be failing in its duty to the public if it did not impose heavy deterrent sentence”: _Yip Kai Foon v HKSAR_ \[2000\] 1 HKC 335 at 338. Conversely, there could be a risk that the offender would likely repeat his wrongdoing if he were at large. If the risks are high enough, this clearly militates against mercy as public interest must be prioritised; the scales will tip towards imprisoning the offender in order to prevent him and deter others from committing similar offences: see _R v Gerrard Michael Stark_ (1992) 13 Cr App R (S) 548 at 550. Indeed, the risk of re-offending was expressly identified as a relevant consideration in _Chng Yew Chin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 124</span> (“_Chng Yew Chin_”) at \[59(d)\]: “The court’s assessment of the offender’s proclivity to re-offend is important, and may include, _inter alia_, an appraisal of the accused’s criminal record and whether the accused is likely to be placed in the same or similar situational or environmental circumstances which engendered the offence in the first place. It may well be that considerations of compassion must yield to those of public interest.”

> 25    In the final analysis, the grant of judicial mercy is always a question of weighing the relative interests concerned – the public interests in punishing crimes in order to denounce it and to benefit and safeguard society, and the interests against punishment that would unduly place gravely ill offenders at risk. This requires the court to undertake a holistic review of the circumstances before making its finding of whether humanitarian considerations supporting the exercise of judicial mercy should ultimately, if they exist, prevail over other interests of society.

> 26    Should the courts moderate punishment on an unprincipled basis, there are at least two dangers. First, the courts would “appear to endorse the view that ill-health is a licence to commit crime or in some way shield an offender from the consequences of his conduct” if it exercised judicial mercy generously: _Bayanmunkh_ at \[10(1)\]. Second, the courts run a real risk of disparate and uneven sentencing by departing from principle. It cannot be gainsaid that judicial mercy is an exceptional jurisdiction that is to be invoked carefully and only sparingly, lest there be a radical and unfounded departure from our traditional theory of criminal justice.

> 27    As mentioned at \[22\] above, what can constitute exceptional circumstances include terminal illness, or conditions that will lead to an endangerment of life by reason of either the imprisonment or the deprivation of certain necessaries during imprisonment which an offender critically depends on to enhance his prospects of recovery. It will, in principle, also include other circumstances that are equally grave. To establish any of these circumstances, there would of course have to be clear evidence. It would only be proper to exercise judicial mercy if the test of exceptionality has been satisfied and there is an absence of overwhelming, countervailing public interest considerations which favour punishment.”

69     Judicial mercy had been exercised by the courts in situations whereby an accused was suffering from terminal illnesses or in a situation whereby a sentence of imprisonment could endanger an accused’s life. In the present case, I noted that Accused was not suffering from a terminal illness. And although the Accused was suffering from high blood pressure, heart ailment and spinal problems, I was of the view that these were not illnesses which would cause her life to be endangered should she serve a period of imprisonment. I was confident that the Singapore Prison Services would have the necessary and proper medical facilities to deal and take care of the Accused’s medical conditions during the period of her incarceration.

70     The court in _Chew Soo Chun_ had also emphasised that for a court to exercise mercy, there must be exceptional circumstances from which humanitarian considerations arise, outweighing the public interests in having the Accused punished for what she had done wrong against the law. In the present case, I did not see any exceptional circumstances from which humanitarian consideration had arisen which outweighed public interest to warrant a discount in the Accused’s sentence.

#### Sentence to be imposed

71     From the sentencing precedents tendered by both parties, I noted that the sentencing range for a first-time offender who had committed criminal breach of trust as an employee for sums involving $30,000 to $50,000 would be in the range of 9 to 15 months’ imprisonment.

72     I also noted the comment by the High Court in _Kavitha D/O Mailvagan_ at \[21\] to \[22\] that the appropriate sentence for a usual offender where the sum involved was $30,423.96 and where the offender had pleaded guilty and had made partial restitution would be about 10 months’ imprisonment. The District court in _Kavitha D/O Mailvagan_ had sentenced the accused to 9 months’ imprisonment but the High Court on appeal had lowered the sentence to 7 months because the High Court was of the view that the accused had not committed the offence for personal gain and that she had committed the offence out of fear caused by threats by unlicensed moneylenders towards herself and her young son. In the present case, the Accused had not made any restitution and she had committed the offence to feed her gambling habit without any fear or threats caused by third parties.

73     In deciding the sentence to be imposed, I had taken into account the following:

> (a)     The large amount of monies involved;

> (b)     The fact that the Accused’s offending behaviour was not a one-off incident but it was a course of conduct committed over a number of occasions over a period of time;

> (c)     The Accused was in a position of trust;

> (d)     The fact that the Accused had committed the offences for her personal gain; and

> (e)     The Accused’s mitigating circumstances.

74     The Defence had urged me to impose a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment for the Accused because the High Court in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ had imposed an imprisonment term of 5 months on the accused for misappropriating a sum of $67,679.05 over a 6-month period. I was of the view that _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ was not applicable to the present case due to the special circumstances present in that case.

75     In _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_, the appellant was the former principal of Maris Stella High School. He was charged with the offence of criminal breach of trust by a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for dishonestly misappropriating, via six cashier’s orders between 27 March 2009 and 10 September 2009, the sum of $67,679.05 from the School’s Chapel Building Fund account (“the Chapel Fund account”). He had used the money to pay for certain expenses incurred in renovating Champagnat House, which was the official residence of the Marist Brothers in Singapore. The Marist Brothers was an international Catholic religious order which founded the School, and the appellant was himself a Marist Brother.

76     The High Court had held that the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment which was imposed by the District Judge was somewhat lenient but it was not **manifestly inadequate** in the light of the appellant’s contribution to the school which he was the former principal and to society as a whole. Chan Seng Onn J at \[37\] to \[42\] had held the following:

> “37    While I would have adopted a higher starting point than four months’ imprisonment, I do not think that the final sentence of five months’ imprisonment which the trial judge imposed is “manifestly inadequate” in the circumstances. In arriving at this view, I am inclined to give a fair amount of weight to the following factors.

> 38    First, I note that the appellant has dedicated much of his adult life to the School, having been its Principal for some 25 years. It is undisputed that, during his tenure, the School achieved much success as evidenced by the various awards conferred on it. While these must of course have been the product of a collective effort from its students and educators, it is certainly not the case that the appellant had played an insignificant role in raising the status of the School. So much is clear from the testimonials that speak glowingly of his contributions to the School and his attributes as a Principal, and from the many awards he has personally received in recognition of his dedicated service towards education. The Prosecution, however, relied on Tay Yong Kwang J’s judgment in _Shi Ming Yi_ and submitted that it would be wrong to place _any_ weight at all on the appellant’s contributions as they did not involve a risk of “life and limb” and were therefore not sufficiently “stellar”. I am not impressed by this argument. Nowhere in the judgment of _Shi Ming Yi_ did Tay J espouse the extremely narrow proposition which the Prosecution had articulated in their submissions. While it was indeed the case that Reverend Shi Ming Yi had undertaken physical risks in his efforts to raise money and thereby received a discount in his sentence, there is nothing in Tay J’s judgment which suggests that he was laying down an authoritative sentencing principle to govern all future CBT cases. In any event, I am of the opinion that it is unfair to characterise the appellant’s contributions to society as being not sufficiently “stellar”. That trivialises not only his contributions to the School and society in general, but also those of other educators at large. I have therefore taken the appellant’s contributions into account for, as was eloquently said by Tay J in _Shi Ming Yi_ (at \[94\]), “one wrongdoing does not have to be so overwhelming that the many good deeds are completely forgotten and interred with the bones”.

> 40    Secondly, I also note that the appellant is 67 years of age now. While I am aware that there is no general rule _mandating_ a discount in prison time for offenders of mature years (_Krishnan Chand v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 737</span> (“_Krishnan Chand_”) at \[8\]), I am also unaware of any principle which _disallows_ me from taking it into account for the purpose of sentencing. I am therefore inclined to accord at least some degree of compassion to the appellant on account of his advanced age because, as has been said, “the rigour of imprisonment is, generally speaking, a harsh experience for elderly offenders”: _Edward Alfred Braham v R_ \[1994\] NTCCA 60 at \[21\] _per_ Angel J.

> 41    Thirdly, I also considered that the appellant has led a crime-free life up to now. His status as a first-time offender is certainly a factor that is generally accepted as having mitigating value: _Krishnan Chand_ at \[14\].

> 42    Ultimately, while I have explained why I find the five months’ imprisonment term imposed by the trial judge to be somewhat lenient given the aggravated nature of this s 408 offence, all things considered, I do not find it to be “_manifestly_ inadequate” such that appellate interference is warranted.”

77     The High Court in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ had acknowledged that the sentence which was imposed by the District Judge was lenient. However, the High Court had considered the following special circumstance factors in allowing the sentence by the District Judge to stand:

> (a)     The appellant had used the misappropriated monies to pay for expenses incurred in renovating Champagnat House, which was the official residence of the Marist Brothers in Singapore. The Marist Brothers was an international Catholic religious order which had founded the school;

> (b)     The appellant has dedicated much of his adult life to the School, having been its Principal for some 25 years. During his tenure, the School had achieved much success and had won various awards. The High Court was of the view that the appellant had played a significant role in raising the status of the School. Also, the appellant had received numerous testimonials that spoke glowingly of his contributions to the School and his attributes as a Principal, and had also personally received many awards in recognition of his dedicated service towards education in Singapore;

> (c)     The High Court also considered the appellant’s advanced age; and

> (d)     The High Court took into account the fact that the appellant was a first offender with no previous criminal antecedents.

78     Regarding the present case, as opposed to the appellant in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ who had misappropriated monies not for his own personal gain but to renovate Champagnat House, which was the official residence of the Marist Brothers in Singapore, the Accused had misappropriated the money and used it for her personal gain and to feed her gambling habits. The Accused also did not have any substantial contributions to society as compared to the appellant in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ who had spent most of his life helping students and had won numerous awards for his contributions to education in Singapore. I also noted that the Accused was also only 47 years old as compared to the appellant in _Tan Kim Hock Anthony_ who was an elderly 67 years old.

79     Having considered all the submissions by both parties, the precedents tendered by the parties and circumstances of the case, I was of the view that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment was not unreasonable or manifestly excessive and I thereby sentenced the Accused to 10 months’ imprisonment.

80     The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed her Notice of Appeal against my sentence. The Accused had also applied for a stay of execution of her imprisonment sentence pending appeal and I had granted a stay pending appeal. The Accused had also been granted bail pending appeal
