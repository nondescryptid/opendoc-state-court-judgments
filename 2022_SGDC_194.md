### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge of housebreaking by night at a coffeeshop in order to commit theft under s 457 r/w s 458A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) r/w s 50T of the Prisons Act (Cap 247 Rev Ed 2000), one charge of theft in dwelling under s 380 Penal Code, and one charge of causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duty under s 332 of the Penal Code. Six charges – two theft charges under s 379 Penal Code r/w s 50T Prisons Act, one charge of attempted theft under s 379 r/w s 511 Penal Code and s 50T Prisons Act, one charge of being drunk in a public place under s 14(2) and punishable under s 14(2)(i) Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act 2015 and two charges of using abusive words towards police officers in relation to the execution of their duty under s 6(1)(a) and punishable under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence with the consent of the accused.

2       He was sentenced to 10 years preventive detention (‘PD’) with effect from 30 April 2021. The accused has appealed against that sentence.

## Summary of Facts

### DAC-936456-2018

3       On 31 October 2018 at about 2am, the accused made his way to the Tanglin Halt market area, which is adjacent to a coffeeshop at Block 46-I Commonwealth Drive. He was stressed as he did not have any money and had no food at home. He tried to withdraw money from the ATM but had insufficient funds. He loitered around the area and thereafter went to the back of the coffeeshop. There, he found a metal bar. He used it to break open the padlock of the back gate to the coffeeshop. He then gained access into the coffeeshop. He found a plastic canvas which he used to hide beneath in order to shield himself from any CCTV.

4       Using the same metal bar, he broke open the padlock of the secured drawer of the wanton noodle stall and removed cash amounting to $350. Still hiding under the canvas, he next went to the drinks stall. He managed to open its cash register by pushing its buttons. He removed cash amounting to $400. He then made his way to the chicken rice stall. He tried to use a key to open the cash register drawer but was unable to do so. He lastly made his way to the mixed vegetable rice stall and tried to pry open the cash register drawer, but failed to do so. He then fled the coffeeshop through the back gate with the stolen cash of $750. He did not make any restitution.

5       The accused was liable to imprisonment in lieu of caning and an enhanced sentence of 11 days. He had been convicted on 10 February 2004 of an offence of housebreaking under s 457 r/w s 458A and s 34 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to 12 years corrective training (‘CT’). He was subject to a remission order between 2 April 2018 to 10 November 2018.

### DAC-914735-2019

6       On 14 April 2019 at about 11.00pm, the accused was passing by Sam Yat Eating House at Block 252 Jurong East Street 24. He noticed a black Converse pouch was placed on the service counter of the Western food stall which was unmanned. Realising there was an opportunity to steal the pouch, the accused quickly entered into the coffeeshop and took the pouch. He left thereafter. He was captured on the CCTV removing the pouch.

7       The Converse pouch was valued at $60. There was a Coach leather wallet valued at $150, a Malaysian NRIC, a work permit, a UOB debit card, a Malaysian driving licence, a set of keys to the coffeeshop and $20 cash in it.

### DAC-910891-2021

8       On 29 April 2021 at about 5.46 am, Senior Staff Sergeant Vigneswaran Meenatchi Sundram Shanmuganathan (‘SSgt Vignes’) and his partner, Sgt(2) Nadhrah Binte Yusri were dispatched to Block 16 Ghim Moh Road to attend to a noise complaint.

9       Upon arrival, they saw the accused was at the 13th floor corridor having a heated dispute with a lady. The accused was observed to be intoxicated. It was established that he earlier had a dispute with the mother of the lady at a unit at the 10thfloor of the block and was asked to leave the place. The accused went up to level 13 instead. The lady was sent after him to coax him not to do anything rash.

10     The two police officers persuaded the accused and the lady to return to the unit at level 10. The accused led the way. However, whilst walking down the staircase, he suddenly ran down when he reached the 10th floor staircase. SSgt Vignes immediately gave chase. At level 3 staircase, SSgt Vignes caught up as the accused had fallen down. He asked the accused why he was running. The accused suddenly punched SSgt Vignes on his left cheekbone with his right hand, causing SSgt Vignes’ spectacles to fly off. The accused immediately sprinted down the staircase and SSgt Vignes gave chase again. The accused fell down at the common corridor of level 2, whereupon SSgt Vignes pinned him down. The accused started shouting loudly and used vulgarities at SSgt Vignes and his partner. When the accused was being handcuffed by one of the back-up officers, he used abusive words towards him.

11     SSgt Vignes was seen at Alexandra Hospital on the same day at around 8am. He complained of pain over the left cheek. The examining doctor stated in the medical report that there was ‘mild tenderness of the left maxilla region and temporal-mandibular junction on palpation’ and the ‘clinical impression was left facial bone (maxilla region) injury’.

## Antecedents

## Address on Sentence

13     The prosecution sought a sentence of 12 years PD. It was submitted that the dominant sentencing principle is prevention.

14     It was emphasised that the accused’s s 457 offence is his 33rd offence and he received 12 years’ CT in 2004 for similar offences. Reference was also made to the PD report which states the accused is assessed to be in the high risk of general criminal reoffending. As regards the accused’s desire to lead a pro-social life, it was said that he has continued to reoffend after he came to know his fiancée and was on the run for a substantial period.

## Mitigation

15     The accused is 50 years of age. His parents divorced when he was five years old. He was raised by his grandmother.

16     The defence urged me to sentence the accused to an imprisonment term. The defence emphasised the protective factors. It was said that the accused met his fiancée in 2017 and wishes to spend his life with her, his step-daughter and godmother. With their support, the accused is certain he would reform.

## Sentence

17     There is no dispute that the technical requirements for PD as set out in s 304(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”) are met. The accused is 50 years old (above 30). He has on at least three occasions been convicted of offences which carry an imprisonment term of two years or more and was on at least two of those occasions sentenced to an imprisonment term and a term of CT, and the current offences are punishable with an imprisonment term of two years or more. The pre-sentencing report states that the accused is of good physical condition and of normal mental condition and he is suitable to undergo PD.

18     The prosecution submitted that this is an appropriate case for PD in view of the accused’s antecedents. In _Public Prosecutor v Raffi bin Jelan and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 120</span> at \[24\], the High Court summarised the underlying rationale for imposing preventive detention:

> It is clear from the statutory scheme in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) that a sentence of preventive detention is an extreme measure that is prescribed for certain classes of habitual offenders and/or potential recidivists who are viewed as being beyond the reach of conventional sentencing and its underlying _raison d’etre_. Preventive detention has a wholly different penological objective. The rationale for preventive sentencing is preventive control that extends beyond the parameters of conventional sentencing which requires the sentence to fit the crime. The overwhelming consideration is whether the court is satisfied in the circumstances that it is “expedient for the protection of the public” that an offender be incarcerated for a protracted period. If the court forms the view that such a repeat offender by virtue of his propensity to offend may yet again do so if unchecked, there would be a compelling case for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. Such an offender by reason of his past conduct and anticipated future conduct will be viewed as having forfeited his right to be accorded the considerations and attributes peculiar to conventional sentencing.

19     The accused has a long history of criminal proclivity. His criminal record stretches more than three decades and this was his 33rd housebreaking offence. He was last released from prison in April 2018 and was subject to a remission order. About six months later, on 3 October 2018, whilst he was still subject to the remission order, he committed two counts of theft under s 379 Penal Code and one count of attempted theft under s 379. Not long later, on 31 October 2018, he committed the offence of housebreaking. He was still subject to the remission order then. On 3 November 2018, he was charged in Court. After he was released on bail on 8 January 2019, about three months thereafter, he committed the offence of theft in dwelling on 14 April 2019. On 25 August 2020, he did not appear at his trial which was fixed for the housebreaking charge. An arrest warrant was issued against him. Whilst he was on the run, when the police came into contact with him when attending to a noise complaint on 29 April 2021, he punched a police officer in an attempt to escape.

20     The PD report states that the accused’s “employment and financial problem was a significant risk factor to his general offending.” He has been unable to hold a steady job and “committed property offences for “fast cash” whenever he was not gainfully employed as facilitated by his antisocial attitudes”.

21     The main thrust of the defence argument was that the accused now has the support of his fiancée, godmother and step-daughter and is a changed man. In this regard, the PD report states “_In the last two years between May 2019 to April 2021, Kannan managed to stay free from general offending as motivated by his fiancée and his desire to live a pro-social life with his newfound family. This indicated that Kannan has demonstrated positive shift in his attitudes_.”

22     I had carefully considered the claim that there has been a positive shift in attitude and the accused was motivated by ‘his desire to live a pro-social life with his newfound family’. As the fiancée informed me, she came to know the accused about one month before he commenced his 22-month imprisonment term on 11 January 2017. After his release from prison in April 2018, the accused stayed with her family. Despite that, it did not break his cycle of reoffending. He committed the first set of four property offences about six months after his release. Whilst he was on court bail, which was furnished by his fiancée, he went on to commit the further s 380 offence. In August 2020, he had no qualms in jumping bail, which resulted in a sum of $10,000 being forfeited. Whilst the accused managed to stay crime free between the period of May 2019 and April 2021, he was on the run from 25 August 2020 until his arrest on 29 April 2021. In the circumstances, it is apparent that the fiancée made little impact (if any) on the accused’s proclivity to commit property offences to get “fast cash”. He also had no compunction in jumping bail. The PD report classified the accused as falling into the “high risk” category of criminal reoffending and belonging to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release. I was therefore satisfied that taking the accused’s current offences together with his history of antecedents, it was “expedient for the protection of the public” that a sentence of PD be imposed.

23     As regards the length of the PD term, his longest sentences thus far have been nine years’ imprisonment and 12 years’ CT. I took reference from the prior sentences, his four present property offences which were committed whilst subject to the remission order and one whilst he was on court bail, and his ‘high risk’ of reoffending. Although the reality is that his supportive relationship has not been effective in stopping his reoffending, but considering the positive shift in attitude noted in the PD report, I imposed a term of 10 years’ PD with effect from 30 April 2021.
