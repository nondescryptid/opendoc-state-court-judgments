Civil Procedure – Summary judgment

Contract – Duress – Economic

Contract – Misrepresentation

15 December 2020

### Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin:

1       This is the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment. The plaintiff’s claim in the underlying action arises out of a written settlement agreement dated 27 February 2020 (the “Settlement Agreement”) under which the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff approximately $196,000, partly in cash and partly in goods. The plaintiff claims $133,609.37 in this action and in this application on the basis that this is the amount that remains unpaid after the defendant returned goods worth about $62,500.

2       The defendant alleges that the Settlement Agreement is void on two distinct grounds. One is that it entered into it under economic duress. The other is that it was induced to enter into it by misrepresentations made by the plaintiff. In addition the defendant contends that it is entitled to set off various sums that the plaintiff owes to it, and the defendant has also asserted counterclaims against the plaintiff alleging broadly that the plaintiff breached various implied contractual duties owed to it. It argues that the set-off and counterclaims furnish further independent reason why the plaintiff should not be allowed summary judgment on its claim.

## Factual background

3       It is not disputed that the Settlement Agreement arose in the context of a joint venture between the plaintiff and two individuals, namely Lin Sitong, referred to by all parties as “Nikki”, and See Ching Hour, referred to as “Vincent”. The key individual behind the plaintiff is its sole director and shareholder Zhang Keke, referred to as “Keira”. The business of the joint venture comprised the wholesale of liquor, soft drinks and beverages, and the defendant was the corporate vehicle for the business. As part of the joint venture all three parties held shares in the defendant. Nikki and Vincent each held 30% of these shares, and the remaining 40% was held by the plaintiff through Keira’s brother as its nominee. Nikki was at all times the sole director of the defendant.

4       The joint venture was recorded in a written memorandum of agreement dated 30 May 2019 (the “MOA”). I should observe that whereas the plaintiff is FY Group Singapore Pte Ltd the corporate party to the MOA is named “FY Group Pte Ltd”, but parties have throughout this action and application proceeded on the uncontroverted premise that the plaintiff was the corporate participant in the joint venture and so I proceed likewise. Under the MOA each party had their own defined roles and responsibilities. The plaintiff was responsible for “Finance, Human Resource, Operation, Logistic & Inventory”, while Nikki and Vincent took charge of sales and marketing.

5       It is not disputed that the joint venture between the parties did not survive beyond 27 February 2020, which was the day on which two written agreements were signed. One was the Settlement Agreement. It was signed by Nikki and Vincent on the defendant’s behalf and by Keira on the plaintiff’s behalf – although Keira signed on behalf of “FY GROUP PTE LTD”, once more I proceed on the common basis that the plaintiff was the corporate party to the Settlement Agreement as it was to the MOA.

6       The Settlement Agreement consists of three numbered paragraphs under the sentence, “We agreed on below settlement based on the attached Balance Sheet dated 26th Feb, 2020”. It is mostly typewritten but contains substantial handwritten amendments and additions against which parties countersigned. The first paragraph says, “Other Creditor - FY Group Pte Ltd $13,341.69: WIS will pay to FY GROUP PTE LTD by end of March, 2020”. The words “by end of March, 2020” are handwritten and in substitution of the typewritten word “immediately” that was struck out. The second paragraph states, “Trade Creditors-FYG $171,496.46: WIS will pay FY GROUP PTE LTD $100,000.00 within three months, $30,000.00 will be paid by end of March, $30,000.00 will be paid by end of April, and the balance of $40,000.00 will be paid by end of May, 2020” – the year and the comma immediately preceding it are handwritten – and continues, “The balance of $71,496.46, FY GROUP PTE LTD will take the equivalent value of the goods from the stocks”. The third paragraph is entirely handwritten and provides, “Stock – FYG $11,286.27: FY Group Pte Ltd will take the equivalent value of the goods from the stocks”. There is no dispute that “FYG” refers to the plaintiff and “WIS” refers to the defendant.

7       In short, under the Settlement Agreement the defendant was obliged to pay the plaintiff $113,341.69 in cash in three instalments at the end of the months of March, April and May 2020, and the plaintiff was also entitled to take from the defendant goods worth $82,755.73. While the defendant’s position is that the Settlement Agreement is void, I do not understand this interpretation of the Settlement Agreement, assuming its validity, to be a contested issue.

8       The other agreement dated 27 February 2020 was a shareholders’ agreement (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”) signed by Nikki, Vincent and Keira on behalf of her brother. The Shareholders’ Agreement is entirely typewritten and consists of two numbered paragraphs under the sentence, “We agreed on below settlement based on the attached Balance Sheet dated 26th Feb, 2020”. The undisputed gist of the Shareholders’ Agreement was that Nikki and Vincent would purchase the plaintiff’s 40% shareholding in the defendant held through Keira’s brother. The purchase price was $16,924.12 on the express agreed understanding that the “company net worth” of the defendant was $42,310.31, It appears not to be disputed that Nikki and Vincent paid this sum of $16,942.12 to Keira. All parties – that is, Nikki, Vincent and Keira and, by attribution, both the plaintiff and the defendant – have taken the common position in this action and application that Nikki and Vincent are at present the only shareholders of the defendant with each holding 50% of those shares. It will become apparent later that I regard this as a crucial fact.

9       It is evident on the face of the Settlement Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement that both of them were based on the same “Balance Sheet dated 26th Feb, 2020”. It is apparent from the evidence that this “Balance Sheet” was sent by Keira to Nikki and Vincent over WeChat at 11.30pm on 26 February 2020, the night before the two agreements were signed, and that this was done in response to Nikki’s request at 9.11pm on 25 February 2020 that Keira send to her and Vincent “the last and more accurate p&l and BS tomorrow”. It is also apparent that the Balance Sheet stated the “TOTAL NET WORTH” of the defendant as $42,310.31, which was the exact amount of the “company net worth” stated in the Shareholders’ Agreement, making it clear beyond doubt that the Balance Sheet was indeed the basis for the valuation of the defendant’s net worth and the plaintiff’s 40% shareholding in the defendant for purposes of the Shareholders’ Agreement.

10     It is the Balance Sheet that gives rise to the defendant’s defence of misrepresentation. The defendant pleads that, in order to induce it to enter into the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff “represented to the Defendant that the Defendant’s Balance Sheet reflected a true and accurate account of the Defendant’s financial state of affairs”, but this was untrue because the Balance Sheet was incorrect. The defendant pleads that at this juncture the best particulars it can provide of the inaccuracy of the Balance Sheet are that the plaintiff was not entitled to charge it “any management support fees and/or salary of its staff”, meaning that the liabilities owed by the defendant to the plaintiff as reflected in the Balance Sheet are “inflated”. The defendant says that its ability to furnish better particulars is hampered by the plaintiff’s refusal to provide it with documents that would allow it to verify the figures in the Balance Sheet, the plaintiff having possession of these documents by virtue of its responsibility for the defendant’s finances as set out in the MOA.

11     As for the defendant’s defence of economic duress, the essential complaint put forward by Nikki and Vincent on its behalf is that the plaintiff actively obstructed the defendant’s business endeavours from 7 February 2020. According to Nikki and Vincent, events were set in motion when Keira informed them at a meeting on 21 January 2020 that she wished to have the plaintiff withdraw from the “loss-making” joint venture. Thereafter, on 6 February 2020 one John Liow sent an e-mail on the plaintiff’s behalf addressed to Nikki, Vincent and others stating that he was giving “official notification” of the “\[c\]omplete stoppage & discontinuation of \[the defendant’s\] business operations from 7th February 2020 (Friday 1400 pm)”, and that there “shall be no sales transactions and deliveries of any stock/goods to the trade”.

12     The defendant’s case is that having unilaterally decided in this way to “freeze” the defendant’s operations the plaintiff (a) prevented all movement of the defendant’s stock of goods kept in the plaintiff’s warehouse, for instance, when Nikki and Vincent wanted to retrieve the defendant’s goods from the warehouse the plaintiff “instructed its warehouse staff not to listen to any instructions” from them, (b) “refused to pay any of the Defendant’s vendors’ and suppliers’ invoices”, (c) helped itself to the defendant’s funds without Nikki’s consent in purported repayment of debts that it alleged were owed by the defendant, (d) tried to exert control over goods of the defendant stored at a third party’s warehouse, and (e) terminated the employment of all the defendant’s employees. Nikki and Vincent say that this led to them being “chased by frustrated customers” of the defendant who wanted to know “whether and when they would receive their stocks” pursuant to existing contracts of supply. They say that this had “extremely damaging consequences on the Defendant” and caused “much stress and anxiety” to them, and that in order to avoid the defendant “breaching its contracts and losing goodwill with clients and suppliers” they felt that they had “no practical alternative” but to accept the terms of the Settlement Agreement. They add that they were given inadequate time to consider the Balance Sheet and the drafts of the Settlement Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement between the time Keira sent those documents late at night on 26 February 2020 and the time they were supposed to meet Keira to sign both agreements the next morning.

13     Turning at last to the right of set-off and the counterclaims asserted by the defendant, it pleads that the plaintiff owes it almost $8,000 under three invoices. It also pleads that it was an implied term of the MOA that, in discharging its responsibility for the defendant’s “Finance, Human Resource, Operation, Logistic & Inventory”, the plaintiff would (a) act “with reasonable skill and care”, (b) “not act against the interests of the Defendant”, and (c) “properly account to the Defendant as regards its financial affairs and inventory”. It alleges that the plaintiff breached this implied term and caused the defendant loss as a consequence. The defendant pleads in the alternative that it was an implied term of the Settlement Agreement that the plaintiff would “return all of the Defendant’s records to the Defendant forthwith following the dissolution of the Joint Venture”, and that the plaintiff has breached this implied term by withholding those records from the defendant.

## _Prima facie_ case for summary judgment

14     I think it clear that the plaintiff has established a _prima facie_ case for summary judgment. The Settlement Agreement appears on its face to embody a binding accord between the plaintiff and the defendant supported by consideration. There is no question that the Settlement Agreement requires the defendant to make payment to the plaintiff partly in cash and partly in goods. There is no dispute that the defendant has not made any cash payment and the plaintiff has taken from the defendant goods worth $62,511.34. On those premises the defendant continues to owe the plaintiff at least the sum of $133,609.37 for which it seeks summary judgment – I say “at least” because by my calculations the plaintiff could be entitled to $3.71 more.

15     Given this _prima facie_ case for summary judgment, to resist this application the defendant must show that its defences of misrepresentation and economic duress raise triable issues, or that its set-off and counterclaims constitute sufficient reason to deny the plaintiff summary judgment. I consider each in turn, starting with the misrepresentation defence.

## Misrepresentation

16     For the misrepresentation defence to get off the ground the defendant must show that the plaintiff made a representation – that is, a statement of fact – that was untrue. The defendant’s pleaded case is that the plaintiff represented to it that the “Balance Sheet reflected a true and accurate account of the Defendant’s financial state of affairs”. The immediate difficulty with this pleading is that the plaintiff never made a statement of fact in such express language, whether through Keira or anyone else. Ms Lee Ping, counsel for the defendant, explains that this representation impliedly arose in two main ways. First, the Settlement Agreement itself provided in its preamble that it was “based on” the Balance Sheet, and this was consistent with Keira having informed Nikki and Vincent at a meeting on 24 February 2020 that she “would prepare a settlement agreement based on the balance sheet of the Defendant”. Second, given that Keira had sent the Balance Sheet in response to a request by Nikki over WeChat for “the last and more accurate p&l and BS”, Keira had by her conduct effectively represented that the Balance Sheet truly and accurately showed the state of the defendant’s finances.

17     In support of this characterisation of the facts Ms Lee relies on the decision of Judith Prakash J in _Tiong Swee Eng v Yeo Khee Siang_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1141</span> (“_Tiong Swee Eng_”). This case concerned a settlement agreement between a husband and a wife concerning the division of their matrimonial assets. This agreement was reached at the end of a mediation session at which the husband had presented a case summary containing a list of the matrimonial assets, referred to as the “Asset List” (at \[3\]). The wife sought to rescind the settlement agreement on the ground of misrepresentation, alleging that the husband had provided a false and misleading Asset List that omitted one or more matrimonial assets that ought to be available for division. Prakash J agreed that the husband “did in fact misrepresent the matrimonial pool of assets” (at \[36\]), although she found that this was an innocent or negligent misrepresentation and ultimately declined to rescind the settlement agreement. Ms Lee argues that on the point of whether a representation was made this case is indistinguishable from _Tiong Swee Eng_: just as the Asset List was found to constitute a representation in relation to the settlement agreement that was built on it, the representation being that the contents of the Asset List were correct and complete, so the Balance Sheet constitutes a representation in relation to the Settlement Agreement that was based on it, the representation being that the Balance Sheet depicted truly and accurately the defendant’s financial state.

18     Persuasive as Ms Lee’s argument initially seemed, I think that _Tiong Swee Eng_ can be distinguished after all because in that case the settlement agreement contained an express clause in which the husband declared that as at the date of the agreement he had the assets detailed in the rest of that clause and owned no other property locally or overseas (at \[11(a)\]), and the catalogue of those assets was based on the Asset List (at \[12\]). Thus, properly read there was in _Tiong Swee Eng_ an express written statement of fact that the Asset List was accurate. In this case, on the other hand, I see no comparable express statement. It is no answer that the Settlement Agreement was expressly said to be “based on” the Balance Sheet because I do not see how this necessarily carries with it a statement that the Balance Sheet is accurate. It is equally possible to discern a statement not that the Balance Sheet was unconditionally true but that it was true to the best of Keira’s and the plaintiff’s knowledge and belief. So it is with Keira’s conduct in sending Nikki and Vincent the Balance Sheet: I cannot see why it inexorably connotes a statement by Keira that the Balance Sheet reflected a true and accurate account of the defendant’s financial affairs when it could just as much suggest instead the more qualified statement, “So far as I know, and to the best of my honest belief, this Balance Sheet represents a correct account of the defendant’s finances”.

19     It seems to me that the representation alleged by the defendant would be rather incongruent in the entire context of the dealings between the parties as they sought to dissolve the joint venture. The defendant does not deny that the plaintiff supplied it with goods in the course of its business, and thereby implicitly accepts that at the time the parties were discussing dissolution of the joint venture in February 2020 there was very probably some money owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, except that the quantum of the debt might have been uncertain. The Settlement Agreement was evidently the culmination of the parties’ attempt to reach consensus on the amount that was owing and the manner in which it would be repaid. That being so, it strikes me as fanciful to think that, in the midst of negotiations at arm’s length between representatives of the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff would in effect commit itself to warranting in unqualified fashion the accuracy of the Balance Sheet. I find it far more consistent to construe the presentation of the Balance Sheet as the plaintiff saying to the defendant, “This is my position on what you owe me, and I believe it is true; you may have your own position, but this is mine and I stand by it”.

20     Ms Lee contends that this case is special because the plaintiff had exclusive charge of the defendant’s finances pursuant to the MOA and Nikki and Vincent thus relied completely on the plaintiff to provide correct financial information on the defendant. Even leaving aside the plaintiff’s response that Nikki and Vincent had full access at all times to the accounting software that held the defendant’s financial accounts, the material fact is that by the time the Balance Sheet was sent the interests of Nikki and Vincent were nowhere as aligned with those of the plaintiff as they might have been during the currency of the joint venture. Given the divergence of the parties’ interests I find it untenable to interpret the plaintiff’s conduct as carrying an unqualified guarantee of the contents of the Balance Sheet. At highest there was a representation that the plaintiff genuinely believed that the Balance Sheet was true and accurate. This is tangibly different from the representation alleged by the defendant that the Balance Sheet was in fact true and accurate.

21     Put another way, I do not think it can seriously be disputed that one purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to resolve definitively at the time any disagreement as to the sum owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. To say that the reference to the Balance Sheet in the Settlement Agreement and the plaintiff’s conduct in sending Nikki and Vincent the Balance Sheet amounts to a representation that the Balance Sheet was true and accurate is in substance to say that in order to enforce the Settlement Agreement the plaintiff has to prove all over again that the amount it said the defendant owed to it at the time was indeed the amount that was owed. This would in my view wholly undermine the purpose of the Settlement Agreement I have just described, and so I think that it could not be right to extract from the circumstances of this case the representation alleged by the defendant absent clear express statements from the plaintiff to that effect. Therefore, notwithstanding Ms Lee’s vigorous and compelling advocacy, I think that when the undisputed facts are looked at in the round the representation alleged by the defendant is unarguable and the issue of whether it was made falls short of being a triable one.

22     Ms Lee informs me that the defendant is prepared to amend its pleadings in order to plead a different representation along the lines of the one canvassed above that the plaintiff honestly believed that the Balance Sheet was true and accurate. Ms Lee says that the defendant’s case is that this too was false, in that the plaintiff through Keira’s agency acted with fraudulent intent to inflate the liabilities reflected in the Balance Sheet as owing from the defendant to the plaintiff. Initially I thought this allegation of fraud unsustainable given the fact that the Balance Sheet underpins both the Settlement Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement. Ms Vanesse Koh, counsel for the plaintiff, astutely points out that if the plaintiff were falsely to inflate the liabilities owed to it by the defendant it might operate to its advantage in the Settlement Agreement but that would be disadvantageous to it under the Shareholders’ Agreement. This is because inflated liabilities would reduce the “TOTAL NET WORTH” of the defendant in the Balance Sheet and the “company net worth” in the Shareholders’ Agreement, which as explained earlier are the same thing, and so diminish the value of the plaintiff’s 40% shareholding in the defendant and depress the price it could demand from Nikki and Vincent to purchase those shares. But I think Ms Lee is right to say that the arithmetic is such that inflating liabilities would invariably result in a net gain to the plaintiff when the advantage under the Settlement Agreement is put alongside the disadvantage under the Shareholders’ Agreement, because the plaintiff stands to gain 100% of the inflated liabilities under the former but lose only 40% of the reduction in the defendant’s net worth under the latter. Hence I cannot dismiss the possibility of fraudulent presentation of the Balance Sheet simply on the basis that it would also cause prejudice to the plaintiff under the Shareholders’ Agreement.

23     Ms Koh also contends that when the evidence is considered it is clear beyond doubt that the plaintiff prepared the Balance Sheet honestly. So far as the defendant complains that it was erroneously charged fees and workers’ salaries by the plaintiff, Ms Koh’s answer is that invoices were issued by the plaintiff to the defendant for those fees and salaries, and as long as the liabilities stated in the Balance Sheet as owing from the defendant to the plaintiff were supported by such invoices it would have been honest and non-fraudulent to include those liabilities in the computations for the Balance Sheet, and if anything it would have been dishonest to exclude them. While I understand Ms Koh’s logic I do not think it is as straightforward as that. If it turns out that the plaintiff did not genuinely believe that it was entitled to charge the defendant the fees and salaries it did, it seems to me wholly arguable that it prepared and presented the Balance Sheet without honestly believing that it was a true and accurate depiction of the defendant’s financial state. And it seems to me that this issue of whether the plaintiff was entitled to charge those fees requires a full consideration of all the evidence at trial and is as such a triable one. In short, if the plaintiff were to amend its pleadings on misrepresentation in the manner Ms Lee indicated it was willing to do, I think it would give rise to triable issues of whether the amended representation was made and whether it was false.

24     But I decline to give the plaintiff leave to amend even though I can do so because I think there is no reasonable prospect of arguing that the Settlement Agreement should be set aside or avoided in consequence. Given that the Balance Sheet formed the basis not only of the Settlement Agreement but also of the Shareholders’ Agreement, any misrepresentation concerning the Balance Sheet that induced the defendant’s entry into the former would in identical measure have induced Nikki’s and Vincent’s entry into the latter. Yet even as the defendant attacks the validity of the former Nikki, Vincent and the defendant are none of them prepared to disclaim the latter, and instead they rely throughout on the effectiveness of the Shareholders’ Agreement in transferring the plaintiff’s 40% shareholding in the defendant to Nikki and Vincent. I think Ms Koh is right to contend that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation does not permit the defendant to take these incompatible positions. That doctrine “precludes a person who has exercised a right from exercising another right which is alternative to and inconsistent with the right he has exercised”, to quote from a passage in the decision of Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in _Treasure Valley Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy and another (Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, intervener)_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 358</span> (at \[31\]) that was later endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _BWG v BWF_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 1296</span> (at \[102\]).

25     Ms Lee fairly and forcefully submits in response that it is not the defendant’s place to take any position on the Shareholders’ Agreement given that it is not a party to it even though Nikki and Vincent are, and so it should not be expected to deny the validity of that agreement. Ms Lee also argues that there is in any event no real inconsistency in Nikki and Vincent saying on one hand that they wished to dissolve their joint venture with the plaintiff by purchasing the plaintiff’s shares in the defendant under the Shareholders’ Agreement and saying on the other hand that the accounts had to be sorted out in a proper and accurate manner under the Settlement Agreement and that this latter contract should be invalidated if the accounts were not so sorted.

26     While these contentions have some attraction when viewed up close, I am not convinced by them when I take a step back and look at the case from a broader perspective. Nikki and Vincent were without doubt the directing minds of the defendant at the time the Settlement Agreement and Shareholders’ Agreement were entered into. Assuming a misrepresentation as to the Balance Sheet by the plaintiff, it seems to me an unavoidable conclusion that Nikki and Vincent have long since chosen to affirm the Shareholders’ Agreement. Having exercised that right and taken the benefit of it I think it is inconsistent for them to cause the defendant to contest the Settlement Agreement on the ground of the very same taint they were glad to overlook in relation to the Shareholders’ Agreement. My understanding of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is that it possesses the flexibility of a creature of equity and looks to substantial justice rather than legal form, and so even though Nikki and Vincent are technically separate entities from the defendant I think the doctrine is wide enough that it may operate to limit the options available to a company controlled by individuals who have made an inconsistent choice in their personal capacities. Hence I think that this doctrine would restrain Nikki and Vincent from urging on the defendant’s behalf the rescission of the Settlement Agreement. For that reason I can say with confidence even at this interlocutory stage that the defendant’s misrepresentation defence is futile.

27     Although this suffices by itself to satisfy me that the defendant’s defence of misrepresentation may be summarily rejected, I agree with Ms Koh’s contention that the conclusion is buttressed by Nikki’s initial response when the plaintiff demanded through its solicitors payment of the outstanding sums under the Settlement Agreement. In her e-mail dated 14 May 2020 Nikki said that the defendant had been advised by its lawyers that the Settlement Agreement was “vague, ambiguous & unsupported by any proper consideration”, and the sums claimed by the plaintiff were “not substantiated by any genuine delivery orders or goods delivered”. There was no allegation of any misrepresentation – or for that matter economic duress – and this leads to the inference urged by Ms Koh that the defence is little more than an afterthought.

## Economic duress

28     It is common ground between the parties that for a contracting party to avoid the contract on the ground of economic duress it must show (a) that there was pressure amounting to compulsion of its will, and (b) the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted: see the decision of Quentin Loh J in _E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 232</span> (at \[51\]). As Loh J elaborated (at \[52\]), an important guiding principle is that economic duress must not be confused with normal “lawful commercial pressure” that is only to be expected in any business dealings between self-interested persons.

29     In this case the defendant alleges that the plaintiff abused its control over the defendant’s “Finance, Human Resource, Operation, Logistic & Inventory” and effectively brought the defendant’s business to a standstill. My first impression was that there was nothing objectionable in this. The MOA did not specify any fixed or minimum duration for the joint venture between the parties. Any party could I think decide unilaterally to withdraw from the joint venture should it form the view that the venture was no longer beneficial to it, which appears to be what the plaintiff did. If it was entitled to exit the joint venture at any time, I would think it was entitled to cease the work it was doing for the defendant and wash its hands of the business. What is more, as a supplier of goods to the defendant the plaintiff was owed money by it, and as a creditor I should think it legitimate for the plaintiff to wish in exiting the joint venture to recover what it was owed. Any steps taken to obtain from the defendant what it was owed would seem to me more naturally to fall within the realm of “lawful commercial pressure” than to be illegitimate pressure such as would constitute economic duress.

30     But Ms Lee has persuaded me that my immediate impression was overly simplistic. Ms Lee cites the decision of Judith Prakash J in _Tam Tak Chuen v Khairul bin Abdul Rahman and others_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 240</span> and I accept that this case demonstrates that it is in principle possible to find economic duress in the dissolution of a joint venture even where the participants in the venture were free to leave at any time. In that case two medical doctors were in business together and when one of them, Dr Khairul, found out that the other, Dr Tam, was having an extra-marital affair with an employee in one of the clinics the doctors operated together Dr Khairul decided to end the business partnership. Dr Khairul had managed to obtain from a closed-circuit camera in the clinic video footage of Dr Tam having sexual relations with the employee, and he confronted Dr Tam with the footage. Shortly after that Dr Tam agreed to sell his stake in the joint business to Dr Khairul for $50,000, which was at an undervalue. Prakash J acknowledged that Dr Khairul “was perfectly entitled to take all legal steps available to him to terminate the relationship, and to minimise the loss that he himself would suffer from such a termination”, but held that Dr Khairul had then gone on to “take advantage of the situation and unfairly profit from it” (at \[54\]). Having found that Dr Tam had sold his stake under economic duress Prakash J set the sale aside.

31     In view of this authority cited by Ms Lee I am prepared to say that it is a triable issue whether the plaintiff exerted illegitimate pressure on the defendant in the course of dissolving the joint venture between the plaintiff, Nikki and Vincent. There is a factual dispute as to whether the plaintiff was being deliberately obstructive and not merely passively non-cooperative. There is also I think a factual dispute as to whether there was behaviour on the plaintiff’s part that could be characterised as exploitative or predatory, given that the defendant effectively alleges that the plaintiff was charging it for fees and workers’ salaries it was not entitled to do. I am constrained to say that the defendant’s evidence is somewhat thin: the alleged overcharged fees and salaries do not come up to large amounts, and so far as Nikki has said that she discovered that the plaintiff was seeking without basis to charge the defendant an additional $166,407.29 in management support fees, it seems a complete answer to this that the plaintiff did not include that in the computation of the sums owed to it leading up to the Settlement Agreement and is not claiming those fees now. On balance I do not think I can draw firm conclusions at this interlocutory stage on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any pressure the plaintiff might have exerted on the defendant.

32     But on the issue of whether there was compulsion of the defendant’s will I think there is greater certainty as to the merits of the parties’ cases. Ms Koh has rightly referred to a considerable body of evidence that tends to show that there was no such compulsion, including the fact that Nikki and Vincent had had presence of mind enough to seek and make on the defendant’s behalf handwritten amendments to the Settlement Agreement, and the fact that in the months immediately after the signing of the Settlement Agreement they conducted themselves as if it were valid and binding on the defendant and their eventual protests otherwise were highly belated. Nikki and Vincent do not appear to have made any serious attempt in their affidavits to explain these facts away.

33     The evidence stacked up in the plaintiff’s favour on this point is thus of formidable strength but I think that even if all that is left aside there are two undisputed facts that taken together are by themselves conclusive. The first is that the Settlement Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement were signed by the same individuals, Nikki and Vincent, around the same time, even if they were signing on the defendant’s behalf in respect of the Settlement Agreement. The second is that Nikki and Vincent have throughout accepted that the Shareholders’ Agreement is valid and binding in that they hold themselves out as the only shareholders of the defendant having previously purchased the plaintiff’s 40% shareholding. I think it must follow from this second fact that Nikki and Vincent were in fact fully capable of entering into the Shareholders’ Agreement and their wills had not been compelled in a way that would make that contract liable to be set aside. Given the closeness in time between the signing of the Settlement Agreement and the Shareholders’ Agreement, it seems to me incoherent to say that there was no compulsion of Nikki’s and Vincent’s wills when they signed the latter but there was when they signed the former.

34     Again Ms Lee points to the fact that Nikki and Vincent are not parties to this action and contends that no adverse consequence should attach to the defendant just because Nikki and Vincent have not volunteered their position on the Shareholders’ Agreement, and the defendant not being a party to that contract should not be expected to presume to speak for them. But if this case were to go to trial Nikki and Vincent would eventually have to testify in their dual capacities as the defendant’s representatives and contracting parties in their own right, and I am unable to think of a plausible explanation that they could advance to convince the trial judge that their will was compelled when entering into the Settlement Agreement on the defendant’s behalf but they were sufficiently possessed of mind and volition to make a choice to purchase the plaintiff’s shares in the defendant under the Shareholders’ Agreement. Whatever might be the evidence adduced at trial I cannot see how the trial judge could make such an internally contradictory finding.

35     For this reason alone I consider myself able to conclude even at this point in the proceedings that the defendant’s defence of economic duress cannot succeed. Once more I express agreement with Ms Koh’s point that the defence is likely to be nothing more than an afterthought given that it was raised by the defendant very belatedly and was conspicuously absent from Nikki’s initial response to the plaintiff’s demand for payment of the outstanding sums under the Settlement Agreement.

## Set-off and counterclaims

36     The plaintiff accepts that it ought to pay the defendant in respect of two invoices for the sums of $1,025.19 and $3,237.20. As for the remaining debt allegedly owed by the plaintiff to the defendant that is disputed, I fail to see a close enough connection between that debt and the Settlement Agreement that the dispute concerning the debt should pose an impediment to granting the plaintiff summary judgment pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.

37     As for the defendant’s counterclaims, there are two of them, one based on the plaintiff’s alleged breach of an implied term of the MOA and the other on the plaintiff’s alleged breach of an implied term of the Settlement Agreement. Taking first the MOA counterclaim, I think Ms Koh is right to say that it seems dubious because the defendant is seeking to imply into an agreement to which it is not even a party a term that confers a benefit on it. It is thus asserting contractual rights twice removed from the actual language of the contract. But I do not propose to say anything more about the merits of this counterclaim because there is no application before me to strike it out. That being so, I think it would be going beyond my proper function in this application to find that the MOA counterclaim has no reasonable prospect of succeeding. I think I must assume that it is not hopeless.

38     The question is instead whether the defendant’s MOA counterclaim is so closely connected to the plaintiff’s claim under the Settlement Agreement that the plaintiff should not be granted summary judgment. I answer this in the negative. Although the MOA counterclaim and the Settlement Agreement share a common origin in that they arose out of the joint venture between the plaintiff, Nikki and Vincent, it seems to me that the facts and evidence that would have to be considered in relation to each of them are very different. To determine the counterclaim it is necessary to examine the dealings between the parties in the joint venture. For example, there will need to be evidence of the manner in which the plaintiff carried out its responsibilities under the MOA. Assessing the plaintiff’s claim under the Settlement Agreement, on the other hand, entails the markedly narrower enquiry of whether the defendant has paid what it agreed to pay. Hence I think that the litigation of the defendant’s counterclaim under the MOA furnishes no reason to delay judgment to which the plaintiff is entitled.

39     This leaves for consideration the defendant’s alternative counterclaim alleging breach of an implied term in the Settlement Agreement that the plaintiff return the defendant’s records in its possession to the defendant. This counterclaim is premised on the validity of the Settlement Agreement and so entails prior acceptance of the plaintiff’s right to receive from the defendant the payment contracted for under the Settlement Agreement. While this counterclaim is obviously closely connected to the plaintiff’s claim given that both invoke the same contract, the guiding consideration here is that even if the defendant can prove the existence of the implied term it alleges there is no possibility of suggesting that payment to the plaintiff was contingent on its returning the defendant’s records. This is because the express terms of the Settlement Agreement unambiguously required the defendant to pay by stipulated dates. If the defendant could have no right under the Settlement Agreement to withhold payment from the plaintiff on the ground of omission to return records, I cannot see why the summary judgment due the plaintiff should await the outcome of a dispute over the return of the defendant’s records.

## Conclusion

40     Setting off the sums that the plaintiff accepts it owes to the defendant, I enter summary judgment in the plaintiff’s favour for the sum of $129,346.98 with the usual interest at 5.33% per annum from date of writ to judgment. I am very grateful to counsel for both parties for assisting me so with the clarity and comprehensiveness of their argument and their command of the relevant legal and factual material. Although I have rejected summarily the defendant’s case I think Ms Lee gave it its best possible showing with an assured tenacity that was at the same time always measured and fair.
