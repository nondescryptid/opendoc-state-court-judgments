CONTRACT – Breach

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 8/2022.\]

25 March 2022

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       This was a one day trial on whether the plaintiff had proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of US $100,155 or SG$142,220.10 as pleaded in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) and whether the plaintiff was liable to pay the defendant the sum of US $81,884.69 as pleaded by the defendant in his Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1). A total of 3 witnesses gave evidence in court. The 2 plaintiff witnesses were Mr Fu Chun (“also known as “Bill Fu”) and his driver, Mr Li Qi and the defendant (“also known as Gavin Chung”) as the sole witness.

2       At the end of the trial, I granted judgment in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of SG $142,220.10 with interest at 5.33% pa from date of writ to judgment and dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim. Being dissatisfied, the defendant has since appealed against my decision. These are the full grounds of my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       It was undisputed that on or about 23 August 2019, the plaintiff entered into a contract for the supply of metal powder from the defendant being Contract No: 0018/2019/SINTERGRO/USGL (“SPA”)[^1]. The terms specified the acceptable gold and silver content to be contained in the powder. For gold, the minimum was to be at least 9 ppm and the silver was to be at least 200 ppm. The terms also provided the price payable for different content levels. In addition, the payment term was to be “100% TT payment after B/L or after taking samples and results for ex the buyer’s yard term.” The SPA further provided that the metal powder was to originate from Colombo, Sri Lanka and the destination was Shanghai.

4       It was undisputed that the parties had entered into a Compromise Agreement (“CA”) on 7 January 2020[^2]. It was also undisputed that the parties agreed to have SGS SA (“SGS”) to be the testing agent of the contents of the metal powder when the metal powder arrived at Shanghai. It was also undisputed that both parties’ representatives attended at the mutual inspection on 17 November 2019 for which the photographs of the inspection had been exhibited[^3] where samples were taken by SGS staff for purpose of testing. There was no dispute that the SGS report stated that the gold and silver content in the powder did not meet the minimum levels specified in the contract. The SGS report stated[^4] that the gold level measured at 6.52ppm and the silver measured at 23ppm which meant that both were well below the acceptable contractual levels of 9ppm for gold and 200ppm for silver respectively. It was undisputed that it was the defendant who paid for SGS’ services in testing and producing the report.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

5       The plaintiff‘s pleaded case was that a shipment of approximately 327,260 metric tons of metal powder that was sent by the defendant departed from Colombo, Sir Lanka and arrived at Shanghai on 19 November 2019. The relevant Bill of Lading was Booking No CMB 9A0001300 (“B/L”). Pursuant to an oral conversation between Bill Fu and Gavin Chung on 24 September 2019, the plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of US$100,155 for the shipment of metal powder on 30 September 2019.

6       When the SGS report was furnished to the plaintiff on 26 December 2019, the plaintiff raised his concerns about the gold and silver content of the metal powder to the defendant and this resulted in the CA of 7 January 2020. In Gavin Chung’s email of 7 January 2020, he acknowledged payment of US $103,531.98 (which parties agreed should be US$100,155) and he would send materials to the plaintiff’s yard at Chennai, India until the amount was cleared. As the defendant had clearly breached the terms of the SPA as the gold and silver content fell below the contractual levels and the defendant had admitted to owing the plaintiff money as seen in the CA, the plaintiff therefore sued to seek return of the US $100,155 or SG $142,220.10.

### The defendant’s version

7       The defendant pleaded at \[15\] and \[16\] of Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) that there was common mistake made by parties as regards the amount paid by plaintiff to the defendant. The plaintiff had indicated that he paid the amount of US $103,541.43 instead of the correct amount of US $100,155. The amount of US $103,541.43 was for another shipment to the plaintiff from Krishnapatnam, India to Shanghai[^5].

8       It was pleaded at \[17\] of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) that the plaintiff misrepresented to the defendant that the metal powder was of low quality. The defendant states at \[8\] of his Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No1) that the amount paid by the plaintiff was indeed US $100,155. At \[11\] of the same pleading, the defendant claimed that on 9 October 2019, he received a Wechat message from Bill Fu stating that the initial test results by Mr Bill Fu’s laboratory of samples taken by Customs officers showed that the quality was 21.1ppm and so Mr Fu proceeded to pay the US $100,155. As the SGS report showed different levels of gold and silver content, it was alleged that the defendant’s goods had been tampered prior to SGS’s testing. The basis for this allegation was that 15 containers seal numbers differed from the one on the B/L.

9       The defendant also pleaded discharge by frustration at \[19\] of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1). As for the inability to fulfil the terms of the CA, the defendant claimed that India underwent a lockdown due to the Covid pandemic. Hence, the defendant did not beach the contract and had delivered goods as contracted. Based on the defendant’s calculations, the goods were worth US $182,039.69. This was based on the dry weight of 280.605 metric tons and content of 21.1ppm as particularised at \[27\] of the same pleading. After deducting the plaintiff’s payment of US $100,155, the balance amount of the counterclaim was US$81,884.69 (US $182,039.69-US$100,155= US$81,884.69).

## Issues to be determined

10     The issues before the court were as follows:

> Issue 1- Was the defendant liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of US $100,155 or SG $142,220.10?

> Issue 2- Was the plaintiff liable to pay the defendant the sum of US$81,884.69 as per the counterclaim?

## Decision of the court

## Issue 1- Was the defendant liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of US $100,155 or SG $142,220.10?

11     I found that the plaintiff had proven its case that the defendant was liable to pay the sum as claimed as the SGS report clearly stated that both the gold and silver content in the metal powder were well below the levels as provided under the SPA. Therefore, I found that the defendant had breached the terms of the SPA.

12     The defendant took the position that there were mistakes in the CA and was therefore null and void. According to the plaintiff in its reply submissions, it was suing based on the SPA and not the CA. I agreed with the plaintiff’s reply submissions that the CA amounted to admissions that the defendant acknowledged that the shipment was below standard, the SGS report was accurate and that the defendant had breached the SPA. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff in its reply submissions, there would be no need for the CA if there was no breach.

13     I found that there was no false misrepresentation made by the plaintiff to the defendant. I agreed with the plaintiff’s closing submissions[^6] that the informal test report was a stop-gap preliminary report. I found that the SGS report was the definitive report stating the content levels of gold and silver content. SGS, which was the mutually agreed testing agent, had been paid by the defendant and the findings of the SGS report were undisputed. I found that the defendant had clearly accepted the findings of the SGS report and this was the reason why he agreed to enter into the CA. As the SGS report and the CA were contemporaneous documents, I found that the defendant knew that the metal powder he supplied to the plaintiff had failed to meet the contractual requirements and so he entered into the CA. In fact, he had admitted to entering into the CA at \[13\] of his AEIC[^7].

14     The defendant made allegations of tampering and claimed that different seal numbers and SGS report showing photographs of the goods under “Abnormal Condition” were examples or proof of such tampering. I found that the allegations of tampering of the defendant’s goods and the claim that the plaintiff had informed the defendant that the content was 21.1ppm were an afterthought designed to explain away the findings of the SGS report. The defendant had not substantiated such allegations other than attempting to produce the Wechat messages in Chinese[^8] which were inadmissible as they did not comply with O 92 r 1 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). Under this provision, every document if not in the English language must be accompanied by a translation certified by a court interpreter or a translation verified by the affidavit of a person to translate it before it may be received, filed or used in Court. I noted that the plaintiff had filed a notice of objection on this same point on 11 August 2021 and they had also rightly raised the same objection in court during the trial.

15     In \[19\] of the defendant’s AEIC [^9], the defendant made allegations of the plaintiff’s tampering of the metal powder with the assistance of some other individuals. In addition, the defendant counsel also suggested in court that as the plaintiff knew Customs officers, the plaintiff was therefore able to tamper with the metal powder. These were very serious allegations. I found these were far-fetched allegations that were unsubstantiated. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff’s counsel at the trial and at \[34\] of the plaintiff’s AEIC[^10], none of the defendant’s representatives had complained about tampering of the bags of metal powder or any improper collection of samples by SGS at the joint inspection held on 17 November 2019. I accepted the plaintiff’s explanation outlined in \[33\] of his AEIC[^11] that there were different seal numbers from those in the B/L as the Customs officials had opened the bags for their inspection and after doing so, they would re-seal using their own seal numbers again. This explanation was entirely plausible as it would be inconceivable that the Customs would leave the bags open and unsealed after their inspection.

16     I found that there was no discharge by frustration as pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleaded at \[18\] of his Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment no 1) that due to the Covid pandemic, the Indian government imposed travel restrictions and conditions of entry into India. Further, during cross-examination, the defendant’s evidence was that due to such measures imposed by the Indian government, it was not possible to send US $100,155 or US $103, 513.98 worth of goods to the plaintiff’s yard in Chennai, India. He informed Mr Bill Fu on 3 March 2020 that he could not perform the CA terms due to this reason.

17     I found that these were bare assertions without adequate proof. In \[24\] of the defendant’s AEIC, the defendant referred to and exhibited a purported Indian Government Advisory in early January 2020[^12]. I placed little or no weight on this advisory as it had no date of issuance and more importantly, referred to travel restrictions for visitors. It did not mention restrictions relating to shipment of commercial goods and the present suit related to shipment of commercial goods. In addition, Mr Bill Fu testified that he had workers already in his yard at Chennai who were working from January to at least April 2020 and the plaintiff was therefore in the position to accept shipments from the defendant if such shipments were made. Instead, this Court only had the defendant’s self-serving broad-brushed statements that the Covid pandemic prevented him from fulfilling the terms of the CA.

18     In short, I find that the defendant had breached the SPA and CA and was therefore liable to pay the sum claimed by the plaintiff as SG $142,220.10.

## Second issue- Was the plaintiff liable to pay the defendant the sum of US $81,884.69 as per the counterclaim?

19     Mr Bill Fu testified that as the metal powder did not meet the contractual requirements and was therefore worthless, the powder was disposed of by having them used for land reclamation. Mr Fu further testified that he was not paid for the disposal of the powder. But in court, Mr Fu did concede that he did random sampling before the SGS did their test and deemed the value to be US $100,155 and hence, this amount was paid. Mr Fu qualified his evidence that the random sampling was not truly indicative of the actual content as the random sampling was for a small amount of powder.

20     The defendant on the other hand insisted that the powder was worth something and claimed that it was 21.1 ppm so the powder was therefore worth US $182,039.69. At \[27\] of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1), the defendant particularised his counterclaim as US$182,039.69 based on 21.1 ppm gold content.

21     I found that the defendant had not proven his counterclaim. I agreed with the plaintiff that the random sampling cannot be used as an indication of the worth of the entire shipment of metal powder. In my view, the fact that the defendant engaged SGS to conduct a more thorough testing of the entire shipment was acknowledgement by both parties that reliance would be placed on SGS’s assessment. The plaintiff had also agreed to SGS testing of the powder and hence the SGS report was furnished to him. Therefore, by conduct of parties, I find that it would be the SGS report that would be the definitive gauge of the content of the gold and silver in the metal powder.

22     The defendant also agreed during cross-examination that should the content of silver and gold fall below the contractual levels stated in the SPA, there was no need for the plaintiff to pay and that the contract would have been breached.

23     Having found that there was no tampering and that the content of the gold and silver in the metal powder was of the quantity as certified in SGS report, it followed that the defendant’s counterclaim was accordingly dismissed. The counterclaim was premised on a higher content of 21.1 ppm as alleged by the defendant instead of 6.52ppm (for gold) and 23ppm (for silver) as stated in the SGS report.

24     I agreed with the plaintiff’s closing submissions[^13] relating to the counterclaim. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff, the counterclaim was premised on a higher gold content based on the informal test report which had not been translated into English as required under O 92 r 1 of the Rules of Court and was therefore inadmissible as evidence. Further, as I had found that the definitive measurements were those stated in the SGS report, I had therefore rejected the measurements in the informal test report.

## Conclusion

25     For the above reasons, I allowed the plaintiff’s claim and dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.
