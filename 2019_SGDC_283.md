### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

1       The Accused claimed trial to one charge of personating a public servant, an offence punishable under section 170 Penal Code. The charge reads as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.42%"> <col width="73.58%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge no</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Details</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-911665-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">that you, on the 3rd day of March 2017, at or about 10pm, at 181 Kitchener Road, “Parkroyal On Kitchener Road”, Room 609, Singapore 208533, Singapore, did pretend to hold an office as a public servant, to wit, an immigration officer, knowing that you do not hold such office, and in such assumed character did do an act under colour of such office, to wit, by searching the belongings of one Ruhi Qureshi and questioning the said Ruhi Qureshi as an immigration officer, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 170 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

2       At the end of the trial, the Accused was found guilty and convicted. He was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment. The Accused is appealing against his conviction and sentence.

## Case for Defence

3       Essentially, the defence was one of denial to the charge. The Accused claimed that he never impersonated as an immigration officer. It was alleged that the victim fabricated the case against him. It was submitted that Ruhi Qureshi (“the victim”) had a reason to lie against the Accused. Besides giving evidence in his own defence, the Accused also called upon Dr Christopher Cheok from IMH to testify for the Defence.

## Case for Prosecution

4       The Prosecution called seven witnesses including rebuttal witnesses in support of its case. The Prosecution’s case centred mainly on the evidence of the victim, Ruhi Qureshi, a female Indian who came to Singapore on a social visit pass on 2 March 2017. On the day in question and at the material time, the incident took place at Parkroyal, Kitchener Road, Singapore (“the hotel”).

## Summary of the Evidence for the Prosecution

5       The victim arrived in Singapore on 2 March 2017 to provide commercial sexual services at the hotel to repay the debt incurred by her family in India. Her return flight back to India was to be on 13 March 2017.

6       The victim was managed by an agent by the name of Arvind whom she never met personally. The agent arranged the clients for her. They corresponded via the WhatsApp chat. The immoral earnings would be shared between them.

7       The Accused was not the victim’s first customer. She only met him on the night of 3 March 2017 at the hotel room where the alleged offence was committed by the Accused who represented himself to be an immigration officer. The Accused searched the belongings of the victim and questioned her.

8       Before the Accused left the hotel room in the morning of 4 March 2017, he told the victim, that he will come back to check on her and warned her not to have customers, otherwise she would be in trouble. The victim felt unsafe. She took steps to block off the phone calls from the Accused. She also requested the hotel to change her room to avoid seeing the Accused. The victim did not report the alleged incident to the police as she was prostituting during the material time.

9       Despite having his phone number “blacklisted”, the Accused managed to get through to the victim by calling her on the hotel’s landline. This was in the morning of 12 March 2017.

10     On 12 March 2017, the Police responded to a “999” call made on that day at about 1.24pm. The caller (identity unknown) informed the Police that “there is an agent and a very young Indian girl inside the room. The agent is forcing her into prostitution. My friend came across her and she told him.” See First Information Report (the “FIR”) marked P1. The incident location was reported to be at 181 Kitchener Road, Parkroyal On Kitchener Road.

11     On arrival at the incident location on 12 March 2017, the police officers were brought up to the hotel guest room where they interviewed the victim. The victim admitted that she was prostituting. The Police also set up a mousetrap operation to apprehend the agent that was alleged to have forced the victim into prostitution. However, the agent did not show up. The victim, on the other hand, was placed under arrest for prostitution. She was brought back to the Police Station for investigation. The Police could not establish any proof of the victim being forced into prostitution as alleged in the FIR. There were no messages exchanged between the agent and the victim noted on the latter’s mobile phone. Moreover, the victim herself denied she was being forced into prostitution – contrary to the FIR. Instead, the investigation disclosed an offence committed by the Accused. On 14 March 2017, the victim was released from the police custody.

12     Upon further investigation on 12 March 2017, the identity of the FIR was established to be the Accused. The Police was able to establish the identity of the FIR caller as the Accused called again on 12 March 2017 to the 999-call centre disclosing his name and telephone number. This was discovered by the IO, ASP Lee Ting Wei (PW5) not when he was at the hotel.

13     On 13 November 2017 at the Police Cantonment Complex, the Accused was placed under arrest for an offence of personating a public officer under section 170 Penal Code. The arrest report was identified to be exhibit P6.

14     Tan Tze Keong Alan (PW4), a forensic examiner, examined and extracted the data from the Accused’s IPhone 6S Plus (the “cell phone”) which was seized by the Police on 13 March 2017 at the Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore.

15     ASP Lee Ting Wei (PW5) viewed the extracted data and prepared a summary of the files extracted that were related to the case (WhatsApp messages, call logs and internet history) as shown in exhibit P2, Annexures A, B and C.

16     The first time PW5 met the Accused was at the Police Cantonment Complex on 13 November 2017, which was also when PW5 seized one Murdoch University student card (exhibit P3) from the Accused. See exhibit P3.

17     P2, Annex A contained a series of WhatsApp messages from 12 to 13 March 2017 between the Accused and the alleged agent. The agent was denoted by the word “Ria” while the Accused was denoted by the word “Ry”. There were no messages prior to 12 March 2017 as these had been deleted by the Accused.

18     P2, Annex B showed incoming calls and outgoing calls recorded on the cell phone from 7:18pm, 3 March 2017 to 4:16pm, 12 March 2017.

19     P2, Annex C showed the internet history of the websites visited via the Accused’s cell phone. The search terms used were also stated. These searches were made on 3 March 2017 from 9:30pm until 9:34pm.

20     Exhibit P4 was an extraction report that contained the timeline of events that was logged in the cell phone. The period of information was from 3 March 2017 at 7:12pm to 4 March 2017 at 1:38am.

## Submissions of the Parties

21     The Defence contended that the case for the Prosecution rested solely on the evidence of the victim. It was submitted that the victim’s testimony was not “unusually convincing”. It was also claimed that the victim had concocted the allegation that the Accused had identified himself as an immigration officer. It was submitted that she was motivated to lie as she had an axe to grind against the Accused for causing her to be arrested.

22     Counsel also highlighted that the Accused had bipolar disorder and was suffering from a major depressive episode during the material time in March 2017.

23     On the other hand, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused has failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. It was contended that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecution submitted that the victim was a credible witness and her allegations were corroborated by contemporaneous evidence. The Prosecution also contended the Accused was an untruthful witness and that the alleged motive for the victim to lie was an afterthought.

## The law on section 170 Penal Code

24     In _Sivakumar s/o Selvarajah v PP <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 17</span>_ at \[49\] to \[51\], the Court of Appeal discussed the elements of the offence under section 170 Penal Code. The present case falls under the first element of section 170. The court held at \[53\] that “_obviously, pretension can come in various forms. Express words would be the most obvious situation. To the extent that the Judge seemed to think that express words were a necessary requirement, we do not agree. One can feign to be a police officer even without expressly uttering or saying so. For example, a conviction under section 170 was also recorded against an accused who flashed a card with the words “Tanglin Police” on it and said that he worked in a police station: see PP v Christopher s/o M P Nathan <span class="citation">\[2000\] SGHC 43</span>. In our view, the context and the words used and/or the actions of the alleged offender would be crucial. It would be foolhardy for any court to lay down hard and fast rules as to what words or actions would be sufficient to constitute pretension as a police officer. Ultimately, the court must be satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the totality of the evidence adduced, that the accused had pretended to be a police officer and under colour of that pretension proceeded to do an act or attempted to do the act. \[54\] Furthermore, we would add that, if someone merely says that he is a police officer and does nothing beyond that pretension, no offence under section 170 would have been committed as he would not have done any act, or attempted to do any such act, pursuant to that pretension. Both the first and second elements of the offence under section 170 must be made out. But if a person, who is not a police officer, says to another person that he is a police officer and then proceeds to demand to see the ID of that other person, the offence under section 170 would have been committed. A case in point is Sarjit Singh Rapati v PP <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 638</span> where the accused falsely represented to be an “immigration officer” and demanded to inspect the work permit of his victim who worked in a restaurant. His conviction was upheld on appeal. What we would underscore is that section 170 does not impose any stricter requirement of proof going beyond demonstrating that the accused has pretended that he is a public servant and pursuant to that pretension proceeded to do an act. \[55\] As regards the second element under section 170 of “does or attempts to do any act under colour of such office” (see \[50(a)(ii)\] above), the act done or attempted to be done by the accused need not be an act which that public servant (that the accused pretended to be) could legally have done.”_

## Evaluation of the Evidence

25     Bearing in mind the principles enunciated by the Court in _Sivakumar’s case_, _supra_, I proceeded to evaluate the evidence presented before me. Having considered the whole case and the submissions of the parties, for reasons stated below, I found the Accused to be not a credible witness.

26     There was no dispute that the victim arrived in Singapore on 2 March 2017. She was on a social visit pass. On arrival, she checked into the hotel to provide sexual services for money to repay a loan taken to cover her mother’s medical expenses incurred in India.

27     It was not denied that the Accused was not an immigration officer.

28     It was also common ground that one Arvind (“the agent”) facilitated the provision of sexual services by the victim. The victim communicated with the agent via WhatsApp. The victim’s cell phone number was XXX that was used to communicate with the Accused via his cell phone number XXX.

29     The agent arranged for the victim to meet the Accused at the hotel on 3 March 2017. The agent used the phone number XXX to communicate with the Accused.

30     It was not denied that the Accused did visit the victim at the hotel on 3 March 2017 and had sex with the victim. The Accused left the hotel in the early hours of 4 March 2017.

31     Having observed the victim in court and considering all the circumstances, I was of the view that she was a credible witness and her evidence was “unusually convincing”. This will be elaborated below.

32     I also made the following findings sated below.

33     As stated earlier, the agent had arranged for the Accused to meet the victim at the hotel on 3 March 2017. Based on P2, Annex A, the Accused would have been at the hotel and met the victim at about 10:04pm on 3 March 2017.

34     I accepted the following evidence of the victim. I found that she would charge $200-$500 for her sexual services. I found that the victim had at least one customer before she met the Accused on 3 March 2017.

35     On 3 March 2017, the victim met the Accused as arranged by her agent at level 6 of the hotel and brought him to her room. The Accused had brought along a bottle of wine. After entering the room, the Accused handed her sheets of paper to read. The paper purportedly provided information about the regulations for residing in Singapore and the law in Singapore. There was also information about the provision of sexual services. The victim felt scared as she had come here to earn immoral earnings. Moreover, the Accused mentioned that she could be in trouble for this. The Accused also mentioned that he was an immigration officer when he handed the sheets of paper to her. She believed in his false representation. The Accused took her mobile phone and looked into her WhatsApp chat. He also took her passport, visa and flight ticket. He asked and she told him about her background. She also explained to him why she was providing sexual services. Given this backdrop, it was natural that she would cry, as she was scared that she could be arrested. They then left the room as the Accused wanted to smoke. Upon their return to the hotel room, the Accused mentioned to her “I can save you from getting into trouble if you make me happy”. He added that “what services you are providing, provide me with that and I can save you from getting in trouble”. The victim understood this to mean the provision of sexual services to him. I did not doubt that this prompted the victim to ask the Accused to verify his identity as an immigration officer. Accordingly, the Accused took a card (exhibit P3) from his wallet and holding it with his finger at the side for the victim to take a glance. The card was not given to the victim. It was not denied that exhibit P3 was seized by the Police from the Accused. The victim was not familiar with the immigration logo. She could see his face and name. They ended having sex.

36     The Accused then left the hotel the following morning on 4 March 2017. Before he left, he warned the victim not to receive any customers and that he will check on her.

37     After the Accused had left, the victim blocked off his phone number and called the hotel reception to change room to avoid him.

38     The victim also disclosed to her agent about the incident and that the Accused did not pay for the sexual service.

39     I had no reason to doubt that the victim did not want to report the incident to the Police as she was prostituting. I believed her evidence that her agent or anyone did not force her into prostitution and that she never informed the Accused that she needed to be rescued.

40     Despite the victim’s efforts to avoid the Accused, the latter managed to contact her via the hotel’s phone line on 12 March 2017. After the calls, the Accused came to the new guest room that the victim was staying. However, the victim did not allow the Accused to come in. Instead, she called the reception for help and a security person came. Subsequently, the police arrived.

41     The Police came in response to the FIR (exhibit P1). The Police interviewed the victim. At that time, she did not inform the Police about the Accused. The Police also did not mention about the Accused. The Police took away her mobile phone.

42     The victim was arrested and brought to the Police Station. She was held in custody until 14 March 2017. At the Police Station, she was told that the Accused called the Police that she was providing sexual services in the hotel. She left Singapore on 27 March 2017. After returning to India, the victim deleted all her WhatsApp messages from her mobile phone.

## Credibility of the victim PW3

43     The Defence subjected the victim to intensive cross-examination. Despite this, I found her credibility was not shaken. I found the victim to be steadfast and was forthcoming in giving her evidence. I found her evidence to be internally and externally consistent. Having observed her demeanour and considered both the internal and external consistencies , I was of the view that the victim was a reliable witness. Her testimony of changing rooms to avoid the Accused was corroborated by the hotel’s user activity log (exhibit P7). After her first encounter with the Accused, she became fearful of the Accused.

44     PW5’s evidence was also consistent with the victim’s evidence that she was not paid by the Accused for her sexual services. The victim’s testimony about a card shown to her was consistent with exhibit P3 seized by PW5.

45     In these circumstances, I found that the victim did not fabricate with her agent to fix up the Accused by alleging that the Accused pretended to be an immigration officer.

46     Counsel attempted to cast doubt on the victim’s testimony by reference to the evidence given in relation to P3. The Defence submitted that anyone looking at P3 would be able to see the words “Murdoch University”. However, the victim testified that she did not see. The victim explained that her focus was to see whether it was the Accused’s ID as he mentioned his name was Brian Reddy. She wanted to see the name to verify his ID. Moreover, she also said it was not that she cannot see “Murdoch University” but she did not get the time to see that. She was only given a chance to glance. It was not handed over to her. She was also in a state of fear. In such circumstances, I believed she was not given the time to take a closer look at P3 and hence no opportunity to see “Murdoch University”. Nevertheless, she could read his name and see his face. See pages 32 to 33 of Day 2 transcripts dated 15 January 2019. It must also be highlighted that it was a fact that at the material time the Accused had with him exhibit P3 that was seized by PW5. The victim would not have known of P3 if it was not shown to her. This would fortify the credibility of the victim when she mentioned about the Accused showing her P3 for verification as to his identity.

47     Next counsel submitted that the victim concocted the allegation that the Accused identified himself as an immigration officer. The Defence alleged that the victim only informed the police about the impersonation as immigration officer after her arrest on 12 March 2017 because she thought that the Accused had called the police to arrest her on 12 March 2017. With due respect, I rejected this submission. The alleged motive of the victim for framing the Accused was inconsistent with the Accused’s allegation that the victim had asked him for help to get away from the clutches of the syndicate. Indeed, as submitted by the Prosecution, the victim should be grateful and not angry since the Accused claimed that she asked for help.

48     I found that the Accused did claim to be an immigration officer when he handed sheets of paper about the law in Singapore. This was corroborated by the fact that before meeting the victim, the Accused did google searches using the search terms “immigration officer” card, immigration officer identification and various permutation of these terms. He also had with him exhibit P3. I rejected his evidence that he did the internet searches because someone questioned him while he on his way to meet the victim. This explanation was illogical given the fact that it was a past event. Why was he concerned about someone checking on him? If so, why he did not lodge a formal complaint? Why was there such curiosity? Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the “only explanation for the searches is the one that corroborates the victim’s account _i.e_. the accused had intended to pretend to be an immigration officer.”

49     The Defence highlighted that the victim had left out the part about the Accused calling the agent that he was going to walk out of the hotel room as the victim was not the girl advertised on the website as a “fair skinned” female. With respect, I was of the view that this was not material and was irrelevant.

50     I also rejected the submission that the evidence that the victim was scared and her mobile phone was switched off and on airplane mode was inconsistent with her allegation that the Accused searched through her mobile phone. I found no good reason to reject the victim’s evidence that the Accused indeed had searched through her WhatsApp chat on her phone.

51     Counsel appeared to doubt that the Accused had sex with the victim for two to three times on 3 March 2017. This was purportedly because the Accused was said to have premature ejaculation arising from the side effects of taking the drug Sertraline (antidepressant). With respect, this allegation was not bore out by the evidence. There was no evidence produced to show that the Accused was on medications around the time of the incident. In fact, from 1 January 2017 to 17 March 2017, Dr Christopher Cheok (DW2) confirmed that from the National Health Records, there was no medications prescribed to the Accused.

52     Next, counsel claimed that the evidence of the victim that the Accused did not pay her a cent was contradicted by the evidence of PW1 and PW2 that the victim told them she was paid $200. I agreed with the Prosecution that from the evidence of PW1 (24 January 2019 transcripts, at page 90, lines 28-32, page 10 lines 1-21), “it is clear that the issue of payment was being asked to and answered by the victim generally, without reference to anyone as the identity of the FIR caller had not been established when the police were at the scene. In the same vein, the victim did not state who she had received the S$200 from. All we have from the victim is her evidence that she gets paid S$200-S$250 for a single session and that she **had seen another client before she met the accused**.” (Emphasis added). See \[48\] of the Prosecution’s written submissions. Similarly based on the evidence of PW2 recorded on 24 January 2019 transcripts, page 36, lines 24-32, page 37 lines 1-7, I also agreed that the victim had not told PW2 that she was paid $200 by the Accused. I found that the victim consistently maintained in court that she had not received a single penny from the Accused. The fact that the Accused had made a withdrawal of $700 was a neutral factor. The withdrawal of the money can be for other purposes including buying wine but not for paying for sexual services. I was of the view that the victim was not fabricating evidence as contended by counsel.

53     Counsel also took issue that the victim took a long time to open the hotel room door to the police officers. Counsel even said that the victim could have deleted all her messages with her agent from her phone during this period. In my view, this was mere speculation. Given the fact that the victim was a commercial sex worker and her encounter with the Accused on 3 March 2017, I think it was natural that the victim must exercise caution before allowing strangers even though in uniform to come in.

54     Counsel also pointed that the agent at item 416 of Annex A of P2 texted the message to the Accused “you are immigration officer”. This was on 12 March 2017 at 4:36pm. By this time, the police had arrived at the hotel and had met up with the victim. This would be before 3pm. See 24 January 2017 transcripts at page 41, lines 4 – 24. This fortified the victim’s evidence that the Accused claimed that he was an immigration officer.

## Credibility of the Accused

55     I found the Accused to be an unreliable witness not worthy of credit. His testimony contained many inconsistencies. Accordingly, I rejected his defence.

56     Firstly, when cross-examined on Annex C of P2 on why he did internet searches relating to “immigration officer” and “police officer” identification “pass” and “card” before meeting the victim, the Accused did not give consistent and coherent explanations. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the Accused gave five different reasons. See \[56\] and \[57\] of the Prosecution’s submissions.

57     Next, the Accused claimed that the victim told him that she was forced into prostitution. He was concerned for her and wanted to help her. However, this was not borne out by his own evidence. If he was indeed concerned, why did he have sex with the victim knowing that she was forced into prostitution? He was also not able to give a cogent explanation as to why he did not try to get help from the Police as soon as possible but waited until 12 March 2017 to report to the Police about the alleged forced prostitution. If the victim had asked him for help why would she “blacklisted” his calls? In fact, the victim did not pick up his calls made on 7 March 2017. She also had to change her room to avoid him. There was also no good reason for him to remain anonymous when he made the FIR call to the Police on 12 March 2017.

58     The Accused claimed that he tried to gather information on the pimp before going to the Police. However, as pointed out by the Prosecution, this was not supported by the contemporaneous evidence. See \[63\] of the Prosecution’s submissions. His allegation that PW5 had told him that all his deleted messages to the pimp could be extracted was not put to PW5.

59     The evidence of Mohd Sufian (PW6), the former manager of the hotel, also illustrated the unreliability of the Accused’s evidence. It was not disputed that PW6 escorted the Accused out from the corridor of the victim’s room on 11 March 2017. During their encounter, the Accused told him that he was from the police, which was not true. He could have mentioned that he was there to help the victim but he did not.

60     The Accused claimed that he was suffering from bipolar disorder and major depression and was on medications in March 2017. He claimed that his mental condition was largely caused by his relationship with his wife and that both wanted a divorce. However, exhibit P4 (the extraction report of the Accused’s phone) revealed that both of them wanted to be together and the message sent by the wife in the early morning of 4 March 2017 was very loving in nature. He also did not disclose to PW5 when asked if he was suffering from any medical condition on 13 March 2017 at the time of signing the consent form for the polygraph test. It was only disclosed by his lawyer to PW5 on 24 March 2017. There were also no relevant medical records produced to show that the Accused was consulting a doctor for his bipolar disorder and major depression or that he was on medications around the time of the incident. In fact, DW2 testified that based on the records, there were no medications prescribed to the Accused from January to 17 March 2017. DW2 also said that there was “no contributory link” between the Accused’s mental illness and his alleged offence. The medical records produced by the Accused were either post-dated the offence or predated it by about 2 years. In these circumstances, I found that the Accused has exaggerated his medical conditions.

61     It was highlighted by the Prosecution in the written submissions at \[85\] – \[87\], that there was also another instance of the Accused lying in court. I agreed. In this regard, I can do no better than to reproduce the material paragraphs from the Prosecution’s submissions:

![]([2019] SGDC 0283_Image/[2019] SGDC 0283_image1.png)

62     It was clear to me that the Accused was lying and was untruthful. It cannot be that on one instance, the Accused acknowledged the statements were voluntarily given and then during re-examination to allege that there was some form of high-handedness from various IOs.

63     Having considered all the circumstances, I therefore found that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of the Accused both internally and externally. He was clearly not a credible witness and I accorded no weight to his testimony.

## Guilty and Convicted

64     Having reviewed the evidence and considered the submissions of the parties I found that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused did pretend to be an immigration officer and in such assumed character searched the victim’s belongings and questioned her. Accordingly, the Accused was found guilty and convicted on the charge.

## Antecedents

65     The Accused did not dispute that he was also known as Balaji Varatharaju. The Accused admitted to his foreign antecedents tendered by the Prosecution. The Accused has been sentenced to imprisonment in Australia for various offences including obtaining benefit by deception and knowingly uttered a forged document in June 2010. In July 2010, he was jailed for 4 months for making a false declaration. The Accused’s foreign antecedents can be a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate sentence. See _Fricker Oliver v PP <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 84</span>_ at \[19\].

## Address on Sentence

66     The Prosecution referred to the case of _Sivakumar s/o Selvarajah v PP, supra_, and submitted for an imprisonment term of 8 months. In the case of Sivakumar, _supra_, the offender was convicted of impersonating as a police officer, an offence under section 170 Penal Code. The offender was sentenced to an imprisonment term of six months. Prosecution submitted that an uplift of 2 months was warranted in view of the Accused’s antecedents and to give weight to the element of deterrence.

## Mitigation

67     Counsel tendered a written mitigation plea on behalf of the Accused. In short, counsel submitted for a fine to be imposed.

68     Much of the mitigation plea was devoted to highlighting his academic progression, career and family circumstances. His wife was expected to deliver on 29 November 2019. It is trite that such circumstances, unless exceptional, are of little or no mitigating value.

69     Counsel also submitted that the Accused was at the material time facing marital problem and chanced upon the advertisement for sexual services.

70     The Accused claimed that he was currently being treated for his bipolar disorder with a depressive episode. The Defence contended that the Accused had a relapse and a bipolar depressive episode at the material time of the offence on 3 March 2017. A medical report dated 6 May 2018 from Winslow Clinic was annexed to the mitigation plea. A significant part of it was reproduced in the mitigation plea.

71     The Defence has also called upon Dr Christopher Cheok (DW2), a Senior Consultant from IMH to give evidence on the Accused’s behalf during the trial. Dr Cheok has prepared a forensic psychiatric evaluation report regarding the Accused’s mental condition. See exhibit D7. In the report, Dr Cheok stated that although the Accused has bipolar disorder with a major depressive episode, but there was no contributory link to the alleged offence committed by the Accused. In his evidence in court, Dr Cheok repeatedly stated that the bipolar disorder was not so severe that impacted the Accused’s judgment. See Day 5 Transcripts at page 99 line 21 to page 100 line 5. Dr Cheok supported his opinion based on the facts stated at Day 5 page 100, lines 16-22.

72     At page 98, line 15 to line 20, of Day 5 Transcripts, Dr Cheok expressly stated that he did not agree with Dr Leong’s opinion stated at exhibit D8I and annexed to the mitigation plea except the opinion that the Accused has bipolar disorder with a depressive episode from February to May 2017. Dr Cheok disagreed with Dr Leong’s analysis of the impact or severity of his diagnosis on the Accused.

73     As to the effect of drinking, Dr Cheok was clear that there might be some impact solely from intoxication but not from the mental illness.

74     Having seen the report from Winslow Clinic (exhibit D8I) annexed to the mitigation plea and the evidence of Dr Cheok who was in court to give evidence and cross-examined, I accepted Dr Cheok’s evidence and found the medical condition of the Accused did not have an impact on his judgment on the day he committed the offence. I also accepted Dr Cheok’s evidence that there was no contributory link to the offence committed by the Accused.

75     With respect, I found the reasons for the calls to the Police on 12 March 2017 were speculative and irrelevant.

76     Counsel also submitted that there was undue delay on the part of the Prosecution. With respect to counsel, I did not agree that there was undue delay on the part of Prosecution. I agreed with the Prosecution that time was needed to obtain the foreign antecedents and the fact that the Accused had another name.

## Sentencing Considerations

77     I agreed with the Prosecution that main sentencing consideration in this case was one of general and specific deterrence.

78     The penalty prescribed for an offence under section 170 of the Penal Code could be imprisonment for up to two years, or be fined or both.

79     In the case of _Sivakumar, supra_, at \[73\], the Court highlighted that “w (W)hether a fine or imprisonment is appropriate would depend essentially on the nature of the act done under colour of the office. If the act was innocuous, then a fine would be appropriate. However, if there were aggravating circumstances, for example, the consequences of the act were serious to the victim or where a vulnerable victim was taken advantage of, a custodial sentence would be justified.”

80     In the present case, the Accused impersonated as an immigration officer to avoid payment for the sexual services provided by the victim. It was not an innocuous act. He had taken advantage of the victim, a foreigner and vulnerable victim. His impersonation had also tarnished the image of our Immigration Officer.

81     Given the Accused’s antecedents and the circumstances of the case, a deterrent sentence was warranted, both generally and specifically. The Accused committed the offence within a short time while he was in Singapore and after he had served a period of imprisonment in Australia.

## Conclusion

82     In the circumstances, I was of the view that custodial threshold was crossed. In my judgment, considering the factors stated above, an imprisonment term of 7 months was appropriate to reflect the Accused’s culpability. The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
