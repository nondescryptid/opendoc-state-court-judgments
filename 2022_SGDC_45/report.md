### District Judge Koo Zhi Xuan:

## Introduction

1       Chow Chee Kin (“the Accused”), pleaded guilty to the following two charges under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”):

> (a)      DAC-903482-2020 (“the s 64 offence”): you, on the 30th of November 2019, at or about 4.37 am, along Geylang Road towards Kallang Road, Singapore, when driving motor car SLF8998U, in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, by driving against the flow of traffic on Lane 2 of 5 of Geylang Road towards Kallang Road, from the junction with Lorong 15 Geylang until the junction with Lorong 17 Geylang Road, and in so doing caused two vehicles to slow down, manoeuvre and switch to lane 3 in order to avoid a head-on collision with you, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 64(1) punishable under Section 64(2C)(c) read with Section 64(2C)(a) and Section 64(2D)(i) of the Road Traffic Act, (cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed); and

> (b)      DAC-903481-2020 (“the s 67 offence”): you, on the 30th of November 2019, at or about 4.37 am, along Geylang Road towards Kallang Road, when driving motor car SLF8998U did have so much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your breath, to wit, not less than 92 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 67(1)(b) and punishable under Section 67(1) read with Section 67(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

2       On 15 February 2022, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

> (a)      For the s 64 offence: 4 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification order for a period of 42 months with effect from the Accused’s date of release;

> (b)      For the s 67 offence: $8,000 fine (in default 20 days’ imprisonment) and a disqualification order for a period of 48 months with effect from 15 February 2022;

> (c)     The disqualification orders are to run concurrently.

3       On the same day, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence. I therefore ordered a stay of execution and granted the Accused bail pending appeal. These grounds of decision supersede the oral judgment delivered to parties on 15 February 2022.

## Facts and Procedural History

### The Statement of Facts

4       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification on 11 December 2020:

> 1.    The accused is Chow Chee Kin, a 46-year-old male Singaporean ... He was the driver of motor vehicle SLF 8998U (“the car”) at the material time.

> 2.    The complainant is Staff Sergeant Muhammad Naufal (“SSgt Naufal”), attached to the Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre.

> 3.    On 30th November 2019 at about 4.37am, the accused was driving the car with a few of his friends seated within. He exited Lorong 15 Geylang by turning left into Geylang Road (towards Kallang Road), and drove against the flow of traffic on lane 2 (out of 5 lanes). He drove along Geylang Road for about 30 seconds in that direction, at a slow speed. During that time, two vehicles which were travelling in the forward direction along lane 2 of Geylang Road had to slow down, manoeuvre and switch to lane 3 in order to avoid a head-on collision with the accused. The accused then turned into Lorong 17 Geylang. The above events were captured on POLCAM CCTV.

> 4.    At the material time, SSgt Naufal and his partner were on duty in the vicinity and spotted the accused driving against the flow of traffic. SSgt Naufal stopped the accused. The accused was observed to reek strongly of alcohol, and he had an unsteady gait, flushed face, bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. SSgt Naufal administered a breathalyzer test on the accused, and the result showed that the accused had failed the test. The accused was arrested and escorted to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters.

> 5.    Thereat, the Breath Evidential Analyser (“BEA”) test was performed on him that day at about 6.15am. The test revealed that the proportion of alcohol in the accused’s breath was 92 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. Prior to being arrested, the accused had drunk alcohol before driving the car. He thus knew that he was under the influence of alcohol when he drove the car at the material time.

> 6.    At the material time, the traffic flow was moderate, and visibility was clear.

> 7.    By virtue of the foregoing:

>> a.    The accused drove the car in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstance of the case, by driving against the flow of traffic on lane 2 of 5 of Geylang Road towards Kallang Road, from the junction with Lorong 15 Geylang until the junction with Lorong 17 Geylang Road. He has thereby committed an offence under s 64(1) punishable under s 64(2C)(_a_) read with s 64(2D)(_i_) of the Road Traffic Act, (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”). In addition, as the accused is a serious offender under s 64(8) RTA, he is liable to additional punishment under s 64(2C)(_c_) RTA.

>> b.    The accused drove the car with so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath exceeds the prescribed limit. He has thereby committed an offence under s 67(1)(_b_) punishable under s 67(1) read with s 67(2)(_a_) of the RTA.

### Antecedents

5       The Accused is untraced.

### The psychiatric reports

6       After the Accused pleaded guilty on 11 December 2020, the Prosecution indicated that it was not objecting to the Defence’s position to call for a mandatory treatment order report (“MTO Suitability Report”) under s 339(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). This was in light of a private psychiatric report dated 4 June 2020 (“Dr Ung’s Report”) tendered by the Defence, which was prepared by Dr Ken Ung Eng Kean (“Dr Ung”). Dr Ung’s Report had concluded that the Accused was suitable to be treated by a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”). I therefore ordered the Accused to attend at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for assessment to enable the MTO Suitability Report to be prepared, and for Dr Ung’s Report be submitted to the appointed psychiatrist to be taken into consideration.

7       Dr Ung’s Report, which was “predicated on the truthfulness and accuracy of the information given … by \[the Accused\] and his wife” (at \[7\]), stated that the Accused was “suffering from Persistent Depressive Disorder (“PDD”) and Alcohol Use Disorder (“AUD”)” (at \[32\]) at the time of the offences. The issue of whether there was a causal or contributory link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and the offences he had committed was addressed in Dr Ung’s Report as follows:

> **N**.     **Is there a causal/contributory link between \[the Accused’s\] psychiatric disorder(s) and the incident?**

> 33    There are 2 mechanisms in which \[PDD\] contributes to his charges.

> 33.1  The first is through the effects of Depression leading to poor judgment (decision-making) and increased impulsivity (i.e. deciding to drink with his friend after already drinking at a corporate event, decide to drink and drive).

> \[Extracts from academic sources were reproduced here to highlight that depressed patients “make bad decisions” and show “greater impulsivity”.\]

> 33.2  The second is the role of his depression on exacerbating his use of alcohol to cope with his insomnia and depressed mood. Scrutiny of his alcohol history, corroborated by his wife, showed a significant increase in his alcohol use after the loss of his job and ensuing depressing. Vulnerable individuals may tun to drugs/alcohol to relieve subjective distress and mental anguish as alcohol transiently improves symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety and depression (self-medication). The use of alcohol in an effort to ‘self-medicate’ distressing mood states such as depression is supported by current scientific literature.

> …

> 34    How significant the above 2 factors (which are related to his \[PDD\]) and whether it crosses the threshold of legal ‘causality’ is ultimately a legal determinant and the prerogative of the Court to decide.

8       The MTO Suitability Report, which was prepared by Dr Yeo Chen Kuan Derrick (“Dr Yeo”) from IMH on 18 January 2021, came to a different conclusion. While Dr Yeo agreed that the Accused was suffering from PDD and AUD, he opined that these conditions “did not have any contributory link to \[the Accused’s\] alleged offending behaviour” (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(d)\]). This was based on Dr Yeo’s observation that (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(d)\]):

> At the material time, despite \[the Accused’s AUD\] and PDD, the \[Accused\] was aware that drink driving was unlawful \[_sic_\] he was clearly cognizant of the nature of his actions and he had the volitional capacity to make a decision to engage in drink driving while making a calculated risk in assuming that he was within the legal limit of his blood alcohol level, based on his reasoning that ‘some time had passed between his last drink’ and his operating of a motor vehicle.

9       With regards to Dr Ung’s opinion of the link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and the commission of the offences (see above at \[7\]), Dr Yeo disagreed and commented that the material paragraphs in Dr Ung’s Report “appear to be hypothetical, generalized statements about the possible effects of mental disorders that did not result from a careful examination of whether it would apply to the particular offender (namely \[the Accused\]), in the context of his current offences in this particular case” (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(e)\]). Dr Yeo also submitted that the “association between depression and alcohol use does not impair the \[Accused’s\] ability to make appropriate decisions, such as choosing whether to operate a motor vehicle soon after his drinking, as he had in the past been able to consider alternatives such as taking a cab or getting his wife to fetch him” (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(g)\]).

10     Dr Yeo eventually recommended that the Accused “would not be a suitable candidate for a \[MTO\]”, and this was “primarily due to \[the\] lack of any significant contributory link of his mental disorders to the alleged offending behaviour” (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(j)\])).

11     In response to the MTO Suitability Report, the Defence filed a one-page response by Dr Ung dated 3 March 2021 (“Dr Ung’s Letter”) which asserted that Dr Ung “continue\[s\] to opine that the \[Accused’s\] disorder did contribute to his poor judgment and bad choices leading to the offences”.

### The Defence’s application for a Newton hearing to be convened

12     On 17 March 2021, the Defence filed an application for a Newton hearing to be convened “for clarifications with the IMH doctor on the MTO suitability report”.

13     At the hearing on 26 March 2021, the Defence submitted that a Newton hearing should be convened given the disagreement between Dr Ung and Dr Yeo on whether there was a causal or contributory link between the Accused’s mental conditions and his commission of the offences. The Defence sought to persuade the Court that Dr Yeo’s conclusion in the MTO Suitability Report was “illogical” given the conclusion reached by Dr Yeo that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions did not impair the Accused’s judgment at the material time when the offences were committed. In the Defence’s view, a Newton hearing should be convened for Dr Yeo to provide his comments in response to Dr Ung’s views.

14     In response, the Prosecution submitted that a Newton hearing should only be convened to seek clarifications from the appointed psychiatrist who had prepared a MTO suitability report under very limited circumstances. The Prosecution submitted that the circumstances in this case did not justify convening a Newton hearing. This is because of Dr Yeo’s “unambiguous conclusion” in the MTO Suitability Report that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions did not have any contributory link to his offending behaviour, and there was also nothing manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd in the MTO Suitability Report.

15     Upon considering parties’ submissions, I rejected the Defence’s application for a Newton hearing on 26 March 2021. The reasons for my decision on this issue are set out at \[24\] – \[31\] below.

16     Subsequently, the sentencing hearing for this matter was adjourned a number of times pending the outcome of the appeal in _Wu Zhi Yong v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 9865 of 2020), given the similarities of the charges faced by the offenders in both cases. On 19 November 2021, the High Court released its decision in _Wu Zhi Yong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 261</span> (“_WZY v PP_”), setting out the sentencing framework the courts should adopt when sentencing an offender who has driven recklessly or dangerously whilst under the influence of drink under the newly amended RTA (“the _WZY_ framework”). Further sentencing submissions were filed by parties thereafter to address the applicability of the _WZY_ framework to the present facts.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

17     The Prosecution submitted that the following sentences should be imposed in light of the _WZY_ framework:

> (a)     For the s 64 offence: four to five weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of between 36 to 42 months; and

> (b)     For the s 67 offence: Fine of $8,000 and a disqualification period of 48 months.

18     In relation to the s 64 offence, the Prosecution submitted that the present case fell within the lower end of Band 2 of the _WZY_ framework. This is because of the high alcohol level found in the Accused’s breath, and the potential harm caused by the Accused’s act of dangerous driving. In relation to the s 67 offence, the Prosecution relied on the framework laid down in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 224</span> (“_Rafael Voltaire Alzate_”), which sets out the sentences to be imposed for a drink driving offence under s 67 of the RTA based on the level of alcohol present in an offender’s breath (“_Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework”)_._

19     In relation to the weight the Court should place on the Accused’s psychiatric conditions as a mitigating factor, the Prosecution highlighted various shortcomings in Dr Ung’s Report, and submitted that the Court should prefer the opinions of Dr Yeo in the MTO Suitability Report instead. Given the conclusion reached in the MTO Suitability Report that there was no contributory link found between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and his commission of the offences, the Prosecution submitted that the Court should place little to no mitigating weight on the Accused’s psychiatric conditions.

## Mitigation

20     The Defence submitted that the overall culpability of the offender in _WZY v PP_ was higher than that of the Accused. In the Defence’s view, as there was no specific aggravating factor on the present facts save for the Accused’s high alcohol level, the s 64 offence should be pegged at the higher end of Band 1 under the _WZY_ framework. The Defence then submitted that the Court should take into consideration the Accused’s timeous plea of guilt, and the fact that he was suffering from PDD and AUD as mitigating factors, to moderate the punishment for the s 64 offence downwards to a fine between $2,000 and $15,000, together with a disqualification period of 2 to 3 years.

21     For the s 67 offence, the Defence’s position in its written submissions was aligned with that of the Prosecution, _ie_, that a fine of between $8,000 and $10,000 and a disqualification period of 48 to 60 months should be imposed, based on the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework_._

22     The Defence further submitted that if the Court was not minded to impose a substantial fine for the offences, the Court should consider imposing a combination of community-based sentences in lieu of imprisonment. The Defence submitted that a combination of a day reporting order and a community service order (“CSO”) would be appropriate, and requested that a CSO suitability report be called.

## Issues

23     The following issues arose for my consideration:

> (a)     Should the Court have convened a Newton hearing to clarify the views of the appointed psychiatrist in the MTO Suitability Report?

> (b)     What were the appropriate sentences to be imposed on the Accused for the s 64 offence and the s 67 offence in light of _WZY v PP_?

> (c)     Would the imposition of community-based sentences in lieu of an imprisonment term be appropriate?

## Issue 1: Whether the Court should have convened a Newton hearing

24     In considering the Defence’s application to convene a Newton hearing for clarifications to be made with the appointed psychiatrist of the MTO Suitability Report, these were the relevant legislative provisions under the CPC which I bore in mind:

> **Mandatory treatment orders**

> 339(3)    A court may make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender only if the report submitted by an appointed psychiatrist states that –

>> (_a_)    the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment

>> (_b_)    the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

>> (_c_)    the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence.

> (4)    A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender if the report submitted by the appointed psychiatrist states that he is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c).

> …

> (8)    Before making any report, the appointed psychiatrist shall take into consideration the report made by the psychiatrist engaged by the offender.

> (9)    Any report made by the appointed psychiatrist shall be taken to be final and conclusive as to the matters referred to in subsection (3)(_a_), (_b_) and (_c_).

25     In my understanding, section 339(9) of the CPC makes it clear that there are certain matters in the MTO Suitability Report which shall be taken as “final and conclusive”, so much so that ordinarily, on the substance of these matters, even the Court should not question or challenge the views of the appointed psychiatrist of the MTO Suitability Report. One of these matters is whether “the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence” (s 339(3)(_c_) of the CPC).

26     In its submissions before the Court, the Defence sought to rely on _Low Gek Hong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 69</span> (“_Low Gek Hong_”), a High Court decision which considered the issue of whether a Newton hearing should have been convened in relation to a MTO suitability report prepared by the appointed psychiatrist. In _Low Gek Hong_, the appointed psychiatrist in question had prepared a MTO suitability report stating that “there was no direct contributing relationship between \[the offender’s\] depression and her offences”, before recommending a MTO as “one of \[the offender’s\] sentencing options” (_Low Gek Hong_ at \[3\]). The appointed psychiatrist then prepared a supplementary report stating that the offender’s major depressive disorder “can be considered a contributing factor which could cause \[the offender\] to commit the offences” (_Low Gek Hong_ at \[4\]). Faced with these seemingly ambiguous or even contradictory opinions, the District Judge convened a Newton hearing for the appointed psychiatrist’s position to be clarified. At the appeal, the High Court held that the Newton hearing should _not_ have been convened because “if a psychiatrist does _not_ state clearly in his MTO report that any psychiatric condition _is_ ‘one of the contributing factors’ of the offending conduct in question (in the language of s 339(3)(_c_) of the CPC), then as far as the court is concerned it must mean that he has made _no_ such finding” (_Low Gek Hong_ at \[15\]).

27     In my view, _Low Gek Hong_ did not assist the Defence at all. _Low Gek Hong_ in fact stands for the proposition that a Newton hearing should ordinarily _not_ be convened to question the appointed psychiatrist of a MTO suitability report _unless in exceptional circumstances_. In _Low Gek Hong_, even though the appointed psychiatrist’s reports were not worded as clearly as they ought to have been, the High Court held that a Newton hearing should not have been convened in light of s 339(9) of the CPC, of which purpose is “precisely to avoid or at least minimise the possible protraction of the sentencing process with satellite litigation aimed at challenging or re-interpreting what the psychiatrist has stated, or not stated” (_Low Gek Hong_ at \[16\]).

28     The High Court did provide some exceptions to this general rule. Clarifications may have to be sought from the appointed psychiatrist (_Low Gek Hong_ at \[11\]) if:

> (a)     there are “obvious clerical or administrative” errors found in the MTO suitability report; or

> (b)     the MTO suitability report is “unclear and particularly where it draws manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions”.

29     In my view, none of the exceptions laid down in _Low Gek Hong_ could reasonably be said to apply on the present facts. At the hearing before me, the Defence could not identify any obvious error requiring clarification in the MTO Suitability Report. The MTO Suitability Report was neither unclear nor one which could be described to have drawn a manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusion. In contrast to the MTO suitability report in _Low Gek Hong_, the MTO Suitability Report in the present case was in fact absolutely clear that in Dr Yeo’s view, the Accused’s psychiatric conditions “did not have any contributory link to his alleged offending behavior” (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(d)\]) and a MTO was therefore not recommended. Dr Yeo’s _reasons_ for why he came to this view were also clearly set out in the MTO Suitability Report (see above at \[8\] – \[9\]). As such, Dr Yeo’s view on this matter was “final and conclusive” in accordance with s 339(9) of the CPC. There was therefore no basis for this Court to convene a Newton hearing to question or clarify matters with Dr Yeo, given the High Court’s holdings in _Low Gek Hong_.

30     Ultimately, the Defence appeared to have sought a Newton hearing because the preferred opinion of Dr Ung differed from that of Dr Yeo, in relation to whether the Accused’s psychiatric condition was a “contributing factor” for his commission of the offence. In my view, the presence of such disagreements is not a sufficient basis to convene a Newton hearing, in order to determine whether a MTO should be ordered. The possibility of such disagreements between psychiatrists is anticipated, and its resolution prescribed, in the relevant legislative provisions. This explains why under s 339(8) of the CPC, the appointed psychiatrist is obliged to “take into consideration the report made by the psychiatrist engaged by the offender”, which was duly done here. If there is subsequently a disagreement between the appointed psychiatrist and the privately engaged psychiatrist, as may sometimes occur, the appointed psychiatrist’s views on the matters referred to in subsection (3)(_a_), (_b_) and (_c_) are “final and conclusive”, in accordance with s 339(9) of the CPC.

31     For the foregoing reasons, I rejected the Defence’s request for a Newton hearing to be convened.

## Issue 2: The appropriate sentences for the s 64 offence and the s 67 offence

### The WZY Framework

32     In its seminal decision of _WZY v PP_, the High Court laid down the _WZY_ framework for the sentencing of offenders who have been charged under both s 67 of the RTA and s 64 of the RTA, provisions which were amended during the 2019 RTA amendments in Parliament. Given that the Accused was charged and convicted under both these amended provisions, it was not disputed that the _WZY_ framework is applicable to the present facts.

33     For the sentencing of a s 64 RTA offence punishable under s 64(2C)(_a_) RTA read with s 64(2C)(_c_) RTA, the High Court held that the courts should apply a modified “sentencing bands” approach. This approach consists of two steps:

> (a)     The first step involves identifying the band applicable to the offence and the indicative starting point with reference to that band, having regard to the offence-specific factors present. The appropriate sentencing bands were set out by the High Court as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.6%"> <col width="46.4%"> <col width="39%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases reflecting lower level of seriousness, with no offence-specific aggravating factors present or where they are present only to a limited extent.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender’s blood alcohol level is likely to be at the lowest or second lowest bands in the <em>Rafael Voltaire Alzate</em> sentencing framework.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">A fine of between $2,000 and $15,000 and/or up to one month’s imprisonment and a disqualification period of two to three years.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases reflecting higher level of seriousness and would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender’s level of culpability and blood alcohol level will typically both be on the higher side. Where an offender’s blood alcohol level is in the highest or second highest band in the <em>Rafael Voltaire Alzate</em> sentencing framework, the case is likely to fall at least within Band 2.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between one month’s and one year’s imprisonment and a disqualification period of three to four years.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Most serious cases of reckless or dangerous driving whilst under the influence of drink with multiple aggravating factors suggesting higher levels of culpability and higher alcohol levels.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between one year’s and two years’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of four to five years.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Having arrived at an indicative starting point under the first step, the second step involves the courts calibrating the sentence from that starting point by having regard to the offender-specific factors present.

34     For the sentencing of the s 67 RTA offence, the High Court reiterated that the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework should continue to apply. This framework provides the neutral starting points for a s 67 RTA offence where no harm to person or property has eventuated based on the level of alcohol in the offender’s body, as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.36%"> <col width="37.96%"> <col width="32.68%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of alcohol (μg per 100ml of breath)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of fines</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of disqualification</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36-54</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000 - $4,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24-30 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55-69</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$4,000 - $6,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30-36 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70-89</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000 - $8,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36-48 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">≥ 90</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$8,000 - $10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">48-60 months (or longer)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

35     The High Court then clarified that any sentence to be imposed on the offender under s 67 RTA should run concurrently with that under s 64 RTA, if custodial terms were to be imposed in respect of each of the offences. This is to avoid the problem of double counting. However, the High Court also opined that the sentencing court is not prevented from imposing a condign sentence for the s 64 RTA offence and, separately, a fine for the s 67 RTA offence, if appropriate.

36     I shall now explain how I had applied the _WZY_ framework to the facts of the present case, beginning with the s 64 offence.

### The appropriate sentence for the s 64 offence

#### Step 1 of the WZY framework: Identifying the appropriate sentencing band and indicative starting point

37     Under Step 1 of the _WZY_ framework, I agreed with the Prosecution that the s 64 offence in the present case fell within the lower end of Band 2 of the three bands laid down in _WZY v PP_ (see above at \[33(a)\]). This is because of the presence of the following offence-specific aggravating factors.

38     First, the alcohol level found in the Accused’s breath (92 μg per 100ml breath) was _very high_, falling within the highest band of the four bands laid down in the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework (see above at \[34\])_._ I considered this to be a highly aggravating factor given the High Court’s views in _WZY v PP_ that “the level of alcohol found in an offender’s blood or breath would be a key factor in determining the sentencing band in which a case is situated” (at \[37\]). I was also guided by the High Court’s reminder that “where an offender’s blood alcohol level is at the highest or second highest band of the framework in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_, the case is likely to fall _at least_ within Band 2” (_WZY v PP_ at \[42\]).

39     Second, there was in my view _serious potential harm_ involved in the Accused’s act of dangerous driving, which constituted a separate offence-specific aggravating factor. The Accused had driven against the flow of traffic at a major road comprising of 5 lanes which was known to be relatively bustling during the material time, and the actual volume of traffic was in fact of moderate nature. The very act of driving against the flow of traffic has been recognised as an “aggravating factor because of the increased danger to road users” (_Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin Suse_”) at \[27\]). Although the Accused was driving at a slow speed for a relatively short duration of time, the video footages tendered by the Prosecution and referred to in the SOF show that evasive action had to be taken by a number of road users to avoid a head-on collision with the Accused’s vehicle. Specifically, at least two vehicles had to slow down abruptly and/or swerve in between lanes in the middle of the road to avoid the Accused’s vehicle, when there were other vehicles behind and beside them which were travelling at a relatively fast speed. Even if the slow speed in which the Accused was travelling meant that a head-on collision with the Accused’s vehicle was not likely, serious potential harm could have resulted if the drivers of other vehicles who did not have sight of the Accused’s vehicle had collided into the vehicles which had slowed down abruptly or swerved in between lanes to avoid the Accused’s vehicle.

40     Furthermore, the Accused was not driving alone. He was ferrying his friends in his vehicle despite his high level of alcohol intoxication, which was evidenced by his “unsteady gait, flushed face, bloodshot eyes and slurred speech” when apprehended (SOF at \[4\]). He could have endangered the lives of all of his friends. The video footages also show two police officers who were on patrol hastily dashing from one end of the road to the other (_ie_, across 5 lanes) in order to apprehend the Accused, causing more vehicles to stop in the middle of the road. When I considered all of these facts in totality, I was of the view that as a result of the Accused’s act of dangerous driving, even if for a short duration of time, “the potential harm occasioned to road users \[at the material time\] would have been serious” (_WZY v PP_ at \[36(a)\]).

41     Given the presence of these two offence-specific aggravating factors, I came to the conclusion that the s 64 offence fell minimally within the lower end of Band 2 of the _WZY v PP_ framework, similar to the accused in _WZY v PP_. Even though the Accused in the present case had not attempted to evade arrest, I agreed with the Prosecution that this factor is sufficiently counterbalanced by the fact that the Accused’s alcohol level was approximately twice of that of the offender in _WZY v PP_. Ultimately, no good reason was offered by the Defence as to why the s 64 offence should not fall within Band 2 as a starting point under step 1 of the _WZY_ framework.

42     For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the starting point of 5 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate under Step 1 of the _WZY_ framework for the s 64 offence. This would be at the lower end of Band 2, considering that the Accused had driven dangerously only for a short duration, and no personal injury or property damage was caused. I did not think the starting point should be at the _lowest end_ of Band 2 (_ie_, 4 weeks’ imprisonment) because of the very high alcohol level found in the Accused’s breath. In my view, a starting point of 4 weeks’ imprisonment would have been more appropriate if the Accused’s alcohol level had fallen within the second highest band in the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework (_ie_, 70-89 μg per 100ml breath), all other things being equal. Given that the Accused’s alcohol level was in fact 92 μg per 100ml breath, _ie_, within the highest band in the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework, an uplift of the starting point to 5 weeks’ imprisonment was in my view warranted.

#### Step 2 of the WZY framework: Calibrating the sentence based on offender-specific factors

43     I now turn to Step 2 of the _WZY_ framework and consider the thrust of the Defence’s submissions, which was that given the presence of offender-specific mitigating factors, the sentence for the s 64 offence should be moderated downwards to a high fine.

44     I considered and accepted that the Accused had shown genuine remorse by pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity. This was a valid mitigating factor. However, the weight of this mitigating factor was not particularly strong, as the Accused’s actions were caught on video footage. He was also almost immediately apprehended by the police officers on patrol, with the Breath Evidential Analyser (“BEA”) test performed on him shortly thereafter.

45     The central issue in dispute under step 2 of the analysis was the amount of mitigating weight the Court should attach to the Accused’s psychiatric conditions. Even if the Accused was suffering from certain psychiatric disorders at the time of the offence, this should be treated as a weighty mitigating factor only if there was a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and his commission of the offences (_Ng So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 178</span> at \[58\] and _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1294</span> (“_Jordon Lim_”) at \[45\]). While Dr Yeo and Dr Ung both agreed that the Accused was suffering from PDD at the material time, they disagreed on whether the Accused’s PDD had a causal connection with the offences. The Court therefore had to take a view on the weight to be placed on Dr Ung’s Report, with regards to the alleged causal link between the Accused’s PDD and his commission of the offences.

46     In a number of recent decisions, the Court of Appeal and the High Court have held that a psychiatrist who prepares a report of an accused person’s psychiatric conditions meant for the court’s consideration “owe a duty to the court to ensure that their evidence is reliable and fit for court use” (_Miya Manik v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 2 SLR 1169</span> (“_Miya Manik_”) at \[55\]). From this general principle, the following practical standards have been derived:

> (a)     The psychiatrist should ensure that his report is not simply predicated entirely on the truthfulness of the information the accused person has provided, without any independent information to verify the veracity or accuracy of the narrative provided by the accused person (_Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span> (“_Wong Tian Jun De Beers_”) at \[21\]). It is not open to the psychiatrist to simply include a caveat that the report is predicated on the truthfulness of the accused person’s account (_Wong Tian Jun De Beers_ at \[24\]).

> (b)     The psychiatrist must provide the reasoning behind his conclusions, for a report that merely states the conclusions without reasons which cannot be probed or evaluated is useless and prone to be rejected (_Public Prosecutor v Chia Kee Chen and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 249</span> at \[118\]).

47     If a psychiatrist report is unable to meet these standards, the courts should not hesitate to altogether reject and place no weight on it (_Wong Tian Jun De Beers_ at \[19\] and \[28\]).

48     Having considered both sets of psychiatric reports carefully, I agreed with the Prosecution that Dr Ung’s Report failed to meet the aforementioned standards and was therefore unreliable and unhelpful. The reasons for why I came to this view are set out as follows.

49     First, Dr Ung’s Report appeared to be based entirely on the Accused’s account and the account provided by the Accused’s wife. There was a distinct lack of objectivity in Dr Ung’s Report as it did not appear to have been prepared with reference to any objective evidence. It was not clear from Dr Ung’s Report, for example, whether he had even seen or considered the charge sheets setting out the Accused’s offences. The following sentence produced in Dr Ung’s Report (at \[9\]) was particularly telling: “Although I did not have sight of the actual \[BEA\] test result, \[the Accused\] told me that his tested blood alcohol level was 92mg/DL”. A lack of regard in obtaining independent information pertaining to an accused person’s offences is problematic as it reveals a cavalier attitude towards establishing the factual premises upon which a psychiatric opinion is based.

50     The factual unreliability of Dr Ung’s Report is buttressed when one considers the erroneous factual claim made in the critical portion of the report dealing with whether there was a causal link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and the offences committed. At para 33.1 of Dr Ung’s Report (see above at \[7\]), Dr Ung opined that the Accused’s PDD had led to the Accused’s “increased impulsivity” in “deciding to drink with his friend after already drinking at a corporate event”. This was however factually erroneous, as the Defence’s own mitigation plea clarified that the Accused did _not_ drink with the friends he had met at a restaurant at Geylang Road _after_ he had attended and drunk at a corporate event at a colleague’s condominium in Seng Kang earlier in the evening.

51     Second, there was nothing in Dr Ung’s Report which shows that Dr Ung had carefully inquired into the _mental state_ of the Accused _at the material time_ in choosing to drive despite having drunk alcohol. It was thus unexplained how Dr Ung came to the conclusion that it was indeed the Accused’s “poor judgment ... and increased impulsivity” _from his PDD_ which contributed to the Accused’s commission of the offences. The _reasoning_ required in a psychiatrist report for the Court to probe or evaluate the claim that the Accused’s PDD had a causal link to his commission of the offences was wholly absent in Dr Ung’s Report. It was manifestly inadequate for Dr Ung to simply provide extracts from academic sources making “hypothetical, generalised statements” that depressed patients make bad decisions and show greater impulsivity (see above at \[7\]). The logical leap from the general proposition that depressed patients make bad decisions and show greater impulsivity to the particular claim that the Accused’s PDD had contributed to him deciding to drink and drive was never bridged in Dr Ung’s Report.

52     The standard required of a psychiatrist to articulate the reasons for his conclusion was further and more egregiously breached in Dr Ung’s Letter (see above at \[11\]), which was dated 3 March 2021. By this time, both the SOF and the MTO Suitability Report would have been available for Dr Ung’s perusal. Despite the shortcomings highlighted of Dr Ung’s Report in the MTO Suitability Report, Dr Ung’s Letter was merely one page long, in which Dr Ung once again simply asserted, without explanation, that he continued to “opine that the \[Accused’s PDD\] did contribute to his poor judgment and bad choices leading to the offences” (Dr Ung’s Letter at \[4\]). Dr Ung’s continued reliance on such unreasoned assertions ultimately convinced me that Dr Ung’s Report and Dr Ung’s Letter “could not, even with the utmost charity, be viewed as … expert report\[s\]” (_Miya Manik_ at \[41\]). I therefore placed _no weight_ on the conclusion reached in Dr Ung’s Report that the Accused’s PDD had contributed to his commission of the offences.

53     In contrast, the MTO Suitability Report prepared by Dr Yeo was far more detailed and reasoned. Various sources of information (including the charge sheets and the SOF) were considered by Dr Yeo. More importantly, the MTO Suitability Report contained a forensic analysis into the circumstances surrounding the Accused’s decision to drink and drive at the material time (MTO Suitability Report at \[14\] – \[18\]), before reaching the conclusion that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions did not have any contributory link to his commission of the offences (MTO Suitability Report at \[19(d)\]). Further reasons supporting this conclusion were also included in the MTO Suitability Report, and these reasons have been set out at \[8\] – \[9\] above.

54     In the circumstances, there was no basis for this Court to accept that the Accused’s PDD had any causal link at all to his commission of the offences such that the clear need for deterrence in the present case should be displaced for rehabilitation to be brought to the fore (_Jordon Lim_ at \[45\]). Accordingly, I saw no justification to moderate the punishment of the s 64 offence downwards from an imprisonment term of 5 weeks to that of a high fine, as suggested by the Defence. In my view, doing so would clearly go against the High Court’s holding in _WZY v PP_ that fines for such offences are only reserved for situations falling “at the lowest end of Band 1” (_WZY v PP_ at \[45\]). The present s 64 offence simply did not fall at the lowest end of Band 1.

55     Given that the only valid mitigating factor is the Accused’s early plea of guilt, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence for the s 64 offence should be 4 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of 42 months with effect from the Accused’s release from imprisonment. As the MTO Suitability Report had stated (at \[19(k)\]) that “\[should\] the \[Accused\] be incarcerated, \[it is recommended for the Accused\] to be followed up closely by prison psychiatric services so as to prevent decompensation of the \[Accused’s PDD\]”, I gave directions for the MTO Suitability Report to be sent to Prisons, for Prisons’ information and/or treatment of the Accused as may be deemed necessary or appropriate during his time in incarceration.

### The appropriate sentence for the s 67 offence

56     For the s 67 offence, it was initially not disputed by parties that under the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework, a fine of between $8,000 and $10,000 and a DQ period of 48 to 60 months would be appropriate given the Accused’s alcohol level. The pertinent issue here was whether the Court should impose a nominal imprisonment term for the s 67 offence, even though such a sentence would not have been justified under the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework, simply so that the nominal imprisonment term could be run concurrently with the imprisonment sentence imposed for the s 64 offence.

57     At the hearing on 4 February 2022, I raised the concern that if I were to apply the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework in determining the sentence for the s 67 offence and impose a fine, whilst imposing an imprisonment sentence for the s 64 offence, this would be the result of the Accused’s level of alcohol intoxication being considered twice. This is because the degree in which an accused person is intoxicated necessarily features as a key factor in _both_ the sentencing analyses for a s 64 offence under the _WZY_ framework and also a s 67 offence under the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework. I also highlighted to parties that under the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework, fines would ordinarily be imposed for a s 67 offence, as an imprisonment sentence is usually meted out to a first-time drink-driving offender only if his alcohol intoxication level was exceptionally high and/or he had caused property damage or hurt whilst driving under the influence of drink (“aggravated drink-driving offender”). I shared that this would lead to a seemingly odd situation where an aggravated drink-driving offender who was also guilty of dangerous driving under s 64 RTA would face a practically inconsequential imprisonment term for the s 67 offence (as it would run concurrently with the imprisonment sentence for the s 64 offence), while a driver like the Accused with a lower culpability would have to suffer _both_ an imprisonment term under the s 64 offence and also pay a high fine under the s 67 offence.

58     In response, the Prosecution submitted that this issue was already considered by Menon CJ in _WZY v PP_, who had come to the provisional view that the concerns of double counting “do not prevent a court from imposing a condign sentence for the offence under s 64 and, separately, a _fine_ for the offence under s 67, where that is considered appropriate” (_WZY v PP_ at \[65\]). Furthermore, in dismissing the appeal, Menon CJ also expressed that the offender in _WZY v PP_ “would have faced a higher sentence of imprisonment and possibly also a fine for the offence under s 67” (_WZY v PP_ at \[73\]). In the Prosecution’s view, this meant that the High Court had resolved that there was nothing wrong in law for the courts to impose an imprisonment sentence for the s 64 offence and a separate fine for the s 67 offence.

59     The Defence on the other hand highlighted that the overriding principle must be that accused persons in such a situation should not be disproportionately punished, and articulated the position during oral submissions that imposing both an imprisonment term and a fine on the Accused in the present case could amount to double counting and disproportionate punishment.

60     While there were credible arguments raised on both sides of this issue, on balance, I eventually came to the conclusion that there exist stronger grounds for the Court to impose a fine for the s 67 offence when warranted under the _Rafael Voltaire Alzcate_ sentencing framework, as compared to the option of imposing a nominal imprisonment sentence simply for it to run concurrently with the imprisonment sentence for the s 64 offence. The reasons for my views are set out as follows.

61     First, I considered the primacy of parliamentary intent. When Parliament passed the amendments to the RTA in 2019, it was clear from the language of the text that the Prosecution would have to “charge an offender for, and proceed on, _both_ offences under ss 64 and 67 in order for the \[enhanced\] penalty provision \[under s 64(2C)(_c_)\] to apply” (_WZY v PP_ at \[57\]). This is because of how the newly amended s 64 RTA is structured, as s 64(8) RTA defines a “serious offender” under s 64(2C)(_c_) RTA to mean “an offender who is _convicted_ of an offence under section 67…_in relation to the offender’s driving_” (emphasis added). I considered that these were amendments which were passed in Parliament with the High Court decision of _Edwin Suse_ in 2013 in the backdrop, a decision which had established a sentencing framework (which had been consistently applied over a few years prior to the 2019 RTA amendments) in which first-time offenders of a s 67 offence would ordinarily be punished with fines if no hurt or property damage was caused. While Parliament had increased the maximum punishments for a s 67 offence, there was no indication from the parliamentary debates that the starting position of a fine was no longer appropriate for most first-time offenders of a s 67 offence. As such, I was of the view that Parliament in passing the RTA amendments could be said to have _implicitly_ accepted the possibility of an offender being punished _via_ both a fine and imprisonment term under a s 67 and s 64 respectively, notwithstanding the fact that both offences when paired together would necessarily engage “an identical or largely overlapping set of facts” (_WZY v PP_ at \[56\]), as in the present case. In my view, this meant that Parliament did not find objectionable the possibility that the accused’s level of alcohol intoxication would have to be considered twice by the sentencing court, when s 64(2C)(_c_) RTA is engaged. While the effect of such double counting may be addressed by the imposition of concurrent imprisonment sentences at the sentencing stage, this option is simply not available when the sentences imposed constitute an imprisonment sentence and a fine.

62     Second, the imposition of a nominal imprisonment sentence for the s 67 offence just so that it can be run concurrently is questionable in principle. The High Court in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (“_Anne Gan_”) at \[19\] has stressed that sentencing for multiple offences comprises two analytically distinct steps which are to be taken _in sequence_ – the court must determine the appropriate individual sentence in respect of each charge _first_ before it determines the overall sentence to be imposed by taking into account the totality principle. Artificially imposing a nominal imprisonment sentence – when a fine would have been warranted – for the s 67 offence runs the risk of the sentencing court not being able to ensure “consistency in outcomes and transparency in reasoning” (_Anne Gan_ at \[22\]) for s 67 offences over time. Viewed through the lens of _Anne Gan_, I found it instructive that Menon CJ had proceeded to determine the sentence to be imposed on the offender in _WZY v PP_ for the s 67 offence by directly applying the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework, which led him to the view that “a fine of $3,000 … would have been appropriate” for the s 67 offence (_WZY v PP_ at \[68\]), even though Menon CJ was fully cognizant of the problems of double counting if consecutive imprisonment sentences were imposed (see _WZY v PP_ at \[55\] – \[64\]).

63     Third, I was of the view that the requirement of ordinal proportionality in sentencing could still be upheld even if an aggravated drink-driving offender (see above at \[57\]) ends up _not_ having to pay a fine for the s 67 offence but is allowed to serve a _concurrent_ imprisonment sentence instead. In my view, this result is tolerable because an aggravated drink-driving offender is likely to face a far lengthier imprisonment sentence for his s 64 offence (as his s 64 offence is likely to fall under high Band 2 or even Band 3 under the _WZY v PP_ framework). There is therefore nothing inherently unjust or disproportionate for an aggravated drink-driving offender to be punished with a much lengthier imprisonment term of, for example, one year, for the s 64 offence (with the shorter imprisonment term for the s 67 offence being run concurrently); while an offender of lower culpability such as the Accused punished with a significantly shorter imprisonment term for the s 64 offence (in this case, 4 weeks) _and_ a high fine under s 67 RTA. Both outcomes effectively signal the severity in which Parliament and the courts look upon the act of driving dangerously or recklessly whilst under the influence of drink. In the final analysis, I was satisfied that imposing a 4 weeks’ imprisonment sentence _and_ a high fine on the Accused in the present case could not be considered disproportionate or crushing.

64     For the foregoing reasons, I reached the conclusion that it was justifiable to impose a fine for the s 67 offence based on the _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ sentencing framework, even if an imprisonment sentenced was imposed on the s 64 offence. I therefore imposed the following sentence for the s 67 offence in the present case given the Accused’s level of alcohol intoxication (92 μg per 100ml breath): a fine of $8,000 (in default 20 days’ imprisonment) and a disqualification period of 48 months with effect from 15 February 2022.

## Issue 3: Whether community-based sentences would be appropriate

65     Having considered parties’ submissions on whether a community-based sentence (“CBS”) should be imposed on the Accused in lieu of an imprisonment term, I agreed with the Prosecution that a CBS was clearly not appropriate in the present case.

66     Given that the MTO Suitability Report had stated that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions did not have any contributory link to his commission of the offences, I was precluded from making a MTO as the requirement under s 339(3)(_c_) CPC was not met. The Defence did not appear to dispute this, subsequent to my decision on 26 March 2021 not to convene a Newton hearing.

67     I was of the view that the other forms of CBS suggested by the Defence were not appropriate in the present case given the _severity of the offences committed_ and the _strong public interest_ in deterring such offences. It has been held that a CBS is meant to target “offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: _ie_, regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions” (_Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span> (“_Ernest Sim_”) at \[33\]). The High Court has held that in every case, “the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender in question must be carefully scrutinised and evaluated to determine whether rehabilitation should be given prominence notwithstanding any countervailing need for deterrence, retribution or prevention”, when determining if a CBS is suitable (_Ernest Sim_ at \[40\]).

68     In the present case, the Accused was neither a young offender (_ie_, he was 45 years old when he had committed the offences) nor were his offences those which are “traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum”. The punishments for the Accused’s offences were statutorily enhanced just in 2019; with Parliament’s intention being explicitly stated to be “for offenders driving under influence to face stiffer penalties to signal the aggravated seriousness of their actions” (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, _Official Report_ (8 July 2019) vol 94 (Josephine Teo, Second Minister for Home Affairs). Given the Accused’s very high level of alcohol intoxication, coupled with his act of driving against the flow of traffic in a manner which I had found posed serious potential harm to other road users, I was of the view that the principles of general and specific deterrence ought to take precedence over rehabilitation in the present case to such an extent that a CBS would not be appropriate.

69     The Defence also did not tender any relevant precedent which would strongly suggest the appropriateness of a CBS on the present facts. While the Defence cited the decision in _Public Prosecutor v Hoon Qi Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 5</span> (“_Hoon_”) to highlight the point that a CBS may be appropriate even for relatively serious offences, I was of the view that _Hoon_ did not assist the Accused. This was because the nature of the offence and the profile of the offender in question in _Hoon_ were starkly dissimilar. _Hoon_ involved a 23 year old student who had pleaded guilty to one charge of insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2012 Rev Ed) by using his handphone to record a video clip of a woman easing herself in a toilet. The offender in _Hoon_ was diagnosed by an IMH psychiatrist to be suffering from PDD, and his condition was a “mild but existent contributing factor for his commission of the offence” (_Hoon_ at \[19\]). In contrast, the Accused was 45 years old when he committed the offences and had once held a relatively senior position in public service. Unlike the offender in _Hoon_, the IMH psychiatrist in this case also did not opine that there was a contributory link between the Accused’s psychiatric conditions and his offending behaviour. Without downplaying the seriousness of the offence committed by the offender in _Hoon_, I was of the view that the offences committed by the Accused in the present case were far more serious given the potential of causing serious personal injury (or even death) to other road users. An imprisonment sentence was clearly necessitated on the present facts to deter the highly irresponsible act of drinking and driving dangerously, for the safety of all road users. In the final analysis, I found the Accused’s offences “so serious that a community sentence \[would be\] disproportionately inadequate” (_Hoon_ at \[9\]).

70     For all of the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that a CBS would be clearly inappropriate and therefore rejected the Defence’s request for a CSO suitability report to be prepared.

## Conclusion

71     In conclusion, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:

> (a)      For the s 64 offence: 4 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification order for a period of 42 months with effect from the Accused’s date of release;

> (b)      For the s 67 offence: $8,000 fine (in default 20 days’ imprisonment) and a disqualification order for a period of 48 months with effect from 15 February 2022;
