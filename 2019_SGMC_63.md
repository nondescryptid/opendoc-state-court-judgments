### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

The accused person, Ong Tiong Yeow, male, aged 55, claimed trial and was convicted of 1 charge of committing affray under Section 267B of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. The details of the charge is as follows:

> i)     MAC-902993-2018 (C1B) – On the 31 day of July 2017, at or about 7.11 p.m., along Bukit Timah Road, Singapore, which is a public place, the accused did disturb the public peace by fighting with one Jiang Sasa (M/33), by punching each other.

2       He was sentenced to pay a fine of $3,000 and in default to serve 3 weeks imprisonment. The accused has appealed against the conviction and sentence. Jiang Sasa had pleaded guilty earlier to a similar charge and was sentenced to a fine of $3,000 with a default period of 3 weeks imprisonment.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The Prosecution called 4 witnesses to prove their case.

#### Jiang Sasa (Jiang), PW1 and Liu YuLing (Liu), PW2

4       The first witness, Jiang, was referred to a police report, P1, made by the accused on the 31 July 2017 at 7.11 pm in which he stated that Jiang had assaulted him and that the incident happened along Bukit Timah road by Kampong Java road. As to the background of what sparked off the incident, Jiang testified that on the evening of 31 July 2017 after picking up his 5 year old son from the hospital, together with his wife, Liu, and his mother in law, he drove to his home in his car, a Mazda 6, bearing licence plate SKR3083R. His wife sat next to him while his son and his mother in law sat at the back. His son was not feeling comfortable as he had been discharged after a 3 day stay in the hospital. He drove along Bukit Timah road and there were 2 lanes which merged into one lane. When they merged, he allowed a white car on his left to go through first and he drove behind the white car and the accused was driving behind him. At that point in time, the accused pressed his horn. When he looked at his rear view mirror he could see the accused’s car. He did not know why the accused pressed his horn which he did 4 to 5 times. His son reacted to the horning by crying.

5       When the accused kept horning at him, Jiang observed that there were a number of vehicles in front of him which were moving initially but they became stationary as the traffic was rather heavy. Both their cars were stationary and the accused continued to press his horn. He looked at his rear view mirror and noticed that the accused was pointing his middle finger at him. He alighted from his car and walked towards the accused’s car. He stood outside the accused’s car and asked him to wind down his window as he wanted to ask the accused what he wanted. Suddenly the accused, who remained seated inside his car, grabbed his shirt and pulled him towards his car forcefully. Jiang wanted to free himself and he pushed the accused away. When he was pushing the accused, the latter punched him on the right upper arm. Jiang responded by punching the accused twice on his right upper arm. He told the accused not to be rude and not to drive in a dangerous manner and he walked back to his car. The accused did not say anything to him. He estimated that the interaction between him and the accused lasted about 30 to 40 seconds.

6       Jiang had 2 cameras affixed to his car and the rear camera captured the incident. He handed the footage from this camera to the police on the date of the incident. When the footage was played in court, Jiang agreed that when he filtered into the single lane and ended in front of the accused’s car, the accused might have had to jam his brakes. The accused’s hand came out of the car 3 times. When he pushed the accused away, the latter hit his right upper arm. He sustained 2 scratches on his chest as a result of the encounter with the accused. Subsequently Jiang was charged for affray arising from the above incident and he pleaded guilty on 2 October 2018 and was sentenced to pay a fine of $3,000.

7       The next witness for the prosecution was Liu, Jiang’s wife. She sat next to him when he drove his car on the evening of 31 July 2017. She noticed the accused when she heard someone at their rear had pressed the horn of his car. She looked at the rear view mirror and saw him pointing his middle finger. He pressed his horn loudly about 4 to 5 times. She did not know why he did this. Her son was frightened and started to cry. She turned around to comfort her son who was seated next to his grandmother. Jiang was unhappy that their son was crying. He talked to him and comforted him. There was a change of traffic conditions and all vehicles came to a stop. Jiang alighted from his car and walked towards the accused’s car. He spoke to the accused. She did not see anything else as her son was still crying. The next time, she saw Jiang, he was still talking to the accused but his shirt was torn. When Jiang returned to his car, there were 2 scratches on his chest as shown in the photograph P3.

#### Inspector Goh Jian Hao Gerald(Insp Goh), PW3 and Senior Staff Sergeant Ling Wei Lian (SSgt Ling), PW4

8       Insp Goh recorded a statement from the accused in English on the 3 August 2017 at the Tanglin Police Station. The statement was given voluntarily by the accused and admitted as P4. He recorded whatever the accused wanted to say in relation to the case. P4 was read to the accused at the end of the recording session. In P4, the accused said he tried to punch Jiang but he did not manage to do so.

9       The investigating officer, SSgt Ling, was the last witness for the prosecution. On the 31 July 2017, Jiang and his wife gave the footage from their car camera to him at the Tanglin police station after he had recorded a statement from them. He took a photograph, P3, of the 2 scratches on Jiang’s chest. SSgt Ling recorded the cautioned statement, P5, from the accused on the 21 March 2018, which the accused gave voluntarily and he recorded whatever the accused wanted to say. In P5, the accused admitted that he grabbed Jiang’s shirt and Jiang retaliated by punching him several times.

## The Defence

10     The accused testified that he did not punch Jiang on the 31 July 2017. On that date he picked up his car from the workshop at Alexandra at about 6.40pm. While he was driving along Bukit Timah road, Jiang, who was on his left, cut into the lane in front of him dangerously and he almost collided onto the accused’s left passenger seat. The accused reacted by pressing his horn once. Jiang could not come in front of his car and came to the rear of the accused’s car. As both travelled along Kampong Java road, Jiang cut into his lane again and was successful in doing so after he allowed a white MPV to pass him. The accused pressed his horn again.

11     Thereafter, all the cars stopped at a traffic light. The accused felt annoyed with Jiang and showed him the middle finger. Jiang then alighted from his car and rushed towards his car. Jiang came to his car and shouted at him calling him a coward. The accused remained in his car and grabbed Jiang’s shirt and tore it. Jiang reacted by punching him repeatedly. The accused instinctively tried to block the punches. Jiang’s punches landed on the accused’s shoulder, upper arm, forearm and his eye. After that Jiang walked back to his car and drove off. The accused called the police and lost sight of Jiang’s car at the red light.

12     In cross-examination, the accused reiterated that he did not punch Jiang and that he had only grabbed and pulled his shirt. As for the honking the accused said that he did not do it multiple times as it was only twice.

## Decision

13     The accused has claimed trial to 1 charge of having disturbed the public peace by fighting in public with Jiang, PW1, on the 31 of July 2017 along Bukit Timah road by punching each other.

14     I shall begin with the undisputed facts. Arising from an encounter on the road involving the accused and Jiang on the evening of 31 July 2017 who were driving their respective cars, both cars were stationary when the traffic was heavy, with Jiang’s car in front of the accused’s car. Jiang’s version was that the accused had horned on multiple times for a reason which he did not know and the accused pointed his middle finger at him which the accused does not deny, as he was angry with Jiang. The accused said that, prior to the encounter, Jiang tried to cut into his lane twice. On the first occasion, Jiang was coming from his left and did so dangerously and almost collided onto his front left passenger side but was not able to do so successfully. On the second occasion, Jiang cut into his lane successfully and ended in front of him. While he admitted horning at Jiang, he maintained that he did so only twice.

15     It is also not in dispute that Jiang alighted from his car and went to the rear to speak to the accused. He approached the accused’s car and the accused wound down his window. They spoke to each other. The accused remained seated in his car and Jiang was standing outside his car. The accused grabbed Jiang’s shirt which tore and Jiang had 2 scratches on his chest. Jiang punched the accused, at least twice by his admission, while the accused claimed that it was 5 to 6 times. The accused’s hand came out of the car but he denied punching Jiang.

16     The accused appeared to have claimed trial to the charge of affray solely on account of his claim that he did not punch Jiang in that encounter. However, in cross-examination, when he was questioned as to whether he tried to pull Jiang again the accused said “ _because in the heat of a fight there’s a lot of arm swinging and….. all that so anything to do---it’s just a spontaneous reaction of a lot---a lot of arm swinging”[^1]._He eventually agreed that there was a fight between him and Jiang[^2].

17     I find that the evidence showed that there was a fight in public involving the accused and Jiang, on a public road, with heavy traffic which invariably would have disturbed the public peace. This is conceded too by the accused[^3]. While it was the case that Jiang was the person who alighted and went to confront the accused and he could not have been in the best of moods, given that the accused’s horning had affected his son badly as he cried, it was the accused who escalated it into a physical encounter when he suddenly grabbed Jiang towards him, with such significant force that Jiang’s shirt was torn[^4]. This is admitted by the accused as he stated in P4 voluntarily that “_Then I_ **_reached out first_**_, and pulled his shirt towards me towards me_…”[^5] (emphasis added).

18     When it was put to the accused that he had used physical violence first on Jiang, he agreed[^6]. The accused also agreed that Jiang was shocked when he was grabbed and his shirt was pulled[^7]. Jiang did sustain 2 scratches on his chest as shown in the photograph P3 taken by SSgt Ling at the police station. Where these injuries were concerned, the accused appeared to have conceded under cross-examination that in the course of grabbing Jiang’s shirt he had scratched him on his upper chest[^8].

19     From the CCTV footage that was tendered to the court, the act of the accused pulling Jiang towards his car forcefully can clearly be seen and it caused Jiang’s body to hit the car. Jiang used his right hand to push the accused back and his further acts of reacting by punching the accused multiple times can also be observed, which is not disputed by Jiang. While there was some disagreement as to the number of punches with Jiang trying to reduce the number and the accused trying to inflate, at the very least, there were multiple punches and the accused in P4 said “_and he(referring to Jiang) punched me 4 times_.”[^9] The accused’s hand can also be seen reaching out from his car towards Jiang in a punching motion at least 3 times but it cannot be ascertained with absolute certainty that the punches landed on Jiang, but they did appear clearly to be punches and whether or not they landed, does not mean that the accused did not punch Jiang. Jiang had described it as another attempt by the accused to grab him too. There was hence a physical encounter between the 2 of them after the grabbing of Jiang’s shirt by the accused . The accused did admit in P4 that he “_did try to punch back_.”[^10] I find that the entire episode can best be described as an exchange of punches between the accused and Jiang and that the accused had fought with Jiang in public, thus disturbing the peace.

## Conclusion

20     For all the above reasons, and based on the totality of the evidence and the findings which I have made earlier, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore found the accused guilty and convicted him on the charge of affray under section 267B of the Penal Code.

21     Upon his conviction, I was informed by the prosecution that the accused was a first offender. In their address on sentence, the prosecution highlighted the fact that the accused, unlike Jiang, did not plead guilty at the first available opportunity and was therefore not remorseful. While Jiang had been sentenced to a fine of $3,000 they submitted that a sum above $3,000 will be well justified. The accused did not say anything in mitigation.

22     In determining the appropriate sentence, I noted that the punishment under section 267B of the Penal Code Chapter 224 for the offence of affray is imprisonment for a period which may extend to 1 year or with a fine which may extend to $5,000 or both. For every offence of affray, there are 2 aspects. Firstly, it involves violence which is basically fighting in public and the second involves the disturbance of the public peace by the fighting in public, i.e. the public order aspect. An act of affray does not necessarily involve a direct, tangible harm such as injury. What is targeted by the offence is the disturbance of public peace.

23     Where the sentencing considerations are concerned, I referred to the commentary on Section 267B of the Penal Code by the authors of the “_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_” (3rd Edition) which is as follows:

> _The facts constituting the crime of affray may vary greatly. They may involve a fist-fight between two persons, or a group fight which falls just short of rioting. In assessing sentence, the court would consider the circumstances that led to the affray. A distinction will be drawn between a fight that is premeditated and one that is spontaneous. Other significant considerations would be the duration of the fight, the degree of violence, and the extent to which the public peace was broken. Thus, a brief scuffle between two individuals at a void deck with hardly anyone around is likely to attract a lesser punishment than a prolonged brawl between a group of men in a crowded coffeeshop.”_

24     Turning to the facts of this case, I agree with the prosecution that there are elements of road rage here. Arising from the encounter on the road between the accused and Jiang, the accused was angry with what he perceived to be the acts of Jiang in cutting into his lane dangerously. The accused has admitted that he initiated the first physical contact by grabbing Jiang so forcefully that Jiang’s body hit his car. Nevertheless, I find that Jiang is not totally blameless because he should not have alighted from his car in the first place to confront the accused on the road with heavy traffic. The accused, however, unlike Jiang, has not pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity but he is not to be penalised for claiming trial. While Jiang did have 2 scratches on his chest, these are relatively minor as he did not require medical attention. I was of the view that there was no reason to treat the accused differently from Jiang and that there were no significant aggravating factors to warrant a fine higher than what was imposed on Jiang i.e $3000.

25     All considered, I imposed a fine of $3,000 with a default period of 3 weeks imprisonment. The accused has paid the fine.
