The accused admitted to a further four charges and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC”).

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

3       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:-

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

**PP v. JIMMY TAN TECK HENG**

> **Parties**

> 1.    The accused is one Jimmy Tan Teck Heng, a 41-year-old male Singaporean bearing NRIC No: Sxxx5303B. At the material time, he was the driver of the vehicle bearing registration number SHD2200K (“**V2**”), which was registered under the company M/s Prime Car Rental & Taxi Services Pte Ltd (“**Prime Services**”).

> 2.    The accomplices are as follows:

>> a.    Ong Ka Li (“**Ong**”), also known as ‘Xiao Hei’, male / 61 years old, bearing NRIC No: Sxxx7257D. At the material time, Ong was the driver of the vehicle bearing registration number SLC4463M (“**V1**”). V1 was insured by QBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“**QBE**”).

>> b.    Choo Kok Seng (“**Choo”**), also known as ‘Eric’, male / 43 years old, bearing NRIC No: Sxxx1244D. At the material time, Choo was a passenger of V2.

> **First Information Report**

> 3.    The informant is one Assistant Superintendent Nick Lie of the Singapore Police Force (“**the Informant**”). On or around 12 September 2018, while conducting investigations into a separate case of motor insurance fraud (_vide_ A/20180502/7004), the Informant discovered that fraudulent insurance claims had been submitted in relation to a traffic accident on 30 June 2017 along Sembawang Road, Singapore between V1 and V2 (“**the Purported Accident**”). Police investigations led to thediscovery of the facts of this case.

> **Background Facts**

> 4.    Sometime before 30 June 2017, the accused was approached by Ong who asked him if he wanted to earn some extra money by participating in the Purported Accident. Ong informed the accused that the Purported Accident would be deliberately staged. Ong would intentionally ram his vehicle V1 into the rear of the accused’s taxi V2, thereby causing an intentional collision and damage to both vehicles. Ong also told the accused that he would be paid monies ranging from $200/- to $300/- for each individual that the accused recruited to be part of the staged accident.

> 5.    Sometime thereafter, the accused contacted Choo to ask if the latter was interested to participate in the Purported Accident. The accused told Choo that Choo would receive an insurance pay out for his role in the Purported Accident. Choo told the accused that he was interested, and that he would also get his wife, one Koh Bee Bee (“**Koh**”), to participate.

> 6.    Sometime before 12.00 pm on 30 June 2017, the accused drove V2 to Hougang, Singapore to pick up Choo and Koh. Choo then arranged for the accused to pick up one Henry Chew Pong Hwee (“**Henry**”), and Henry’s elderly parents, Chew Choong Hau (“**Chew**”) and Sim Soh Ngern (“**Sim**”), at Yishun, Singapore.

> 7.    At about 12.00 pm on 30 June 2017, the accused drove V2 along Sembawang Road, which was the arranged location for the Purported Accident. Choo, Koh, Henry, Chew and Sim were passengers in V2 (collectively “**the Passengers**”). The accused received a call from Ong, informing him that Ong was driving V1 directly behind V2, and that Ong would soon be colliding V1 into the rear of V2. The accused alerted the Passengers of the impending collision. Ong then rammed V1 into the rear of V2.

> 8.    After the accident, the accused and Ong alighted from their respective vehicles. Ong instructed the accused to take pictures of the damage caused to the vehicles. Ong also told the accused to delete the footage from the accused’s rear end in-car camera, as Ong did not wish to be identified in the video recording.

> **Facts pertaining to the 1st Charge (DAC-921976-2019)**

> 9.    Pursuant to the conspiracy, on 1 July 2017 at around 9.40 am, the accused submitted a false Singapore Accident Statement (“**SAS**”) reporting that he was driving V2 on 30 June 2017 at about 12.00 pm along Sembawang Road, when he was involved in a road traffic accident with V1.

> 10.    On 19 July 2017, M/s Prime Auto Claims Service Pte Ltd (“**Prime Auto**”), acting on behalf of Prime Services (the registered owner of V2), filed a Notice of Claim against QBE (insurer of V1), for property damage caused to V2 amounting to $7,973.92/- in respect of the Purported Accident. The accused’s false SAS was enclosed as a supporting document.

> 11    .Based on the accused’s false SAS and the supporting documents, QBE was deceived into believing that its insured vehicle V1 was indeed involved in the Purported Accident and that Prime Services’ claim was genuine. QBE was thereby dishonestly induced into processing and allowing Prime Services’ claim and ultimately delivered the sum of $7,973.92/- to Prime Auto on 4 August 2017 as full and final settlement towards Prime Services’ claim. QBE would not have done so had it not been so deceived.

> 12    By engaging in a conspiracy to commit an offence of cheating with Ong, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed.).

> **Facts pertaining to the 2nd Charge (DAC-921977-2019)**

> 13.    On 30 June 2017, on Ong’s instruction, the accused consulted with Yap Family Clinic & Surgery, located at Blk 232, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, and was attended to by Dr. Yap Thiam Koon. The accused lied to Dr. Yap that he had pain in his neck following the Purported Accident. The accused told Dr. Yap that he was the driver of a car that had been hit in the rear. Dr. Yap diagnosed the accused with acute whiplash injury of the neck, and provided the accused with a medical certificate dated 30 June 2017 stating that the accused was unfit for duty for two days.

> 14.    The accused then submitted the medical certificate and medical receipt to Ong for the purpose of submitting a fraudulent insurance claim for personal injury. Ong also instructed the accused to sign a Warrant-to-Act in favour of M/s Legal Options LLC (“**Legal Options LLC**”).

> 15    On 28 August 2017, solicitors from Legal Options LLC sent a letter of demand to QBE, stating that the accused had suffered injuries as the driver of V2 when the vehicle was hit in the rear by V1 (insured by QBE) on 30 June 2017. The letter of demand sought to claim $7,030.40/- in damages and fees. Attached with the letter of demand were the following documents:

>> a.    The false SAS lodged by the accused;

>> b.    A false police report lodged by Choo on 30 June 2017;

>> c.    The medical report dated 19 June 2017 in respect of the accused’s visit to Dr Yap and the medical certificate and receipt in relation to the medical consultation.

> 16.    The claim was not paid out.

> 17.    The accused had thus, on or before 30 June 2017, in Singapore, engaged in a conspiracy with Ong to cheat insurance companies and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, the accused submitted a false SAS and the above-mentioned documents (at paragraph \[15\]) to deceive QBE that SHD2200K driven by him was involved in a genuine accident, a fact which the accused knew to be false, to dishonestly induce QBE to pay the Third Party Bodily Injury Claim of $7,030.40, which offence was not committed in consequence of this abetment. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed.).

> **Facts pertaining to the 3rd Charge (DAC-921978-2019)**

> 18.    On 30 June 2017, on the instruction of the accused and Ong, Choo consulted with Yap Family Clinic & Surgery, located at Blk 232, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, and was attended to by Dr. Yap Thiam Koon. Choo lied to Dr. Yap that he had pain in his neck and right shoulder following the Purported Accident. Choo told Dr. Yap that he was the passenger of a car that was hit in the rear. Dr. Yap diagnosed Choo with acute whiplash injury of the neck with right shoulder strain, and provided Choo with a medical certificate dated 30 June 2017 stating that Choo was unfit for duty for two days.

> 19.    Sometime before the medical consultation, the accused had driven Choo to meet Ong at a coffee shop at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. Thereat, Ong instructed Choo to sign a Warrant-to-Act in favour of Legal Options LLC.

> 20.    On 28 August 2017, solicitors from Legal Options LLC sent a letter of demand to QBE, stating that Choo had suffered injuries as a passenger of V2 when the vehicle was hit in the rear by V1 (insured by QBE) on 30 June 2017. The letter of demand sought to claim $7,030.40/- in damages and fees. Attached with the letter of demand were the following documents:

>> a.    The false SAS lodged by the accused;

>> b.    A false police report lodged by Choo on 30 June 2017;

>> c.    The medical report dated 19 June 2017 in respect of the Choo’s visit to Dr Yap and the medical certificate and receipt in relation to the medical consultation.

> 21.    The claim was not paid out.

> 22.    The accused had thus, on or before 30 June 2017, in Singapore, engaged in a conspiracy with Ong and Choo to cheat insurance companies, and in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, Choo submitted a false SAS lodged by the accused and the above-mentioned documents (at paragraph \[20\]) to deceive QBE that SHD2200K was involved in the genuine accident, a fact which the accused knew to be false, to dishonestly induce QBE to pay the Third Party Bodily Injury Claim of $7,030.40/-, which offence was not committed in consequence of this abetment. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed.).

> **Conclusion**

> 23.    The accused has made no restitution to date.

## CONSIDERATION OF SENTENCE

4       The offences which the accused committed are serious offences which carry heavy prescribed penalties. The prescribed punishment for the first charge is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 10 years, and a liablity to a fine. For the second and third charges (where no payout was made), the maximum term of imprisonment is 30 months.

5       In cases which involve the staging of motor accidents to defraud insurance companies into paying out false claims, the pre-dominant sentencing principle would be general deterrence. Sentence imposed should deter the accused and like-minded offenders from committing such offences, which if left unchecked, would have an adverse impact on the motor insurance industry and consumers. While I accepted that there was no need for specific deterrence as the accused was a first offender, defence counsel’s contention[^1] that there would be no need for general deterrence was misconceived.

6       The prosecution sought a global sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment. It submitted for a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for the first charge and 4 months’ imprisonment for the second and third charges. This sentencing position was borne out by the precedents tendered involving motor insurance fraud:-

> (a)     In _PP v Lau Soon Kwan_ (MA 99111/2015/01), the offender who had provided his particulars for two fake accidents was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment when $7,110.00 was paid out. No restitution was made. His appeal was dismissed.

> (b)     In _PP v Chew Chiu Mong_ (DAC 907770/2016), the offender was a phantom passenger in a fake accident and had caused a payout of $7,059.00. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> (c)     For the charges where no payouts were made, the prosecution relied on three cases where 4 months’ imprisonment was imposed for cases involving fraudulent claims of $6,789.37, $6,996.40 and $3,060.00 which did not result in payouts.[^2]

7       The defence conceded that the prosecution’s sentencing was reasonable. It stated at \[5\] of the Plea-in-Mitigation:-

> We are gratified that the Prosecution’s indicated position on sentence for the three charges is within the usual sentencing benchmarks.

8       The defence reiterated this position at \[25\]:-

> We reiterate our appreciation that the sentences asked by the Prosecution is aligned with the usual sentencing benchmarks.

9       I was in agreement with the prosecution and defence that the sentence proposed by the prosecution was within the usual range of sentences for offences of this nature.

10     The defence however sought a lower sentence on the basis of purportedly good mitigating factors. It contended that 4 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for the first charge and 2 months’ imprisonment for the second and third charges, with a global sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment. In my view, sentence proposed by the defence was unrealistic, given the lack of good mitigating factors and the presence of aggravating factors. The precedents cited by defence counsel also did not support its sentencing position. For example, the defence had relied on _PP v Mohammad Shahrin bin Sutirman_ (DAC 941451-2015 & 6 ors). Although a 4-month term of imprisonment was imposed when the amount imvolved was $8,030.00, only a partial payout of $2,520 was made. By contrast, in the present case, there was a full payout on the fraudulent claim.

11     The accused’s personal and family circumstances such as his wife deserting him and leaving him to care for a young son, and his financial difficulties did not count as good mitigating factors. His claims that he had succumbed to temptation when the mastermind Ong Ka Li approached him, his acceptance of Ong Ka Li’s rationalization that this was not a true crime and his lack of knowledge of the details of the fraudulent claims were also not good mitigating factors. However, in calibrating sentence, I accepted that the accused was not the mastermind of the scheme.

12     In favour of the accused, I took into account his clean record, his co-operation with authorities and his early plea of guilt, which could be an indication of his remorse. However, his claim of remorse was not supported by any positive act of restitution. While he may not have received any part of the $7,973.92, this sum still represented the loss caused to the insurance company because of his offences.

13     Defence counsel claimed that the accused had a change of mind and instructed the law firm not to proceed further with his own spurious injury claim. Even if this were so, the offence had already been committed as a false claim had by then been lodged on his behalf. The fact that the accused did not receive a payout was already recognized in the charge, which carried a reduced prescribed penalty. While the accused may have had second thoughts about his own participation, he took no steps to report his own crime or the activities of Ong Ka Li and the others or prevent the payout of $7,973,92.

14     In considering sentence, several aggravating factors were present and taken into account. The accused was instrumental in helping Ong Ka Li expand his criminal enterprise. At the behest of Ong Ka Li, he recruited Choo Kok Seng (“Choo”) to participate in the crime, who in turn recruited his wife.[^3] The accused had also played an active role in gathering the participants in that he had conveyed them to the site of the staged accident. He had picked Choo and his wife up together with Henry Chew Pong Hwee and his parents.[^4] Apart from the offences he pleaded guilty to, four other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Although the charges arose from the same incident, each charge would increase the amount the insurance company was to be cheated of.

15     Having considered the mitigating and aggravating factors, there was no reason to depart from the usual range of sentence. I therefore sentenced the accused to 6 months’ imprisonment for the first charge and to 4 months’ imprisonment for the second and third charges. The individual sentences cannot be said to be manifestly excessive since both the prosecution and defence agreed that they were within the usual range of sentences.

16     In terms of the overall sentence, I agreed with the defence that the sentences in the first and second charges should run consecutively.[^5] The total sentence that the accused would serve would therefore be 10 months’ imprisonment. In my assessment, the total sentence was just and proportionate to the offences committed by the accused.
