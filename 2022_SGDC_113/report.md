Misuse of Drugs Act – Whether a second reading speech on the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill on 15 January 2019 where it was stated that drug abusers would be rehabilitated precluded prosecutions under s 33A

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9088/2022/01.\]

30 May 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by Mr Muhammad Akbar Khan bin Abdullah (“**the Accused**”) against my decision to convict him – after a trial – on a charge under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“**MDA**”). The charge alleged that on or before 21 February 2021 the Accused had consumed, without authorisation, Monoacetylmorphine (“**MAM**”), a specified drug listed in the MDA (“**LT2 Charge**”). The Accused denied having consumed MAM at all material times.

2       At the material time, the Accused was subject to an order issued under reg 15(2) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“**Regulations**”). The Accused was arrested at his flat unit on 21 February 2021 because he had failed to report to Bedok Police Division HQ for urine tests (as required under the Regulations) and was suspected to have consumed controlled drugs.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

## Grounds for conviction – Overview

3       In summary, I found that the Prosecution had proven the LT2 Charge beyond reasonable doubt based on the following:

> (a)     First, the Accused had admitted to having consumed heroin before his arrest. This admission is contained in an investigation statement recorded from him on 12 April 2021 (P12) (“**12 April Statement**”). I found the 12 April Statement to have been voluntarily given by him, despite his claims to the contrary.

> (b)     Second, the Accused’s urine samples (procured one day after his arrest) were found to contain MAM. Pursuant to s 22 of the MDA, the Accused is presumed to have consumed that drug. During the trial, the Accused had failed to rebut this presumption.

4       In convicting the Accused, I had also considered – and rejected – his claim that it was not appropriate to prosecute him on the LT2 Charge. This claim is based on (apparently) a second reading speech on the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill on 15 January 2019 where the Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam (“**the Minister**”) stated that drug abusers would be rehabilitated rather than be prosecuted.

## The 12 April Statement

5       I will now elaborate on each of the above, beginning with my decision on the 12 April Statement.

### The 12 April Statement was made voluntarily

#### Ancillary hearing

6       To prove its case on the LT2 Charge, the Prosecution had sought to admit the 12 April Statement. The Accused challenged the admission of this statement by alleging that it was not voluntarily given by him. Specifically, the Accused alleged that the following persons had separately promised that he would be referred to a drug rehabilitation centre (“**DRC**”) – instead of being prosecuted – if he were to admit to having consumed controlled drugs:

> (a)     Insp Qurratu Ain Binte Aminurrashid (PW13) (“**Insp Qurratu**”) – the recorder of the 12 April Statement, and

> (b)     SI Rick Koh (PW2) (“**SI Koh**”) – the Accused’s supervision officer.

7       Given the Accused’s allegations, an ancillary hearing was accordingly convened to determine whether the 12 April Statement was voluntarily given.

#### Insp Qurratu’s evidence

8       The first witness for the ancillary hearing was Insp Qurratu. During examination-in-chief, Insp Qurratu testified that the 12 April Statement was recorded from 10.45 am to 11.29 am.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Before she commenced recording the 12 April Statement, Insp Qurratu asked the Accused whether he was comfortable to provide a statement. After the Accused confirmed that he was, Insp Qurratu read to him his previous statement recorded on 22 February 2021 at Changi General Hospital (“**CGH**”) (P5). The Accused informed her that he did not have any corrections to make to that statement. Thereafter, Insp Qurratu showed the Accused two certificates issued by the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) and told him that his urine samples were found to contain MAM. Insp Qurratu then asked the Accused why this was so. She recorded the Accused’s response in the 12 April Statement. After she had completed recording the Accused’s statement, Insp Qurratu read it back to him. The Accused declined to make any amendment to the 12 April Statement. Thereafter, Insp Qurratu and the Accused appended their signatures to the statement. According to Insp Qurratu, the Accused was normal and calm during the statement recording.[^3]

9       During cross-examination, the Accused put to Insp Qurratu that she had promised to refer him to a DRC if he gave a “good statement” during the recording of the 12 April Statement. She denied. Insp Qurratu testified that she had spoken to the Accused about DRC before the statement recording started. This was however in the context of informing him about the possible outcomes to the investigations – namely, that he could _either_ be referred to a DRC _or_ be prosecuted in court. Insp Qurratu stressed that she did not have the power to refer the Accused to a DRC, and that such a decision could only be made by her senior management.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

#### SI Koh’s evidence

10     The second witness for the ancillary hearing was SI Koh. During examination-in-chief, SI Koh testified that he was not present at Bedok Police Division HQ when the 12 April Statement was recorded. SI Koh explained that he was out of office performing duties and had gone to Bedok Police Division HQ only sometime after 5.00 pm that day. He could not recall whether he had spoken to the Accused on 12 April 2021.

11     During cross-examination, the Accused put to SI Koh that he had promised to refer him (i.e., the Accused) to the DRC if he were to admit to having consumed drugs. It was also put to SI Koh that Insp Qurratu was present when this promise was made, and that she would have heard it. SI Koh denied these claims. According to SI Koh, he would never tell any of his drug supervisee or accused person such matters.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

#### The Accused’s evidence

12     The next witness for the ancillary hearing was the Accused. He testified that when he reported to Bedok Police Division HQ on 12 April 2021, SI Koh brought him to an office. At the office, he saw Insp Qurratu. SI Koh showed the Accused two certificates which stated that his urine samples contained drugs and asked him (i.e., the Accused) to give a statement so that he could be referred to a DRC.

13     The Accused complied with SI Koh’s request, on the understanding that under the “law” announced by the Minister in 2019, he would be referred to a DRC and would not be prosecuted if he were to admit to drug consumption.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

#### 12 April Statement was voluntarily given

14     As stated earlier, I have found that the Accused had given the 12 April Statement voluntarily. My reasons for this decision are as follows.

#### Insp Qurratu and SI Koh were credible witnesses

15     First, I found Insp Qurratu and SI Koh to be truthful witnesses. During the ancillary hearing, they had given their evidence in a forthright and fair manner. At times, Insp Qurratu and SI Koh had given evidence that might assist the Accused’s case – even though it would have been very easy for them to falsely testify otherwise since there was no objective evidence to contradict them.

> (a)     For instance, when the Accused put to SI Koh that the latter had promised to refer him to a DRC on 12 April 2021, SI Koh candidly testified that he could not recall if he had spoken to the Accused on that day. If SI Koh had wanted to lie, he could have simply denied meeting the Accused altogether, since it was a case of the latter’s words against his.

> (b)     An example of Insp Qurratu being an honest witness is where she admitted to having told the Accused – before the statement recording commenced – that he could be referred to DRC (this being one of the possible outcomes to the investigations against him). This is despite the fact that the Accused could have used this admission to advance his case that she had promised him DRC to induce him into making the 12 April Statement. To fend off the Accused’s challenge to the statement, Insp Qurratu could simply have denied mentioning about DRC to him altogether. She did not do so.

> (c)     In my view, Insp Qurratu’s explanation that she had mentioned to the Accused about the two possible outcomes of DRC and prosecution – so that he would be aware of what might happen to his case _before_ recording the 12 April Statement – further demonstrates that she had acted fairly at all times. By being told of the possibility of prosecution – which must have been a real possibility given that (a) his urine samples were found to contain MAM and (b) he was a repeat s 33A offender – the Accused was made aware of the implications of the 12 April Statement.

16     Second, I found that Insp Qurratu and SI Koh had no reason to promise the Accused a referral to a DRC. They had nothing to gain by inducing the Accused to involuntarily admit to drug consumption. Based on the HSA certificates, they already had sufficient basis to prefer the LT2 Charge. (For further discussion, see \[32\] and \[33\] below.)

#### The Accused’s allegations lack coherence and credibility

17     Third, the Accused had failed to provide a consistent account regarding what caused him to give the 12 April Statement involuntarily.

> (a)      _At the start of the trial_, the Accused stated that the 12 April Statement was involuntary because he had been promised a referral to DRC. When I asked the Accused specifically who had made that promise, he identified only Insp Qurratu. The Accused _did not identify SI Koh_.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

> (b)      _When the Accused cross-examined Insp Qurratu_, his case again appeared to be that she was the only person who had made the promise to refer him to DRC. The Accused did not allege that SI Koh had also made him the same promise in her presence.

> (c)     The Accused began to change his position after he had completed cross-examining Insp Qurratu. After Insp Qurratu was released, I asked the Accused to confirm whether there was any other person whose actions had caused him to give the 12 April Statement involuntarily. The Accused initially stated that no other person was involved. On further questioning however, he shifted his position. The Accused alleged that SI Koh had also promised to refer him to DRC if he gave a statement. The Accused was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation when asked why he had chosen not to implicate SI Koh at the start of the trial and when Insp Qurratu was under cross-examination.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (d)     In any event, SI Koh was called to give evidence at the ancillary hearing. _During cross-examination_, the Accused embellished his allegation – by putting to SI Koh that the latter had made a promise to refer him to DRC _in the presence of Insp Qurratu_. This is the first that that the Accused had made such an allegation.

> (e)     When the Accused eventually gave evidence during the ancillary hearing, he referred only to the promise made by SI Koh. He did not mention about the promise allegedly made by Insp Qurratu at all. It seemed as if the Accused had forgotten that it was his case that Insp Qurratu had also promised to refer him to DRC.

> (f)     Under cross-examination, the Accused eventually alleged that _both_ SI Koh and Insp Qurratu had promised to refer him to DRC.

18     The inconsistencies in the Accused’s case regarding whether Insp Qurratu had made the alleged promise to him are especially glaring when one considers his Case for the Defence (P10) (“**CFD**”).

> (a)     In that document, which was filed on 12 November 2021 (i.e., seven months after the 12 April Statement was recorded and six months before the trial), the Accused had _completely omitted_ to state that Insp Qurratu had promised to refer him to DRC during the recording of the 12 April Statement.

> (b)     Instead, the Accused had given the following reasons as to why the 12 April Statement was involuntarily given by him:

>> I had made some incriminating statements which I did not intend to be used by the prosecution at the trial as I at that material time when my statement was recorded, _I wish to state that I was feeling unwell and still on medical leave when the statement was recorded. I was also heavily induced by cough mixture as I was addicted to it. Hence it clouded my judgment._ I was also promised by the CNB officer Mr Rick Koh that should I elect to admit using drugs, he would send me to DRC.

>> \[Italics and underscoring added; grammatical errors in original text\]

> (c)     Under cross-examination, the Accused conceded that the alleged promise by Insp Qurratu was important to his case.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) Yet, he was unable to provide any satisfactory explanation as to why he had failed to mention this promise in his CFD. On this note, I find that if the Accused had the presence of mind to specifically highlight in his CFD (i) the promise by SI Koh, and (ii) that Insp Qurratu was involved in the recording of the 12 April Statement, it is inconceivable how he could have forgotten to mention the alleged promise by Insp Qurratu as well – if such a promise had in fact been made.

> (d)     On further cross-examination, the Accused changed his position yet again – this time claiming that he _had assumed_ that Insp Qurratu was involved in the promise made by SI Koh. The Accused provided the following explanation as to how he had come to this assumption:

>> A    \[…\] For me---but from my---from my point of view, this statement written by---by Ms Qurratu Ain but they are---Rick Koh is my officer. So, without him and this---and Mr Qurratu Ain\[sic\], both---because Ms Qurratu Ain will never just take my statement. Because I need to wait---get back to Rick Koh then I can get Ms Qurratu Ain to take the statement. So, they are combined, Mr DPP.

>> It’s supposed Rick Koh who have to take my statement because he is my officer in charge. But he refer me to Qurratu Ain_. So, I---I---I got the thinking of what he---it’s either---it’s either one on the---I don’t know which---which---but it’s from the---because they are both on there that---that---that time_.

>> Q    Yes. Okay. So, my question is a very simple one. So, I’ll ask you again. Why didn’t you put it to Insp Ain that she heard Rick promised you DRC?

>> A     _She must be know. She must. She---she---she should know._

>> \[text in square brackets and italics added\]

> (e)     In my judgment, the above exchange shows that the Accused is clearly embellishing his evidence along the way.

19     The Accused’s allegations against SI Koh are similarly riddled with inconsistencies and anomalies:

> (a)     As stated earlier, during the ancillary hearing, the Accused initially did not mention about SI Koh’s alleged promise. It was only later – after Insp Qurratu had testified and before he was due to give evidence – that the Accused eventually alleged that SI Koh had also promised to refer him to DRC.

> (b)     Even then, SI Koh’s alleged promise did not seem to feature significantly in the Accused’s mind during the ancillary hearing. I say this because during his examination-in-chief, the Accused had again failed to make any reference to SI Koh’s promise altogether.

> (c)     Importantly, on 12 May 2021 (i.e., barely one month after the 12 April Statement was recorded), the Accused was issued with a warning under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code and was invited to state his defence to the LT2 Charge. In response, the Accused provided the following defence (P11) (“**Cautioned Statement**”):

>> I jab phosphate codeine around 10 tablets a day and a jab and drink syrup codeine and all painkillers. I take medication from polyclinic and I hope the medication can be sent to HSA to know what it contains. I want to check if the polyclinic medication contains drugs.

>> \[grammatical errors in original text\]

> (d)     When the Cautioned Statement was recorded, the Accused (i) would still have remembered SI Koh’s alleged promise, (ii) would know that he was being prosecuted on the LT2 Charge which carried a very severe sentence, and (iii) would also know that the Cautioned Statement was an important opportunity for him to state his defence to the LT2 Charge. Given these factors, one would have expected the Accused to have stated in the Cautioned Statement that he should have been referred to DRC instead of being prosecuted (as allegedly promised). When cross-examined on this, the Accused conceded that he did not know how to answer the question and chose not to do so.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

20     In my judgement, the numerous and unexplained shifts in the Accused’s position – from (a) whether it was Insp Qurratu and/or SI Koh who had promised to refer him to DRC to (b) whether SI Koh had made the alleged promise in the presence of the Insp Qurratu – cast grave doubts on the credibility of his allegations. I disbelieved the Accused’s allegations and found that he had given the 12 April Statement voluntarily.

### The 12 April Statement is reliable and credible

#### The statement contains incriminating admissions

21     Having found the 12 April Statement to be admissible, the next question is what weight ought to be attached to it. In this regard, I note that the Accused had admitted in the statement that he had consumed heroin before his arrest on 21 February 2021:

> 12    Today (12/04/2021), I came to Bedok CNB office. _I am shown a set of HSA certificates bearing my name and NRIC number, stating that my urine samples were positive for controlled drugs. Regarding that, I admit that I had smoked “heroin” about three days prior to my arrest (21/02/2021). I smoked “heroin” that morning (18/02/2021) after my children went to school. I smoked at the staircase landing outside my house_. I placed some “heroin” on an aluminium foil and heat underneath of the foil. Once the fumes formed, I used a rolled-up paper to inhale the fumes. I took about 2-3 puffs and felt normal. I threw away the aluminium foil and rolled-up paper after I was done smoking.

> \[emphasis added\]

#### The admissions could not have been fabricated

22     In my judgment, the information in the 12 April Statement must have been provided by the Accused. In coming to this view, I note, for instance, that the statement contains information such as –

> (a)     How often the Accused had consumed heroin: see \[13\] of the statement.

> (b)     Why he had consumed heroin: see \[13\] of the statement.

> (c)     Details of his heroin supplier: see \[14\] of the statement.

> (d)     Why the Accused had initially denied having consumed heroin in his investigations statement recorded on 22 February 2021: see \[15\] of the statement.

23     The numerous personal and detailed nature of the information provided in the 12 April Statement lends weight to the Accused’s unequivocal admission that he had consumed heroin at the material time.

#### The admissions are against the Accused’s interest

24     In my view, it is highly unlikely that the Accused would falsely admit to having consumed heroin. On his own evidence, the Accused knew that such an admission would expose him to prosecution on an LT2 Charge which carries a very severe sentence.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

#### The Accused’s alleged reasons for making the admissions are incredible

25     In an attempt to cast doubt on his admission in the 12 April Statement, the Accused testified that he had lied about having consumed heroin _because he wanted to be admitted to a DRC_. According to the Accused, he wanted a “short period of break” of between 12 to 18 months in a DRC (a) to deal with marital issues that he was having at the material time, and (b) to seek treatment for his addiction to painkillers and cough mixture.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

26     I found the Accused’s evidence to be inherently incredible:

> (a)     The Accused did not provide any detail regarding his marital issues, and how being admitted to a DRC for a lengthy period of 12 to 18 months would help resolve them.

> (b)     Neither did the Accused explain why he was suitable for admission to a DRC. It bears noting that a DRC is for the treatment and rehabilitation of persons addicted to _controlled drugs_ under the MDA (see s 34 and the definition of “drug addict” in s 2 of the MDA). It was the Accused’s case that he had in fact _not_ consume such drugs – and had thus claimed trial to the LT2 Charge.

> (c)     Furthermore, the Accused had conceded during cross-examination that he was taking a huge risk by admitting to having consumed heroin. This is because such an admission would expose him to a very serious charge under s 33A(2) of the MDA. It is unbelievable that the Accused would take the risk of conviction on such a charge simply to (i) to deal with his marital issues and (ii) to seek treatment for his addiction to painkillers and cough mixture.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

#### The Accused had failed to cast doubt on the admissions

27     Finally, the Accused had submitted that I should not rely on the the 12 April Statement by highlighting the following apparent incongruities in the statement:[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> (a)     First, according to the 12 April Statement, the date of his alleged drug consumption was 18 February 2021. The Accused submitted that this statement did not square with the evidence of HSA Analyst Ong Han Hui Jordan (PW12) (“**Analyst Ong**”) who testified that the detection period for MAM was 24 hours from the last consumption.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) The Accused submitted that if Analyst Ong was correct, then MAM should not have been found in his urine samples given that these samples were taken on 22 February 2021 and analysed on 23 February 2021 – i.e., more than 24 hours after the date of his alleged drug consumption on 18 February 2021.

> (b)     Second, according to the 12 April Statement, the Accused had consumed heroin at the staircase landing outside his flat unit – after his children had gone to school. According to the Accused, there was no reason for him to consume heroin at the staircase landing. Given that his children were in school, he would have consumed heroin in his flat unit.

28     I was not persuaded by the Accused’s submissions.

> (a)     It bears noting that (i) the information regarding the date and location of the drug consumption _came from the Accused_, and (ii) such details were provided about _two months after_ the consumption in February 2021. Given the lapse of time, it is not inconceivable that the Accused himself might have made a mistake regarding when he had consumed heroin, whether his children were in school at the material time, and whether he had consumed heroin at the staircase landing. In my view, whether such details are accurate or not do not undermine the Accused’s admission that he had consumed heroin.

> (b)     In any event, Analyst Ong had testified that the 24-hour detection period for MAM was subject to factors such as (i) the amount of water intake by the Accused, (ii) his metabolism and excretion rates, and (iii) the amount of drug he had taken during his last consumption. Analyst Ong was not able to state the period that MAM would be detectable for the Accused specifically.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) In the circumstances, his evidence on the 24-hour detection period is not conclusive on the issue of whether MAM could remain in the Accused’s urine for detection on 23 February 2021 when the date of consumption was 18 February 2021.

### The 12 April Statement proved the LT2 Charge

29     In the 12 April Statement, the Accused admitted that he “_had smoked ‘heroin’”_ prior to his arrest on 21 February 2021. In my judgement, this admission proves that the Accused had committed the offence stated in the LT2 Charge.

> (a)     In coming to this view, I take judicial notice of the fact that heroin is the street name for diamorphine.

> (b)     Furthermore, the Accused did not dispute the fact that the consumption of diamorphine would lead to the presence of MAM in his urine samples.

> (c)     Finally, I noted that the Accused had also accepted the fact that he had previously been convicted and sentenced for the consumption of Morphine under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

## Positive urine test results

30     Apart from the 12 April Statement, the fact that the Accused had consumed MAM on or before 21 February 2021 is also established by HSA analysis of his urine samples.

### Procurement of the Accused’s urine samples

31     During the trial, the Prosecution adduced the following evidence:

> (a)     After his arrest on 21 February 2021, the Accused was soon admitted to the Accident & Emergency Department (“**A&E**”) of Changi General Hospital (“**CGH**”). This was because the Accused had complained of back and leg pain. The Accused was latter transferred to Ward 35.

> (b)     At CGH, the Accused was required by CNB to provide his urine samples for testing.

> (c)     At about 11 am on 22 February 2021, when the Accused was in Ward 35, the Accused informed the CNB officers who were then on escort duty with him that he wanted to provide his urine samples. These officers were Sgt Mohammad Danial bin Mohammad Ismail (PW4) (“**Sgt Danial**”), Sgt Marfiqa binte Mohamed Makhfuz (PW7) (“**Sgt Marfiqa**”) and SI Muhammad Ridwan bin Shinei (PW6) (“**SI Ridwan**”).

> (d)     From a bag containing numerous bottles, the Accused was allowed to choose one bottle with red cap and two bottles with blue caps. He was then escorted to the toilet at Ward 35 by Sgt Danial and SI Ridwan. Sgt Danial entered the toilet together with the Accused and witnessed the latter provide his urine into a bottle with red cap, while SI Ridwan waited outside the toilet. After the Accused had completed providing his urine samples, he was escorted back to his bed at Ward 35. The three urine bottles remained in the Accused possession at all material times.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (e)     Once back at the Accused’s bed, Sgt Danial poured urine from the bottle with red cap into the two bottles with blue caps in front of the Accused. The bottles with blue caps were then closed, temporarily sealed and placed in the possession of the Accused.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (f)     SI Ridwan then brought the balance of the Accused’s urine in the bottle with red cap back to Bedok Police Division HQ to do an instant urine test (“**IUT**”). When the IUT showed that the Accused’s urine contained opiates, SI Ridwan returned to Ward 35 with two locked metal containers and HSA labels/seals bearing the Accused’s particulars. These seals were applied on the two bottles with blue caps containing the Accused’s urine samples. After he had confirmed that the particulars on the seals and signed on them, the Accused deposited the two bottles separately into the two locked metal containers. SI Ridwan then brought the containers back to Bedok Police Division.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

### HSA certificates

32     The Prosecution had also adduced the following evidence:

> (a)     On 23 February 2021 (i.e., one day after the collection of the Accused’s urine samples), the two locked metal containers were sent to HSA where they were unlocked by HSA staff.

> (b)     The two bottles containing the Accused’s urine samples were analysed and two certificates (both dated 15 March 2021) were issued by HSA. One of these certificates (Lab. No. 2103303-AT-001 (P6)) was issued by HSA analyst Ng Xue Qin (PW11) (“**Analyst Ng**”). The other certificate (Lab. No. 2103303-AT-002 (P7)) was issued by Analyst Ong.

> (c)     According to these certificates (P6 and P7), the Accused’s urine samples were found to contain MAM (“**positive urine test results**”). The certificates further stated that “the presence of MAM in the urine is a result of consumption of diamorphine”. The two certificates (P6 and P7) were issued pursuant to s 16 of the MDA, which provides that a certificate purporting to be signed by an analyst employed by HSA and to relate to a controlled drug shall be proof of all matters contained in the certificate.

33     According to s 22 of the MDA, if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of urine tests conducted by different analysts employed by the HSA on two samples of his urine, then that person shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of s 8(b). In other words, the two HSA certificates (P6 and P7) is _prima facie_ proof that the Accused had consumed MAM.

### Challenge to the positive urine test results

34     The Accused urged me to reject the positive urine test results. His submissions were as follows:

> (a)     The Accused initially testified that he was _not sure_ how CNB had procured his urine samples. According to the Accused, he had provided some urine into a bottle at A&E. As the amount of urine was insufficient, he was told to hold onto the bottle so that he could provide more urine into the bottle when he was able to. When the Accused was later transferred to Ward 35, he brought along the bottle to the ward. At Ward 35, he was not “sober” and _could not recall_ having provided his urine samples there.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

> (b)     When the Prosecution highlighted that even if the urine samples from A&E were the ones sent to HSA for analysis, that would still have been _his_ urine, the Accused shifted his stance – by claiming that he believed that his urine had been “_swapped_” before it was sent to HSA for analysis.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

> (c)     Finally, the Accused claimed that the positive urine test results could have been due to various medication that he had consumed/been administered with at the material time.

### Challenge rejected

35     I am unable to accept the Accused’s submissions as to why I should reject the positive urine test results.

#### The Accused did provide his urine samples for HSA analysis

36     First, I found Sgt Danial to be a truthful witness. There is no basis for me to suspect that he had given false evidence on how he had procured the Accused’s urine samples.

37     Second, Sgt Danial’s evidence has been corroborated by Sgt Marfiqa and SI Ridwan.

> (a)     Sgt Marfiqa had in fact tendered a CNB field diary (P2) which showed that she had made contemporaneous records on 22 February 2021 when Sgt Danial procured the Accused’s urine samples, and that the Accused had counter-signed against these entries. The Accused did not challenge these entries when he cross-examined Sgt Marfiqa.

> (b)     There is no evidence to show that Sgt Danial, Sgt Marfiqa and SI Ridwan had conspired to fabricate false evidence against the Accused. If there was indeed such a conspiracy, one would have expected these three witnesses to have fabricated stronger evidence against him. For instance, SI Ridwan could have testified that he too witnessed the Accused providing his urine samples into the bottle with red cap in the toilet. He did not do so.

38     Third, the Accused’s claim that he was not sober at Ward 35 is dubious.

> (a)     If the Accused was in pain at the material time, I find it difficult to comprehend how he could also not be sober at the same time.

> (b)     There is nothing to suggest that the Accused was not sober from the time of his arrest to the time he was transferred to Ward 35.

> (c)     The Accused claimed that he was not sober at the ward because of painkillers that he was given at A&E.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) In this regard, it was not disputed that because the Accused was in a state of pain at the material time, Dr Dawood Khan (PW5) (“**Dr Khan**”) had given him paracetamol and an injection of Tramadol at A&E. According to Dr Khan however, paracetamol and tramadol does not cause a patient not to be sober.[^23]

39     In any event, I found the Accused’s claim that (A) he could not recall having provided his urine samples at Ward 35 and (B) he was not “sober” at the material time to be neither here nor there.

> (a)     In relation to (A), the fact that the Accused _could not recall_ having provided his urine samples did not mean that he _did not_ do so. In this regard, I note that it was not the Accused’s case that he did not provide any urine samples at the ward.

> (b)     As for (B), the Accused clarified during cross-examination that he had been in a “zombie-like” state at the material time – and that he would just comply with whatever instructions Sgt Danial gave him.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) Again, the mere fact that he would comply with Sgt Danial’s instructions did not mean that he did not provide his urine samples at the ward.

40     Finally, the Accused had failed to challenge the procurement of his urine samples in his Cautioned Statement. If the Accused had any dispute regarding HSA analysis and his urine samples, he would reasonably have stated this in the Cautioned Statement. When confronted with this fact, the Accused explained that he had failed to do so because he was not specifically asked whether he was challenging the urine procurement process when the Cautioned Statement was recorded. I found this explanation unbelievable – especially when it was his own evidence that he could say whatever he wanted to say in that statement.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

#### No basis to find that the Accused’s urine samples had been swapped

41     As for the Accused’s claim that his urine samples had been swapped before it was sent for HSA analysis, I found this to be devoid of merit.

42     First, there is no factual basis to support the Accused’s claim.

> (a)     There is no evidence to show that from the time the Accused deposited the two bottles of his urine samples into the locked metal containers to the time that these containers were received by HSA for analysis, they had been tampered with. It is undisputed evidence that the locked metal containers could only be opened at HSA as only HSA had the keys to the containers.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> (b)     According to the HSA analysts, upon receiving the Accused’s urine samples, they conducted a number of checks to ensure that everything was in order, including checking for his name, NRIC and signature, and ensuring that the seal on the urine bottles were intact.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

> (c)     According to SSSgt Amos Yap Hon Chian (PW9), the officer who submitted the containers containing the Accused’s urine samples to HSA on 23 February 2021, HSA did not raise any issue with the containers or their contents.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

> (d)     On the Accused’s own evidence, it was _only his belief_ that his urine samples had been swapped. The basis of this belief was the Accused’s “experience” with _other_ unspecified and unrelated cases where urine samples had allegedly been swapped. The Accused could not provide any evidence to support his belief that the urine samples which he had provided at CGH on 22 February 2021 had been swapped.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

> (e)     The Accused speculated that his urine samples might have swapped so that CNB could use a positive urine test result as leverage to extract some drug-related information from him.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) This speculation is clearly not supported by the Accused’s own evidence. During the trial, he did not give any evidence that CNB officers had sought to extract such information from him. The Accused eventually conceded that he did not know why the CNB officers would want to conspire to frame him up with a false LT2 charge.[^31]

43     In my judgement, the Accused’s claim that his urine samples had been swapped is clearly an afterthought. It bears emphasis that he had failed to make the claim during numerous critical stages in his case, namely –

> (a)     On 22 February 2021 – when the Accused’s investigation statement in relation to the LT2 Charge was recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (P5). Instead, the Accused gave a detailed account in this statement on how his urine samples were procured at Ward 35. When confronted with this fact, the Accused claimed that he had given this statement in a “zombie-like” state and that the portion of the statement on the procurement of his urine samples was inaccurate. This belated allegation was made only after he was confronted with the fact that his statement was inconsistent with his claim that his urine samples had been swapped during cross-examination. Prior to this, the Accused did not either challenge the admission of the statement, or raise issue with any part of it, during the trial.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> (b)     On 12 May 2021 – when the Cautioned Statement was recorded. In the statement, the Accused had explained that his urine samples could have come to contain MAM because he had been jabbing himself with phosphate codeine as well as consuming medication from the polyclinics, syrup codeine and pain killers. When asked why he had failed to claim that his urine samples had been swapped in the statement, the Accused was initially unable to give a coherent explanation.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) On further probing, the Accused claimed that he was not “sober” when the statement was recorded. This claim does not square with the fact that he had the presence of mind to provide his defence to the LT2 Charge in some detail, e.g., by stating the medication that he had purportedly consumed which could result in MAM being present in his urine samples. When confronted with this fact, the Accused again failed to give a coherent explanation.[^34]

> (c)     On 12 November 2021 – when the Accused’s CFD was filed. In the CFD, the Accused set out his defence in great detail. Among others, he claimed that “the procurement of _my_ urine sample was done without my knowledge” and that the positive urine test results were due to his medication prescribed by various clinics and hospitals. On cross-examination, the Accused came up with an incredible claim that he did not state in the CFD that his urine samples had been swapped because he wanted to be “discreet” and would never discuss such a matter openly. When it was put to him that such an explanation was plainly illogical because he was prepared to make the same claim in open court, the Accused requested that his cross-examination be terminated and that he be found guilty so that he could appeal against his conviction.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

#### No evidence that positive urine test results were due to medication

44     Finally, I find that the Accused had failed to prove that the positive urine test results were due to other medication that he had consumed/administered with, and not due to his consumption of diamorphine.

> (a)     First, during the early stages of the trial, the Accused had initially claimed that the positive urine test results were affected by such medication. He however eventually abandoned this claim – after hearing the evidence of the Analysts Ng and Ong that neither paracetamol nor tramadol would cause such result.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

> (b)     Second, the Accused conceded that his claim was based on a _mere speculation_. There is simply no factual basis to support this claim.

> (c)     Finally, the Accused in fact admitted that the medications which he had consumed would not have led to MAM being found in his urine samples. He had accepted that MAM in his urine samples could not be due to the consumption of any other kind of drug except diamorphine.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37)

## No basis to find that the LT2 Charge is inappropriate

45     I now turn to the last issue raised by the Accused. During the trial, the Accused repeatedly claimed that “it is the law” that anyone who had admitted to drug consumption would be referred to DRC. According to the Accused, this “law” was set out in statements made by the Minister in 2019. The Accused reasoned that based on this “law”, he ought to have been referred to DRC instead of being prosecuted on the LT2 Charge.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

46     The Accused did not refer me to the relevant ministerial statements to support his understanding of this “law”. Presumably, he was referring to the following speech by the Minister on 15 January 2019 at the second reading of a bill which introduced amendments to the MDA (“**the Speech**”): Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (15 January) vol 94.

> … we have been studying how to bring down recidivism down even further. Our assessment is that for pure abusers, we can now afford to focus, shift our balance quite decisively, and **_focus more on rehabilitation_** as opposed to detention. We all know that long periods of detention can affect the abusers’ employability after they are released. …

> …

> Addiction is a complex problem. Staying clean is ultimately dependent on a variety of factors including the resolve of the abuser. But it is a difficult journey for the abusers. Often, they become estranged from their families, communities and the workplace. It is harder for them to reintegrate once released. A number get back into bad company, on drugs, and then they get re-arrested at various points; the cycle repeats itself over and over again.

> _So, we have decided, let us try and distinguish between those who only consume drugs – I call them the ‘pure’ abusers – from those who also face charges for other offences. For example, trafficking, property offences, violent offences. So, if they have abused drugs and they have committed some of these other crimes, we put them in one category. We put those who only abused drugs in one category._

> _For the second group, those who consume drugs and commit other offences, they will continue to be charged for their drug-consumption offences as well as the other offences. If they are liable, they will be sentenced to LT \[ie, Long-Term Imprisonment\]._

> _For those who only abuse but do not have any other criminal offence, that means they only consume drugs and they admit to their drug abuse, then the_ **_general approach_** _, regardless the number of times, would be that the Director of CNB will make the appropriate supervision or detention order, and channel them into the rehabilitation regime._

> _So, this group of abusers may also include those who have minor consumption-related offences like possession of drug-taking utensils or possession of small quantities of drugs._ **_If AGC agrees_** _with CNB that there is no need to charge the drug abusers for these minor offences, then these persons will also be channelled to the rehabilitation regime._

> _This will be conditional on the abusers admitting to their drug offences._ If they deny their drug abuse despite the evidence, that means they have really not accepted the need for rehabilitation, they are likely to be charged in court, if AGC concurs.

> …

> And, really, to benefit as many persons as possible, _CNB_, **_with the concurrence of AGC_**_, will_ **_generally_** _not charge abusers, who meet the criteria I have explained, from tomorrow, 16 January 2019_, on the assumption that the Bill is passed today.

> \[italics and bold added\]

47     In my view, the Accused’s reliance on the Speech is misplaced.

> (a)     It is well-established that “a minister’s speech at the second reading of a bill is not law”: _Tan Hon Leong Eddie v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] 3 SLR 639</span> (“**_Eddie Tan_**”) at \[22\]; _Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 476</span> (“**_Tan Eng Hong_**”) at \[181\].

> (b)     It is evident from the Speech (parts in bold) that the Minister was simply stating a “general” approach to the treatment of pure drug addicts, and that this general approach is _subject to the concurrence of AGC_ based on the facts of each case.

> (c)     In deciding whether to refer the Accused to a DRC or to prosecute him, CNB and AGC must, absent specific language in the statute, be expected and permitted to examine relevant facts and exercise their discretion independently. The Minister cannot bind CNB and AGC in the exercise of their discretion as to whether or not to refer the Accused to DRC (under s 34 of the MDA) and whether or not to prosecute him (under Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore): _Tan Eng Hong_ at \[181\]; _Eddie Tan_ at \[23\] and \[29\].

48     In conclusion, what the Accused is essentially arguing is that he had committed the offence in the LT2 Charge – two years after the Speech – on the expectation that he would be referred to DRC and not be prosecuted. Such an argument turns the law on its head and has been robustly rejected: _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span> at \[57\]; _Eddie Tan_ at \[27\]. I do not understand the Speech to be a “license” for drug addicts to commit drug consumption offences with impunity. A contrary view would undermine the very purpose and basis for the general approach stated in the Speech – i.e., rehabilitation of drug addicts.

## Conclusion

49     For the above reasons, I convicted the Accused of the LT2 Charge.

50     For completeness, I wish to add the following:

> (a)      **DAC 913447-2021 & DAC 913448-2021.** After his conviction on the LT2 Charge, the Accused _pleaded guilty_ to two charges under reg 15(3)(f) read with reg 15(6)(a) of the Regulations. The Accused had failed to present himself for urine test to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Division HQ on 17 and 21 December 2020 (“**FRUT Charges**”).

> (b)      **DAC 913449-2021.** In addition, the Accused consented to another FRUT Charge to be taken into consideration for sentencing (“**TIC**”).

> (c)     A breakdown of the sentences are as follows:
