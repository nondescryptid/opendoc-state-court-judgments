The Offender is dissatisfied with the punishment imposed and has filed this appeal against Sentence.

## Summary of Facts

3       The Offender admitted to the commission of a total of 22 offences (7 proceeded with and 15 taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence) which had occurred separately on 29 March, 30 June and 25 October of 2018.

#### Offences committed on 29 March 2018

4       One day before 29 March 2018, the Offender had received a stolen Maybank credit card from one Alexson Anak Bantar. He decided to use the stolen credit card to purchase items. On 29 March 2018, 2018, at about 6pm, at Eyes Fusion Optometrists located at 10 Anson Road, #01-71, International Plaza, the Offender presented the Maybank Credit Card to a cashier to make payment for a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses and a pair of Armani Exchange sunglasses, with a total value of $450. In so doing, the Offender had deceived the cashier into believing that he was the rightful holder of the Maybank Credit Card, a fact which he knew to be false. The cashier processed the transaction, which was approved, and the Offender duly signed on the credit charge slip that was presented to him. By such manner of deception, the Offender had dishonestly induced the cashier to accept the Maybank Credit Card for payment of $450 and deliver the two pairs of sunglasses to him. The two pairs of sunglasses were not recovered.

5       Later that same day, at about 7pm, the Offender and one “Bai” were together at the Adidas outlet at 133 New Bridge Road, #B1-25, Chinatown Point. Both of them selected several pieces of apparel and they agreed that the Offender would pay for the items using the stolen credit card. At about 7.30pm, the Offender presented the Maybank Credit Card to the cashier to make payment for an assortment of apparel with a total value of $623.60. In so doing, the Offender had deceived the cashier into believing that he was the rightful holder of the Maybank Credit Card, a fact which he knew to be false. The cashier processed the transaction, which was approved, and the Offender duly signed on the credit charge slip that was presented to him. By such manner of deception, the Offender had dishonestly induced the cashier to accept the Maybank Credit Card for payment of $623.60 and deliver the apparel to the Offender. The Offender subsequently sold some of the apparel and only a few pieces of the apparel were recovered.

6       At about 7.40pm, the Offender and “Bai” proceeded to G-Force Network Pte Ltd located at #01-48 of Chinatown Point. They decided to purchase two Samsung S9 mobile phones and some mobile accessories using the stolen Maybank credit card. The Offender presented the Maybank Credit Card to the cashier to make payment for the two Samsung mobile phones and accessories, with a total value of $2,696. The Offender had deceived the cashier into believing that he was the rightful holder of the Maybank Credit Card, a fact which he knew to be false. The said cashier processed the transactions, which was approved, and the Offender duly signed on the credit charge slips. By such manner of deception, the Offender had dishonestly induced the said cashier to accept the Maybank Credit Card for payment of $2,696 and deliver the two mobile phones and accessories to him. The Offender subsequently sold the two phones at a shop in Geylang. The mobile phones and accessories were not recovered.

7       At about 8pm, the Offender and “Bai” proceeded to Cortina Watch store at #01-08 of Chinatown Point. There they selected a watch valued at $4,300 and the Offender presented the stolen credit card to the cashier to make payment. When the cashier processed the payment, the transaction was declined. The card was returned to the Offender and he left with “Bai”. By presenting the stolen credit card to pay for the watch valued at $4,300, the Offender had attempted to dishonestly induce the cashier to deliver the watch to him by deceiving the cashier into believing that the Offender was the rightful holder of the Maybank credit card.

8       From Chinatown Point, the Offender went to a camera shop Cam Vision Camera located at 1 Maritime Square, #01-36, Harbourfront Centre. At about 8.40pm, the Offender presented presented the Maybank Credit Card to a cashier at the said establishment to make payment for a merchandise worth $1,177. When the cashier attempted to process payment for the merchandise using the Maybank Credit Card, the transaction was declined. By presenting the stolen credit card to pay for the merchandise, the Offender had attempted to dishonestly induce the cashier to accept the Maybank Credit Card for payment of $1,177 and deliver the merchandise to him.

#### Offences committed on 30 June 2018

9       On 30 June 2018, at about 12 noon, the Offender and his two friends from Malaysia were taking a ride in a Grab passenger car. One of his friends found a cardholder containing a POSB Debit card and they decided to keep it. Thereafter, the Offender suggested to use the debit card to purchase items. After successfully purchasing several items from an NTUC Fairprice supermarket, the Offender suggested to purchase something expensive with the debit card and selling the item off for a profit. His friends agreed to his suggestion.

10     At about 4pm on 30 June 2018, the three of them were at the Cash Converters store located at Blk 510 Tampines Central 1, #01-250, Singapore. They decided to use the POSB Debit card to purchase a gold chain valued at $2,300. Initially, the attempt to process the payment for the gold chain using the debit card was unsuccessful, possibly due to exceeding the debit card spending limit of $1,500. The Offender requested the cashier to proceed with the payment of $1,500 using the debit card and the transaction was successful. By deceiving the cashier into believing that the Offender was the rightful holder of the POSB Debit card, the Offender had dishonestly induced the cashier to accept the debit card for payment of $1,500.

11     After processing the payment of $1,500 using the debit card, the cashier noticed that the name reflected on the card was of a Chinese. He found it suspicious and notified his manager who called the police. The police arrived and placed the Offender and his two friends under arrest.

#### Offences committed on 25 October 2018

12     On 25 October 2018, at about 9.45pm, the Offender was arrested by the police for drug-related offences. A search conducted on him resulted in the seizure from the waistband of his underwear of 4 packets of substances and 1 piece of aluminium foil which were sent to HSA for analysis. One of the packets was found to contain not less than 1.10 grams of powdery substance containing not less than 0.72 grams of Methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act. The rest were found to contain various small quantities of Diamorphine.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

14     The Prosecution submitted that a global imprisonment of at least 28 months would be appropriate. A table of Prosecution’s Sentencing Position was tendered. Reference to several precedent cases were made to show that for amounts between $1,000 and $3,000 in Cheating cases by first offenders fraudulently using credit cards, the punishments were between 6 to 9 months’ imprisonment. The DPP suggested an uplift of one month per charge in view of the several antecedents of the Offender for property offences involving dishonesty.

## Mitigation

15     The Defence Counsel pleaded for leniency for his client. His client had pleaded guilty to the charges at the first reasonable opportunity but accepted that he was not a person with a clean record. The Offender himself wrote a letter from Prisons expressing his regret for his actions. He would like to be given the chance to change his life for his family.

16     The Counsel submitted that the present case is not a syndicated cheating case but an unsophisticated act of presenting a card, not belonging to him, to make purchases. As the amounts involved are below $5,000, it was submitted that a custodial sentence of between 2 and 4 months would be in order. As for the drug offences, his client regretted mixing with the wrong company and allowing his friends to make use of him to have a small packet of drugs for safe keeping.

## Reasons for the Sentence

17     In calibrating the individual sentences and arriving at the total sentence, it is important to point out that at the end of the day, this Court had to arrive at a global sentence which is commensurate with the gravity of the offences, the circumstances in which they were committed and bearing in mind the type of offender before me. The first step in the sentencing process is to determine the appropriate individual sentences. As I embark on the first step of calibration of the sentences, I would preface it with the acknowledgment that the Offender had entered an early guilty plea which would merit a sentencing discount. I understand the Prosecution had taken this mitigating factor into account in its Sentencing Position.

#### Sentence for the Cheating offences

18     The Offender is not a first offender for property crimes involving dishonesty. Therefore, I agree with the Prosecution’s submissions that there ought to be an uplift in the usual sentences for Cheating offences involving the fraudulent use of bank cards. I also agree with the Defence Counsel that this was not a case involving a syndicate but if it were, the sentences would have to be much higher in view of such an aggravating factor.

19     One of the key sentencing factors for property offences involving dishonesty is the value of the property involved. In this case, the amounts involved in the 4 Cheating charges and 2 Attempted Cheating charges ranged from $450 to $4,300. Therefore, the individual sentences were calibrated according to the amounts involved and whether it was a completed offence or an attempted offence. I ordered 2 of the 6 sentences for the Cheating offences to be run consecutively in view of the number of Cheating charges proceeded with by the Prosecution and in view of the number of Cheating offences being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

20     The total sentence imposed for the Cheating offences was 16 months’ imprisonment and I found this to be appropriate in the light of the total loss of $5,472.80 (including TIC charges) incurred by the Offender’s unauthorized use of the bank cards. There was no restitution. The total sentence had also taken into account the antecedents of the Offender and the apparent lack of salutary effects on him from the several periods of incarceration since 2009 for property offences.

#### Sentence for the Drug Possession offence

21     The usual range for first offenders of drug possession of a low quantity is imprisonment terms from 6 months to 10 months. The sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment was imposed for the possession of Methamphetamine after taking into account the TIC charge of possession of Diamorphine – a different type of drug.

#### Sentence to take into account the period spent in remand before being released on bail and to bear in mind the one-third remission usually given to prisoners

22     The Offender was remanded from 27 October 2018 till 8 April 2019 before posting bail. Subsequently, his bail was revoked on 23 April 2019 and he was re-admitted to remand from that date till the day of sentencing. There was no reason not to take this period of remand of about 6 months into account in calibrating the Sentence. The DPP informed the Court that she had taken into account this period in working out the Prosecution’s Sentencing Position. I decided that a fairer further discount of another 3 months is in order to take into account the one-third remission normally granted to offenders serving sentences.

#### Running of the Sentences

23     Under the law, where there are more than 2 sentences of imprisonment imposed, at least 2 of them will have to be run consecutively. Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap. 68, provides that where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively. This of course does not mean that the Court is constrained to run only two sentences consecutively and not more.

24     On the issue of which sentences of imprisonment passed in any case are to be ordered to run consecutively, the case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> provides a good starting point to look for the relevant considerations. According to the High Court in that case, the first rule that the sentencing judge should consider is the one-transaction rule. The 3 offences for which I had ordered the sentences to run consecutively are clearly distinct. The two sentences for offences connected with cheating had occurred at different times in 2 different locations of Singapore. The drug offence is clearly entirely distinct in time, day and nature of the offence. Running the sentences of imprisonment consecutively for these 3 offences would not infringe the one-transaction rule.

25     On the running of sentences of imprisonment for a multiple offender, guidance was provided in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> which was a decision of the High Court on appeal from the District Court. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon held in this case that: “… as a general rule, a multiple offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.” (at Paragraph 41)

26     The Prosecution submitted correctly therefore, for at least 3 of the imprisonment sentences to be run consecutively. I accepted this submission in view of the number of cheating offences, the 15 TIC charges for the purpose of sentencing and the distinct drug offence. In the recent case of _Muhammad Sutarno Bin Nasir v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 43</span>, it was reiterated by the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judge Quentin Loh sitting in the Court of Appeal, in the _ex tempore_ judgment that:

> “… Distinct offences should be punished separately with consecutive sentences so as to ensure that each legally-protected interest is properly vindicated. Otherwise, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would result in the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending …” (at Paragraph 22)

The cheating offences and the offence of drug possession are distinct offences with very different legally-protected interests to be properly vindicated.

27     The final step would be to take a last look at all the facts and circumstances and assess whether the sentence looks wrong. Having taken the last look, there was nothing patently unprincipled or manifestly inadequate or excessive in the total sentence.

## Conclusion

28     In conclusion, the dominant sentencing principles in this case are both General Deterrence and Specific Deterrence. The sentences imposed for the offences committed by the Offender in this case properly reflect his overall criminality and the specific need to further impress upon him the consequences of re-offending again. The Sentence was backdated to take effect from his date of remand of 23 April 2019.
