### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       Janarthanan s/o Vilasamy is a Singaporean currently 38 years of age. On the morning of 7 January 2017, he and his lover (the “**Victim**”) were at her flat. He became upset when she was unable to find something that he had earlier asked her to keep. In his rage he took a chopper and slashed her right hand. This caused a deep laceration and a fracture of the hand. She was bleeding profusely, but managed to reach the front door of her flat and open the door. She collapsed upon reaching the corridor. Her neighbour saw her and called for the police and an ambulance.

2       The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the Victim with a dangerous weapon, an offence under s 326 of the _Penal Code_ (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “**Penal Code**”). He disputed the charge. The trial commenced on 31 October 2018 and he was convicted on 3 May 2019 at the conclusion of the trial.

3       Meanwhile, on 7 February 2019, the defendant pleaded guilty to various other charges in a separate proceeding before another court. For those charges he received a total sentence of 6 years and 3 months’ imprisonment (which was backdated to the date of his remand on 9 January 2017).

4       On 16 May 2019, the defendant was sentenced for the present offence to 18 months’ imprisonment – to commence upon the expiry of current sentence being served – and 6 strokes of the cane. In passing the sentence, the court acknowledged and accepted the prosecution’s submission that an imprisonment term of 3½ years’ imprisonment was appropriate for the present offence, but a lower sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was imposed on account of the totality principle. The present appeal against the sentence was filed by the prosecution on 21 May 2019. (No appeal has been filed by the defendant.)

5       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charge

6       The defendant was tried, and at the end of the trial found guilty and convicted, on the following charge:

You \[...\] are charged that you, on the 7th day of January 2017 at or about 8.13 a.m., at Block 632A Senja Road #XXX Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Maenakadevi d/o Nagalingam (“Maenakadevi”), _to wit_, by using a chopper measuring about 30 cm, an instrument used for stabbing or cutting, to slash the said Maenakadevi, causing her to sustain injuries including:

i.    Laceration on the right lateral aspect on the right wrist 5-cm, exposing the tendon but sensation remained intact on right fingers; and

ii.    Displaced oblique fracture of the 2nd metacarpal proximal shaft.

and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.).

7       Section 326 of the Penal Code provides:

Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means

326.  Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, _voluntarily causes grievous hurt by means of any instrument for_ shooting, _stabbing or cutting_, or any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or any heated substance, or by means of any poison or any corrosive substance, or by means of any explosive substance, or by means of any substance which it is deleterious to the human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by means of any animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

#### Prosecution’s case

8       The salient evidence led by the prosecution was as follows.

#### (a)   Victim testified that the defendant slashed her

9       S Maenakadevi d/o Nagalingam (PW5, the “**Victim**”) testified[^1] that she had been in a relationship with the defendant for 8 to 9 months before the incident on 7 January 2017. The defendant and her had a “fight” inside her unit that morning. The fight arose because some drugs wrapped in a tissue paper, that the defendant had given to her to keep, was missing. She told the defendant to be patient while she looked for it. He suddenly took a chopper and slashed her on her right hand.

10     She managed to snatch the chopper from him and threw it aside. She started to bleed profusely. She told him not to bicker anymore. He then took a piece of cloth to wrap around the slashed area on her hand. As she had just taken a bath and did not have any clothes on, she took a towel and wrapped herself with it. She went to the front door. As soon as she opened the door she collapsed on the ground. It was at that point that her next door neighbour saw her, and called for the police as well as the ambulance.

#### (b)   A neighbour called the police and an ambulance

11     The Victim’s neighbour, Hiranisha Binte Rasimuddin (PW4, “**Hiranisha**”) testified[^2] that when she stepped out of the lift that morning to return to her unit, she saw the Victim lying down outside her (the Victim’s) unit. Her body was covered in blood, and there was also blood on her towel. Her hands were shaking and she asked for help to call the police. The defendant was there, and Hiranisha asked him what happened. He did not answer. Hiranisha said that she would call the police, and his response was “Call, lah, can go ahead” (or words to that effect). Hiranisha also testified that she saw a lot of blood in the Victim’s unit. The blood was “all around the floor”, “everywhere”. From the blood stains it appeared that the Victim had come out of the unit crawling.

#### (c)   A chopper (among other exhibits) was seized

12     Senior Staff Sergeant Soebqi Aiman Bin Soebirin (PW2, “**SSSgt Soebqi**”) and his partner were the first police officers to arrive at the scene. He testified[^3] that he saw the Victim lying on the ground just outside the unit. She was naked, with a towel wrapped around her. He also saw the defendant outside the unit. SSSgt Soebqi asked the defendant what happened. The defendant told him that a “third party” came into the unit and ran off from there. At that time the door to the unit was open. From his observations, SSSgt Soebqi believed something violent had happened inside the unit, and he called for backup. The officers went inside the unit and found and seized three items which they believed could have been the weapon used, including a chopper.

13     The first investigation officer of the case, Station Inspector Alan Ng Yuebin (PW8, “**SI Ng**”) testified[^4] that the defendant was observed to be outside the unit. He was uncooperative. The officers tried to interview him but to no avail. After the defendant was brought to the police station, SI Ng tried to conduct an interview with the defendant, but he was not forthcoming and was uncooperative.

14     The defendant was subsequently placed under arrest. The arrest report dated 7 January 2017 was tendered in evidence (Exh P5). Photographs subsequently taken at the scene were also tendered in evidence (Exh P1[^5]).

#### (d)   Medical evidence of Victim’s injuries

15     Meanwhile, the Victim was conveyed to the Emergency Department of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. A medical report of the Victim dated 3 March 2017 was tendered in evidence (Exh P3). The report was prepared by Dr Yu Hongmin (PW6, “**Dr Yu**”). It was observed that the Victim had (among other things) “laceration on the right lateral aspect of her \[right\] wrist 5-cm, exposing the tendon but sensation remained intact on right fingers” and an X-ray of the right hand showed a “displaced oblique fracture of the 2nd metacarpal proximal shaft”. Dr Yu testified[^6] that the deep injury sustained by the Victim was likely caused by a sharp object such as a knife. The angle of the laceration was slanted or diagonal. Dr Yu opined that the laceration (on the right wrist area) was _unlikely_ to be self-inflicted unless the person was left-hand dominant.[^7] (The Victim was right-handed.)

#### Defence

16     After the close of the prosecution’s case, the defendant was called upon to enter his defence. He elected to testify.

17     He testified[^8] that he and the Victim had a disagreement that morning. He wanted to return home (to his family), but she refused to let him go. She made some threats to kill herself, and he stopped her. It was she (not he) who took the chopper from the kitchen. She was holding on to the chopper and he was holding on to her hands and trying to take the chopper from her. They had a struggle, in the course of which she was accidentally slashed by the large blade of the chopper. He had never intended to harm her with the chopper.

18     The defendant testified that he got to know the Victim about six to seven months prior to the incident. They both liked each other and he told her that he was a married man. Initially they were on good terms at the beginning of their relationship. As time went on she started to give him some problems. Whenever he tried to go back home she would pick a fight with him. She threatened him on two occasions that she would cut herself and end her life by jumping down. She threatened him by saying if he were to leave and go back to his home she would commit these acts and the blame would be on him. And she told him not to go. About two to three times he made plans to leave. The Victim came to the main gate and cut herself with a knife. He went back in and stopped what she was doing, and he continued to stay with her. On one occasion she took a knife to slit her throat. He did not want that to happen, so he stayed with her, and their relationship went on.

19      _One day prior to the incident_ there were some problems. His wife wanted him to go back home. The Victim threatened him, saying that if he went home she would die. He did not go home, and he and the Victim eventually went to Balestier where they checked into a hotel room.

20     The next day they left the hotel and went back to the Victim’s unit. They both had a bath. Then he told her to go and sleep while he went back to his home and would come back in a short while. Then the problem started. She was not wearing any clothes. She started to open the window grilles and attempted to jump out of the window. He held on to her to stop her. He closed the grilles and made her sit down and he spoke to her, telling her to calm down. He was sitting down and smoking a cigarette when she went to the kitchen area to get a pair of scissors. She threatened that if he went home she would stab herself. He told her to go ahead She did not stab herself and placed the scissors down.

21     She went back to the kitchen area and brought a chopper. He was afraid she was going to do something to him, and he stood up. She raised her hand with the chopper and he quickly went to hold on to her hands. There was a scuffle between them. She was cut by the blade of the chopper. Blood was oozing out from her hand. They went towards the (bed)room. They were still struggling. By that time the chopper had fallen to the ground (after he shook her hand very hard so the chopper would fall off). He then went to the room to get a towel. She went to the living room and opened the door and the gate. She had a towel, and there was another towel to wrap the hand that had sustained the injury. She went out and sat on the ground. That was when the neighbour came by. Shortly after the police arrived, and he was subsequently arrested.

22     He maintained that he had no intention to hurt the Victim. He did not want her to hurt herself. That is the reason he held on to her hands that day. He did not use the chopper to hurt her.

#### Issues before the court

23     The issue before the court was whether the injuries suffered by the Victim were caused by the defendant voluntarily or sustained by accident. This turned on whether the evidence of the Victim or the evidence of the defendant was to be believed.

#### Decision

#### (a)   Victim’s testimony was credible

24     Having considered the totality of the evidence, I found the evidence of the Victim, that she gave in court on 31 October 2018, to be truthful and credible. There was absolutely no reason for her to lie and falsely implicate the defendant. Her evidence was candid, even on matters that might have been awkward. Under cross-examination by the defendant, she did admit that she had suffered from depression, that she had cut her left wrist once, and that she had also slit her throat once with a knife because she was depressed about her children. Her _unwavering_ evidence was that the laceration she sustained on her wrist that morning of 7 January 2017 was _not_ self-inflicted.

25     Her testimony was corroborated by the events that followed, where she asked her neighbour for help to call the police. It was also corroborated by the medical evidence that the injury was unlikely to have been self-inflicted.

#### (b)   Victim’s further testimony on 2 May 2019

26     It should be noted, however, that after the taking of the evidence had been completed and the trial had been adjourned for submissions, the Victim sent two letters to the court, dated 22 November 2018 (Exh A) and 6 March 2019 (Exh B). In these letters she made certain assertions that contradicted her earlier oral testimony in court on 31 October 2018 (her “**earlier testimony**”). Given these unusual circumstances, she was recalled to give further testimony, which was heard on 2-3 May 2019 (her “**later testimony**”).

27     The gist of her later testimony was as follows:[^9]

(a)     It was true that on that day in question, her hand was cut and she was injured. But that was a result of the struggle when the defendant tried to pull the knife from her. It was she who was holding on to the knife. He tried to pull it away from her. As a result her hand was cut. She did not wish to blame the defendant for this, because it was her mistake, because she wanted to kill herself using the knife.

(b)     As regards her evidence on 31 October 2018, she said that when she was shown her statement (by the prosecutor before the trial), she told the prosecutor that she was not able to recall what happened. But she was told this was the statement she had given, this was what had happened, and she had to stick to it. As such, she just followed whatever was written in the statement. But when she went back home, she felt guilty. She thought about it. It was her mistake and she had to rectify it. She did not want an innocent person to be punished for something he did not do. And that was the reason she wrote the letter dated 22 November 2018 (Exh A). After that she received the summons (on 17 December 2018) to come to court. She then wrote the second letter (Exh B) to inform the court that she did not want to come to testify (as she was suffering from depression).

(c)     When the statement was being taken from her at the hospital she was feeling sleepy and dizzy. She did not read her statement at the hospital. It was the IO who read out something to her and told her to append her thumbprint. She was half conscious when she fixed her thumbprint on the statement. She subsequently did mention to the IO that she would like to have the case withdrawn but he did not allow it.

28     Following her testimony, a rebuttal witness was called by the prosecution. The recorder of the Victim’s statement, Inspector Crystal Goh (PW9, “**Insp Goh**”) was called to testify to the circumstances under which the Victim’s statement was recorded. Insp Goh testified[^10] that she went to the hospital (Ng Teng Fong General Hospital) twice that day (7 January 2017). She first saw the Victim at the hospital at about 9.10 am. This was to check the Victim’s injuries to ascertain that they were not life-threatening and to ascertain “how it happened and who did it”. It was a preliminary interview to gather facts. She observed the Victim to be conscious but not lucid. The Victim informed that she was slashed by her boyfriend due to a dispute over drugs. Insp Goh took down some notes but did not record a statement from the Victim that morning as the Victim was going into an operation for her injury. Insp Goh left the hospital at about 1 pm.

29     Insp Goh went to the hospital a second time at about 4.15 pm. She visited the Victim at her bed and, on this occasion, recorded a statement from her. She spent some time talking to the Victim concerning what happened, before writing down her statement. Insp Goh testified that the Victim was conscious and stable, able to articulate, and able to recall facts very well. They spoke in English. The statement was a mixture of questions and answers. The statement was read back to the Victim. She was invited to make corrections or amendments; she did not make any amendment. As the Victim’s right hand was injured, the thumbprint of her left thumb was applied on the statement. The statement was recorded from 5 pm and completed at 6.25 pm.

30     I found Insp Goh to be a truthful and credible witness. Her evidence that the Victim was conscious and articulate when the statement was given was far more credible than the Victim’s claim that she was half-conscious and unaware of the statement she had given. Insp Goh had no motive to fabricate the Victim’s statement. I was satisfied that Insp Goh had properly recorded in the statement what the Victim had told her. (The statement given by the Victim was admitted in evidence as Exh P9.)

31     I found, on the other hand, that the Victim had a clear motive to disclaim the contents of her statement and her earlier testimony on 31 October 2018. By her own account she continued to love the defendant after the incident, and she wanted to withdraw the case and did not want him “to get any punishment”.[^11] She continued to visit him while he was in prison, and on one occasion (prior to her earlier testimony in October 2018), when they spoke about the case he told her to testify that it was because of a _struggle_ they had that her wrist was cut.[^12] In essence he suggested that she told a lie in court. Her letters (Exhs A and B) were plainly a late attempt to try to exonerate him.

32     Taking into account the entirety of the evidence, I did not believe that the contents of Exhs A and B, and the Victim’s later testimony in May 2019 represented a true account of what happened. What she had told the court in her earlier testimony in October 2018, which was consistent with what was recorded in her statement just a matter of hours after the incident, was much closer to the unvarnished truth of what had transpired that morning of 7 January 2017.

#### (c)   DNA evidence inconclusive

33     The chopper seized from the Victim’s unit, by which her injuries had been sustained, was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis by the DNA Profiling Laboratory. A HSA report was subsequently prepared (Exh P7).

34     The defendant’s DNA was not positively identified on the chopper. That observation was inconclusive, however. The HSA Analyst, Lee Yong Sheng (PW7) testified[^13] that it was possible for someone to have touched the chopper without the DNA being found. One possibility was that the person did not leave enough cells or DNA on the exhibit. Another possibility was that the person touched the area but the DNA was masked by the higher DNA levels of another person (such as when there is a lot of blood). Another possibility was that the person’s DNA may gave degraded over time due to environmental factors such as UV from sunlight, humidity, temperature as well as microbial activity.

#### (d)   Defendant’s testimony was not credible

35     I did not find the defendant’s account to be credible. Much of what he said in his testimony, such as the Victim opening the window grilles and attempting to jump out of the window or subsequently threatening to stab herself with a pair of scissors (before bringing the chopper out of the kitchen), were never put to the Victim when he cross-examined her. The account given by him was plainly an afterthought and a fabrication on his part.

36     The defendant’s account was also incongruous with his subsequent behaviour as observed by the Victim’s neighbour, whose testimony was that the when she asked the defendant what had happened _he did not answer_, and gave a rather nonchalant response when she said that she was going to call the police (above, at \[11\]). His account was also at odds with what he told the police officer who attended at the scene: that a third party had entered the unit and ran off (above, at \[12\]). I found the evidence of these witnesses to be truthful. If the Victim had indeed injured herself accidentally with the chopper in the course of a struggle, why did he not simply tell them so?

#### (e)   Verdict

37     Accordingly, I found the clear and coherent testimony of the Victim on 31 October 2018, which was consistent with the statement that she gave to the police on the day of the incident (Exh P9), to be far more credible than the account given by the defendant. Taken together with the testimony of the other witnesses, including the medical evidence, I found that the prosecution had proven its case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. He was found guilty and convicted as charged.

## SENTENCE

#### Antecedents

38     The criminal record of the defendant revealed a number of previous convictions, which included the following offences involving the use of violence:

#### Prosecution’s submissions

39     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 3½ years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. It was submitted that the defendant’s culpability was high. The attack was completely unprovoked. He attacked the Victim suddenly and viciously. She had little opportunity to defend herself. The harm caused was also high. The Victim suffered lacerations on the right wrist. The defendant’s antecedents revealed his recalcitrant behaviour.

40     At the time of sentencing for the present offence, the defendant was serving a sentence of 6 years and 3 months’ imprisonment which had been imposed after he pleaded guilty to various offences on 7 February 2019. The prosecution submitted that the present sentence ought to run _consecutively_ with that sentence.

#### Mitigation Plea

41     The defendant gave a brief oral mitigation plea. He said that he was undergoing _three_ consecutive sentences (for which he was convicted and sentenced on 7 February 2019), which was going to take 6 years and 3 months to complete. If the court imposed a sentence that was consecutive, it would take a long time for him to be out of prison, which would not be fair. He urged the court to impose a _concurrent_ sentence for the present offence.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### (a)   Appropriate sentence for present offence

42     The key sentencing objectives for an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code are deterrence and retribution. This is reflected in the severe punishment prescribed for the offence. Such offence is punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and the offender shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

43     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the defendant’s culpability was high. His attack on the Victim was unprovoked. The instrument that he used, a chopper, was potentially deadly. Serious harm was caused to the Victim, who suffered deep lacerations on her right wrist as well as a fracture of her hand. It was not the defendant’s first offence involving violence, and he had prior convictions for causing hurt. Moreover, he did not show any remorse at all for the offence, but claimed trial to the charge despite the evidence against him.

44     The sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution showed that sentences in the range of 3 to 4 years’ imprisonment, with 4 to 12 strokes of the cane have been imposed for such offences under s 326 of the Penal Code. I accepted the prosecution’s submission that a sentence of 3½ years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane would be an appropriate sentence for the present offence.

#### (b)   Whether the sentence ought to run consecutively or concurrently with defendant’s existing sentence

45     At the time the present matter came up for sentencing, the defendant had, on 7 February 2019, pleaded guilty to and been sentenced for various other offences. Brief details of these offences and the sentence imposed are set out in the following table:

46     I had to decide whether the sentence for the present offence ought to run consecutively or concurrently with the sentence that the defendant was already serving.

47     If the prosecution’s submission was accepted and the sentence for the present offence was ordered to run _consecutively_, the total sentence that would have been imposed on the defendant was 9 years and 9 months’ imprisonment (with 6 strokes of the cane), as illustrated in the following table:

48     In my judgement, such a sentence would have been manifestly excessive and disproportionate to the overall culpability of the defendant. It would have breached the totality principle in sentencing, considering that the total sentence far exceeded the sentence for the most serious offence.

49     On the other hand, I did not consider it appropriate for the sentence in the present offence to run concurrently, as that would have meant that the defendant received no imprisonment term at all for the current offence. That would have been a perverse outcome: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ \[2018\] SGHC 148.

50     In arriving at a sentence that was fair, I considered it necessary to make an adjustment to the sentence for the present offence to arrive at an overall sentence that would be proportionate to the defendant’s culpability as a whole. Notionally, had the defendant been sentenced at _one sitting_ for all the offences, a possible outcome which in my judgment could have been fair was as follows:

51     The drug offence committed on 7 January 2017 (s/n 4) could have warranted an uplift to 4 years’ imprisonment, as it was committed by the defendant while on bail for the earlier drug offence committed on 16 December 2016 (s/n 3). This could be ordered to run consecutively with the s 326 Penal Code offence (s/n 6) and the s 332 Penal Code offence (s/n 1) to give a total imprisonment term of 7 years and 9 months.

52     In order to achieve this outcome of 7 years and 9 months’ imprisonment, I considered it necessary to impose for the present offence a sentence which was _below_ the norm. This was necessitated by the fact that the defendant was already serving a sentence of 6 years and 3 months’ imprisonment. The difference between the notional sentence (7 years and 9 months) and the sentence he was serving (6 years and 3 months) was _18 months_. Accordingly, I considered it appropriate to impose for the present offence a sentence of _18 months’ imprisonment_ (with 6 strokes of caning as submitted by the prosecution).

#### Sentence imposed

53     Therefore, the following sentence was imposed:
