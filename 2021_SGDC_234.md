\[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal in MA 9221/2021/01 was withdrawn on 22 November 2021.\]

3 November 2021

### District Judge Kok Shu-en:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 48 year old male Singapore Permanent Resident who pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving under Section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 (“RTA”), punishable under Section 64(2B)(A) of the RTA. The charge read:

> “You… are charged that on 09 November 2020 at or about 6.55 pm, along Lornie Road slip road into Thomson Road L/P 18, Singapore, did drive a motor vehicle SLD6910X on a road recklessly, to wit, by making an abrupt lane change from lane 3 of 5 lanes road along Lornie Road towards MacRitchie Viaduct, cutting across the chevron marking into lane 5 along Lornie Road slip road into Thomson Road, encroaching into the travel path of the victim, who was approaching from your rear on lane 5 along Lornie Road slip road into Thomson Road, which resulted in a collision, and hurt was caused to one Lee Yam Huat/male/46 years old by such driving, you have thereby committed an offence under Section 64(1) punishable under Section 64(2B) (a) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.”

2       I sentenced the accused to a fine of $7,500, in default one month’s imprisonment, and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months.

3       The accused is dissatisfied with the sentence and has filed an appeal.

## Facts

4       The accused was the driver of motorcar SLD 6910X at the time of the accident. The victim in this case was Lee Yam Huat, a 46 year old male, who was the rider of motorcycle FBN4003T at the time of the accident.

5       On 9 November 2020, at about 6.55pm, while driving SLD 6910X along the slip road on Lornie Road into Thomson Road L/P 18, the accused drove in a reckless manner by making an abrupt lane change from lane 3 of Lornie Road (which consists of 5 lanes) toward MacRitchie Viaduct, cutting across the chevron marking into lane 5 along Lornie Road slip road into Thomson Road. In doing this, the accused encroached into the travel path of the victim, who was approaching from the accused’s rear on lane 5, which resulted in a collision.

6       At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry and traffic flow was light.

7       As a result of the collision, the victim sustained injuries. His right shoulder was tender and swollen with limited range of movement. There were also abrasions on his right shoulder, hands, right knee, and right foot. X-rays showed that he had a mildly displaced right distal clavicle fracture, and a fracture of the base of the distal phalanx of the right big toe. He was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in an ambulance and was discharged from the hospital on the following day, 10 November 2020. He was given a total of 14 days of medical leave from 9 to 22 November 2020.

8       The accused’s motorcar sustained scratches to the left rear bumper, while the victim’s motorcycle sustained multiple scratches on the right portion.

## Antecedents

9       The accused is untraced.

## Parties’ submissions

### Prosecution’s address on sentence

10     The Prosecution sought a fine of between $8,000 and $10,000 and disqualification for a period of 18 months.

11     It took the position that the harm caused in this case of a medium severity, as the victim had suffered two fractures to the right distal clavicle and the right big toe. As for the level of culpability, it submitted the accused could be considered to be at the higher end of the low spectrum of culpability, as he had cut across the lanes at a point after the victim had passed the start of the chevron marking, which the Prosecution argued was a point where any driver would not anticipate that another vehicle would be switching lanes ahead of them.

### Defence’s mitigation plea

12     The Defence sought a fine of $5,000 and a disqualification period of less than 12 months.

13     On the issue of harm, the Defence accepted that this was a case of medium harm caused in view of the two fractures that the victim suffered, though it argued that this was on the lower end of the medium band, given that there was no surgery and only conservative treatment was required. The property damage caused was also minimal.

14     As for the issue culpability, the Defence argued that the abrupt changing of lanes fell towards the lower spectrum of severity of conduct captured under Section 64 of the RTA, noting that more serious dangerous driving features such as beating red lights or pedestrian crossings were absent in this case. Defence Counsel also argued that the victim had contributed to the accident by looking down at his phone. In the video footage of the incident that was played in court, the victim is seen glancing downwards for a moment before the collision occurred.

15     In response, the Prosecution indicated that they did not accept that the victim had contributed to the incident. It pointed out that the victim had looked down for only a short while, and that he had done so at a point, i.e., after the chevron marking, where he would not have expected another driver to be changing lanes. Further, while it was not clear what the victim was looking down at, the Prosecution pointed out that it was not an offence for road users to look down at a phone, as long as they do not touch the phone.

16     Defence Counsel also urged the court to consider the accused’s hitherto clean driving record and the fact that the accused travels to Malaysia from time to time to visit family living there.

## Reasons for the sentence imposed

17     In _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span>, which involved an offence of dangerous driving under section 64(1) of the RTA, the High Court affirmed the two principle factual parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the severity of a crime, namely harm and culpability, and contextualised them as follows:

> “In the context of the offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the RTA, the primary factor relating to the harm caused would be the extent of injury or damage caused. A related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike. The factors increasing the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving.” 

18     In determining the appropriate sentence in this case, I considered the harm caused by the offence and the accused’s level of culpability by looking at the factors discussed in _Koh Thiam Huat_ as set out above.

### Harm caused

19     I agreed with parties’ assessment that the harm caused in this case was in the medium range. The victim sustained fractures in two places – the clavicle, i.e. the collarbone, and the right big toe. He was hospitalised overnight, before being discharged on hospitalisation leave for a total of 14 days (inclusive of the day he was admitted).

20     That said, I did not think there was any reason to regard this case as being at the lower end of the medium spectrum as the Defence had argued. While the victim did indeed only require conservative treatment and was not placed on a particularly long period of hospitalisation leave, he did suffer two fractures and had 14 days of hospitalisation leave. Had more intensive treatment such as surgery or a longer period of convalescence been required, this would have simply tended to push the harm caused into the serious range.

### Level of culpability

21     On the issue of the accused’s culpability, I was of the view that this was low. Both the Prosecution and Defence were similarly of the view that culpability was low, though each sought to persuade me that I should regard this at the higher and lower ends of the spectrum respectively. Parties’ arguments focused on two issues.

##### (1)   The severity of the accused’s reckless driving

22     The Defence argued that the accused’s driving conduct which involved an abrupt changing of lanes is a less egregious form of dangerous or reckless driving than cases involving the beating of a red light, such as the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lee Kuan Yee_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 298</span>. In that case, the offender made a right turn at a junction while the red right-turn arrow was against him, hitting the victim who was proceeding straight on his motorcycle with the green light in his favour. The victim sustained a fracture of his right distal radius and was given 7 days of hospitalisation leave. The offender was sentenced to a fine of $7,500 and a disqualification for a period of 18 months, and the Defence argued that the accused’s less serious driving conduct warranted a lighter penalty.

23     In support of this argument, the Defence relied on the Court’s observation in _Lee Kuan Yee_ that the offender in _Public Prosecutor v Fong Sun Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 174</span> was of a lower level of culpability than the offender in _Lee_. In _Fong Sun Yong_, the offender had swerved abruptly from his lane and collided into the victim and was convicted on one charge under section 64(1) of the pre-2019 amended version of the RTA, which carried a much lower maximum penalty than the charge that the accused faced.

24     While I did not think that the Court’s observations in _Lee Kuan Yee_ could be construed as support for a general proposition that the changing of lanes is a less dangerous form of driving conduct that beating a red light, I accepted that the accused’s level of culpability in this case was indeed less than that of the offender in _Lee Kuan Yee_, where the offender had not only beaten a red light but also failed to form up his motorcar correctly before making a turn at the junction, which was a contravention of Rule 7 of the Road Traffic Rules. However, I note that the victim in this case suffered two fractures and was placed on 14 days of hospitalisation leave, which was more serious than the single fracture and the 7 days of hospitalisation leave suffered by the victim in _Lee Kuan Yee_.

25     When compared to the case of _Fong Sun Yong_, I considered the accused’s level of culpability to be at a higher level. As the Prosecution pointed out, the accused executed the lane change across the chevron markings, which is a factor that was not present in _Fong Sun Yong_. By executing the lane change across the chevron marking, this would have made it much harder for the victim to anticipate and react to the accused’s vehicle, as this was a point where road users would not expect other vehicles to be changing lanes. Chevron markings are traffic signs, as set out in the Schedule to the Road Traffic (Traffic Signs) Rules, and I note that section 120(3) of the RTA requires road users to comply with traffic signs, which the accused in this case had clearly failed to do. For this reason, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s culpability in this case was on the higher end of the low range.

26     For completeness, I note that the Prosecution had argued in submissions that the accused had not only cut across the lanes but had also done so without signalling. Defence Counsel objected to the reference to the lack of signalling given that this was not included in the Statement of Facts, while the Prosecution pointed out that the audio captured in the video footage did not capture any signalling sounds. I found it difficult to conclude from a lack of signalling sounds in the video alone that no signalling was done, and in any event given that this was not a fact included in the Statement of Facts, I did not have regard to this point.

##### (2)   The victim’s potential contribution to the outcome

27     In the video footage of the incident, the Defence highlighted a moment just before the collision occurred when the victim had looked down before looking back up at the road. They surmised that the victim had been looking at his phone and argued that this act had contributed to the eventual collision and its outcome. In response, the Prosecution pointed out that it is possible that the victim may have been looking downward for a legitimate purpose, such as checking on his GPS, as opposed to checking his phone for text messages, which would not have been proper.

28     Either way, it was not made clear to the court why the victim had looked down or what he was looking at. Defence Counsel intimated to the court at the start of proceedings that he had requested that the Police conduct further investigations on this point but that this had not been acceded to. In any event, I observed from the video footage that the victim’s downward glance was very brief and there were no visible indications that this might have affected his ability to react to the accused’s vehicle. Based on the materials before me, I had no reason to find that the victim had materially contributed to the outcome of the incident.

29     However, even if I were to accept that the victim’s downward glance did in fact materially contribute to the outcome of the incident (which I did not), I did not think that this had any bearing on the culpability of the accused. As the High Court held in _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span>, “\[w\]here the conduct of the victim or third parties, whether negligent or otherwise, has materially contributed to the outcome for which the offender is being charged, but has no bearing on the culpability of the offender, it should not affect the sentence imposed.”

30     In _Guay Seng Tiong_, the appellant had pleaded guilty to a charge of causing death by a negligent act under section 304A(b) of the Penal Code. He had failed to keep a proper look out when making a right-turn at a traffic-controlled junction, cutting into the path of another vehicle that was proceeding across the junction, causing a collision between the two vehicles. In the other vehicle was a two-month old infant who was not secured in an approved child restraint. As a result of the collision, the infant sustained a head injury and subsequently passed away.

31     The High Court held that “the failure to properly secure the deceased in an approved restraint was not a relevant consideration in sentencing” as it did not impact the assessment of whether the appellant had been more or less negligent in any way.

32     Similarly, whether the victim in this case had been looking downwards just before the collision had no bearing on the accused’s reckless driving behaviour. The accused accepted without qualification that he was the one who had abruptly cut across two lanes, across the chevron marking, and encroached on the travel path of the victim who was traveling straight ahead on that lane. There is no indication that this conduct was in anyway affected or influenced by the victim’s act of glancing downwards. Accordingly, I did not regard the victim’s act of glancing downwards and the potential contributory effect that this had on the outcome of the incident as a factor that should affect the sentence to be imposed in this case.

### The appropriate sentence to be imposed

33     Section 64(2B)(a) of the RTA provides that where hurt is caused to another person by the driving of a motor vehicle by the offender, the offender shall on conviction of an offence under section 64(1) of the RTA be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.

34     Section 64(2D) of the RTA does not mandate any minimum period of disqualification that is to be imposed on an offender who is convicted of an offence under section 64(1) and punishable under section 64(2B)(a) of the RTA. Instead, section 42(1) of the RTA operates to allow the court to make a disqualification order as it may think fit.

35     In _Lee Kuan Yee_, the Court at \[111\] surveyed cases involving dangerous driving under the pre-2019 amendment version of section 64(1) of the RTA, as well as cases decided under section 64(2B)(a) of the RTA where fines had been imposed and where there were no other aggravating factors to derive a general sentencing guideline. This sentencing guideline applies to offences under section 64(2B)(a) of the RTA, as amended in the 2019 round of amendments to the RTA, which the offence that the accused in this case has been charged for as well. Though _Lee Kuan Yee_ is not a decision of a District Court, I note that the District Judge’s decision in this case was not disturbed on appeal to the High Court and I agree with the guidelines that are set out in the District’s Judge’s grounds of decision, which I replicate here as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.16%"> <col width="33.02%"> <col width="32.82%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of Harm / Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Fine</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>DQ period</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low Harm / Low Culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to $5,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 14 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low – Medium or Moderate Harm / Culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000 to $10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14 to 28 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

36     As the Court in _Lee Kuan Yee_ emphasised at \[112\], these guidelines, besides taking into consideration the legislative intention for a heightened need of deterrence caused by dangerous driving, are merely indicative to assist in our analysis and are to be assessed as a matter of common sense.

37     Given my view that the harm caused in this case was of medium severity, while the accused’s culpability was toward the upper end of low, as a starting point I identified the applicable sentencing range to be a fine of between $5,000 and $10,000 and a disqualification period of between 14 to 28 months.

38     The Defence had specifically urged me to consider a disqualification period of less than 12 months, as was imposed in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Mills Simon Nicholas_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 187</span>, who similarly pleaded guilty to a charge under section 64(2B)(a) of the RTA. In that case, the offender’s culpability and the harm caused were assessed by the Court to be ‘low’, and he was sentenced to a fine of $3,000, as well as a disqualification period of 11 months and a prohibition under section 47F of the RTA for the same period.

39     In my view, the facts of the present case are more aggravated than _Mills_ on both the harm and culpability metrics. In _Mills_, the two victims suffered superficial injuries such as contusions and tenderness, while the vehicles sustained minor damage. While the present case involves only one victim, he suffered more extensive injuries in the form of fractures. As for the level of culpability, the offender in _Mills_ had failed to conform to a red light signal and explained that he had moved from his stationary position when he saw that the bus beside him had started to move forward on a left green arrow and proceeded to move forward as he assumed that the green light was now in his favour. While this act involved the contravention of a traffic rule, he had not deliberately sought to do so. In contrast, there is no suggestion in this case that the Accused’s act of abruptly changing lanes at the chevron marking was anything but a conscious and deliberate act of the accused.

40     As explained above, I was of the view that level of the accused’s culpability in this case was slightly less than that of the offender in _Lee Kuan Yee_, who was sentenced to a fine of $7,500 and an 18 month disqualification period on his plea of guilt. However, when comparing the level of harm caused, the victim in this case had suffered more injuries and was placed on a slightly longer period of hospitalisation leave than the victim in _Lee Kuan Yee_.

41     Having considered the facts and the precedents as cited above, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case should be towards the middle to higher end of the applicable sentencing range, instead of the bottom of the range as suggested by the Defence. From this starting point, I adjusted the sentence to account for the mitigating factors of the accused’s early plea of guilt and his lack of antecedents and imposed a fine of $7,500.

42     As for the disqualification period, I agreed with the Prosecution that a period of 18 months is justified. The accused not only made an abrupt change of lanes but did so across the chevron markings, which are traffic signs that he ought to have complied with, though given the lack of other dangerous or reckless driving features, I was satisfied that a period of 18 months, which tends towards the lower end of the applicable range of between 14 to 28 months, was appropriate.

## Conclusion

43     The Accused has paid the fine and is currently serving the disqualification period of 18 months.
