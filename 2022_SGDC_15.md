2       The accused gave his consent for another 23 charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These are set out in the table at Annex 1.

3       I sentenced the accused to a total sentence of 4 years’ and 9 weeks’ imprisonment, an enhanced sentence of 232 days’ imprisonment, and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 96 months with effect from his date of release.

4       The accused is dissatisfied with the sentence and the order of disqualification and has filed an appeal.

## Facts

5       The accused committed various offences over a period of more than a year, which can be broadly grouped into three batches according to when he was arrested for these offences.

### The first arrest

6       The accused was first arrested on 19 December 2019 in connection with various drug offences, including failing to report for urine testing on several occasions, with the earliest being 15 August 2019. He was first produced in court for these offences on 21 December 2019 and following a period of remand for investigations, he was released on bail on 27 December 2019.

### The second arrest

7       While out on court bail for the first set of charges, the accused committed further offences, for which he was arrested on 18 January 2020. On this date, a traffic police officer spotted the accused riding a motorcycle while using a tinted visor. When the officer directed the accused to stop his vehicle, the accused refused to comply with the direction and continued to ride the motorcycle.

8       The police officer pursued the accused on his patrol motorcycle and again directed the accused to stop, which direction was again ignored. Instead, the accused sped up and in the process of trying to evade the police officer, he made an abrupt illegal U-turn. This illegal U-turn caused an unknown car travelling along the same road to apply its emergency brakes to avoid a collision with the accused’s motorcycle. The accused continued riding the motorcycle until he subsequently lost control of the vehicle, causing it to skid. After the motorcycle skidded, the accused got up and ran away from the scene on foot and was subsequently apprehended by the police officer who gave chase on foot.

9       Following his arrest, investigations revealed that the accused had taken and driven the motorcycle without the consent of the owner and that at the time that he was driving the motorcycle, the accused had been under disqualification. He had been convicted of an offence under Section 379A of the Penal Code on 30 October 2017 and was disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 48 months. This also meant that at the time he drove the motorcycle, there was no policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks in force.

10     Upon his arrest, the accused was found to be in possession of two cigarette boxes that contained crystalline substances, which were subsequently found to contain not less than 1.01g of methamphetamine. He also gave urine samples which were subsequently found to contain methamphetamine. The accused admitted to having consumed “ice” some days before his arrest.

### The third arrest

11     After his arrest on 18 January 2019, the accused was released on police bail on 19 January 2019. During this time, he also remained on court bail, on which he was released on 27 December 2019 for his earlier set of charges. The accused was next required to report to District Court No. 4A for a mention on 22 January 2020 at 11.30am, but he failed to do so. Consequently, a warrant to arrest was issued against him on 22 January 2020 and the accused was on the run thereafter.

12     At about 4.21pm on 27 December 2020, the police received a report from the accused’s ex-girlfriend, who reported that the accused was attempting to commit suicide and was live streaming this over social media. An island wide operation was mounted by the police to locate the accused, which eventually culminated in an operation at a carpark in Bukit Batok from 3.00am onwards on 28 December 2020.

13     While the accused spoke with his ex-girlfriend at the carpark, police approached to apprehend him. The accused noticed the officers approaching and ran towards and got into the car that he had been driving.

14     While the accused was in the car, one of the officers who pursued him grabbed hold of the windowpane of the driver’s seat window, which was partially wound down. Two other officers stood near to him, and all three were ordering the accused to step out of the car. The accused refused to step out of the car and proceeded to reverse the car at speed while the officer was holding onto the windowpane of the car. All three officers who were at the car were dragged along with the car as it was being reversed at speed by the accused. They eventually fell and sustained injuries.

15     The officer who had been holding onto the windowpane sustained multiple abrasions and a contusion of his big left toe, which was a result of the wheel of the car running over his toe while the accused was reversing at speed. He was given 5 days of outpatient medical leave.

16     In his bid to drive out of the carpark and evade arrest, the accused reversed at speed a total of three times, and each time he did so, he hit a marked police vehicle which had been deliberately placed to block his path out of the carpark. He also hit a total of seven other cars that were parked in the carpark, causing damage to the cars.

17     The accused managed to leave the carpark at Bukit Batok and was eventually arrested by the police at about 10.50am on 28 December 2020 at a unit located in Jurong East.

18     Following his arrest, the accused was administered a warning under Section 31(2) of the MDA, that it would be an offence if he failed to provide his urine sample for urine tests as required. Despite acknowledging the warning and confirming that he understood it, the accused refused to provide a urine sample. Instead, he informed the CNB officer that he would already be facing multiple charges and thus saw no difference whether he provided a urine sample or not.

### Breaches of conditional remission order

19     From 4 May 2019 to 2 April 2020 (both dates inclusive), the accused was subject to a conditional remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act. While the remission order was in effect, the accused committed the offences that are the subject of the first and second arrests in breach of the basic condition of the remission order.

20     The earliest offence he committed was on 15 August 2019, and thus the accused was liable to be punished under Section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 232 days from 15 August 2019 to 2 April 2020 (both dates inclusive) for that offence.

## Antecedents

21     The accused is traced with antecedents that date back to 2009. The remission order that he breached by the commission of the offences in this matter was issued in respect of the sentences that were imposed for convictions recorded on 30 October 2017.

22     On this occasion, the accused faced a total of 25 charges for traffic-related offences and drug-related offences. He was sentenced to a global sentence of 2 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment and a disqualification order for a period of 48 months.

## Parties’ submissions

23     Before me, parties were not far apart in their sentencing positions.

24     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of 4 years’ and 8 weeks’ imprisonment, disqualification for a period of 96 months, fine and enhanced sentence of 232 days’ imprisonment under Section 50T of the Prisons Act.

25     The Defence submitted that a global sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment, disqualification for a period of 96 months and an enhanced sentence of 232 days’ imprisonment under Section 50T of the Prisons Act was appropriate.

26     The individual sentences sought are set out in the following table:

## Reasons for the sentences imposed

### Rash act endangering human life

27     Under Section 337(a) of the Penal Code, the offence of doing an act so rashly as to endanger human life is punishable with imprisonment of up to one year, or with a fine of up to $5,000, or both.

28     The Prosecution submitted the following table of precedents where offenders had committed this offence while driving to evade arrest, causing simple hurt to public officers and were sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment for the Section 337(a) offence:

29     In submitting for a lower imprisonment term of 7 months, the Defence sought to distinguish the present case from the precedents cited by the Prosecution. Defence Counsel highlighted the fact that the chain of events leading to the operation to apprehend the accused had been triggered by his suicide attempt, and that he had subsequently been in an emotionally vulnerable state. Counsel argued that this should be contrasted with the offenders in the precedents who were in the midst of carrying out illegal activities that they knew they were being pursued for, which warranted a downward calibration for the accused in the present case.

30     What the Defence did not mention is that while the operation to apprehend the accused may have been triggered by his suicide attempt on 27 December 2020, the accused had a warrant to arrest against him and was on the run from the authorities. This is something he must have known, having been on the run for a period of about 11 months since he last failed to attend court in January 2020. In this regard, the context of his actions was not so different from the offenders in the precedent cases.

31     Even if the accused had been in an emotionally charged state following his suicide attempt, he accepted that he was aware of the risks of endangering the life of the police officer when he decided to reverse the car at speed. As the Prosecution pointed out, this was an extremely dangerous act that posed grave harm to the police officer. Considering that there were two other similar charges involving the other two police officers who were also hurt to be taken into consideration, I agreed with the prosecution that 9 months’ imprisonment was the appropriate punishment for this charge.

32     The Section 337(a) charge does not attract any mandatory disqualification order, but the Prosecution had nevertheless asked that an appropriate period of disqualification be imposed for this charge. I agree that the accused’s conduct in this charge warrants disqualification but given that the accused was already facing lengthy disqualification periods for his RTA offences I did not think it was necessary for an additional order to be given on this charge, since the disqualification periods would simply run concurrently.

### The drug-related offences

33     As a result of his previous convictions for consuming and possessing methamphetamine, the accused was liable for enhanced punishments on the following offences:

> (a)     For the offence of consumption of a specified drug under Section 8(b)(2) punishable under Section 33(4) of the MDA and Section 50T of the Prisons Act, an imprisonment term of at least 3 years and an enhanced sentence of up to 76 days;

> (b)     For the offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug under Section 8(a) punishable under Section 33(1) of the MDA and Section 50T of the Prisons Act, an imprisonment term of at least 2 years and an enhanced sentence of up to 76 days;

> (c)     For the offence of refusing to provide a urine sample without reasonable excuse when required to do so under Section 31(2) punishable under Section 33(4) of the MDA, an imprisonment term of at least 3 years.

34     As for the offence of failing to report for urine test under Reg 15(6)(a) of the MRA and punishable under Section 50T of the Prisons Act, this was punishable with imprisonment of up to 4 years, a fine of up to $10,000, or both, and an enhanced sentence of up to 232 days.

35     The consumption and possession charges that the accused pleaded guilty to were committed while he was already under investigation for an earlier set of drug offences (which are the subject of the TIC charges) and while he was on court bail for other offences. I agreed with the Prosecution that a slight uplift from the mandatory minimum sentences for these charges was warranted, which the Defence had also accepted was appropriate. I sentenced the accused to three years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment on the consumption charge and two years’ and 2 months’ imprisonment on the possession charge. I also sentenced the accused to 47 days of imprisonment as enhanced sentence under Section 50T of the Prisons Act on each charge, the reasons for which I elaborate below at \[52\].

36     As for the failure to provide a urine sample without reasonable excuse, the Prosecution submitted that an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years was warranted in view of the blatant defiance that he said that he was already facing many charges and did not see the point in giving a urine sample. While the accused was certainly blatant in his defiance, this was his first offence under Section 31(2) and given that he was already facing an enhanced sentence I did not think an uplift was necessary, and thus imposed a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment on this charge.

37     As for the failure to report for urine testing, I agreed with the Defence that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment would suffice, which is in line with the usual tariffs for first time offenders of this offence. In addition, I imposed an enhanced sentence of 116 days’ imprisonment pursuant to Section 50T of the Prisons Act, the reasons for which I set out at \[52\] below.

### The traffic offences

38     For the series of traffic offences that the accused committed on 18 January 2020, he was liable to the following punishments:

> (a)     For the offence of driving a vehicle whilst under disqualification under Section 43(4)(a) of the RTA punishable under Section 50T of the Prisons Act, a fine of up to $10,000, or up to 3 years’ imprisonment or both, and an enhanced sentence of up to 76 days’ imprisonment;

> (b)     For the offence of using a vehicle while there was no policy of insurance in force in relation to the use of the vehicle under Section 3(1) punishable under Section 3(2) and 3(3) of the MVA, and Section 50T of the Prisons Act, a fine of up to $1,000 or up to 3 months’ imprisonment or both, a mandatory disqualification period of at least 12 months, and an enhanced sentence of up to 76 days’ imprisonment;

> (c)     For the offence of taking and driving a vehicle without the consent of the owner of the vehicle under Section 96(1) RTA punishable under Section 50T Prisons Act, a fine of up to $1,000 or up to 3 months’ imprisonment or both, and an enhanced sentence of up to 76 days’ imprisonment;

> (d)     For the offence of failing to stop a vehicle when ordered by a police officer in uniform under Section 127(5) punishable under Section 131(2)(a) RTA and Section 50T Prisons Act, a fine of up to $1,000 or up to 3 months’ imprisonment or both, and an enhanced sentence of up to 76 days’ imprisonment;

> (e)     For the offence of dangerous driving under Section 64(1) punishable under Section 64(2C)(a) of the RTA and Section 50T Prisons Act, a fine of up to $5,000, or up to 12 months’ imprisonment or both, and enhanced sentence of up to 76 days’ imprisonment.

39     The Prosecution sought 8 weeks’ imprisonment and 96 months of disqualification in relation to the charge for driving whilst under disqualification, which the Defence agreed was appropriate. This was in line with the High Court’s decision in _Fam Shey Yee v Public Prosecutor_ \[2012\] SGHC, which noted that the usual tariff at that time was 4 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment. In view of the amendments to the RTA in 2019 that doubled the maximum penalty for this offence, the District Court in _Public Prosecutor v Peng Jianwen_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 93</span> held that the new starting point sentence for a first offender would now be 8 weeks’ imprisonment. This decision was upheld by the High Court upon appeal.

40     The accused was on a 48 month period of disqualification at the time of the offence. The doubling of that original period of 48 months to 96 months is in line with the approach laid down by the High Court in _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1028</span>.

41     Guided by these authorities, I imposed a sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment and ordered that the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 96 months with effect from his date of release. In addition, I imposed an enhanced sentence of 22 days’ imprisonment, the reasons for which I address at \[52\] below.

42     Parties were also in agreement as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the offence under Section 3 of the MVA. This was the accused’s fourth conviction for this offence. For his first conviction in 2015, he was sentenced to 1 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of 12 months. In 2017, he faced a total of 5 charges under Section 3 of the MVA, of which he pleaded guilty to 2 with the remaining taken into consideration for sentencing. He was sentenced to 3 weeks’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment and 2 years of disqualification on each proceeded charge.

43     In view of his previous convictions and applying the principle of escalation, I agreed with parties that a sentence of 5 weeks’ and 3 years of disqualification was appropriate in this case.

44     On the three remaining traffic charges, the Prosecution submitted for fines on the Section 64(2C) charge and the Section 96 charge, and a short custodial sentence on the charge for the Section 127(5). The Defence took the position that while fines would ordinary be appropriate for all three charges, short custodial terms should be imposed instead as the accused is impecunious and would not be able to pay the fines. The case of _Low Meng Chay v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 1 SLR(R) 46</span> was cited in support of this proposition, and the Prosecution did not seek to persuade me that it would not be appropriate to take this approach in this case.

45     For the Section 127(5) charge, the Prosecution noted that custodial sentences have been imposed in similar situations where the offender’s failure to stop was prolonged, involved other traffic offences and necessitated pursuit by the authorities. The Defence cited one case where a fine of $600 was imposed. I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold had been crossed in this case given the aggravating factors, specifically the accused’s refusal to heed the repeated signals to stop that necessitated a pursuit by the police officer on both his patrol motorcycle and by foot, as well as the dangerous driving behaviour that the accused displayed in his attempt to evade the officer. Accordingly, I imposed 1 week’s imprisonment on this charge.

46     For the charge of dangerous driving, the key parameters for determining the appropriate sentence are the harm caused by the offence and the culpability of the accused. While no harm was caused by the accused’s illegal U-turn in this case, this was an act that posed a high potential for harm, which was only fortuitously averted by the ability of the unknown car to apply the emergency brakes in time. The accused’s level of culpability was high in this case, enhanced by the fact that he was attempting to evade arrest. On the facts, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed in this case and imposed 1 week’s imprisonment and 24 months of disqualification.

47     As for the offence of taking the vehicle without the consent of the owner under Section 96, I was of the view that a fine would have ordinarily sufficed, but in view of the Defence’s indication that the accused would not be able to pay the fine, I imposed a short custodial sentence of 4 days’ imprisonment instead.

### The remaining charges

48     For the offence of failing to attend court without reasonable excuse under Section 103(5)(c) of the CPC, both parties submitted that 1 week’s imprisonment would be appropriate. There were no reported precedents for this offence, though the data available on the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIR) (as set out in the Defence’s mitigation plea) indicates that most cases under this provision have attracted between 1 to 2 weeks’ imprisonment. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 1 week’s imprisonment in this case.

49     As for the two charges under Section 426 of the Penal Code for mischief, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had clearly been crossed in view of the aggravating factors present on the facts. First was the fact that the offences occurred while the accused was attempting to evade arrest by recklessly reversing at speed. The incident took place in the carpark of a HDB estate, and damage was caused to a total of 7 cars (5 of which are the subject of the TIC charges). I agreed with parties that 3 weeks’ imprisonment on each charge was appropriate in this case.

### The enhanced sentences under Section 50T Prisons Act

50     Of the 13 charges that the accused pleaded guilty to, he was liable for enhanced punishment under Section 50T of the Prisons Act for 9 of them as they were committed during the period that he was the subject of a conditional remission order.

51     In _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>, the High Court laid down the framework for determining sentences under Section 50T of the Prisons Act. Both parties analysed the appropriate sentences to be imposed in accordance with the framework, with slight variations in the specific sentences for each charge.

52     Applying the framework in _Abdul Mutalib_, I first had to consider the gravity of the fresh offence committed and the accused’s rehabilitative prospects and determine based on these factors the appropriate sentencing band. Considering the fresh offences in the order of most serious to the least:

> (a)     The enhanced consumption and possession of drug charges were the most serious of the charges to attract the enhanced penalty. These offences are in themselves grave, and the offences for which the accused had been placed on the remission order included identical offences of consumption and possession of methamphetamine. While on the remission order, the accused committed a string of offences for failing to report for urine testing, before being arrested for consumption and possession of drugs in December 2019. Just shortly after this first arrest, he was again arrested in January 2020 for another set of consumption and possession charges. This series of offending behaviour was indicative of a complete lack of commitment to rehabilitation. Based on the assessment of the gravity of the offences and the accused’s rehabilitative prospects, I arrived at the same view as both parties that the breaches arising from these two charges was moderate and falling within Band 2, _i.e._, attracting a sentencing range of between 1/3 to 2/3 of the remaining remission period. The Defence argued that the enhanced sentence should be pegged at 50% of the remaining remission period, while the Prosecution submitted for 60%. Given the severity of the offences and the accused repeated offending behaviour, I was of the view that the enhanced sentence should be at the higher end of Band 2, and thus imposed enhanced sentences of 60% of the remaining remission duration, which was 47 days for each charge.

> (b)     The failure to report for urine testing charge was the next most serious charge to attract the enhanced penalty. For similar reasons to the consumption and possession of drugs charges, I was of the view that the breach occasioned by this offence was also of moderate severity and falling within the Band 2 sentencing range. The index offence in question was committed just 3 months into the remission period, and in total, the accused failed to report for urine testing on 130 occasions from August 2019 to December 2020, which was indicative of a lack of will and committed to be rehabilitated and remain drug free. The accused did in fact go on to commit other drug offences during this time. I agreed with both parties that the appropriate enhanced sentence to be imposed on this charge was 50% of the remaining remission duration, which was 116 days.

> (c)     The next most serious charge that attracted an enhanced sentence was the charge for driving whilst under disqualification. Both Prosecution and Defence submitted the breach occasioned by this offence to be of low severity, but I considered this to be of moderate severity and therefore falling within Band 2. The offence of driving whilst under disqualification has been described as being “_as serious an offence as a motorist can commit and evinces a blatant disregard for the law_” (see _Muhammad Saiful_ at \[11\]), and in this particular case the accused’s disregard for the law could not have been more blatant. The offences for which the remission order was made in this case included a whole raft of traffic related offences, including multiple charges of driving without a licence and without the requisite insurance policy. Disqualification orders were made on several of these charges, the longest order being for a period of 48 months. Apart from the index offence, which was committed on 18 January 2020, the accused also committed a similar offence which is the subject of a TIC charge in December 2020. Under Band 2, the sentencing range for this charge would have been between 25 and 50 days imprisonment.

53     However, under the third step of the framework in _Abdul Mutalib_, the High Court held that where multiple fresh offences are involved, the cumulative sentence under Section 50T of the Prisons Act must not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offender’s earliest offence.

54     At the date of the earliest offence in this case, the remaining duration of the remission order was 232 days. This was therefore the upper limit of the cumulative enhanced sentences that could be imposed in the present case. As such I adjusted the enhanced sentence on the driving under disqualification charge to 22 days’ imprisonment so that the cumulative enhanced sentences imposed would not exceed 232 days of imprisonment.

55     Having reached the upper limit of 232 days of cumulative enhanced sentence, I did not proceed to consider the enhanced sentences that the accused was liable for under the remaining 5 charges.

56     The final step of the _Abdul Mutalib_ framework is to take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case to determine whether the aggregate sentence is crushing and not keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects. Given the extent of the accused’s reoffending behaviour in this case, which represents a clear escalation in offending behaviour from his previous set of convictions, I did not think that the imposition of the full 232 days of cumulative enhanced sentence was crushing in the circumstances and accordingly no adjustment was required.

### Consecutive sentences

57     As I had convicted and sentenced the accused to imprisonment for more than 3 distinct offences, I was bound by Section 307(1) of the CPC to order at least 2 of these sentences to run consecutively.

58     The Prosecution had asked for 3 imprisonment terms to run consecutively, noting that given the wide range of offences that the accused had committed, his repeated attempts to evade arrest and reoffences while on bail, this was in fact a rather lenient approach. The Defence similarly asked that 3 sentences be ordered to run consecutively.

59     Given the range of offences that the accused has been convicted of, which were committed over a lengthy period, I was of the view that the overall criminality of the offender’s conduct could not be encompassed in two consecutive sentences. In addition to the 3 sentences that parties agreed should be ordered to run consecutively, I also ordered a fourth sentence – for the offence of failing to attend court without reasonable excuse – to run consecutively.

60     In deciding which sentences were to run consecutively, I bore in mind the one-transaction rule and the totality principle as set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>. Each of the 4 charges ordered to run consecutively involved offences that invaded distinct legally protected interests and could not be considered as being part of the same transaction.

61     I was also of the view that the totality principle had not been offended, and that in view of the accused’s entire set of offending conduct, his record and prospects, the overall sentence imposed was not a crushing sentence. In coming to this conclusion, I was also mindful of the fact that pursuant to Section 50T(5) of the Prisons Act, the enhanced sentences imposed on the accused, which totalled 232 days in this case, are also to run consecutively to the other terms of imprisonment imposed on the accused.

62     I would also add that there were no significant mitigating factors that weighed in the accused’s favour in this matter. While he had pleaded guilty to the offences, I was cognisant that the evidence of his offences was overwhelming and that he had to be arrested multiple times by the police, the last of which involved significant police resources for an island wide operation, and as such I did not accord full weight to this as a mitigating factor.

## Conclusion

63     In summary, these were the sentences imposed on the accused:

64     The total sentence imposed was 4 years’ and 9 weeks’ imprisonment, an enhanced sentence of 232 days’ imprisonment, and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 96 months with effect from the date of release.

65     I ordered the sentence to be backdated to the date the accused was first arrested on 19 December 2019 and directed that the periods that the accused was either out on bail or not in remand be excluded. These periods were:

> (a)     27 December 2019 to 18 January 2020. The accused was released on bail on 27 December 2019 until his second arrest on 18 January 2020;

> (b)     19 January 2020 to 28 December 2020. Following his arrest on 18 January 2020, the accused was held in custody until 19 January 2020 when he was released on police bail. He was already on court bail since 27 December 2019 and was required to attend court on 22 January 2020. When he failed to attend court on 22 January 2020, his bail was revoked and a warrant to arrest was issued against him. He was on the run until his final arrest on 28 December 2020 and has been in custody since that date.

66     The accused is currently serving the imprisonment term.
