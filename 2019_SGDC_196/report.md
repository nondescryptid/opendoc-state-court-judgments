\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9190/2019/01.\]

23 September 2019

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to two charges, namely:

> (a)     MAC 903161/2019

> … that you, 12th day of February 2018, at or about 9.40am, at Pasir Ris Polyclinic located at No 1 Pasir Ris Drive 4, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Ahmad Fakruddin Bin Abdullah, to wit, by slapping him on his left cheek, causing him to suffer a bruise on his left cheek, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”); and

> (b)     DAC 909954/2019

> … that you, on the 22nd day of December 2018, at or about 7.35pm, at the vicinity of Asian Haven located at No. 94 Pasir Ris Central, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Lee Shwn Ching (“Shwn Ching”), to wit, by punching her right wrist, causing the said Lee Shwn Ching to suffer from right wrist ulnar avulsion fracture, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code.

2       One charge of voluntarily causing hurt to one Lee Kean Chean (“Kean Chean”), to wit, by punching him on his head three times, causing faint redness over his right temporal area and musculoskeletal pain, an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code, was taken into consideration.

3       I sentenced the Accused to 12 months of reformative training.

4       The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed an appeal against it. At the time of the writing of these grounds of decision, he is serving sentence.

5       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentence.

#### The Statement of Facts

6       The following has been admitted by the Accused without any qualification. The accused is Jabin Lim Kang Ming, a 21-year-old male Chinese Singaporean. His date of birth is 24 August 1998. At the material time of his offences, he was a national serviceman. He was 19 years old at the time of the first offence and 20 years old at the time of the second and third offences.

#### Facts relating to the charge DAC-909954-2019

7       Investigations revealed that on 22 December 2018 at or about 7.30pm, the Accused approached a drinks stall in Asian Haven located at No 94 Pasir Ris Central, Singapore to buy a drink. The Accused asked for a staff discount from Kean Chean, a 32-year-old male Malaysian working as a stall assistant at Asian Haven, on the ground that the Accused’s father was working at the fishing shop near Asian Haven. Kean Chean told the Accused that there was no more discount for staff. The Accused then became upset with Kean Chean and this escalated into an argument.

8       The Accused suddenly took off his shirt, wrapped it around his fist and jumped over the counter to where Kean Chean was standing. Kean Chean ran out from behind the stall counter and was chased by the Accused. The Accused punched Kean Chean twice on his head, causing his spectacles to fall off.

9       Upon seeing this, Shwn Ching, a 51-year-old female who was a stall manager at Asian Haven, intervened and tried to block the Accused from continuing to punch Kean Chean. In the course of the scuffle, the Accused punched Shwn Ching once on her right wrist and managed to punch Kean Chean on the head once more.

10     After the police were called, Kean Chean and Shwn Ching were conveyed to Changi General Hospital. The medical report from Changi General Hospital diagnosed Shwn Ching with a right wrist ulnar avulsion fracture and she was given 17 days of medical leave.

11     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code.

#### Facts relating to the charge MAC-903161-2019

12     Investigations revealed that on 12 February 2018 at or about 9.30am, the Accused was at Pasir Ris Polyclinic to accompany his younger brother for a medical consultation. The Accused noticed his younger brother was in a conversation with the victim, one Ahmad Fakruddin Bin Abdullah, a 16-year old male Singaporean. Who is his brother’s friend. The Accused overheard their conversation and was unhappy with the way the victim spoke to his younger brother.

13     While the victim was standing at the counter of the polyclinic, the Accused confronted him and slapped him on his left cheek. He also tackled the victim to the ground. The witness, one Sazali Bin Abi, who was working as a security guard, then intervened to separate the Accused from the victim. As a result, of the slap, the victim suffered a bruise on his left cheek. The victim did not seek medical attention for any injury sustained.

14     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code.

#### Antecedent records

15     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

16     The Prosecution sought for the Accused to be sentenced to reformative training on the ground that there was a need for deterrence within the overarching consideration for rehabilitation. The Prosecution highlighted 5 reasons.

17     First, there was a need for specific deterrence. The Accused had shown a marked propensity for violence and difficulty containing rage. The Prosecution referred to page 2 of the Probation Report at the 1st and 3rd bullet points under the heading of “Risk factors”, where it was stated:

> “Impulsivity, poor anger management and poor decision-making skills resulted in his commission of the offences”; and

> “Propensity for violence as a learned reaction to perceived threats.”

18     The Prosecution pointed that a similar observation was reflected in Reformative Training Centre report at page 6 – under the heading of “personality/behaviour” where it was stated the based on interviews, the Accused had shown a pattern of “using threats and physical violence to resolve matters.”

19     Secondly, the Accused had resorted to violence arising from trivial matters, for example, over a 40 cents discount at a drink stall (the second and third charges) and being unhappy with how his brother was spoken to by the victim (the first charge).

20     Thirdly, the 2nd and 3rd charges were committed whilst he was on station bail for the first charge.

21     Fourthly, the section 325 of the Penal Code charge was very serious and he had hurt an elderly 51-year old, fracturing the ulna.

22     Fifthly, this offence occurred in public area with numerous people around thus causing public disquiet and danger to others.

#### Mitigation

23     The Accused claimed that the victim had screamed at him while he was talking to him nicely and the victim had challenged him to a fight. The Accused asserted that he was thus provoked. The Accused asked for a chance to change as this was his first time in court.

24     He also highlighted that from the day of the 2nd and 3rd charges, he did not commit any further offences. He then pleaded for a chance at probation. He pointed out that he was having a proper job working from Mondays to Fridays and part time on weekends. He asserted that he could complete probation and comply with the conditions of probation.

#### Principle of Sentencing

25     This is a case where the Accused is a young offender as he was 19 and 20 years old at the time of the two offences. He pleaded guilty to the offences just before turning 21 years old.

26     It is well established that rehabilitation would take centre stage as a sentencing consideration for young offenders below the age of 21, given that their capacity for reform would be greater during the formative years of their lives. It has also been generally accepted that the young would be more impulsive and did not know better.

27     The Courts have applied a 2-step inquiry in the sentencing of young offenders:

> i.     the first stage is to identify and prioritize the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence; and

> ii     the second stage is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that is placed on the relevant ones-

>> see _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari in Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> at \[77-78\] and _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span>_ at \[28\].

28     Applying these principles to the present case, I found that the rehabilitation is still a relevant consideration. The harm caused in all the 3 acts of violence committed by the Accused was not so serious to rule out rehabilitation as the primary sentencing principle. This was also the first time the Accused had landed in court so there was no long history of criminal behaviour.

29     This was also the position taken by both prosecution and the Accused. The only issue is which is the most appropriate rehabilitative regime to adopt under the 2nd stage of the inquiry.

30     I found that, at this second stage of the inquiry, a more deterrent element needed to be reflected in the sentence. The Accused had escalated in his violent behaviour after the first incident of violence.

31     In the first incident of violence, the Accused had acted in a thuggish manner, taking upon himself to teach the younger victim a lesson just because the Accused did not like the way the victim spoke with his younger brother. He had no qualms in slapping the victim’s face in the presence of other people at a medical clinic and wrestling the victim to the ground, causing disturbance to all present in the clinic.

32     Thereafter, despite being under police investigations and bail for this act of violence, the Accused did not control his volatile anger and allowed himself to be provoked to violent behaviour again over another trivial matter. This time, it was over a drink stall assistant not willing to give him a discount on a drink. The Accused did not merely lash out impulsively in anger. He embarked on a series of actions showing a conscious decision to cause hurt. He removed his shirt and wrapped it around his fist and then jumped over the counter to attack the first victim. The first victim had tried to flee but unfortunately was caught by the Accused and received 2 punches to his head. When the 2nd victim intervened to stop the Accused, the Accused had no qualms in hitting the 2nd victim as well despite her being an older person and a female. He hit her with such force that it fractured her wrist bone. The Accused was relentless in his determination to continue with his attack on the first victim as despite this intervention by the second victim, he managed to punch the first victim on the head once more.

33     The Accused showed a blatant lack of regard for the consequences of his action and no restraint over his anger. The fact that he was already under investigation for an act of violence had no restraining effect on him. Hence, I am of the view that while there is room for rehabilitation, the Accused need to realise that he cannot unleash his anger in violence with impunity. Where serious harm had been caused, deterrence and retribution will take on more prominence. There is certainly a need to send out both a specific and general deterrence message here to the Accused and to all like-minded persons who are prone to resort to violence to give vent to their anger.

34     Therefore, reformative training would clearly prima facie be the appropriate sentence.

35     I then considered whether there is a case nonetheless for probation for the Accused. It has been held that probation can be granted even in serious offences where the capacity for rehabilitation for the Accused is “demonstrably high” or other factors are present giving rise to a “compelling case for lenience” – see _PP v Adith s/o Savortham_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 649</span> at \[14\] and \[19\].

36     The threshold for such grounds generally would be higher than an ordinary case for which probation has been recommended. Viewed in this light, I found that the Probation Report although recommending probation did not provide for such compelling grounds.

37     Numerous risk factors were highlighted:

> i.     Impulsivity, poor anger management and poor decision-making skills resulted in his commission of the offences;

> ii.     Modelled after father, and internalised pro-violent attitudes and cognitive distortions that supported the use of aggression to resolve conflicts;

> iii.     Propensity for violence as a learned reaction to perceived threats;

> iv.     Demonstrated low victim empathy, which resulted in his deflection of blame onto the victims for his actions and minimised his acts of aggression as justifiable to the circumstances.

38     The protective factors in contrast are relatively muted and recent:

> i.     Expressed regret for committing the offences as his actions had caused trouble for his family;

> ii.     Adherence to trial time restriction highlights his ability to behave pro-socially;

> iii.     Willing to receive intervention to curb his offending behaviours;

> iv.     Recognised the need to be constructively engaged and stayed employed after being released on bail;

> v.     Father and stepmother’s openness to improve their parenting indicates support for his rehabilitation.

39     The protective factors were mostly either verbal averments or actions taken recently. These, while helpful to the Accused in pointing towards him being capable of rehabilitating, would not be considered as exceptional factors.

40     The parental support was not exceptional. It was just an expressed openness to improve their parenting. It is noted that the Accused had previously been placed under Guidance Programme in 2014[^1]. He did not complete it successfully and breach action was taken against him. Clearly any parental influence did not help the Accused at that time.

41     In any case, I also have doubt over the influence of the Accused’s father as to whether it will be a positive one. During the assessment of probation, the Accused claimed that he did not punch the second victim ‘Shwn Ching’ and instead alleged that it was the first victim who had pushed the second victim away resulting in her falling, fracturing her wrist. The father corroborated this version[^2]. This version contradicted the Statement of Facts which the Accused had pleaded guilty to earlier where he had admitted to hitting the second victim on her wrist resulting in a fractured bone. This was the basis of the conviction of the section 325 of the Penal Code charge. Upon being confronted with this contradiction, the Accused withdrew his allegation in the Probation Report and instead agreed that he is maintaining his admission to the Statement of Facts and his plea of guilt. This episode showed that the Accused’s father was prepared to support his son even if that is not helpful to the Accused. Hence, it was not surprising that the Accused appeared to be still in a state of denial as set out in the Probation Report that he blamed the victims as “he felt that they started the fights and deserved what came to them. He was also upset and felt that it was unfair that the second victim had blamed him for the hurt she sustained when he did not touch her”[^3].

42     It was also reported that the Accused started “having late nights again visiting night clubs and pubs in 2017, from 9pm up to 6am, with peers **_or with his father_**”[^4]. He thus did not have a very strong positive role model in his father. It is also not surprising that this was also listed as one of the risk factors in the Probation Report that the Accused “\[m\]odelled after father, and internalised pro-violent attitudes and cognitive distortions that supported the use of aggression to resolve conflicts” –see \[37\] above.

43     Turning to the Reformative Training Report, while there were positive comments particularly about the Accused being “an individual who was inclined towards a more conventional lifestyle, evidenced by him being gainfully engaged in employment and his constructive use of leisure time”[^5], it also presented the Accused as someone who has deep-seated issues in relation to conflict resolution and use of violence with a relatively long history of violent behaviour.

44     It was noted in the Reformative Training Report from interviewing the Accused that there was a pattern of the Accused using threats and physical violence to resolve matters. When he was 12 years old, he has assaulted his mother on a few occasions to retaliate against her excessive use of physical force to discipline him. When he was 15, he had assaulted a group of classmates who had bullied him, claiming that he had acted in self-defence. He also shared that in 2014 when he was working at a food stall, he had confronted a customer with a kitchen knife who had complained about the long waiting time[^6].

#### Conclusion

45     Hence, considering all the factors, I found that clearly a more deterrent approach under the overarching umbrella of rehabilitation is warranted in the present case. The Reformative Training Report has recommended for the Accused to undergo Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, which would require interventions to be delivered over a 12-month period. Accordingly, I have imposed a sentence of reformative training for a minimum period of 12 months’ detention.
