### Deputy Registrar Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This action arose from a dispute between two competing hair salons offering hair replacement services. The Plaintiff, JPG Enterprise Pte Ltd, sued the Defendant, Hairspec Private Limited, for copyright infringement. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had unlawfully reproduced an advertorial write-up authored by the Plaintiff. The Defendant brought this application to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim on the basis that the write-up lacked the requisite originality to warrant copyright protection. After hearing parties, I dismissed the application on the basis that there were triable issues. The Defendant has appealed against my decision. I now deliver the written grounds of my decision, beginning with a brief summary of the facts.

## Background facts

2       Both parties used the same write-up to promote and advertise a hair replacement service on their respective websites. The Plaintiff’s write-up reads:[^1]

> Our unique and revolutionary hair system is undetectable and the latest in hair loss solutions. It consists of human hair that has been implanted into a micro-thin layer of artificial skin. We then gently bond this artificial skin with the implanted hair onto your scalp. The whole procedure is pain-free, non-surgical and takes less than 90 minutes.

3       An identically worded write-up was published on the Defendant’s website, save that the phrase “90 mins” reads “60 mins”.[^2] For ease of reference, I shall refer to the write-ups published on the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s website as the “Plaintiff’s Advertisement” and “Defendant’s Advertisement”.

4       The hair replacement service essentially entails the implantation of hair onto the customer’s scalp. The salient features of the treatment process was described as follows:[^3]

> (a)     First, the salon would assess the customer’s scalp and hair to determine, amongst others, its colour, texture and thickness.

> (b)     Next, the salon would match the customer’s hair to a list of available toupees. The toupee, unlike regular toupee, is made up of human hair that is implanted onto a film which serves as a layer of artificial human skin.

> (c)     Once a suitable toupee has been selected, the salon would bond the artificial skin onto the customer’s scalp.

> (d)     The salon would then trim the hair from the toupee to a length and style that suits the customer’s preference.

> (e)     The entire treatment process takes around 60 to 90 minutes to complete.

5       The Plaintiff claims that it was the original author of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement. Its pleaded case is that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement was drafted, selected and arranged by its director through his skill, labour and independent judgment, and was first published on its website in or around May 2015.[^4] According to the Defendant, the Defendant’s Advertisement was first published in or around March or April 2017.[^5] Upon discovering that the Defendant’s Advertisement was a replica of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement, the Plaintiff commenced this action for copyright infringement.

## Parties’ submissions

6       The Defendant’s striking out application was initially brought under all four limbs of O 18 r 19(1)(_a_)-(_d_) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). At the hearing, counsel for the Defendant, Mr Victor Choy (“Mr Choy”) clarified that the submissions would focus on O 18 r 19(1)(_a_) and (_b_), namely, that the pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action, and alternatively, that the claim was plainly and obviously unsustainable. The central premise of the Defendant’s submission was the Plaintiff’s Advertisement does not fulfil the requirement of originality for the following reasons:

> (a)     the Plaintiff’s Advertisement was preceded by at least four identically worded works. The prior works were published in 2014 – about one year prior to the publication of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement;[^6]

> (b)     the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is nothing more than a description of its hair treatment process;[^7]

> (c)     the Plaintiff’s Advertisement does not pass the _de minimis_ threshold required to warrant copyright protection;[^8] and

> (d)     the Plaintiff has not produced any supporting evidence to show that it is the original author of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement.[^9]

7       In its written submissions, the Plaintiff argued that originality does not equate to a finding of novelty.[^10] At the hearing, counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Arivanantham s\\o Krishnan (“Mr Arivanantham”) argued that the question of originality was not suitable for summary determination. In this regard, he argued that striking out its claim now would deny the Plaintiff of the opportunity to cross-examine the authors of the prior works cited by the Defendant, which could shed light on whether those prior works themselves could possibly warrant copyright protection. In addition, he put the Defendant to strict proof of the authenticity of the prior works. He sought to distinguish the Plaintiff’s Advertisement from short, descriptive phrases found by courts to have fallen short of the threshold of originality. He further argued that the affidavit averment on authorship made by the Plaintiff’s director is sufficient to resist a striking out application.

## General legal principles on striking out applications

8       The power to strike out pleadings is a draconian one which should not be exercised unless the claim is wholly devoid of merit (_Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 444</span> at \[23\]; see also _Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Vivek Sudarshan Khabya_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1124</span> at \[38\]). The threshold that the applicant has to meet is a high one – the claim must be not just improbable but _impossible_ (_Koh Kim Teck v Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 52</span> at \[21\]; _Lim Kok Lian v Lee Patricia and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 272</span> at \[12\]). To resist a striking out application, all the respondent needs to show is that there are triable issues of fact and law (_Qroi Ltd v Pascoe, Ian and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 36</span> at \[6\]). The mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out (_Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> (“_Gabriel Peter_”) at \[21\]).

9       To strike out a claim under O 18 r 19(1)(_a_), the applicant must show that the pleadings themselves (i.e. without reference to affidavit evidence) fail to disclose a reasonable cause of action.

10     To strike out a claim under O 18 r 19(1)(_b_), the applicant must show that the claim is either legally or factually unsustainable. These concepts were explained in _The “Bunga Melati 5”_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 546</span> (“_The Bunga Melati 5_”) at \[39\] to mean as follows:

> (a)     A claim would be _legally_ unsustainable if the remedy sought would not be granted even if the claimant succeeds in proving all the facts that he seeks to prove.

> (b)     A claim would be _factually_ unsustainable if it can be said with confidence before trial that the factual basis of the claim is “fanciful” because it is “entirely without substance”.

## General legal principles on copyright protection

11     Originality is the touchstone of copyright. Copyright protection may only be conferred upon “original” works. To qualify as an original work, the claimant has to establish two key matters:

> (a)     first, the work had originated from him without copying; and

> (b)     second, the work was sufficiently creative or required sufficient skill and judgment in its creation. The precise quantum of creativity, skill and judgment required is a fact-specific inquiry to be determined on a case-by-case basis. That said, the level of creativity required is “extremely low” and that the work need not be “inventive” or “novel”.

> (_Asia Pacific Publishing Pte Ltd v Pioneers & Leaders (Publishers) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 381</span> (“_Asia Pacific Publishing_”) at \[20\]-\[33\]; _Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 185</span> (“_Global Yellow Pages (CA)_”) at \[24\]; _Auvi Pte Ltd v Seah Siew Tee and another_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 786</span> (“_Auvi_”) at \[32\]).

12     With the general principles in mind, I turn to address each of the Defendant’s contentions in sequence.

## Discussion

### Do the prior publications preclude copyright protection?

13     The Defendant relied on prior publications to defeat the Plaintiff’s claim of originality. In this regard, the Defendant exhibited copies of at least four (4) identically worded write-ups on the internet used by hair salons, manufacturers or suppliers to describe, market or advertise what appears to be the same treatment offered by the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The four write-ups were purportedly published within the period of one year prior to the publication of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement.

14     To my mind, two issues emerge for consideration. Does the mere existence of a prior publication preclude an author of a subsequent publication from asserting copyright? If not, are prior publications nevertheless relevant to the assessment of originality?

#### Originality does not mean novelty

15     In my view, the starting point of the analysis should be that a prior publication does not _ipso facto_ preclude copyright protection. It would be evident that the twin requirements of originality set out at \[11\] above do not go as far as to require the claimant to prove that he was the first in time to produce the work. To impose such a requirement would be tantamount to elevating the requirement of originality to mean “novelty” or “inventiveness” – definitions which courts have repeatedly rejected (see \[24\] below). As stated above (at \[11\]), copyright law does not require the expression to be in original or novel form. The word “original” does not bear its dictionary meaning of “first or earliest, fresh and unusual, able to think of or carry out new ideas or concepts” or “the first and genuine form of something, from which others are copied” (see Susanna H S Leong, _Intellectual Property Law of Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2013) at \[03.036\]). It follows from this that two authors of identical works may each be entitled to assert copyright over his or her own work, so long as the work independently “originated” from each author in that it was not slavishly copied from another source.

16     I am fortified in my view by the following observation made by the Supreme Court of the United States in the seminal decision of _Feist Publications, Inc v Rural Telephone Service Co_, 499 U.S. 340 (1991), _per_ O’Connor J:

> … Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity. 1 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright §§2.01\[A\], \[B\] (1990) (hereinafter Nimmer). To be sure, the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, “no matter how crude, humble or obvious” it might be. Id., §1.08\[C\]. _Originality does not signify novelty; a work may be original even though it closely resembles other works so long as the similarity is fortuitous, not the result of copying. To illustrate, assume that two poets, each ignorant of the other, compose identical poems. Neither work is novel, yet both are original and, hence, copyrightable._ …

> \[emphasis added\]

17      _Feist_ has been cited with approval by our Court of Appeal (see _Asia Pacific Publishing_ at \[38\] and _Global Yellow Pages (CA)_ at \[15\] and \[27\]). In my judgment, the above observations in _Feist_ should apply with equal force to the concept of originality under Singapore law.

18     Of course, that is not to say the existence of prior publications is wholly irrelevant to the inquiry; it undoubtedly is. Prior publications may indicate that the work in issue is something that comes to the mind easily, requiring virtually no intellectual input. This is why expressions that are commonplace and hackneyed do not warrant copyright protection. The more common and longstanding an expression, the less likely it will warrant copyright protection. Further, the more closely a piece of work resembles prior publications, the stronger the inference that the work is not a product of independent creation.

19     Put another way, prior publications are relevant to the assessment of originality. But its mere existence should not _ipso facto_ mean that the subsequent publication lacks the requisite originality. The inquiry, in my view, should remain focused on whether the twin requirements of originality are satisfied, namely (1) whether the subsequent publication was independently created by the author and (2) whether the subsequent publication was sufficiently creative (see \[11\] above). This inquiry is ultimately a value judgment that does not lend itself to a precise or rigid formula. Each case would have to be determined on its particular facts.

#### The cases relied upon by the Defendant should not detract from the established definition of originality

20     The Defendant relied on two cases to show that Courts have denied copyright protection owing to the existence of prior works. In my judgment, the two cases do not take the Defendant’s case very far. Neither of them should detract from the principles stated at \[15\]-\[19\] above.

21     The first of the two cases is _Dicks v Yates_ (1880) 18 Ch D 76 (“_Dick v Yates_”), where the English Court of Appeal found that copyright did not subsist in a title “_Splendid Misery_”. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court found that a novel published in 1801 had used the exact same phrase as its title (at 88-89). The Defendant relied on this finding to argue that the existence of prior publications in this case similarly defeated the Plaintiff’s claim.

22     In my view, that holding must be read in the context that the prior work was published almost _80 years_ before the plaintiff’s publication. This context is crucial to the Court’s finding. As Jessel M.R. explained, that phrase would likely have been “read and heard hundreds of times” through the passage of time. Lush LJ observed that “there is hardly a person who has grown to maturity in this country who has not read them hundreds of times and heard them spoken hundreds of times” (at 92). It was in that context that the Court found that the evidence sufficiently substantiated a finding that the phrase was “hackneyed” and “common”. Viewed from this perspective, the Court did not lay down a general proposition that the mere existence of a prior publication would invariably preclude copyright. It was the _repeated usage_ of the exact same phrase over a _long period of time_ that demonstrated a lack of creativity in the expression. This is entirely consistent with the principle that expressions are that are commonplace and hackneyed do not warrant copyright protection (see \[18\] above). Whether an expression is sufficiently commonplace to deny copyright protection is a question of fact and degree. Each case turns on its facts.

23     Properly understood, _Dick v Yates_ is arguably distinguishable. Quite apart from the fact that the Plaintiff is challenging the authenticity and veracity of the four prior publications, even assuming they are duly proven (see \[30\] below), the expression, unlike that in _Dick v Yates_ which was used hundreds of times over several decades, was only used four times within a short span of one year. Whether or not that renders it sufficiently commonplace to deny copyright protection is a question of fact that should be determined by the trial judge. Suffice to say, the factual scenario in _Dick v Yates_ appears to be vastly different. _Dick v Yates_ therefore does not justify a summary dismissal of the claim.

24     It is also interesting to note that _Dicks v Yates_ drew an analogy with the concept of novelty in patent law (see 89 and 92). Those comments are, in my view, strictly speaking _obiter dicta_. In any event, with respect, this holding can no longer be good law, in light of subsequent authorities that have repeatedly eschewed that analogy. Such authorities are legion; for instance, see _Asia Pacific Publishing_ at \[101\]; _Auvi_ at \[32\]; _University of London Press, Limited v University Tutorial Press, Limited_ \[1916\] 2 Ch 601 at 608-609; _Fleming v Fletcher Concrete Infrastructure Ltd_ \[2007\] BCL 161 (“_Fleming v Fletcher_”) at \[86\]; and _Henkel KGaA v Holdfast New Zealand Ltd_ \[2006\] 1 NZLR 577 (“_Henkel_”) at \[37\]). See also Susanna H S Leong, _Intellectual Property Law of Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2013) at \[03.039\] and Ng-Loy Wee Loon, _Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2014) (“_Law of Intellectual Property of_ Singapore”) at \[6.3.27\]. The jurisprudential dichotomy between originality and novelty is now well entrenched not only in Singapore but also across much of the Commonwealth.

25     The second case of _Sinanide v La Maison Kosmeo_ (1928) 139 LT 365 (“_Sinanide_”) also does not assist the Defendant. In this case, the English Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s finding of originality in the phrase “Beauty is a social necessity, not a luxury”, upon the introduction of fresh evidence on appeal showing that another advertiser had previously used a similar phrase: “A youthful appearance is a modern necessity”. I decline to follow _Sinanide_ for two reasons.

26     First, the exact date of the prior publication, which is relevant to assessing how commonplace an expression had become, is not apparent from the written judgment. The precedential value offered by this case is therefore limited. In any event, the _Sinanide_ is arguably distinguishable. According to Greer LJ’s judgment, the expression was used “many years ago”. In the present case, the four prior works were published within the short span of one year before the publication of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement. Once again, on this count alone, the _Sinanide_ is not on all fours, and does not inexorably defeat the Plaintiff’s claim.

27     Beyond that, _Sinanide_, like _Dick v Yates_, is no longer good law, insofar as it is construed to stand the proposition that a mere existence of a prior publication itself is sufficient to defeat a copyright claim. As I have explained above (at \[15\]-\[19\] and \[24\]), a more granular analysis should be undertaken, focussing on the extent to which the expression had taken root in public discourse. In my view, _Sinanide_ is better rationalised on the doctrine of _de minimis_, namely, that the intellectual input was, on the facts of that case, too insignificant to justify copyright protection. Indeed, Scrutton LJ expressly said that the doctrine of _de minimis_ applied on the facts of the case. _Sinanide_ was also cited for the _de minimis_ doctrine in _Kirk v Fleming_ (1928-35) MacG Cop Cas 44 at 49.

#### Whether or not the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is sufficiently original should be determined by the trial judge

28     Despite its strenuous reliance on _Dick v Yates_ and _Sinanide_, the Defendant did not go so far as to assert that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement must necessarily be a copy or unoriginal by virtue of its resemblance to the prior publications. At the hearing, Mr Choy clarified that the Defendant’s case was that the prior publications gave rise to an _inference_ that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is not original.[^11] That may well be correct. However, the fact that it gives rise to no more an inference is precisely why this inquiry is not suitable for summary determination. At this nascent stage of the proceedings, I am unable to express a conclusive view on the _strength_ of the inference. Further, the Plaintiff should be given an opportunity to _repel_ the inference at trial. I arrived at this view for a number of reasons.

29     First, the mere existence of prior publications is not the end of the inquiry. The _originality_ of such prior publications is relevant to determining how “original” the Plaintiff’s Advertisement was at the time of its publication. The printouts of the four prior publications are inconclusive as to whether these publications were original works themselves. It is premature to rule out the possibility that these publications were mere copies, which, if proven at trial, could well undermine the Defendant’s case.

30     Second, the _accuracy_ of the prior publications is in issue. At the hearing, Mr Arivanantham said that the Plaintiff does not admit to the authenticity of the prior publications exhibited to the Defendant’s affidavit. In response, Mr Choy invited the Court to verify the content (comprising Facebook posts and web articles) on the internet. I declined to do so for two reasons.

> (a)     First, the proper juncture to consider authenticity is after inspection (see _Fermin Aldabe v Standard Chartered Bank_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 194</span> (“_Fermin_”) at \[46\] and O 27 r 4(2) of the ROC). Before me, parties have yet to provide general discovery, let alone conduct inspection. If upon inspection, the Plaintiff puts authenticity into issue, the usual course would be for the Defendant to prove the documents in accordance with the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) _at trial_ (_Fermin_ at \[50\]). In this regard, sections 66 and 67 of the Evidence Act require the Defendant to produce primary or secondary evidence for inspection during the trial (_Jet Holding Ltd and Others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Another and Other Appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 3 SLR(R) 769</span> (“_Jet Holding_”) at \[37\]-\[38\]). Where the case turns on the authenticity of certain documents, parties are also at liberty to seek a preliminary determination of the issue pursuant to O 14 r 12 of the ROC, which would allow for cross-examination of the relevant witnesses.

> (b)     Second, the printouts (dated August 2019) and the present content of the webpages may not necessarily correspond with the contents of the webpages as at the purported date of publication in 2014. It is one thing to prove existing web content, but quite another to prove historical web content. Existing web content may easily be verified by a basic internet search. The approach is less straightforward for historical content. The results of a basic internet search done today may not necessarily correlate with the content that existed at a prior point in time. The internet is not static. Web contents, after its initial posting, are susceptible to edits, which may or may not be readily apparent on the current webpage. At the hearing, Mr Arivanantham questioned whether the prior works were indeed posted on the websites on the stated dates. In these circumstances, the Plaintiff should be allowed to conduct its own investigations and, if necessary, refute the inferences that may be drawn from the evidence adduced by the Defendant. By way of illustration, evidence that could shed light on the accuracy of the printouts – as at the purported date of publication – would include:

>> (i)       testimony of witnesses who created or maintained the website; and

>> (ii)       digitally archived webpages from archival services such as Wayback Machine, Google Cache and Coral Cache

> (see Hon. Paul W. Grimm, _et al, Best Practices for Authenticating Digital Evidence_ (West Academic Publishing, 2016) at p 16 and Deborah R. Eltgroth, _Best Evidence and the Wayback Machine: Toward a Workable Authentication Standard for Archived Internet Evidence_, 78 Fordham L. Rev. 181 (2009) at 186).

31     Third, the present evidence does not justify a summary determination of the issue of independent authorship. Thus far, the relevant materials placed before the Court are mainly (1) internet printouts of the prior publications; and (2) an affidavit testimony of the Plaintiff’s director deposing that he is the original author of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement. The former may amount to _circumstantial_ evidence showing that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is a mere copy. The latter may amount to _direct_ evidence at trial. At this stage, these materials do not carry sufficient probative value to sustain a summary determination of the matter. The proper approach is to test the veracity of the allegations and inferences at trial. As observed in Jeffrey Pinsler SC, _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at \[2.004\], the potential value of any evidence – whether direct or circumstantial – largely depends on its vulnerability to challenge in the course of cross-examination and by other contradictory or inconsistent evidence. Without the benefit of pre-trial processes, cross-examination at trial, and in the absence of contradictory evidence, I am unable to express a conclusive view on this issue. While the uncanny resemblance may seem too much of a coincidence, the Plaintiff should not be barred from leading evidence to show that the resemblance is nevertheless fortuitous. The burden is on the Plaintiff to prove its case at trial. If it manages to discharge that burden, copyright may well subsist in the Plaintiff’s Advertisement.

32     Fourth, the above discussion traverses both issues of fact and law, some of which are arguably novel. I am conscious that some of these issues do not appear to have been decided by Singapore Courts, and novel issues of law are usually not appropriate for summary determination (see _AYW v AYX_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 1183</span> at \[35\] and _Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others v Nurdian Cuaca and other_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 117</span> at \[63\]). The trial judge, who would have the benefit of considering all the factual circumstances in the round, is better suited to express a conclusive view on these issues.

#### Conclusion

33     In summary, the purported prior publications adduced by the Defendant does not meet the high threshold required to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim. Taking the prior publications at face value, I agree that their uncanny resemblance to the Plaintiff’s Advertisement strongly undermines the Plaintiff’s claim of originality. The Plaintiff’s contentions however necessitates a fuller investigation into the facts. Further evidence yet uncovered could potentially strengthen the Plaintiff’s case or weaken the Defendant’s case, which may in turn affect the outcome at trial. As Hobhouse LJ once said, “the courts … must have regard not only to the evidence presently available to the plaintiffs but also to any realistic prospect that evidence would have been strengthened between now and the trial” (_Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No. 3)_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 AC 1</span> at \[160\]).

34     Similarly, the Court of Appeal in _The “Osprey”_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 1099</span> cautioned against ruling out the possibility that the plaintiff’s case might improve as the matter proceeds to trial (at \[20\]):

> A party, at this interlocutory stage, is not compelled to lay out all the evidence on which he will rely at the trial to support his claim. Hence, there was no merit in the second respondents’ contention that the appellants were not able to show that they had a reasonable cause of action because their evidence would not likely to improve, even if the case proceeds to trial. This was hardly the appropriate stage in the proceedings at which the court should or would be dealing with questions of proof. While the appellants’ inability to adduce evidence of the charterparty was indicative of, perhaps, a weak case and may ultimately prove to be detrimental to the success of their claim, we would not be justified in depriving them of their right to a trial. The determination of the question of who was the contracting carrier under the bill of lading would be more appropriately resolved in a proper trial. …

35     In arriving at this conclusion, I considered that a claimant should not be deprived of its right to trial merely because its case is weak (_Recordtv Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd and others_ \[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 43 at \[24\]; and _Ajit Chandrasekar Prabhu and another v Yap Beng Kooi and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 68</span> at \[11\]). I further considered that novel issues of law should generally be determined after trial (see \[32\] above).

### Is the Plaintiff’s Advertisement wholly uncreative?

36     The Defendant’s second and third arguments are that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is merely descriptive and that it is _de minimis_. Both arguments go towards the issue of whether the Plaintiff’s Advertisement has crossed the threshold of creativity required to warrant copyright protection.

#### This fact-centric inquiry should be reserved to the trial judge

37     The creativity threshold has been described as “heavily fact-centric” and “often a problematic matter” (see _Asia Pacific Publishing_ at \[34\]). There is no guiding principle on the precise amount of creativity required; each case turns on its unique facts (_Asia Pacific Publishing_ at \[34\]). Given “how nuanced this exercise can be” (as further elucidated in _Global Yellow Pages (CA)_ at \[31\]), I am of the view that this issue should be determined by the trial judge, save for plain and obvious cases where the expression is clearly devoid of creativity.

#### Cases relied upon by the Defendant are not analogous

38     The Defendant contends that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement clearly does not pass muster and the claim is bound to fail. To make good this assertion, the Defendant referred to various cases where copyright was denied. These cases may be briefly summarised as follows.

> (a)      _Francis Day and Hunter Ltd v Twentieth Century Fox Corp Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1940\] AC 112</span> (“_Francis Day_”): The phrase “the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo” was be too unsubstantial a matter to be copyrighted (at 113). Lord Wright, who delivered the leading judgment for the Privy Council, explained that the phrase “break the bank” was a hackneyed expression and Monte Carlo was “the most obvious place at which that achievement or accident might take place” (at 123).

> (b)      _Kirk v Fleming_ (1928-35) MacG Cop Cas 44: Justice Luxmoore of the English Chancery Court found that copyright did not subsist in an optical advertisement that read:

>> Good sight is your most valuable asset. Avoid the predicament of being without your glasses. Let us make you a spare pair. Broken lenses promptly and accurately replaced.

> He reasoned that practically the same words, “Good sight is your most valuable asset” had been used by opticians in their advertisements some years ago, and “Avoid the predicament of being without your glasses” was a commonplace expression and too trivial. As for the last two sentences, it would be difficult to express the same idea using substantially different words (at 49).

> (c)      _Noah v Shuba_ \[1991\] FSR 14: Justice Mummery of the English High Court refused to find copyright in two sentences that reads “Follow clinic procedure for aftercare. If proper procedures are followed, no risk of viral infections can occur” because they did not “afford sufficient information, instruction or literary enjoyment to qualify as a work”.

> (d)      _Promotions Atlantiques Inc. v Hardcraft Industries Ltd_ \[1987\] FCJ 703 (“_Promotions Atlantiques_”): Justice Strayer of the Federal Court of Canada found that instructions appearing on the back of a packaging was too “simple and brief” to be copyrightable. In arriving at this view, he cited the American case of _Morrissey v Procter & Gamble Company et al_ (1967), 379 F. 2d 675 (1st Cir), where copyright was denied in a set of instructions for a mail-in contest, on the basis that there were very limited ways to describe the subject matter.

> (e)      _Rose v Information Services Ltd_ \[1987\] FSR 254: Justice Hoffmann of the English High Court found that the title “The Lawyer’s Diary” was too simple to qualify for copyright protection.

> (f)      _Sullivan v FNH Investments Pty Ltd_ (2003) 57 IPR 63 (“_Sullivan_”): Justice Jacobson of the Federal Court of Australia found no copyright to have subsisted in the slogan “Somewhere in the Whitsundays” or “the Resort that Offers Precious Little”.

> (g)      _Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah)_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 786</span> (“_Tay Long Kee Impex_”): The Singapore Court of Appeal found that the following warranty clause was too _de minimis_ to merit copyright protection (at \[44\]):

>> All hayrer products are designed and manufactured to provide maximum carefree service, hayrer products carry a lifetime guarantee to be free of defects in materials or workmanship. This does not cover wear and tear or abuse. Accordingly, hayrer will repair or replace, without cost to our customers, any product which is defective in materials or workmanship promptly after its return to our sole agents.

> (h)      _Victoria Pacific Technologies (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2)_ \[2009\] 177 FCR 61 (“_Victoria Pacific Technologies_”): Justice Emmett of the Federal Court of Australia found that the words “Help-Help-Driver-in-Danger-Call-Police-Ph.000” was too simple and too inseparable from the idea sought to be conveyed to attract copyright protection.

39     In my judgment, these cases are hardly analogous. To begin with, the exact wording of the work in issue in _Promotions Atlantiques_ was not apparent from the written judgment. _Promotions Atlantiques_ therefore does not advance the Defendant’s case.

40     The remaining cases are clearly not on all fours with the present case. None of these cases involved descriptions of the same hair replacement service provided by the parties concerned. None of them involved any subject matter that pertains to the hair treatment industry. Most importantly, all of them, with the exception of _Tay Long Kee Impex_, involved short and simple phrases or sentences. Short and simple literary works are generally not copyrightable (_Global Yellow Pages (CA)_ at \[52\]; _Victoria Pacific Technologies_ at \[19\]; see also _Warner-Lambert Co v Supermarketing (Vic) Pty Ltd_ (2002) 56 IPR 330 at 334). The Plaintiff’s Advertisement is not exactly a short phrase or sentence. It may perhaps be characterised as a compilation of four sentences. The Defendant argues that each of the four sentences are too simple to warrant copyright protection. Even if that were the case, copyright may nevertheless subsist in the overall compilation. This is but an extension of the principle that a composite work may be copyrightable even though its constituent elements, on their own, are not (_Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd_ \[1964\] 1 All ER 465, at 469C, 475H and 479C; see also _Budget Eyewear Australia Pty Ltd v Specsavers Pty Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] FCA 507</span> at \[17\]).

41     As for _Tay Long Kee Impex_, the Defendant argued that, following the decision, the Plaintiff’s Advertisement comprising of only 58 words must be too trivial to afford copyright protection.[^12] In this regard, the Defendant relied on the following commentary in _Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore_ at \[6.1.12\]:[^13]

> If the warranty comprising three sentences of 64 words \[in _Tay Long Kee Impex_\] did not cross the _de minimis_ threshold, it means that short phrases … would not qualify as literary works in Singapore.

42     Contrary to what the Defendant had suggested, I do not understand the case to stand for the proposition that literary works shorter than 64 words would necessarily be considered too _de minimis_ to attain copyright protection. Nowhere in _Tay Long Kee Impex_ did the Court actually make such a pronouncement. In fact, case law has recognised that even short phrases are sometimes capable of mustering copyright (_Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 165</span> (“_Global Yellow Pages (HC)_” at \[301\]). _A fortiori_, a passage comprising 64 words – or 58 words in the present case – can enjoy copyright protection, so long as it satisfies the requirement of originality.

43     In my judgment, the approach should be qualitative rather than quantitative. A purely quantitative approach suffers from at least three flaws.

> (a)     First, it tells us nothing about the creative qualities of a literary work. A short and succinct piece of work can evince a creative spark, whereas a verbose write-up may be the product of a mechanical exercise. In this regard, I agree with the learned author of George Wei, _The Law of Copyright in Singapore_ (SNP Editions, 2nd Ed, 2000) at \[2.6\], who astutely observed that a purely quantitative approach may end up excluding works that owe their existence to spontaneous outbursts of the mind.

> (b)     Second, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to demarcate a bright line rule on the exact number of words required to cross the _de minimis_ threshold.

> (c)     Third, it would likely have the undesirable effect of encouraging verbiage, in a bid to cloak uncreative works with copyright.

44     The amount of creative input should be the focal point of the analysis. To reiterate, the degree of creativity required is extremely low (_Asia Pacific Publishing_ at \[38\]). The following cases illustrates the low threshold in the context of marketing or promotional materials.

> (a)      _Cotton and another v Frost_ \[1936\] NZLR 627: The Supreme Court of New Zealand found that an advertisement relating to the manufacture and sale of dental plates (featuring, amongst others, four slogans) was sufficiently original to sustain an injunction. Justice Johnston said that the advertisements containing material known to every manufacturer of dental plates did not defeat the copyright claim (at 636).

> (b)      _Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd and others v Meltwater Holding BV and others_ \[2012\] IP&T 211: The English Court of Appeal found that newspaper headlines are capable of attracting copyright. On the facts of that case, Sir Andrew Morritt C, who delivered the judgment, found that the headlines were often “striking and substantial”. Further, the headlines required skill to fulfil the objective of “capturing the reader’s attention and inducing them to read the article” (at \[16\]).

> (c)      _Sunlec International Pty Ltd v Electropar Ltd and others_ (2008) 79 IPR 411: Justice Wylie of the High Court of New Zealand, after reviewing various authorities including _Kirk v Fleming_, _Sullivan_ and _Francis Day_, came to the view that it was entirely possible for copyright to subsist in a slogan. On the facts of the case, the slogan, “Field Friendly – The best choice for fieldwork”, while comprising common words of the English language, was expressed in a “succinct and relatively memorable way” to enjoy copyright protection (at \[64\]).

> (d)      _Budget Eyewear Australia Pty Ltd v Specsavers Pty Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] FCA 507</span>: The Federal Court of Australia found that the claimant had an arguable case in the way a concept was expressed in an advertisement that reads:

>> (a)    If your Specsavers glasses break — and we’re not saying they will — simply bring them into Budget Eyewear. We’ll replace them with pair from our own range — free of charge;

>> (b)    We’re not saying they will, but if your Specsavers glasses break, we’ll replace them for free; and

>> (c)    If your glasses aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, don’t worry, we’ll come to the rescue. For the next 2 weeks … you can take any Specsavers glasses to your nearest participating Budget Eyewear store and we’ll replace them with a pair from our range — free of charge.

Justice Bennett took the view that there was arguably sufficient skill and judgment in the selection and arrangement of these words (at \[17\]).

45     If copyright has been (or can be) conferred to the works in the above cases, it should also be at least _possible_ for copyright to subsist in the Plaintiff’s Advertisement. I do not agree that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is _entirely_ simple or _purely_ descriptive. It is conceivable that some degree of ingenuity is required in the selection and arrangement of the words used to describe the service, in a palatable way that would entice potential customers. For instance, adjectives such as “revolutionary” and “unique” are not words typically found in bare descriptions. Presumably, the author deployed these adjectives to capture the reader’s attention from the get-go, before delving into the details of the treatment process. Instead of describing the treatment process in its entirety and in mechanical fashion, the author highlighted selected features, in particular, the process being “pain-free” and “non-surgical”. The adjective “micro-thin” used to describe artificial skin has the effect of enhancing the sensory appeal of the process and its after-effects. All of these would arguably require skill and judgment that goes beyond the banal and the trivial.

46     That said, it is not necessary for me to reach a conclusive view at this stage. Indeed, I am cognisant that it remains for parties to lead evidence on this issue, including the author’s perspectives and perhaps industry practices. To succeed in a striking out application, it is not enough for the Defendant to show that the Plaintiff’s case is improbable; it must show that it is _impossible_ (see \[8\] above). As far as this application is concerned, the Defendant has not cross the high threshold required to deny the Plaintiff the right to be heard at trial. _Prima facie_, the Plaintiff’s Advertisement manifests at least some level of creativity, skill and judgment. Whether it is sufficient is a matter that should be determined by the trial judge.

#### The Defendant’s concerns of monopoly are overstated

47     At the hearing, Mr Choy further urged me not to confer a monopoly over the expression, as it would have to effect of stifling competition in the industry. This argument begets the question of whether the Plaintiff’s Advertisement meets the threshold for originality which is a matter that should be determined by the trial judge for the reasons stated above.

48     In any event, the Defendant’s argument entails at least two more steps missing in the inquiry.

49     First, even when copying has been established, an infringement finding does not necessarily follow. It remains for the trial judge to determine the _scope_ of copyright protection that is justified. Where the creativity threshold has been crossed, albeit barely, it is open to the trial judge to afford “thin” protection (_Global Yellow Pages (CA)_ at \[16\]; see also _Henkel_ at \[38\]). In practical terms, what this means is that, short of wholesale word-for-word copying, an infringement claim may not be made out (_Global Yellow Pages (CA)_ at \[49\]; see also _Land Transport Safety Authority of New Zealand v Glogau_ \[1999\] 1 NZLR 261 at 271, _per_ McGechan J). The scope of protection is heavily shaped by the degree of creativity that an expression manifests. The Defendant’s argument overlooks this important principle. In fact, at the hearing, Mr Arivanantham clarified that the Plaintiff takes issue with the copying of the _entire passage_ and not just selected words. Thus, even assuming the Plaintiff is entitled to copyright, it is still potentially open to the Defendant to copy or reproduce certain keywords without infringing copyright.

50     Second, even assuming copyright is found to subsist in the entirety of the Plaintiff’s Advertisement, that is not the end of the matter. The monopoly conferred is a limited one. It prevents others from copying the expression, but not the underlying facts, information or ideas (_Global Yellow Pages (CA)_ at \[30\]; see also _IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd_ (2009) 254 ALR 386 at \[28\], _per_ French CJ, citing _MacMillan & Co Ltd v K & J Cooper_ (1923) 93 LJPC 113 at 117-118, _per_ Lord Atkinson). Competitors are free to express the same idea in a different manner. The following observations made in the seminal case of _Feist_ are instructive:

> Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another’s publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement. _As one commentator explains it: “No matter how much original authorship the work displays, the facts and ideas it exposes are free for the taking … The very same facts and ideas may be divorced from the context imposed by the author, and restated or reshuffled by second comers …”_

> … This is neither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by which copyright advances the progress of science and art. …

> \[emphasis added\]

51     As the learned authors of Halsbury’s Law of Singapore, _Intellectual Property_, Vol. 13(3) (2018 Reissue) further observed at \[160.12\]:

> … The owner of copyright has, in short, no monopoly in the subject matter. Others are at liberty to produce the same result, provided that they do so independently and, although they are not the first in the field, their work is none the less ‘original’ in the sense in which that word is used in the Copyright Act.

52     In summary, at this stage, it is too early to conclude that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement is completely devoid of creativity. Whether the Plaintiff’s Advertisement has crossed the requisite threshold of creativity is an issue that is best reserved to the trial judge.

### Is the Plaintiff required to produce supporting evidence of authorship and the publication date at this stage?

53     As a further string to its bow, the Defendant argued that the claim is fanciful for want of evidence. The Plaintiff has not adduced any supporting evidence of authorship. At the hearing, Mr Choy emphasised that the bare assertion on affidavit is not enough. If the Plaintiff were indeed the author, it must have drafts of the final work product.

54     The main difficulty with this argument is that the Defendant made no mention on its supporting affidavit that the Plaintiff was not the original author or that the work was a copy. As I understand, the Defendant’s striking out application was made on the basis that the work was commonplace and hence not copyrightable. In the Defendant’s supporting affidavit, its director said:[^14]

> 16.    The Plaintiff’s allegations are surprising, since the Plaintiff’s \[Advertisement\] is merely a description of the Treatment process in plain and simple language.

> 17.    Therefore, I thought that the Defendant should look at how other hair salons offering hair replacement services similar to the Treatment have described the process.

55     Indeed, as stated at \[28\] above, Mr Choy confirmed that the Defendant was not going as far as to allege that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement was a copy.

56     Since the Plaintiff’s claim to authorship was not put into issue, the Plaintiff should not be penalised for its failure to lead supporting evidence. Given the draconian consequences that a striking out application entails, it is incumbent on the applicant to frame its allegations with specificity to put the other party on notice of the case it has to meet. Vague allusions would not suffice. I am therefore inclined to place little to no weight on the Plaintiff’s failure to adduce supporting evidence.

57     Further, and in any event, a claimant’s failure to adduce supporting evidence at the interlocutory stage does not necessarily result in a striking out order.

58     As a starting point, the Court of Appeal in _The Bunga Melati 5_ made no express reference to bare assertions in its definition of “factual unsustainability”. To be clear, the exact words of the Court of Appeal were as follows (at \[39(b)\]):

> factually unsustainable: if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, \[for example, if it is\] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based.

59     Similar observations were made in _AYW v AYX_, where Wei J found that bare assertions, by itself, did not render the claim factually unsustainable (at \[110\]-\[111\]):

> 110    This submission raises an interesting point on the test for striking out an action. Can a court conclude that a claim is factually unsustainable on the ground that there is a complete absence of evidence supporting the claim (in this case, that there is a causal link between the eczema and the bullying), especially if it is clear that the plaintiff had many opportunities to adduce such evidence knowing that the defendant was seeking to strike out the claim on that ground?

> 111    In this respect, I find the Court of Appeal’s observations in _The Bunga Melati 5_ (\[30\] supra) helpful. In explaining the meaning of “factual unsustainability”, the Court of Appeal gave the example of a statement of facts being contradicted by documents or other materials on which it is based (_The Bunga Melati 5_ at \[39(b)\]). It appears that the complete absence of supporting evidence is not on its own sufficient to justify a finding that a particular factual claim is factually unsustainable at the striking out stage. As the Court of Appeal emphasised in _The Bunga Melati 5_ at \[45\], “\[s\]ave in the plainest of cases”, a court should not in a striking out application decide between conflicting factual accounts.

60     In my judgment, not every striking out application demands the production of supporting evidence. Affidavit evidence may sometimes suffice. Much would depend on the facts of each case. The overall inquiry should focus on whether the lack of supporting evidence renders the assertion wholly unbelievable. For instance, a bare assertion may not be good enough if the assertion is inherently impossible or inconsistent with contemporaneous documents. This harkens back to the central premise upon which striking out applications are adjudicated, namely, that the respondent’s pleaded averments are deemed proven unless they are completely unbelievable or clearly unprovable (see _Pacific Internet v Catcha.com_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 980</span> at \[17\]).

61     In the present case, the nature of the allegation does not inexorably call for the production of documentary evidence in the form of drafts. The write-up is not lengthy. It is at least plausible that the Plaintiff had scribbled or typed it out in a single sitting, which would obviate the need to go through drafts. A parallel can be drawn with the case of _Fleming v Fletcher_, where a copyright claim was made out on the basis of witness testimony, notwithstanding the claimant’s failure to adduce copies of preliminary sketches of the drawing in issue (at \[73\] and \[85\]).

62     The Defendant cited three cases for the proposition that bare assertions are invariably insufficient to resist a striking out application.[^15] I consider these cases eminently distinguishable.

> (a)      _Hong Alvin v Chia Quee Khee_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 249</span>: The assertion in this case was not only bare but also _contradicted by contemporaneous documents_ (at \[29\]). This falls squarely within the scenario envisaged in _The Bunga Melati 5_ (see \[58\] above). In the present case, the Defendant did not point to any contemporaneous documents that directly contradict the assertion of authorship.

> (b)      _Venkatraman Kalyanaraman v Nithya Kalyani and others_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1365</span>: The bare assertion was rejected because it was not even pleaded (at \[76\]). Here, the claim to authorship has clearly been pleaded.

> (c)      _Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and another v Abdul Samad bin O K Mohamed Haniffa and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 248</span>: The bare assertion was made in relation to fraud. It is trite that cogent evidence is required to prove fraud (_Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 263</span> at \[14\]; _iTronic Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon and another Suit_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 663</span> at \[64\]; see also _Super Group Ltd v Mysore Nagaraja Kartik_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 692</span> at \[106\]). Given the stringent evidential requirements, it is not surprising that the bare assertions did not gain traction (see similar remarks made in _Chia Kok Kee v Tan Wah and others_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 352</span> at \[44\]). In any event, on appeal, the decision was affirmed on the basis that fraud was not even pleaded (see LawNet Editorial Note). That, in my view, should be regarded as the _ratio_ of the decision.

63     In sum, the lack of supporting evidence was not the main basis upon which the assertions were rejected. These cases therefore do not bear out the proposition that the Defendant cited them for.

64     While the lack of supporting evidence may indicate that the Plaintiff is unlikely to be able to discharge its burden of proof at trial, a weak case does not justify summary dismissal (see \[35\] above). To balance the equities, I queried whether the Plaintiff can and ought to furnish security for costs. A parallel may be drawn to the issuance of “conditional leave to defend” in summary judgment applications in respect of “shadowy” defences. At the second hearing, Mr Choy said the Defendant did not wish to pursue such an application.

65     Instead, Mr Choy renewed the Defendant’s request for the Plaintiff to furnish supporting evidence, failing which he argued the action should be stayed. When queried what documents would the Defendant require, Mr Choy replied that the Plaintiff should produce evidence to prove that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement was indeed published in 2015, and not later. With respect, I am unable to agree with this contention. As the party seeking to strike out the claim, it is incumbent on the Defendant to show that the claim is fanciful and without substance. The Defendant did not adduce any evidence to show that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement was not published on the pleaded date. In fact, the Defendant did not even allege on affidavit that the Plaintiff’s Advertisement could not have been published on the pleaded date. In these circumstances, the date of publication is plainly a triable issue.

## Conclusion

66     In conclusion, the Defendant did not discharge the burden of showing that the claim is bound to fail. The materials placed before me did not render the claim wholly unarguable. I therefore dismissed the application.

67     By way of parenthesis, shortly after I reserved judgment to consider the issues more carefully, the United States Court of Appeal for the 9th Circuit reversed a lower court’s summary dismissal of a copyright infringement claim: _Hall v Swift_, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 32272, (9th Cir. Cal. October 28, 2019). The dispute centred on the lyrics of two relatively popular songs: “_Playas Gon’ Play_” and “_Shake if Off_”. The claimants, Sean Hall and Nathan Butler, authored the former song with lyrics consisting: “Playas, they gonna play / And haters, they gonna hate”. Some years later, the defendants, comprising Taylor Swift and others, authored the latter song with lyrics consisting: “Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play / And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate …”. The District Court of California struck out the claim on the basis that the lyrics in issue was too brief and uncreative to warrant copyright protection: _Hall v Swift_, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43575 (C.D. Cal. February 13, 2018). The appellate court however was of the view the issue of originality is a question of fact that should be determined at trial. While _Hall v Swift_ concerned literary work of a different kind, the decision nevertheless served as a timely reminder that questions of originality are generally not suitable for summary determination, even where the literary work in issue may seem brief and simple.

68     Parties agreed that costs of this application should follow the event. Since the striking out application failed, the Defendant should bear the Plaintiff’s costs. On the quantum, the Defendant submitted that the preparatory work undertaken by the Plaintiff was minimal, as evidenced by (a) its reply affidavit being largely a rehash of the Statement of Claim; (b) its brief written submissions; and (c) its thin Bundle of Authorities comprising only seven items. Considering the Plaintiff nevertheless had to attend the hearings and consider the Defendant’s submissions, I fixed costs at $1,500.
