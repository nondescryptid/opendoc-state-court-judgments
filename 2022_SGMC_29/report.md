Criminal Law – Offences – Outraging Modesty – Criminal Procedure – Conviction and Sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9044/2022/01.\]

25 May 2022

### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is appealing against his conviction and sentence. He was sentenced to an imprisonment term of five weeks.

## The Charge

2       The Accused claimed trial to one charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) for outraging the modesty of the Victim onboard a SIA aircraft in the course of his employment. The charge reads as follows:

> **MAC-907180-2020** (“the Charge”)

> You…are charged that you, on 3 May 2019, onboard a Singapore-controlled aircraft, namely, a Singapore Airlines aircraft bearing registration number 9V-SVC (under flight number SQ912), which was en route from Singapore to Manila, Philippines, did use criminal force to one \[redacted\] (Female/ 27 years old), to wit, by slapping her right buttock, intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), read with Section 3(1) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap 327, 1985 Rev Ed).

## Case for Defence

3       The Defence claimed that the Accused had no intention to outrage the Victim’s modesty. He disputed the area and mode of contact. He did not deny that he came into contact with the Victim’s body but disputed that he had slapped her right buttock. He claimed to have only “tapped” the Victim’s “right side of the pelvic” when he saw that she was leaning against the seat, and her buttocks were “protruding” into the aisle. The Accused alleged that his action was to correct the Victim’s posture and to protect the image of SIA.

4       Besides giving evidence in his own defence, the Accused also called one other witness, DW2 Mohd Noor Bin Othman (“DW2 Noor”), the Chief Steward of flights SQ912 and SQ919 at the material time, to give evidence for the Defence. DW2 Noor was a friend and colleague of the Accused. I noted that DW2 Noor was not present when the Accused touched the Victim. The evidence DW2 Noor gave was essentially hearsay evidence except for what transpired at the cockpit meeting when he was present.

## Case for Prosecution

5       The Prosecution submitted that there were documentary and oral evidence from the witnesses and the Accused that proved the charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

6       Besides the Victim, the Prosecution called 4 other witnesses in support of its case. One witness Sarjeet Nair Segaran Nair (“Sarjeet”) was not called as he was in Malaysia. The Prosecution had indicated that this witness was barred from leaving Malaysia to enter Singapore. The Defence has objected to this witness’s evidence to be given via video link.

## The Undisputed Facts

7       There was an agreed statement of facts (“ASOF”). But the undisputed facts were more succinctly set out in the Prosecution’s closing submissions (“PCS”) at \[7\] and the same is reproduced for ease of reference (without the footnotes):

> “The following facts are undisputed at trial:

>> (a)    On 3 May 2019, the Accused and Victim were working on board an SIA Singapore-registered Boeing 777-200 aircraft bearing registration number 9V-SVC (“the Aircraft”). This was a turnaround flight from Singapore to Manila to Singapore, which departed Singapore on 3 May 2019 as flight SQ912 at or about 11.52am, and landed in Manila, Philippines on the same day at or about 3.40pm. The turnaround flight under flight SQ919 departed Manila, Philippines on 3 May 2019 at or about 4.44pm, and landed in Singapore on the same day at or about 8.22pm.

>> (b)    The Accused was the IFM of both flights and the Victim was a flight stewardess on both flights. The Victim was stationed in the business class on flight SQ912 and in the economy class on flight SQ919.

>> (c)    The Accused had made deliberate physical contact with the Victim in the business class of flight SQ912 (though the mode and area of contact is disputed), shortly before the flight landed in Manila, Philippines. The contact occurred whilst the Victim was attending to a passenger in seat 16D of the business class.

>> (d)    After the flight landed in Manila, Philippines, the Victim informed PW4 Dubay, via text messages on WhatsApp (an instant messaging application), that the Accused had smacked her right buttock while she was talking to a passenger.

>> (e)    On the turnaround flight SQ919, the Victim informed PW2 Soong of an incident between the Accused and herself. PW2 Soong then called for a meeting in the cockpit. PW2 Soong, PW3 Tjeng, the Accused, the Victim, and DW2 Noor were present. During the meeting, the Victim confronted the Accused with the allegation that he had “smacked \[her\] ass”. (f) On the same day that flight SQ919 landed in Singapore, PW2 Soong submitted an electronic ‘FOVR form’ (“FOVR Form”) documenting the cockpit meeting to SIA.

>> (g)    On 5 May 2019 at about 12.55pm, the Victim lodged a police report at Pasir Ris Neighbourhood Police Centre, stating that she was molested on board flight SQ912.”

## The Offence

8       The relevant statutory provision for the charge against the Accused is set out below.

> Section 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) states:

>> (1)    Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

## Analysis of the Evidence

9       The Accused alleged that he used the back of his right hand to “tap” the Victim on the right pelvic area. He also testified that there was no situation where it was acceptable to intentionally touch a female colleague on her buttock.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

10     In the present case, I examined the evidence of the Accused and Victim in accordance with the guidelines set out in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>_. As the Prosecution’s case rested mainly on the Victim’s evidence, I was mindful that the Victim’s evidence must be unusually convincing for the Accused to be convicted[^2].

11     I found the Victim’s evidence to be internally and externally consistent. The Victim consistently maintained that the Accused had slapped her on the right buttock whilst she was attending to the passenger in seat 16D. She gave a consistent and clear description and demonstration of her posture when attending to the passenger. I agreed with the Prosecution that she “gave a reasonable explanation that she stood beside the passenger, and leaned forward slightly to attend to the passenger and look at what he was trying to show her in the KrisShop magazine.”[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) .

12     The Victim strongly disagreed when cross-examined by counsel that the Accused used his right hand (back of palm) to touch/tap her pelvic area. The Victim was very clear that it was her “right ass cheek”[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). In fact, she demonstrated in court how her right ass cheek was hit as it was protruding when bending over. I had no reason to doubt her evidence that she was hit on her right buttock. In fact, she testified that she knew her body well. She knew where her hips, ass and pelvic were.[^5] More importantly, the Victim’s testimony that she was hit on the buttock was consistent with the evidence of DW2 Noor who testified that he heard the Accused apologizing to the Victim during the meeting in the cockpit for hitting her buttock.

13     I also agreed with the Prosecution that “the Victim remained entirely consistent about what she recalled the Accused said to her after he slapped her on the buttock, despite different versions being put to her by the defence[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6):

14     The Victim was conversant with the Malay language and I had no reason to doubt her testimony. Accordingly, I accepted her evidence that the Accused had said to the Victim in Malay _“Janganlah berdiri macham ni_” in a cheeky tone or playful manner[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). My finding that it was in a cheeky or playful manner was fortified by the fact that the Defence did not put to the Victim that those alleged Malay words were not said in a cheeky or playful manner. Accordingly, I also rejected the Accused’s denial that he had spoken in a cheeky manner.

15     Next, I found that there was no reason or motive for the Victim to falsely implicate the Accused. She clearly refuted any suggestion that she was making false allegation against the Accused[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). The Victim also frankly acknowledged that the Accused was “nice” and “friendly” when they met. I also noted that both the Accused and the Victim had not met before the incident. Neither did I find that the Victim had embellished her evidence.

16     With respect, I rejected the suggestion by the Defence that the Victim had deliberately used words such as “jolted”, “ballsy” and “smacked” in her examination-in-chief to exaggerate her testimony about being slapped on her buttock by the Accused. I accepted the Victim’s explanation that she used these words as they were accurate. I agreed with the Prosecution that “she explained that her body jolted up in response to the Accused slapping her buttock because she was shocked to be hit by someone from the back”.

17     The Defence submitted that the allegation that the Victim was jolted by the smack could not be true as the passenger whom the Victim was attending to was not called as a witness. With respect, there was no reason why the court should not believe her evidence after assessing all the circumstances. In any event, the passenger was not called as a witness as he could not recall the flight that he had taken. Next, the Victim “used the word “ballsy” to describe the Accused’s actions because of how “daring” and “surprising” his actions were. She used the word “smacked”, as opposed to “slap” or other words describing contact, to describe how the Accused had hit her buttock because the word “smack” more accurately described the force of contact the Accused used”[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). In my view, the Victim’s explanation demonstrated the nature and extent of the outrage of modesty that she experienced when her buttock was slapped. It was, therefore, not surprising that the Victim then lodged a police report against the Accused. See exhibit P1.

18     Next, I found the Victim’s evidence was externally consistent. Soon after the incident, the Victim reported it to Sarjeet, the Leading Steward on board the flight. The Accused accepted that Sarjeet had approached him during the transit in Manila to inform him of the Victim’s allegation that he had “smacked her bottom”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) The Accused also admitted that the Victim confronted him with the allegation on the aerobridge whilst in transit.

19     Immediately after the incident, the Victim also promptly reported it to PW4 Dubay and followed up with a meeting with PW2 Soong and PW3 Tjeng in the cockpit on the turnaround flight. The Victim’s allegation was also corroborated by the evidence of the Accused’s confession in the cockpit, which was documented in the FOVR Form lodged by PW2 Soong. See exhibit P5.

20     In view of the fact that the FOVR was prepared by PW2 Soong on the same day as the incident and that there was no reason for PW2 Soong to falsely fabricate the evidence against the Accused, I gave full weight to the said document.

21     PW3 Tjeng confirmed the Victim’ allegation that (a) the Accused touched her inappropriately, (b) on her “butt cheek” and the Accused had apologised for the specific inappropriate mode of contact alleged by the Victim. I found no reason for PW3 Tjeng to lie against the Accused. Neither was there any motive alleged by the Defence. I noted he was not able to recall the details of the meeting in the cockpit. However, it was not unusual for a witness not able to recall the details due to the lapse of time and the lack of documentary record.

22     The Victim’s evidence was also consistent with the evidence of DW2 Noor. DW2 Noor testified during cross-examination that the Accused had apologised to the Victim for hitting her buttock during the cockpit meeting.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) DW2 Noor also confirmed the Victim’s account that the Accused said words to the effect of “I swear on my mother and the Quran that this is my first time”.

23     In the circumstances, I found the Victim to be a credible and truthful witness. I was also of the view that the Victim’s evidence was unusually convincing and fortified by her subsequent corroborative accounts to other witnesses. Accordingly, I accepted her testimony. I found that whilst on board the aircraft, on 3 May 2019, the Accused did slap the Victim’s right buttock. By her conduct and the evidence given, I had no doubt that she did not consent to what the Accused had done and that she felt her modesty was outraged otherwise she would not have made a police report that she was molested and would not have brought up the incident to PW4 Dubay.

## Credibility of the Accused

24     I found the Accused’s evidence was not only inherently illogical, but also internally and externally inconsistent.

25     The Accused claimed that he had “tapped” the Victim to correct her posture. However, as the Prosecution had submitted – “this begs the question of why he could not have corrected her posture verbally, without touching her.”[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) As was highlighted by PW4 Dubay, it was inappropriate for a male IFM to correct a female flight stewardess’s posture using physical contact, because of the importance of showing respect to colleagues, and because the correction can be done verbally[^13]. This accorded not only with common sense but also safe working environment for all employees of SIA. In my view, hitting a female colleague on her buttocks was clearly a form of sexual harassment that would outrage her modesty. In fact, such conduct had been held by the courts to be an offence under s354 of the Penal Code[^14].

26     With respect, based on the testimony of PW4 Dubay, an experienced IFM since 2004, I was of the view that it was certainly not acceptable for a superior to use his hand to slap on the buttock of the Victim and therefore I rejected the Accused’s claim that his motive was to correct the Victim’s posture. Moreover, given the wide seat (see P3) and PW4 Dubay’s evidence, it would be appropriate for the Victim to lean in to listen to the passenger and would not warrant any correction of posture[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). I also found no reasonable explanation as to why the Accused could not verbally correct the Victim’s posture without slapping on her buttock. There was no emergency or safety issue and as pointed out by the Prosecution, in any event, not much time was needed to correct a posture verbally. Consequently, contrary to the contention of the Accused, by verbally correcting the Victim’s posture if indeed it was necessary to do so (which I disagreed), there would still be adequate time to prepare for the aircraft landing.

27     The Accused agreed that there should not be unnecessary physical contact with his female colleagues. He also agreed that the pelvic area, where he claimed to have touched the Victim, was close to the buttock and was a sensitive area. Given this concession, I can only conclude that the reason why he slapped the Victim’s buttock was with the intent to outrage her modesty. This was buttressed by the fact that he had admitted that the Victim’s was standing in a provocative position[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16). The question of _mens rea_ will be elaborated below.

28     There was no doubt that there were internal inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the Accused had given no less than three different versions in respect of where he had touched the Victim. First, he said that he had touched the Victim on the “right side of the pelvic”[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17), or her “pelvic area”.[^18] However, in his long statement (exhibit D1), he stated it was the Victim’s waist area. Next, in the eCCVR Form (exhibit P6 at \[2\]), the Accused specifically reported that he had hit the “bottom” of the Victim. When asked to explain the inconsistency between his testimony in court and P6, the Accused claimed that he was given a “limited time”[^19] to prepare the eCCVR Form and he was “in shock”[^20] over the incident. With respect, I rejected his explanation. In my view, given the serious nature of allegation made against him, one would expect him to pay attention to what he wrote. It would be inconceivable that he would admit to hitting the Victim’s “bottom” (which he understood to mean buttocks), in a report to his company when this was the specific allegation being made against him, unless this was the truth. In any event, the Accused had again admitted that he touched the Victim “near her bottom area” in his email dated 16 May 2019 to SIA which was submitted a few days after the incident (exhibit D4B at \[2\]). I also did not believe that he was still in a state of shock as there was a significant lapse of time between the allegation made against him by the Victim at the cockpit and when P6 was written.

29     For the avoidance of doubt, P6 was admitted into evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. I agreed with the Prosecution that due weight be given to P6 in light of its contemporaneity with the incident. There was also no reason for the Accused to misrepresent that he had hit the Victim’s bottom in P6. Moreover, P6 was a formal document that the Accused prepared for his employer in answer to the sexual allegation made against him. Therefore, it was unlikely that the Accused was careless in writing the details in the form and there is no reason why he admitted in the form (P6) that he hit the Victim’s “bottom” unless this was the truth.

30     In the email to SIA (D4B), and his long statement to the Police (D1), the Accused had claimed that he only tapped the Victim. However, in P6, he described that he had “hit” the Victim’s bottom. I was of the view that the Accused hit the Victim’s bottom rather than tapped as the former was made closer in time to the incident. As highlighted by the Prosecution the “claim that he “tapped” the Victim is clearly an afterthought intended to downplay his actions.”[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

31     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had given different reasons as to why he touched the Victim. In court, the Accused claimed that he touched the Victim to correct her posture as her posture did not look good for the image of SIA.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) Another version stated was that the way the Victim was standing was “blocking” the aisle and when he tapped her, she “moved forward a bit”.[^23] This version was not mentioned in his long statement, his email to SIA, or P6. The 3rd version was that in P6 he said he hit the Victim’s bottom as she was standing provocatively and in a “provocative position”. I agreed with the Prosecution that in using the word “provocative”, the Accused was not merely saying that the Victim was standing improperly, or in an unsightly manner. On the contrary, there was a clear sexual connotation attached to the word, which the Accused was aware of. This was evident from his telling references to the “sarong kebaya” which the Victim was wearing, and how it was “tight fitting” and “enhanced” the shape of the body.[^24]

32     Next, I found the Accused was evasive in giving evidence. This can be seen during his cross-examination when he was asked why he could not have only verbally corrected the Victim, if he had intended to correct her posture[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25):

> _Q_      _And even assuming you needed to correct her posture immediately, Mr. Rozalie, you could have done it purely verbally._

> _A_      _I was just drawing her attention_

> **_Q_**      **_I am not---that is not answering my question. You could have done it entirely verbally without touching her._**

> **_A_**      **_Maybe._**

> _Q_      _Why maybe, Mr. Rozalie? Because it’s a simple question as in could you have given her feedback that she was standing inappropriately without touching her? You could have done it entirely verbally. Why is it a maybe?_

> _A_      _Because I do not have the luxury of time at that time._

> _Q_      _It would make no difference if you just told her verbally, “stand properly”._

> _A_      _Mr. Lee, I do not have the luxury of time at that moment of time when the incident happened._

> **_Q_**      **_You are not answering my question again, so I will ask you again. You could have done it entirely verbally._**

> **_A_**      **_Maybe, I could._**

> _Q_      _You could have simply told her she was standing inappropriately without touching her at all._

> _A_      _No. Because the posture was really, uh, un---unnecessary._

> **_Q_**      **_So, you couldn’t have just told her “stand properly, don’t lean against the aircraft fixture”? You couldn’t have just told her that? You needed to touch her?_**

> **_A_**      **_No_**

> **_Q_**      **_So you are saying you can’t communicate feedback to your subordinates without touching them?_**

> **_A_**      **_Mr. Lee---_**

> **_Q_**      **_On---no. Listen to my question. You cannot communicate feedback on posture without touching your subordinates?_**

> **_A_**      **_I can._**

> _Q_      _Because your answer to my question just now was you could---couldn’t you have just told her to stand properly, don’t lean against the aircraft fixture without touching her your answer was no. So logically, that must follow. You are unable to communicate feedback about posture to your subordinates without touching them. That must be your evidence, isn’t it?_

> _A_      _Yah. But Mr. Lee, you---you---you are not giving me a chance to explain._

> _Q_      _I am asking you a question and you have not---_

> _A_      _That is not as easy---_

> _Q_      _responded---_

> _A_      _as a---an answer, Mr. Lee. I’m so sorry. But I have to explain myself, right? I’m---_

> _Q_      _It was---_

> _A_      _I’m just asking you to---for me to explain._

> _Q_      _It was unnecessary---sorry. Simply telling her to stand properly, don’t lean against the aircraft fixture would have sufficed._

> _A At that moment of time, the circumstances does not allow, Mr. Lee._

> _Q_      _It was unnecessary for you to have touched Ms. Rebecca if all you had wanted to do was to correct her posture._

> _A_      _I wanted to correct her posture, yes. But you must understand the circumstance that---that I was in at that time—_

> _Q_      _It was not---_

> _A_      _with the luxury of time._

> _\[Emphasis in bold added\]_

33     It can be seen from the above that when asked if he could have corrected the Victim’s posture entirely verbally, his answer was “maybe”. He was unable to give a consistent and firm explanation. Neither was he able to give a reasonable explanation why he could not correct the Victim’s posture verbally without slapping her buttock. Clearly, correction of posture can be done verbally and it would certainly not take too much of a time to verbalize what should be the correct posture.

34     Considering all the circumstances, I found the Accused was not a forthright witness and was not truthful. I therefore rejected his evidence given in his defence.

## The Mens Rea

35     It is trite that the element of intention is rarely, if ever, proved by direct evidence; it is inevitably to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). In my view, the reason the Accused did not choose to correct the Victim’s posture verbally but instead, used his hand to slap on her buttock was because he intended to outrage her modesty. This was consistent with the circumstances and the facts of the case, namely, the Victim was wearing a tight- fitting sarong kebaya and standing in a posture which was “provocative” as admitted by the Accused. In my view, by describing the posture as “provocative”, the Accused must have meant it connoted some sexual desire especially when he made reference to the sarong kebaya that the Victim was wearing which he admitted was tight fitting. Hence, considering the circumstances mentioned earlier, the fact that they had not met before, the way the Accused described the Victim’s posture as well as by slapping her butt cheek and spoke in a cheeky tone, clearly the Accused must have intended to outrage the Victim’s modesty. I also agreed with the Prosecution that “in the present case, the natural consequence of intentionally slapping the Victim’s buttock, which the Accused must have intended having regard to his knowledge that doing so was inappropriate, would be to outrage the Victim’s modesty”[^27]. See also _Sim Yew Thong v Ng Loy Nam Thomas <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 155</span>_ at \[18\][^28].

36     My finding was also consistent with the conduct of the Accused after the incident. After the flight had landed in Manila, the Accused approached the Victim at the aerobridge and later at the cabin, to apologise to her and kept repeating that he had no intention. But the Accused did not provide any defence for slapping the Victim’s buttock[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). The Accused merely said in Malay that “I’m sorry, I hit your ass”.[^30] While in the cockpit in the presence of PW2 Soong, the Victim and others, the Accused did not mention that his intention was to correct the posture of the Victim and to protect the image of SIA. On the contrary, he apologized for his “inappropriate behaviour”[^31]. The Accused agreed that he did not provide any excuse or defence when confronted with the allegation in the cockpit[^32]. PW2 Soong confirmed that if there were any excuses or defence provided by the Accused, it would have been recorded in P5[^33]. PW3 Tjeng, besides confirming the apology made by the Accused, highlighted that the Accused also said, “this is the first time I’ve done it and I will not do it again.”[^34] I also noted that in P6 which was a record made by the Accused, he also did not mention that his intention was to correct the Victim’s posture and protect the image of SIA. In my view, the failure on the part of the Accused to mention that his action was to correct the Victim’s posture and protect the image of SIA, was consistent with that of a guilty mind. His silence was clearly inconsistent with that of an innocent person. It was only in his police statement, which was recorded on 14 May 2019, more than 10 days after the incident that the Accused mentioned about correcting the Victim’s posture and the image of the company. Soon after the investigation by the Police, the Accused also sent an email dated 16 May 2019 to SIA (D4B) where he repeated that his intention was to correct the Victim’s posture and uphold the image of SIA. The same alleged defence was also subsequently mentioned in his cautioned statement, D2, recorded on 4 August 2020. In my view, these were an afterthought made to exculpate himself from prosecution or from any disciplinary action by SIA. If indeed the Accused’s intention was to correct her posture and protect the image of SIA and no other reason, he could have said so when the Victim confronted him and when they met in the presence of the flight captain PW2 Soong and others. The Accused had ample opportunity to do so but chose not to mention his alleged true intention when confronted during the meeting at the cockpit.

## Guilty and Convicted

37     The Accused himself acknowledged that the Victim and him barely knew each other. This was the first time they were working together on board the flight. There was no evidence of any animosity between the parties before the incident or any evidence that the Victim falsely implicated the Accused. For the reasons state above, I rejected the Accused’s denial that he had no intention to molest the victim but had merely touched her to correct her posture in the course of work. As for the intention on the part of the Accused, that may be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case and the conduct of the Accused.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) Considering the objective facts and circumstances of the case stated above, I found that the Accused did slap the Victim’s right buttock with the intent to outrage the modesty of the Victim at the material time. I also found that the Accused slapped the victim’s right buttock upon walking past her while she was attending to a passenger.

38     Having considered all the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty and convicted him of the charge. In my view, the evidence of the Victim was unusually convincing. I had no doubt that the Accused had the requisite _mens rea_ and _actus rea_.

## Sentencing Submissions

39     The Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 6-8 weeks which was the mid-range of band 1 as set out in the sentencing framework in _Kunasekaran_[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). The learned DPP also highlighted that the offence committed on board the aircraft was an aggravating factor. The Victim was a flight stewardess. In this context, it was submitted that the Accused’s action carried a real risk of compromising the ability of the Victim to carry out her duties and to respond to any emergencies that may crop up in the course of the flight.[^37]

40     Counsel for the Accused mitigated orally on behalf of the Accused in court. Counsel submitted for a fine or a 1-day jail term coupled with a fine.

41     The Defence submitted that there was no evidence to suggest any long-term detriment or special trauma suffered by the Victim. It was a fleeting touch with only one instance of contact with the buttocks. There was no skin-to-skin contact.

42     In respect of culpability, counsel submitted that there was no evidence of premeditation.

43     Counsel contended that the Accused was extremely apologetic. He apologised voluntarily in front of everyone. There was no escalation of the situation as the Accused did not interact with the Victim after the incident.

## Sentencing Framework in _Kunasekaran_

44     I applied the sentencing approach in _Kunasekaran_ in determining the sentence to be imposed. The sentencing bands for offences under section 354(1) Penal Code, following the case of _Kunasekaran_ are:

> a)     Band 1: less than 5 months’ imprisonment

> b)     Band 2: 5 to 15 months’ imprisonment

> c)     Band 3: 15 – 24 months’ imprisonment

45     The parties did not dispute that the present case fell within Band 1.

## Offence-specific factors

46     The Accused had smacked the Victim’s right buttock. I accepted that it was a fleeting touch with no skin-to-skin contact and no intrusion of the victim’s private parts. The intrusion was opportunistic and without premeditation. I also noted that the incident took place while the Victim was attending to a passenger.

47     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Victim was distressed by the Accused’s action as seen from her reporting of the incident to numerous people thereafter including the leading steward, the ward leader during transit and to the captain and the first officer on the return flight. The fact that the Victim was traumatised was also documented contemporaneously in exhibit P4.

48     Next, there was also an abuse of authority by the Accused. The Accused was the Victim’s direct supervisor and the highest-ranking cabin crew member on board the flight. The Accused had abused his position as a superior and taken liberties with the Victim when she was attending to a passenger.

49     The fact that the Victim was an air transportation worker at the material time was an aggravating factor[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38). As highlighted by the Prosecution, a flight stewardess performs a function which is essential to the safety and wellbeing of passengers. In the present case, there was a real risk that the Victim who was physically violated and distressed might be less able to respond in an emergency situation as the offence took place shortly before the flight landed in Manila.

50     The present case was also aggravated by the fact that the offence took place while on board an aircraft[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39). As submitted by the Prosecution, there was no accessibility to law enforcement or an escape avenue for the Victim while on flight. But I was mindful that the flight was already preparing for landing and accordingly the degree of aggravation would be lower[^40]. Bearing the above in mind, I was of the view that the charge fell below the mid-range of Band 1 of Kunasekaran’s sentencing framework. I was satisfied that a custodial term was warranted.

## Offender-specific factors

51     I did not find any mitigating factors in favour of the Accused. The fact that the Accused was untraced was a neutral factor. There was no remorse demonstrated by the Accused. The Victim was put on the stand and was subjected to lengthy cross-examination. The Victim also had to relive her trauma by having to recount the event in court.

52     I also noted that the Accused confronted the Victim about the allegation on the aerobridge and shortly after, in the cabin. In this respect, it was not quite correct to say that there was no escalation as there was a heated confrontation between the Victim and the Accused during transit.

## The Sentence

53     Considering the factors above and the submissions of the parties, I sentenced the Accused to 5 weeks’ imprisonment to fulfil the needs for general deterrence.

54     The relevant case precedents tendered by the Prosecution in respect of intrusions on a victim’s buttocks, revealed imprisonment terms ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) The sentence imposed was in line with the sentencing precedents.

55     I was of the view that a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate and commensurate with the overall culpability and criminality of the Accused in this case.

## Conclusion

56     The Accused is currently on bail, pending the hearing of this appeal.
