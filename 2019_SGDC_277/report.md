\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9276/2019/01.\]

11 December 2019

### District Judge Prem Raj Prabakaran:

## Introduction

1       These grounds address the accused’s appeal against sentence. The subject of his appeal is a **mandatory minimum sentence** prescribed in the Misuse of Drugs Act (“the MDA”).[^1]

## Charge

2       The accused, a 41-year-old[^2] Singaporean, claimed trial to a single charge. This was for having in his possession a controlled drug, an offence under s 8(_a_) of the MDA. The charge read as follows:

> …that you, on 8 May 2018 at about 4.10 a.m., in the vicinity of …232 Geylang Road, Singapore 389292, did have in your possession a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act…,to wit, **1 packet containing not less than 0.19 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain 5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group**[^3], without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the said Act…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

3       The vegetable matter containing the controlled drug (“the Drug”) – a synthetic cannabinoid[^4] – was found inside a packet seized from the accused by the arresting officer, Sergeant Ahmad Razali bin Jamil[^5] (“Sgt Razali”).[^6] The word “BUTTERFLY” and the image of a butterfly were printed on the packet (“the Packet”). The Packet was thus referred to as the “butterfly packet”[^7] or “packet of butterfly”[^8] during the trial.

4       The accused knew that the Packet was in his possession.[^9] But, he said he thought the Packet (which he averred was given to him by an “old friend”, who he did not call as a witness) contained tobacco. He claimed he did not know that the Packet contained the Drug.[^10]

5       I convicted the accused, after hearing the evidence of the witnesses (including the accused) and reviewing the parties’ submissions.

## Mandatory minimum sentence imposed

6       The accused had previously been convicted of the same offence.[^11] He was hence liable to enhanced punishment. Section 33(1), read with the Second Schedule, of the MDA, prescribes the following sentences of imprisonment:

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="25.22%"> <col width="74.78%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Prescribed imprisonment sentences</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Minimum</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Maximum</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

7       I sentenced the accused to 2 years’ imprisonment (_viz_., the mandatory minimum sentence), with effect from 31 October 2019.[^12] The accused, who is currently serving sentence, has since appealed this sentence. His earliest date of release is 2 March 2021.

8       During the trial, I had explained to the accused on multiple occasions that the court could not impose a sentence below the prescribed mandatory minimum sentence.[^13] The accused has nevertheless appealed (only) against his sentence and not his conviction. These grounds are therefore in two parts. The first part addresses only his appeal against sentence. The second part is an appendix setting out my reasons for convicting him.

## Trial proceedings

9       The Prosecution called seven witnesses. They included the arresting officer[^14] and an analyst from the Health Sciences Authority[^15] who signed the certificate under s 16 of the MDA relating to the controlled drug (in the Packet).[^16] Evidence was also led to establish the chain of custody of the Packet from the point of seizure to the point of analysis. The accused did not dispute the evidence of the witnesses called by the Prosecution in any material way.

### Case for the Prosecution

10     Sgt Razali, the arresting officer, was the key witness for the Prosecution. He had been patrolling the vicinity of Lorong 10 Geylang[^17] with his partners on 8 May 2018 at about 4:00am. They were all in plain clothes.

11     As they were patrolling, Sgt Razali spotted the accused standing[^18] at a nearby coffeeshop. After informing his partners that he was going to “make a check on the accused”[^19], he walked towards the accused while his partners followed some distance behind.[^20] As Sgt Razali was walking towards the accused, the accused started to walk away from the coffeeshop. Sgt Razali managed to stop the accused at some point after the coffeeshop[^21], and identified himself as a police officer. He noticed that the accused “was slurred in speech and his movement was unsteady”.[^22] He therefore demanded the accused’s particulars and frisked the accused. On frisking the accused, he found the Packet in a pocket at the front of the accused’s pants.[^23]

12     When Sgt Razali questioned the accused about the brown substance in the Packet, the accused kept silent.[^24] Sgt Razali then “immediately placed \[the Packet\] inside \[a\] seizure bag and sealed the \[bag\] in the presence of the accused.”[^25]

13     While Sgt Razali was engaging the accused,[^26] his partners were conducting checks on another man the accused had been with.[^27]

14     Sgt Razali arrested the accused and escorted him to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters in a car.[^28] The accused did not say anything to him during the journey.[^29]

### Case for the Defence

15     The accused testified in his defence. He did not call any other witness. His evidence was somewhat difficult to follow, as he was rather incoherent.

16     The accused said he had just started working as a debt collector in Geylang for a couple of weeks before he was arrested. He had therefore run out of money and was “very down”.[^30]

17     On 7 May 2018, he was walking along Lorong 10 Geylang at about 11:00pm. He wanted to cross the road to take a bus from the opposite side of the road.[^31] As he was walking along Lorong 10 Geylang, a male Indian[^32] alighted from a bus. When they looked at each other, the male Indian called out the accused’s name. The accused replied “No”, and also asked the male Indian “You saw who?” The male Indian replied, “Ramesh lah. You forget? Ramesh?”[^33] The accused claimed “Ramesh” was his “childhood friend”[^34]. Until their chance encounter on 7 May 2018, they had not met for some 20 years.[^35]

18     “Ramesh” told the accused he had seen the accused on television and social media. According to the accused, he had appeared in the media for “Singapore Debt Collection Service LLP” (a debt collection company). “Ramesh” then remarked that the accused must be “making a lot of money”.[^36] The accused denied, and informed “Ramesh” that he had since quit this debt collection company and was now with another company.

19     The accused claimed that “Ramesh” then asked him for money. In response, he informed “Ramesh” that he did not have any. He also told “Ramesh” that he did not even have money for a cigarette. When he then asked Ramesh for a cigarette[^37], “Ramesh” gave him the Packet (with its contents). As it was past 11:00pm, he told “Ramesh” that he had to catch the bus home. They then parted ways, and the accused continued walking along Lorong 10 Geylang.

20     As he was walking, the accused saw another “childhood friend” – one “Muhammad”. “Muhammad” was with two other persons the accused did not know. When the accused asked “Muhammad” what he was doing in this “trouble place”[^38], “Muhammad” informed him that he had a “problem”[^39] with a secret society. On hearing this, the accused offered to help “Muhammad” “talk peace”[^40] with the secret society. The accused was arrested soon thereafter.

## Elements of offence of possession

21     To make out the offence of possession under s 8(_a_) of the MDA, the Prosecution must establish:[^41]

> (a)     the fact of knowing possession; and

> (b)     the “_mens rea_ element, which is \[the accused’s\] knowledge of the nature of the drugs that \[he was\] in possession of”.

22     The offence is hence “not a strict liability offence that is established simply by proof of the fact of possession”.[^42]

### Proving the fact of knowing possession

23     Possession, for the purposes of the MDA, “has been interpreted to mean not just physical possession or custody but also to incorporate an element of knowledge”.[^43] “\[A\]ll that is required in \[the\] context of establishing the fact of \[knowing\] possession is that the accused…must know of the existence, within his possession, control or custody, of the thing which is later found to be a controlled drug; it is not necessary that the accused…also knows that the thing was in fact a controlled drug, much less its specific nature”.[^44] As such, when proving the fact of knowing possession, the Prosecution:[^45]

> …must prove not only that the accused was in possession of the package or container but also that the accused knew that \[the package or container\] contained something, which may later be established to be the…controlled drugs. However, in proving possession, it is not incumbent on the Prosecution to prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs, or even of something that turns out to be contraband, as long as \[the Prosecution\] proves that \[the accused\] was in \[knowing\] possession[^46] of something and that thing turns out to be the drugs in question.[^47]

24     The Prosecution can establish the fact of knowing possession by:[^48]

> (a)     proof beyond reasonable doubt of knowing (as opposed to inadvertent) possession of the thing; or

> (b)     invoking the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA[^49], which is then not rebutted.[^50]

25     Section 18(1) of the MDA reads as follows:

> **Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs**

> **18.—(1**)    Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —

>> (a)    anything containing a controlled drug;

>> (b)    the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;

>> (c)    the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or

>> (d)    a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,

> shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.

26     The ambit of s 18(1) of the MDA was discussed in _Obeng Comfort v PP_[^51] (“_Obeng Comfort_”) in the following terms:

> 34    Section 18(1) lists certain circumstances under which a person is presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession. **For the purposes of s 18(1), what we are concerned with is whether the thing in issue exists and whether the accused in fact has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue. The thing in issue is the container, the key or the document of title. In this sense, this provision deals with secondary possession of the drug in that the accused possesses, controls or has custody of something which has the drug or which relates to the title in, or delivery of, the drug.** As is evident in s 18(3), the accused does not need to be in physical possession of the drug, _ie_, primary possession. **At this stage, we are also not concerned with the qualities of the drug…Once the Prosecution proves that the thing in issue exists and that the accused has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue, the effect of s 18(1) is to raise a presumption of fact, which is that the accused, by virtue of his possession, control or custody of the thing in issue, is presumed to possess the drugs which are contained in or are related to the thing in issue.**

> 35    To rebut the presumption in s 18(1), the accused has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drug in his possession. **In this context, the most obvious way in which the presumption can be rebutted is by establishing that the accused did not know that the thing in issue contained that which is shown to be the drug in question. Thus, for instance, the presumption could be rebutted successfully if the accused is able to persuade the court that the drug was slipped into his bag or was placed in his vehicle or his house without his knowledge. The inquiry under s 18(1) does not extend to the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drug.** That is dealt with under the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) where a person who is proved or presumed to be in possession of a controlled drug is presumed to have known “the nature of that drug”…

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

### Proving the mens rea element

27     It is only after the fact of knowing possession is proved (or presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA and unrebutted) that the element of knowledge becomes relevant.[^52] On this note, the Prosecution may establish the _mens rea_ element (_viz_., the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs he was in possession of)[^53] by:[^54]

> (a)     proof beyond reasonable doubt; or

> (b)     invoking the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA[^55], which is then not rebutted.

28     Section 18(2) of the MDA reads as follows:

> **Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs**

> **18.—(1**)    …

>> (2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be _presumed to have known the nature of that drug_.

> \[emphasis added in italics\]

29     The reference to “nature of \[the\] drug” in s 18(2) of the MDA refers to the specific controlled drug found in the accused’s possession”[^56] (_viz_., “5-Fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group”[^57] in this case).

30     To rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA, the accused must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug in his possession.[^58] The issue of how the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) can be rebutted was addressed in _Obeng Comfort_ in the following terms:

> 39    In a case where the accused is seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, as a matter of common sense and practical application, he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, particularly when the goods have to be carried across international borders as they could be prohibited goods or goods which are subject to tax. It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite. **Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about.** The presumption under s 18(2) operates to vest the accused with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of, and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was.

> 40     **Where the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (“the purported item”), the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry.** For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. If it is an ordinary item that is easily available in the country of receipt, the court would want to know why it was necessary for him to transport it from another country. If it is a perishable or fragile item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to preserve it or to prevent damage to it. If it is a precious item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to keep it safe from loss through theft or otherwise. If it is a dangerous item, the court would consider how the item was packed and handled. **Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account (ie, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true). This depends not only on the credibility of the accused as a witness but also on how believable his account relating to the purported item is**.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

## Brief reasons for conviction

31     The appendix to these grounds set out my reasons for convicting the accused. I summarise my reasons in this section.

### Accused had knowing possession of Packet

32     The accused knew that the Packet and its contents (which he supposedly thought was tobacco) were in his possession. This was sufficient to establish his knowing possession of the Packet.

33     In any event, the evidence of Sgt Razali[^59] – who I found to be a forthcoming and candid witness – was sufficient to raise the presumption of fact under s 18(1)(_a_) of the MDA[^60] that the accused, by virtue of his possession of the Packet, was presumed to possess the Drug contained in the Packet.[^61] The accused did not adduce any evidence to rebut this presumption.

### Accused failed to rebut presumption of knowledge

34     I also found that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. He did not prove, on a balance of probabilities that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the Drug.[^62] I did not find his account relating to the Packet believable. In addition, I did not find the accused to be a credible witness.[^63]

35     I therefore convicted the accused on the charge.

## Accused’s criminal antecedents

36     The accused was not a first offender. Between 1996 and 2014, he served several sentences of imprisonment. His first convictions were for drug offences. These convictions and the sentences imposed are set out in the following table:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.9%"> <col width="45.6%"> <col width="27.5%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Date of conviction</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20 December 1996</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of a controlled drug</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 month’s imprisonment (consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of a controlled drug</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 months’ imprisonment (consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption of a controlled drug</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 November 1997</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption of a controlled drug</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

37     The accused’s last conviction was in May 2014, for the offence of theft with common intention. He was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

38     Between his first and last convictions, his remaining convictions were primarily for disorderly behaviour and using inappropriate words or behaviour towards public servants. In July 2000, he was also convicted of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means with common intention. The total sentences imposed ranged from 10 weeks’ imprisonment to 30 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

## Decision on sentence

39     The Prosecution sought “the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment…in the absence of any further aggravating factors”.[^64] Although the accused had claimed trial, the Prosecution stated that it was not seeking any uplift to this sentence. According to the Prosecution, this was “the general position \[it was\] taking with respect to such cases”.[^65] The Prosecution also acknowledged that the interval between the accused’s last conviction for drug consumption and his current offence (_viz_., a period of more than 21 years) was “a \[sentencing\] factor that could be relevant as well”.[^66]

40     The accused sought “the lightest sentence possible”.[^67] He stated that he had “not been involved in drugs for almost twenty years and \[was\] a changed person now”. According to the accused, he had since repented and was determined to lead a better life. With his fiancée’s constant support and encouragement, he had slowly changed. He now had a full-time job. They also had a new house to look forward to. However, both his job and house had to be “put on hold…because of the sentencing”. The accused also stated that he wished “to settle down and live a normal life”.

41     The accused claimed he understood that the court had to impose the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment at least.[^68] But, he urged the court to “try \[to give him\] a lower sentence” nonetheless.

42     I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment. Having claimed trial, the accused was not entitled to any sentencing discount usually accorded to offenders who plead guilty. That said, I decided against any uplift to the mandatory minimum sentence because the accused’s last conviction for the same drug offence was some 21 years ago. While I noted his other convictions, I bore in mind that they were for unrelated offences. I was aware that the accused’s incarceration would affect his job and plans to settle down. But, these were consequences that followed inevitably after his conviction. They were certainly not mitigating in any way. In any event, the sentence imposed in this case was already – as the accused urged the court to impose[^69] – the “lightest sentence possible”.

## Conclusion

43     A sentence may be reduced on appeal if it is “manifestly excessive”.[^70] The imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence, prescribed by legislation, cannot be said to be “manifestly excessive”.

**Appendix: Reasons for conviction**

### Introduction

1       This appendix sets out my reasons for convicting the accused. To make out the offence of possession under s 8(_a_) of the MDA, the Prosecution must establish:[^71]

> (a)     the fact of knowing possession; and

> (b)     the “_mens rea_ element, which is \[the accused’s\] knowledge of the nature of the drugs that \[he was\] in possession of”.

### Accused had knowing possession of Packet

2       Sgt Razali had testified that he found the Packet in a pocket at the front of the accused’s pants.[^72] When cross-examining Sgt Razali, the accused suggested that Sgt Razali had found the Packet in his[^73] wallet instead.[^74] However, when cross-examined by the Prosecution, the accused testified that he had “put \[the Packet\] behind \[his\] pocket”.[^75] Notwithstanding these different versions, the accused ultimately knew that the Packet and its contents (which he supposedly thought was tobacco) were in his possession. This was sufficient to establish his knowing possession of the Packet.

3       In any event, the evidence of Sgt Razali[^76] – who I found to be a forthcoming and candid witness – was sufficient to raise the presumption of fact under s 18(1)(_a_) of the MDA[^77] that the accused, by virtue of his possession of the Packet, was presumed to possess the Drug contained in the Packet.[^78] The accused did not adduce any evidence to rebut this presumption.

### Accused failed to rebut presumption of knowledge

4       “\[I\]f an accused is either (a) proved to have had the controlled drug in his possession; or (b) presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA to have had the controlled drug in his possession and the contrary is not proved, the presumption under s 18(2) that he has knowledge of the nature of the drug would be invoked. This follows because an accused person, who, it has been established, was in possession of the controlled drug should be taken to know the nature of that drug unless he can demonstrate otherwise.”[^79]

#### Accused’s testimony was not persuasive

5       I found that the accused failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. He did not prove, on a balance of probabilities that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the Drug.[^80] I did not find his account relating to the Packet believable. I also did not find him to be a credible witness.[^81]

6       The accused claimed he thought the Packet contained tobacco because “Ramesh” had given the Packet to him when he asked “Ramesh” for a cigarette.[^82] But, he never explained his basis for thinking that the Packet contained tobacco. It was not his evidence that “Ramesh” had expressly told him that the Packet contained tobacco. Indeed, the following extract from the transcript of the accused’s cross-examination showed he was unsure why “Ramesh” gave him the Packet when he had only asked for a cigarette:[^83]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

So, what exactly did he give to you?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**I don’t know it’s cigarette when I ask cigarette, he give me this packet, lah.**

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

**Because you mentioned cigarette?**

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**Yah. Tobacco. I asked him for cigarette, but he gave me this.**

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So, when you ask him for a cigarette, he gave you \[the Packet\].

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yah.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Butterfly packets.

 |
| 

A

 | 

He say, uh, “Left a little bit, you just take only lah”. He say “Little bit, okay. You can have it”.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Can you identify which packet you’re referring to?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

This one, lah.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

That’s exhibit P3.

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

 |

  
  

7       The accused was also not consistent in his evidence-in-chief as to who gave him the Packet. At one point, his evidence suggested it was “Muhammad”[^84] (and not “Ramesh”) who gave him the Packet:[^85]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

…So this Muhammad, the other time I saw him…I talk to him. I say, “Now, I’ve been…**because of you, now I charged, you know**. Tobacco, they said it got chemical inside. Because of it, he say he cried.” I say, “You cry for what. You should…come to the Court and tell the Court.” And I can’t locate him seriously…

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

 |

  
  

8       At another point, his evidence seemed to affirm it was actually “Muhammad” who gave him the Packet:[^86]

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. Let’s talk…more about this conversation where you asked him for a cigarette.

 |
| 

\[A\]:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

And then what happened?

 |
| 

\[A\]:

 | 

Then he give me cigarette. **Then I say “Eh, Muhammad this one what?”** Then he say “Tobacco.”. I say, “So little ah?” I say, “Then how to smoke?” Because I do not consume also. I do not consume also. So, while walking, uh, even at Lorong 10 while they was talking about their problem, I also ask them cigarette.

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

 |

  
  

9       Neither “Ramesh” nor “Muhammad” were called as witnesses to support the accused’s bare assertions. The accused also failed to provide _any_ details about “Ramesh” or “Muhammad” as well as their meeting when his two investigation statements (the voluntariness of which were not challenged[^87]) were recorded. These statements were recorded from 11:45am on 8 May 2018 (_viz_., within eight hours of his arrest earlier that day)[^88] and on 26 June 2018 (_viz_., less than two months from his date of arrest)[^89]. His memory of the events between 7 and 8 May 2018 would have been fresh on these two occasions. Yet, he made no mention of how he met “Ramesh”, where he met “Ramesh”, and his relationship with “Ramesh” (among other details).[^90] Indeed, the accused only referred to one “Ramesh” in his Case for the Defence that was dated 28 February 2019[^91] – nearly 10 months after the date of his arrest. Even then, his Case for the Defence did not state that “Ramesh” gave him the Packet.

10     In these circumstances, I was of the view that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. His account relating to who had given him the Packet was inconsistent.[^92] His claim that “Ramesh” had given him the Packet was unjustifiably belated.[^93] He also adduced no evidence to explain his basis for thinking that the Packet contained tobacco – when he was already unsure why “Ramesh” gave him the Packet and not the cigarette he asked for.[^94]

11     I did not therefore find the accused to be a credible witness.

#### Credit of accused successfully impeached

12     My view as to the accused’s (lack of) credibility was fortified when the Prosecution sought to impeach his credit with his investigation statements, under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act.[^95] This was done during the course of his cross-examination by the Prosecution, on the basis that his investigation statements were inconsistent with his evidence in court. The accused did not dispute that he gave both statements voluntarily.[^96] He also testified that he had been cooperative with the officers who recorded these statements from him and had told them the truth.[^97]

13     Impeachment seeks to “undermine \[an accused’s\] credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on”.[^98] In an impeachment exercise, “the court must consider the discrepancies \[or inconsistencies\] and the explanation proffered \[by the accused\] for the purpose of an overall assessment of \[the accused’s\] credibility”.[^99] The successful impeachment of an accused’s credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act goes to the weight of his oral testimony.[^100]

14     There were three main inconsistencies between the accused’s testimony and his investigation statements. These related to:

> (a)     his financial situation;

> (b)     whether he had consumed the contents in the Packet; and

> (c)     when he received the Packet.

##### Inconsistency over accused’s financial situation

15     In examination-in-chief, the accused has testified that he had no money when he met “Ramesh” as he had just started working for another debt collection company.[^101] He said that “Ramesh” had given him the Packet after he asked “Ramesh” for a cigarette and informed “Ramesh” that he did not even have money for a cigarette.[^102] In cross-examination, he also testified that he earned only between $800 and $1,000 per month.[^103]

16     The accused’s testimony as to his (precarious) financial situation was, however, inconsistent with his first investigation statement. This statement had been recorded less than eight hours after the Packet was found in his possession. There, he had informed the recording officer that he was “working full time as a debt collector and…earn\[ing\] a monthly income of about SGD 4000” – a sum far greater than the sum he stated during cross-examination.

17     When the Prosecution pointed out this inconsistency, I noted the accused’s discomfort as he tried – rather incoherently – to explain the inconsistency. He even admitted that “sometimes” he was able to earn up to $5,000. The relevant extract from the transcript of his cross-examination read as follows:[^104]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Would you now agree that the amount that you provided this Court this morning as $1,000---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

That---was the---range, yah, that was the range.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Let him finish his questions.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Would you not agree that $1,000 and $4,000 are very different estimates?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, but I give you the range because I can’t earn up to 4,000 sometime earn less, sometime that is the average between my commission, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But did---but did the Court not tell you that you are simply required to provide a range?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes. I give the range about a thousand but I worry if I give above then if sometime down, up, down, up, down.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But you did not mention 4,000 at all this morning in evidence?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yah. Because my range, I---I don’t want to go up to 5,000, sometimes I can earn up to 5,000 also. It depends on my commission, I’m telling the truth because if not, why should I put up the name, at here I do not put up name but that second, because I---at the moment, I remember the fellow name, I state---tell the truth that fellow name.

 |

  
  

18     The Prosecution then put it to the accused that he had stated a far lower monthly salary to support his case as to why he had asked “Ramesh” for a cigarette (_viz_., because he did not even have money for a cigarette). In response, the accused testified that he had earned a monthly salary of $4,000 only when he was working with his _previous_ debt collection company (_viz_., “Singapore Debt Collection Service LLP”[^105]). This was a departure from his first statement, where it was clear that he was referring to his _present_ circumstances (and as of the day the Packet was found in his possession). The relevant extract from this statement[^106] read as follows:

> I am feeling well and comfortable to have my statement recorded in English Language. I am also known as ‘Prince’ to my friends and family. I am divorced and I am currently working full time as a debt collector and I earn a monthly income of about SGD 4000. I am no longer staying at the above mentioned address. I am now staying at Blk 76 Telok Blangah Height…

##### Inconsistency over whether accused consumed contents in Packet

19     The accused had testified – on three occasions during his cross-examination – that he _never_ consumed the contents in the Packet after receiving the Packet from “Ramesh”.[^107] He had, however, stated otherwise in _both_ of his investigation statements. The relevant extract from the first investigation statement read as follows:

>   
| 

5

 | 

With regard to the exhibit recovered \[_ie_, the Packet and its contents\], I admit it belongs to me and it was meant for my own consumption. It is ‘butterfly’ which is the same as a cigarette to me. **A friend had given it to me 2 days ago on 06/05/18 when I asked him for a cigarette.** He passed me a used packet of ‘butterfly’ **and I rolled it myself for me to smoke**…

 |
| 

\[emphasis added in bold\]

 |

  
  

20     The relevant extract from his subsequent statement[^108] read as follows:

> 7.    I am now asked about the rolling paper that was used for me to smoke the “butterfly”. I want to say that I have already finished the rolling paper when I was arrested on the 8/5/2018. I am also asked about the friend who gave me the “butterfly” to smoke. I want to say that I do not remember who gave me the “butterfly”. I cannot remember because before I asked my friend for cigarette, I took “epam” tablets and my memory is not very clear. **I took the “butterfly” from him and smoke it because I have no more cigarettes with me.** The exhibit that was found on me during my arrest is the remaining “butterfly” that my friend gave me. I want to say that it belongs to me and is for my own consumption only.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

21     The accused therefore admitted to smoking the contents of the Packet in both of his investigation statements. When the Prosecution pointed out the discrepancy between his testimony and his first investigation statement to the accused, his furnished an incoherent explanation for the inconsistency:[^109]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Can you refer to paragraph 5 of your statement? This will be in exhibit P9. In the middle of the paragraph you say that, “He passed me a used packet of Butterfly and I rolled it myself for me to smoke. The balance tobacco inside the packet is meant for myself”.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, that’s what I said. But then, I have not rolled it yet. I do not have even the whole---whole paper.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So what do you mean when you say, “I rolled it for myself to smoke”?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yah, because I’m saying that that cigarette is for me to roll because that is a tobacco because I keep on asking for cigarette. But then, he did not have cigarette, he give me this. So he said, “That is all I have”, he gave me.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But, Mr. Rashid, would you not agree with me from the way you have described in the s---in the statement, it suggests that you had rolled the Butterfly packet for yourself to smoke?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

That one when I asked him for cigarette but I have not rolled yet, if I roll it, my urine should have been dirty already.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Your version in Court seems to be different from the version in your statement.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Sir, Your Honour, as I told you at that time when he took my statement, I have got cases and I was so confused because I do not know what the content is, and then I got cases. I don’t want to get myself into another cases.

 |

  
  

##### Inconsistency over when accused received Packet

22     In examination-in-chief, the accused had testified that “Ramesh” had given him the Packet sometime after 11:00pm (but before midnight) on 7 May 2018.[^110] This was, however, inconsistent with his first investigation statement. There, the accused had informed the recording officer that a “friend had given \[the Packet\] to \[him\] 2 days ago on 06/05/18”.[^111] When confronted with this inconsistency, the accused claimed he had informed the recording officer that he wished to amend this aspect in his first investigation statement.[^112] However, he never explained why this alleged amendment was not made to his first statement (and he did not put any questions in this regard to the recording officer of this statement[^113], who was called by the Prosecution as a witness[^114]).

23     In addition, the accused did not explain why he had nevertheless signed on both pages of the first investigation statement – which he agreed had been read back to him after it was recorded[^115] – to confirm that:

> (a)     the contents of the statement were “true and correct”; and

> (b)     he “\[did\] not wish to make any changes to this statement”.

24     Further, the accused had confirmed at the outset of the recording of his second investigation statement that he did not wish to make any changes to his first investigation statement (after it had been read back to him once more).

25     The accused had also offered a second reason as to why he had informed the recording officer that a “friend had given \[the Packet\] to \[him\] 2 days ago on 06/05/18”.[^116] He claimed that he was in a “dilemma” and confused at the time the first investigation statement was recorded because he was “focusing” on his other case (involving an outrage of modesty). In this regard, his explanation was yet again incoherent:[^117]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. Mr. Rashid, if you refer to paragraph 5, the 2nd sentence, “A friend had given it to me 2 days ago on 6th May 2018 when I asked him for a cigarette?”

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes. Ramesh, that’s the one.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

That was 6th May 2018?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

It’s supposed to be on the 7th, on that day itself.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

You said 2 days ago?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Okay. Because, you know what, at that moment, I have another cases, that was---even the officer know that was the outrage of modesty, I was already into dilemma, and that case, I go on my own searching and that case drop. I was really---was focusing on my case, I have another case which I was accused.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But you know what you are in question for...And you said specifically in your statement 2 days ago?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

But then, that was making a confuse because I had another problem which I told Sir that I had this molest case---outrage of modesty which they are the same time then it dropped on August. So, firstly, it was not brought by this case, the case was being in Court for outrage of modesty then this case came up. That’s why the Judge was asking that time, “Which charges you are charging, you are charging outrage of modesty then how come these charges come, which is which one?” So, at that moment, Sir, uh, Your Honour, I was in very dilemma because of that outrage modesty which I was being accused which I never do. I was at Court that time, Court 26, I was at there watching people case, I don’t have any case, I just come there and see people case and I did---I drink, yes, I drink, I drink outside then I came in to the Court, I went outside and drink then I call up my wife---call up my wife to fetch her after work which I board the train Jurong, I fall asleep because I was standing.

 |

  
  

26     I failed to see how any alleged confusion over, or focus on, a separate and distinct offence could have led the accused to state that he had received the Packet on a different day – bearing in mind that the first statement was recorded just a few hours after he had allegedly received the Packet from “Ramesh”.

27     In any event, the two reasons offered by the accused seemed inconsistent with one another. On the one hand, he stated that he had informed the recording officer that he wanted to amend the first investigation statement (which meant he was aware of the alleged error at the time the statement was recorded). On the other hand, he claimed that he had made the error because he was confused.

28     Given the accused’s incoherent and less than satisfactory explanations for these inconsistencies, I found that the Prosecution had successfully impeached the credit of the accused. I was, however, mindful that:[^118]

> …the fact that the credit of an accused person…has been impeached does not necessarily mean that all his evidence must be disregarded. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded.

29     Having scrutinised the whole of the evidence, I was of the view that no weight should be placed on the accused’s evidence that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug in his possession.[^119] He therefore failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. As such, I convicted him on the charge.

Thus, an accused…will not be found to be in possession of drugs (even if they were within his physical custody) if they were planted on his without his knowledge…The distinction may be expressed in terms of inadvertent possession on the one hand, which would not amount to possession in the legal sense, and knowing possession, which would.
