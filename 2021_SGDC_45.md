Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9037/2021/01.\]

8 March 2021

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to three charges relating to the abuse of a 30-year old female victim with a mild intellectual disability. The offences took place in a flat in Woodlands Drive (“the Woodlands flat”) where the accused was staying at the material time. The accused’s cruel actions were tragically part of a wider pattern of abuse which was only revealed after the victim was rushed to the hospital in a critical condition on 16 January 2018.

2       As the accused has appealed against her sentence of eight-and-a-half years’ imprisonment, I will set out the reasons for my decision.

3       For ease of reference, the three proceeded charges are summarised in the following table:

## Facts

### Other family members

6       The accused stayed in the Woodlands flat with a number of other family members. Reference will be made to the following family members in the facts that follow:

> (a)     Hany Aboubakr Abdelkarim Abdelfattah: The accused’s husband.

> (b)     Hasmah Binte Sulong: The accused’s mother.

> (c)     Hasniza Binte Ismail: The accused’s elder sister.

> (d)     Muhammad Iskandar Bin Ismail: The accused’s second brother.

> (e)     Muhammad Iski Bin Ismail: The accused’s third brother.

### The Victim

7       The victim was a 30-year old female who was a secondary school friend of the victim’s youngest brother Muhammad Isafi Bin Ismail. It was through this connection that the victim became acquainted with the accused and the rest of her family. The victim would visit Isafi and his family at the Woodlands flat and would periodically stay there due to her family problems.

8       Sometime in early 2016, the victim ran away from home “for good”[^2] and moved into the Woodlands flat. At that point, the victim was working at a McDonalds restaurant and there was an arrangement for the victim to pay the accused’s mother Hasmah $150 a month for laundry and the victim would sleep on a mat in the living room.

9       After moving into the flat, the accused demanded that the victim hand over her ATM card, passport, and NRIC to her. The accused’s sister Hasniza also discussed with the accused about making the victim their slave.[^3]

### The Beginning of the abuse

10     Sometime between May and June 2016, the accused confronted the victim and accused her of performing fellatio on Hany, the accused’s husband. Various members of the accused’s family including Hany were present. The accused scolded the victim and slapped her once on the face and instigated Hany to slap the victim as well. From then on, members of the accused’s family repeatedly perpetrated acts of abuse against the victim.

11     Apart from the incidents that give rise to the three proceeded charges, the Statement of Facts also describes other acts of abuse against the victim. In this part of the judgment, I will outline the facts in relation to the proceeded charges.

#### DAC 900785/2020: Hammering of the victim’s teeth – s.324 Penal Code

12     Sometime between 8 June 2017 and 25 June 2017, during the fasting period before Hari Raya Puasa, the victim was in the living room of the flat together with the accused and Hasmah. Hasmah started complaining to the accused that the victim was very dirty and messy and instructed the accused to knock out the victim’s teeth with a hammer.

13     Upon hearing this, the accused commanded the victim to wait for her in the bathroom adjoining the kitchen at the flat. The victim was frightened and did as she was told. Shortly after, the accused entered the bathroom with a hammer the length of an A4 paper (around 30 cm in length), with a wooden handle and a steel head. She instructed the victim to sit on the toilet seat and to open her mouth. The accused then forcefully hit the victim’s two upper front teeth with the hammer twice. As a result of the accused’s forceful hits to the victim’s teeth, the whole of the victim’s front left upper tooth became dislodged and fell out immediately. In addition, the victim’s front right upper tooth was also chipped. The ordeal was extremely painful for the victim but she did not scream or cry for help as she knew it would be futile.[^4] Subsequently, more of her right upper tooth chipped off while she was eating.

### Facts relating to the three proceeded charges

#### DAC 900786/2020: Splashing hot water

14     Sometime in June 2017, after the events of DAC-900785-2020, the accused saw the victim in the kitchen of the flat. She got angry with the victim’s presence, reached for a white electric kettle containing hot water and splashed the hot water from the kettle on the victim. At the time, the victim was standing in front of the accused and the hot water scalded her front lower body and both her thighs. The scalding from the hot water was painful and caused blistering burns to the victim. However, the victim did not dare to cry out for help or tell anyone that she was scalded by the accused as she was fearful that the accused would scald her with hot water again.

15     Later that day, as her burn wounds were left unattended, the victim’s trousers started sticking onto her wounds. Hasmah and Hasniza noticed her fidgeting with her trousers and discovered the burn injuries. Hasniza then bought a cream and applied it onto the victim’s scald wounds.[^5]

#### DAC 900791/2020: Twisting and fracturing the second left toe with pliers

16     Sometime between September and October 2017, the victim was with Hasmah, the accused, and Iskandar’s wife, Arniyati, in the living room of the Block 714 Unit when the accused got angry with the victim again. The accused demanded that the victim sit on the floor of the living room and went to the kitchen to retrieve a pair of pliers from a toolbox stored in the cabinet under the kitchen sink.

17     In the living room, the accused sat in front of the victim. She clipped and tried to twist the victim’s second left toe with the plier. However, the victim quickly shifted her left foot. Frustrated, the accused shouted at Hasmah to help her twist the victim’s toes with pliers.

18     Hasmah positioned herself to the right of the victim while the accused was on the victim’s left. In furtherance of their common intention to cause grievous hurt to the victim, Hasmah and the accused, each armed with a pair of pliers, clipped and twisted the victim’s toes. The accused clipped and twisted the victim’s second left toe, while Hasmah clipped and twisted her second and third right toes.

19     The accused twisted the victim’s second left toe very forcefully and the victim felt her second left toe breaking when the accused was twisting it. The pain was excruciating and the victim screamed out in pain. Her second left toe was fractured as a result and it bled profusely. Throughout the entire incident, Arniyati was present and saw Hasmah and the accused’s joint abuse on the victim.

20     After the assault, the accused went to purchase medication for the victim. However, the medication had no effect on the victim’s fractured second left toe. The accused and Hasniza then took turns to bandage the victim’s injured second left toe with a sanitary pad, so as to prevent the blood from her toe from smearing onto the floor of the flat.

21     As a result of this incident and following the lack of proper medical attention, the victim sustained a left second toe deformity. [^6]

## Prosecution’s Submissions

22     The prosecution’s sentencing submission dealt with:

> (a)     The applicable sentencing principles.

> (b)     The general aggravating factors

> (c)     Applying the _Ng Soon Kim_ sentencing approach to each of the individual charges in order to arrive at indicative sentences for each charge, while at the same time bearing in mind the sentences imposed in previous cases.

23     Based on these considerations, the prosecution submitted that the accused should be sentenced to at least 36 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving the use of a hammer, at least 30 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving hot water, and at least 48 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving the use of pliers. In addition, the prosecution submitted that all 3 sentences should run consecutively for a total sentence of nine and a half years’ imprisonment.

## My Decision

24     For ease of reference, my decision is divided into the following parts:

> (a)     General aggravating factors that apply to all charges.

> (b)     Applicable sentencing principles.

> (c)     Defence mitigation plea.

> (d)     Adopting the approach in _Ng Soon Kim_ to arrive at indicative sentence for each offence.

> (e)     Sentences to run consecutively and the totality principle.

## General Aggravating Factors

25     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the following general aggravating factors were present in this case:

> (a)     Vulnerable victim.

> (b)     Abuse of trust and authority

> (c)     Pattern of abuse

> (d)     Psychological harm caused to the victim

> (e)     Deliberate concealment of the offences

### Vulnerable victim

26     In _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> at \[34\], the Court of Appeal made the following observation in relation to offenders who exploit or take advantage of vulnerable persons:

>     The law recognises the special need to protect certain groups of vulnerable persons, such as the handicapped, the incapacitated, children and the elderly. An offender’s culpability will generally be viewed as enhanced where the victim is vulnerable. This is because the offender will, in such circumstances, be seen as exploiting or **_taking advantage of a relatively helpless person_**. In general, the more vulnerable the victim, the more culpable the offender. (emphasis added)

27     The present victim was a vulnerable person in view of her mild intellectual disability which allowed her to be exploited by the accused and prevented her from seeking help or escaping. The report prepared by the Institute of Mental Health states:

>     Her deficits in intellectual functions such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, judgment and learning from experience would have affected her ability to seek appropriate help at the time of the alleged offences against her.

28     While the accused may not be aware of the exact nature of the victim’s condition, it was clear from the facts that the accused knew that she was “taking advantage of a relatively helpless person” as she was able to bully the victim into submission. In particular, the accused:

> (a)     Was able to pressure the victim to return to the flat.

> (b)     Was able to make the victim surrender her NRIC, passport, ATM card, and handphone.

> (c)     Was aware that the victim did not resist when the accused assaulted her and did not seek help from the authorities after each instance of abuse.

### Abuse of trust and authority

29     The accused and the other family members staying in the flat abused and exploited their position of trust and authority over the victim. Instead of protecting her when the victim came to them for shelter, the accused and her family resorted to threats and physical restraint to prevent the victim from escaping.[^7]

30     The victim had been acquainted with the accused’s family when she was in secondary school and had been staying in the flat to escape her family problems. When she ran away from home for good in 2016, she went to the accused’s family as she trusted them. As the accused made the victim surrender her handphone, NRIC, ATM card and passport, this reduced the victim’s opportunities to make contact with the outside world and made her dependent on the accused’s family for food, shelter, medical treatment, and other basic necessities.

31     Where it came to the provision of these basic necessities, it is clear from the statement of facts that the accused was aware that the victim’s living conditions in the flat were deplorable. She was aware that the victim was being chained up at night[^8] and was also aware that after each time she injured the victim, appropriate medical treatment was never provided. In _ADF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span>, the “appalling conditions of employment” was one of the cumulative aggravating features taken into account to the Court of Appeal at \[147\].

32     The accused and Hasniza discussed treating the victim as a slave and after the accused made the victim stop work at McDonald’s, the victim was treated as an unpaid labourer and made to do chores in the Woodlands flat and was even brought to the accused’s new flat to work in extremely difficult conditions. For example, while working at the accused’s new flat, she was not allowed to sleep at night but was made to stand in the kitchen[^9] Over and above that, the prosecution pointed out that she was also brought by the family to Malaysia to clean the family’s flat in Johor Bahru[^10]. However, I note that the facts do not state the accused’s specific role in these trips to Malaysia.

### Psychological Harm

33     When I assessed the level of harm inflicted by the accused in respect of the proceeded charges, I took into account both the physical harm and the psychological harm suffered by the victim at the time the offences took place. For avoidance of doubt, I did not take into account any further harm that may have taken place after the accused left the flat on 13 November 2017.

34     The participation of the accused in the abuse against the victim over an extended period of time led to the victim suffering severe psychological harm. In _ADF_, the Court of Appeal found that the application of mental abuse in conjunction with physical abuse would constitute a serious aggravating factor. While psychological harm may be more difficult to quantify than physical injuries, the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span> has provided guidance on certain forms of behaviour that may be indicative of psychological harm.

35     The prosecution also submitted a report from a clinical psychologist from the Community Psychology Hub dated 8 February 2019. The psychologist assessed at \[20\] that the victim’s history of traumatic experiences and emotional numbing would place her at high risk of being exploited and re-victimised in the future.

### Sustained Pattern of Abuse

36     The fact that a particular offence occurred as part of a sustained pattern of abuse can be taken into account by the Court. In _PP v Bong Sim Swan, Suzanna_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 1001</span>, the Court of Appeal answered in the affirmative the question whether the Court can take into account psychological harm that arises from a sustained pattern of abuse even though separate charges were not preferred for other incidents of abuse. By doing so, the Court is not punishing the accused for a separate uncharged offence but is using this information to form a more accurate assessment of the suffering of the victim and of the offender’s culpability. Furthermore, an offender who commits abuse against a victim with an awareness of the victim’s predicament is considered more culpable as her actions are analogous to rubbing salt into a festering wound: See _Chua Siew Peng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1247</span> at \[66\]

37     I agreed with the prosecution that the fact that there was a sustained pattern of abuse was relevant. The facts supporting this assertion can be found in the Statement of Facts where the accused admitted to other acts of abuse that were not part of the proceeded charges. Some of these acts form the subject matter of charges taken into consideration.

38     Therefore, when I determined the sentences for the individual charges, I took into account the pattern of abuse against the victim during the period the accused stayed in the flat when considering the level of psychological harm and the accused’s culpability.

39     There may be a risk of double-counting if this factor is considered when determining the individual sentences and subsequently when determining how many sentences should be ordered to run consecutively. This is something I bore in mind when calibrating the sentence.

### Deliberate Concealment of the crimes

40     I agreed with the prosecution that the accused and her family acted to conceal their crimes to the detriment of the victim’s health and wellbeing. Each time the accused assaulted the victim, she was fully aware that the victim required medical treatment but she declined to bring her to the hospital. The accused would have been fully aware that if she did so, the doctor would have asked about the cause of the injuries which would result in her crimes being revealed.

41     Instead, they resorted to inadequate treatment measures in order to avoid bringing her to the hospital:

> (a)     Hasniza’s application of antiseptic, creams or powders were clearly insufficient given the nature of the injuries caused and may well have prolonged the victim’s pain and suffering.

> (b)     When the victim’s left toe became infected and started bleeding after the accused used pliers to twist and fracture it, the reaction of the accused and Hasniza was to simply wrap it in a sanitary pad so that the blood would not mess up the floor of their flat. The accused then proceeded to purchased medication that did nothing for the fracture.

42     After the victim was rushed to the hospital in a near death state, the accused acted in concert with others to obstruct police investigations. They coordinated their statements to suggest that the victim only turned up at the flat 2 weeks ago with her injuries. The accused persisted with her lies to the police until Muhammad Iski came clean to the police about a week after the incident was reported. The repeated lies show a lack of remorse and a firm intent to conceal the offences.

## Applicable Sentencing Principles

43     As this case involved acts of considerable cruelty against a vulnerable and defenceless victim, I agreed with the prosecution that deterrence and retribution were the most relevant sentencing principles.

44     There is significant public interest in ensuring that vulnerable persons such as persons with intellectual disabilities are protected from abuse and exploitation.

45     The principle of deterrence seeks to accomplish this in two ways. Specific deterrence seeks to deter the offender from re-offending and is considered appropriate when the offender is a persistent offender or where the crime is premeditated. On the other hand, general deterrence aims at educating and deterring other like-minded members of the general public: _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[18\]. As such, the sentence should send a strong signal to persons who may otherwise be tempted to exploit the low intellect and naivete of persons with intellectual disabilities.

46     In relation to the principle of retribution, it refers to the idea that the offender should receive a sentence that she deserves, which is a sentence that reflects proportionally, the harm done and her culpability. If appropriate punishment is not imposed, or if it is generally perceived as being proportionally inadequate, the victim, as well as the wider community, will be left with the sour taste of injustice and grievance: _ADF v PP_ \[2010\] 1 SLR 8744 at \[66\].

## Defence Submissions and Mitigating factors

47     The accused’s lawyer submitted a written mitigation plea which highlighted the following:

> (a)     The accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty early.

> (b)     Although she initially tried to help her family conceal the offences, she eventually came clean and admitted her guilt.

> (c)     The accused had no prior antecedents.

> (d)     The accused was angered by the victim who masturbated and fellated her husband.

> (e)     The victim also made offensive comments about her son and even hit him.

> (f)     The accused was diagnosed with depression with transient psychotic symptoms in 2019.

> (g)     In 2017, the accused’s miscarriage, her husband’s incarceration and her father’s death affected her mental state and led her to commit these offences.

48     In respect of the sentence to be imposed, the defence submitted that an aggregate sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

49     In relation to mitigating factors:

> (a)     I gave due weight to the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty and had no previous convictions. However, I also noted the prosecution’s submission that the accused had initially tried to conceal the offences and that the offences only came to light after Iski confessed.

> (b)     There was no evidence to suggest that the accused was suffering from depression at the time of the offences or that there was a causal link to the offences. The IMH report dated 7 March 2018 states that the accused did not present with a mental illness at present though she may have experienced an adjustment reaction after her arrest. The report also indicates that the accused claimed that she had bought “Prozac” from a roadside seller in early 2017 as she was stressed about her husband’s incarceration, but she was “okay” after 10 days and stopped taking the drug.

## Sentence for each charge

50     In determining the sentence, I agreed with the prosecution that the sentencing approach set out by the High Court in _Ng Soon Kim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1097</span> was applicable. In _Ng Soon Kim_, the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon outlined at \[12\] the following sentencing approach for an offence under s.324 of the Penal Code:

> (a)     First step: Consider what would be an appropriate sentence had the hurt alone been the subject of an offence under s.323. At this stage, the Court will refer to the sentencing framework for s.323 set out in _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>:

> (b)     Second step: Consider the application of a suitable uplift, having regard to the dangerous means used.

> (c)     Third step: Calibrate the sentence after consideration of the aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

51     In this part of the judgment, I explain how I applied the approach in _Ng Soon Kim_ to arrive at the sentences for the two offences under s.324 of the Penal Code. In addition, I explain why I agreed with the prosecution that this framework with suitable modifications, could be applied to the third offence under s.326 of the Penal Code.

### DAC 900785/2020: Section 324 Penal Code: Use of a hammer

52      _First Step (12 months):_ I agreed with the prosecution that the loss of the victim’s front left upper tooth and chipped front right upper tooth would fall within Band 3 of _Low Song Chye_ since these injuries were permanent in nature and would require significant dental procedures to rectify. As the accused had failed to provide the victim with the appropriate dental treatment to rectify the harm she had caused, this also increased the impact of the injury as the accused had to live with the broken teeth. This would have worsened her quality of life further as she would have needed to eat while bearing the pain of having these injuries. Therefore, I was of the view that an indicative sentence at step 1 would have been 12 months’ imprisonment.

53      _Second Step (uplift of 12 months):_ I agreed with the prosecution that the use of a hammer (measuring about 30cm in length) on the victim’s teeth would justify an uplift of about 12 months’ imprisonment as the weapon was one that the accused had selected as she knew that it would allow her to achieve her objective with as little effort as possible of knocking the victim’s teeth out.

54     I also noted that this uplift was consistent with the uplift applied in _Alvin Ngor Xuan Hong v PP_ MA 9059/2020 (“Alvin Ngor”).[^11] In _Alvin Ngor_, the offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s.326 read with s.34 of the Penal Code. The victim in that case suffered injuries including a dislocated tooth and a dento-alveolar fracture. The offender used a wrench while the accomplice used a knuckleduster. The District Judge held that the uplift for the use of a wrench and a knuckleduster should be in the range of 9-12 months’ imprisonment. The offender’s appeal was dismissed by the High Court.

55      _Third Step (uplift of 10 months)_ : I was of the view that the accused’s culpability in relation to this assault was high. The accused, upon receiving instructions from Hasmah to knock out the victim’s teeth with a hammer, executed the plan with a cold and calculated precision. She ordered the victim to sit in the bathroom, armed herself with a hammer, ordered the victim to open her mouth, and then forcefully hit the victim’s teeth twice.

56     After taking into account the above factors specific to the charge, the mitigating factors and the significant general aggravating factors highlighted in the earlier part of this judgment, I was of the view that an uplift of 10 months’ was warranted. I was of the view that such an uplift was required a stage 3 in order to reflect the increased need for deterrence and retribution for cases involving cruel and calculated abuse of a vulnerable victim coupled with the deliberate withholding of appropriate medical treatment.

57     In arriving at the indicative sentence for this charge, I also took into account the case of _PP v Zariah Binte Mohd Ali and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 173</span> (“Zariah”). The offender was convicted after a trial of several acts of abuse against a domestic helper. The offender eventually withdrew her appeal. Two of the charges involved hammering the victim on her lip and the sentences imposed are found in the table below.

58     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the offence in the present case was more serious than DAC 915346/2014 in Zariah’s case notwithstanding that the latter involved a charge under s.73(2) of the Penal Code. In respect of that charge, only bodily pain was caused whereas the present case involved permanent damage to the victim’s teeth.

59     Therefore, after adopting the three step approach, I arrived at an indicative sentence of 34 months’ imprisonment.

### DAC 900786/2020 – Section 324 Penal Code: splashing hot water

60      _First Step (9 months)_ _:_ The prosecution referred the case of _PP v Azlin bte Arujunah and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 168</span> in relation to the classification of a blister and partial thickness burn. The offenders faced a number of charges including the use of a heated spoon on a child’s palm. However, there was some uncertainty which burns were due to later scalding incidents and which would have been caused by the spoon. The Court stated at \[224\] that there would have been a blister and partial thickness burn but the extent of the injury was not known. As such, the Court placed the injury in the lower end of Band 2.

61     I agreed with the prosecution that the injuries suffered by the victim were far more serious than the injury caused by the heated spoon in _Azlin bte Arujunuah_.

62     As the facts reveal, the hot water from the electric kettle scalded her front lower body and both and thighs. It was very painful for the victim and blistering burns were caused. The injuries were extensive enough and later in the day, it resulted in her trousers sticking to her wounds[^12]. Therefore, I concluded that this fell within the lower end of band 3 and arrived at an indicative sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment.

63      _Second Step (uplift of 9 months):_ The prosecution again referred to _Azlin bte Arujunah_ but this time to the charges under s.326 of the Penal Code which involved the use of hot water above 70oC to scald the victim. The High Court in deciding that the appropriate uplift was 2 years imprisonment, noted at \[206\] that:

> (a)     Water above 70oC would cause mid to deep dermal burns.

> (b)     Water is difficult to control and would be more dangerous given that it could lead to greater surface areas being affected, which would in turn, result in more serious injuries and consequences.

> (c)     The victim in that case was a young child with thinner skin who would be disproportionately affected.

> (d)     There was indiscriminate throwing of water onto the child.

64     As the presents facts do not reveal the temperature of the water and the victim in the present case was not a young child with thinner skin, those factors would not apply here. As such, the prosecution submitted that the uplift should also be lower.

65     I agreed that the indiscriminate splashing of hot water from an electric kettle had potential to cause significant harm given that it is hard to control water and it had the potential to a large surface area and concluded that the uplift at this step should be 9 months’ imprisonment.

66      _Third Step (uplift of 10 months)_ : I was of the view that the accused’s culpability in relation to this assault was high. By this time, the accused had already used a hammer to knock hit the victim’s teeth. Instead of showing remorse, she decided to cause more harm to the victim, and she would be fully aware that the splashing of hot water would cause a lot of pain to the victim over and above the damage to her skin.

67     After taking into account the above factors that were specific to the charge, the general mitigating factors and the very significant general aggravating factors highlighted in the earlier part of this judgment, I was of the view that an uplift of 10 months’ was warranted.

68     In arriving an indicative sentence, I also took into account the case of _PP v Goh Gek Hwee_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 481</span> which was cited by the prosecution. In _Goh Gek Hwee_, the offender was convicted of 4 charges relating to a single incident. One of the charges was for splashing hot oil onto a victim under s.324 of the Penal Code. The victim in that case suffered multiple burn injuries. The Court noted that the psychiatric report stated that the offender was experiencing an acute stress reaction and the material time which affected her judgment and impulse control. After the incident, the offender attempted to commit suicide by cutting her wrist and stabbing herself. The offender was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment on the s.324 charge and the appeal was subsequently withdrawn.[^13]

69     The burn injuries caused in _Goh Gek Hwee_ were more serious than the burn injury caused in relation to this specific charge. On the other hand, there are numerous aggravating factors present in this case that were not present in _Goh Gek Hwee_.

70     Therefore, after applying the three step process, I arrived at an indicative sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment for this charge.

### DAC900791/20 – s.326 r/w s.34 Penal Code – using pliers

71     In _Azlin bte Arujunah_, the High Court expressed the view at \[196\] that the approach adopted in _Ng Soon Kim_ provided a helpful guide to sentencing under s.326 of the Penal Code by way of analogy:

> (a)      First step: consider the appropriate sentence under s.325 of the Penal Code.

> (b)      Second step: Apply a suitable uplift to account for the dangerous means used.

> (c)      Third step: Adjust the sentence on the basis of aggravating and mitigating factors.

72     I adopted this approach in determining the sentence for the offence under s.326 r/w s.34 which involve the use of pliers to twist the victim’s toes.

73      _First step (24 months’)_ : The injuries caused were serious. In contrast to a single blow, the twisting of the victim’s toe would have taken longer and the victim would have felt excruciating pain as her toes were twisted, with the left second toe twisted to the point that a fracture was caused. In addition, the prosecution has highlighted that the photographs show a permanent deformity.[^14]

74     The prosecution pointed out in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>, the Court of Appeal stated at \[56\] that where the victim suffered fractures to his left elbow, left calf and his right 8th to 11th ribs, the indicative starting point sentence would be around three-and-a-half years’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that as the present injury was not as serious as that suffered in _BDB_, a “significantly lower” starting point of 24 months’ was appropriate.

75     Therefore, I agreed with the prosecution that 24 months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate starting point for the first step.

76      _Second step (uplift of 12 months):_ In an earlier part of this judgment, I had referred to _Alvin Ngor’s_ case where an uplift of 9 to 12 months’ imprisonment was applied in a case involving the use of a wrench and knuckle duster to hit the victim on the head and face. The pliers used here were also blunt force instruments and had the potential to cause serious injury given the manner in which they were used. In the circumstances, I was of the view that an uplift of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

77      _Third step (uplift of 12 months):_ The accused’s culpability for this offence was also high. The accused initially tried to twist the victim’s toe with the pliers by herself but failed because the victim shifted her foot.[^15] Undeterred, the accused carried out her plan to harm the victim by getting Hasmah’s assistance. This resulted in the accused and Hasmah jointly attacking the victim with pliers.

78     In _PP v Ong Chee Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 213</span> at \[33\], the High Court observed that there are generally three reasons why group violence is regarded as aggravating:

> (a)     Greater harm may result

> (b)     The victim is likely to be in greater fear and to feel a greater sense of humiliation and helplessness

> (c)     The group pressure to continue may make such offences less likely to be abandoned, and group dynamics may lead to greater harm or damage being caused.

79     At the same time, I noted the defence submission that since there were only 2 persons involved, it would be “unfair” to call it a group assault. While giving due consideration to the fact that only 2 persons were involved, I agreed with the prosecution that the first two factors cited in _Ong Chee Heng_ were present in this case and increased the seriousness of the offence:

> (a)     The victim was able to shift her feet when the accused was trying to twist her toes by herself. But once Hasmah got involved, the victim was unable to escape as both the accused and Hasmah were armed with pliers and proceeded to clip and twist the victim’s toes.

> (b)     Being attacked by two persons armed with pliers would also have caused the victim to be in greater fear and to feel a greater sense of humiliation and helplessness.

80     Finally, the accused’s conduct after the assault was shocking. The accused twisted the victim’s with so much force that the victim screamed in pain. Apart from the fracture, the victim’s toe also started bleeding. Instead of calling for an ambulance, the accused’s only reaction was to purchase medication that had no effect on the facture. The facts also state that the accused and Hasniza bandaged the victim’s toe with a sanitary pad to prevent the blood from smearing onto the floor of the flat.

81     After taking into account the above factors specific to this charge, the general mitigating factors and the very significant general aggravating factors highlighted in the earlier part of this judgment, I was of the view that an uplift of 12 months’ was warranted. Therefore, the indicative sentence for this charge is 48 months’ imprisonment.

## Indicative Sentences

82     Therefore, after adopting the three step approach, I arrived at the following _indicative_ sentences:

> (a)     DAC 900785/2020 - 34 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC 900786/2020 - 28 months’ imprisonment

> (c)     DAC 900791/2020 - 48 months’ imprisonment

## Decision on consecutive sentences and the totality principles

83     In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon observed that as a general rule, an offender who commits unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence. This is normally achieved by ordering the individual sentences to run consecutively.

84     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the sentences for the three proceeded charges should run consecutively. This was necessary in order to reflect the accused’s culpability as she would have caused greater harm compared to an offender who committed fewer acts of abuse. The accused in the present case had abused the victim for an extended period of close to 18 months’ as shown by both the proceeded charges as well as the charges taken into consideration, most of which involve the abuse of the victim.

85     Consecutive sentences in this case would reflect the principle of deterrence. This is especially important in cases involving vulnerable victims as the law should be effective in deterring offenders who commit repeated acts of abuse. As the Chief Justice pointed out in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ at \[43\]:

>     \[T\]he imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would afford an offender who has already committed an offence less or no real incentive to refrain from committing a further offence, in so far as such a sentencing position would result in the offender not having to bear any real consequence for the further offending This creates a distorted incentive that detracts from the deterrent value of the individual sentences notionally imposed.

### Totality principle

86     In _Raveen Balakrishnan_, the Chief Justice stated at \[65\] that where the court is inclined to order sentences to run consecutively, it is necessary for the court to run a final check to ensure that the aggregate sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality presented and not excessive. This is done by applying the totality principle. At the same time, if an adjustment is done, the Court should ensure that the sentence continues to reflect the relevant sentencing principles, which in this case are deterrence and retribution.

87     In _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>, the Chief Justice explained at \[47\] that the totality principle has two limbs:

> (a)     Whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed.

> (b)     Whether the effect on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with her past record and her future prospects.

88     Applying the principle to the present case, I was of the view that the first limb was not breached as the offence under s.326 of the Penal Code was punishable with imprisonment which may extend to 15 years and also with caning[^16].

89     As for the applicability of the second limb, I noted the prosecution’s submission that in calibrating their sentencing position, the prosecution had also taken into account the totality principle by seeking a slightly lower sentence for DAC 900786/2020.[^17] While I gave due weight to this, I was nevertheless of the view that should be a small downward adjustment in keeping with her past record and future prospects. In coming to this finding, I noted that the accused did not have a prior criminal record and was a mother in her early thirties with two young children. Therefore, despite the very serious crimes she had committed, I was of the view that there were still prospects for her subsequent rehabilitation and reintegration.

90     In the circumstances, while I arrived at an indicative sentence of 9 years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment, I would have adjusted the sentence slightly downwards to arrive at an aggregate sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment in light of the second limb of the totality principle.

## Sentence Imposed

91     However, the Court has to take into account the time spent by the accused in remand[^18]. While the accused is currently on bail, she had earlier spent about 4 months’ in remand. Therefore, I further adjusted the sentences for DAC 900785/2020 and DAC 900786/2020 to arrive at an aggregate sentence of eight-and-a-half years’ imprisonment.

92     The final sentences imposed are therefore:

> (a)     DAC 900785/2020 – 30 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC 900786/2020 – 24 months’ imprisonment

> (c)     DAC 900791/2020 – 48 months’ imprisonment

93     All three sentences were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 102 months’ or eight-and-a-half years’ imprisonment. At the time of preparing this judgment, the accused is on bail pending appeal.
