Criminal Law – Outraging of modesty

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9252/2021/01.\]

31 January 2022

### Principal District Judge Toh Han Li :

1       The accused claimed trial to the following charge:

> **_MAC-910297-2019_** **_(“3rd Charge”)_**

> You…are charged that you, on 28 March 2019, on or about 12.00am, at \[address\], Singapore, being a member of the household of the employer of \[V\], Female, 27-years-old, a domestic helper, did use criminal force on \[V\], to wit, by touching \[V’s\] left breast over her shirt with your fingers, knowing it likely that you would there by outrage \[V’s\] modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“PC”), read with Section 73(2) of the PC.

2       He was tried at the same trial for two other charges of outraging modesty (MAC 910295 and 910296 of 2019) against the same victim on 8 March 2019 (the 1st and 2nd charges).

3       At the end of the trial, I acquitted the accused of the 1st and 2nd charges and convicted him on the 3rd charge. The prosecution did not file an appeal against the acquittal on the 1st and 2nd charges. The accused has appealed against his conviction and sentence on the 3rd charge.

4       The accused is on bail pending the appeal.

5       For the purposes of the Grounds of Decision, I focused on the accused’s appeal against his conviction and sentence on the 3rd charge but made references to the evidence and my findings on the 1st and 2nd charge where relevant.

## The prosecution’s case

6       The victim was a foreign domestic worker at the material time. She arrived in Singapore on 14 April 2017 and was employed by the accused’s wife (“DW2”) from 27 April 2017 to 29 March 2019. Her gross salary was $638 per month of which $22 was deducted for a day off.

7       On 3 March 2019, DW2 applied to extend the victim’s work permit and the victim’s work permit was extended from 3 April 2019 to 3 May 2019. The other members of the household were D, E (“DW4”) and M who were sons of the accused and DW2. Their ages at the material time were 16, 12 and 9 years old respectively. Since May/June 2018, the victim would share a room with M, as set out in photographs P2 to P6. This was referred to as the “Yellow Room” in the sketch plan of the unit in D1. The victim and M would sleep on mattresses separated by a laundry basket in the Yellow Room. The “Blue Room” as referred to in D1 was occupied by D.

8       The alleged incidents took place towards the tail end of the victim’s employment, namely on 8 March 2019 for the 1st and 2nd charges and 28 March 2019 for the 3rd charge. The victim was scheduled to fly from Singapore to Manila on 3 May 2019 on board a Scoot Airlines flight paid for by DW2. An airline ticket (P7) departing from Manila to Tacloban on board Cebu Pacific Airlines on 4 May 2019 was booked by the victim on 12 March 2019. The tickets were eventually not utilised in view of the police investigations that came about after the victim made the police report on 29 March 2019.

9       The victim had a good relationship with all members of the accused’s family although there was some suggestion by the defence of a possible motive on the victim’s part to falsely implicate the accused arising out of specific events. I will discuss this in due course.

### The prosecution’s evidence on the 3rd charge

10     On 27 March 2019 at around 11.30pm the victim was asleep with M in the Yellow Room with the lights off. She was lying face up on the mattress and wearing a T-shirt. Her mattress was closer to the wardrobe as depicted in P5 and her head was further away from the door and was closer to the right side of the picture in P5 with her feet closer to the door. M’s mattress was placed beside the victim’s mattress and was away from the wardrobe and closer to the window that is depicted in P2. There was a space of roughly more than one arm’s length between the victim and M’s mattress. The room door was open. The victim testified that since she had started working for the accused and DW2, they did not allow her to close the room door. She did not cover herself with a blanket.

11     The victim testified that she was in a deep sleep when she felt someone touching her left breast for a few seconds in a circular motion over her T shirt. That person was seated on the floor between her mattress and M’s mattress. She pushed the person’s hand away and saw someone leaving the room. At that moment, she saw the time on her phone and it was midnight. The wall clock in the room stated 12.05am which meant that the date would be 28 March 2019. She did not go back to sleep as she was scared. She wanted to send a message to DW2 but did not do so as she did not want to disturb DW2 who she thought was sleeping. The victim said that she was scared that the incident might happen again.

12     The victim’s testified that she did not see the face of the person who touched her but recognised the physique as that of the accused. She surmised by the process of elimination that it was the accused as D was fat, DW4 was skinny and M was asleep next to her and it was not the accused’s wife DW2. The relevant portion of the victim’s evidence under cross-examination was as follows[^1]:

> Q    And from the size of the body of that person, you testify that it was Sir who had touched you on your breast?

> A    Yes.

13     Under cross-examination, the victim testified that she did not see the accused picking up M’s pillow under M’s head, adjusting his bolster or placing it between his legs and turning M to the side and tapping him. At about 2.00am she was awake and heard someone open the flat gate and saw D come in.

14     On the morning of 28 March 2019, she performed her household chores. She was teaching M spelling in the Blue Room who was also watching television. DW4 kept disturbing M and taking away the television remote control. DW4 pushed the victim and she pushed DW4 back. She then went to check on her cooking in the kitchen. DW4 was angry that he could not come into the room as he wanted his mass clothes (referring to clothing for the Catholic mass service). DW4 asked the victim why she did not prepare his mass clothes. The victim then told DW4 that his mass clothes was hanging at the window. DW4 changed into them and left.

15     On the evening of 28 March 2019 at 8.41pm, the victim texted DW2 asking her if she could close the \[room\] door. DW2 came into the victim’s room and asked her why she wanted to close the door. The victim said that someone came into her room and disturbed her. The victim told DW2 that she was not sure who came into the room to touch her although she said it was not D. She did not tell DW2 that it was the accused as she was scared that DW2 would get angry, confront the accused and the accused may get violent. The victim also recalled DW2 asking her if the accused had touched her on the Saturday mornings when they went marketing and the victim said no.

16     DW2 asked D if he had gone into the victim’s room and he said no. DW2 asked the accused if he had gone into the victim’s room and he said “yes” as he wanted to check on M. At that point, the mother of the accused asked the victim to calm down with words to the effect of asking the victim not to “make the incident big” to the extent that they needed to go to court.

17     The accused told the victim that she could close the door to the room that evening.

18     The accused spoke to DW2 and his mother in a language that the victim did not understand. The victim testified that she was scared as she did not know what they were planning for her and that they may send her home early.

19     On 29 March 2019 she spoke to her cousin (“PW3”) over the phone about the incident and told her that she was going to lodge a police report. PW3 testified that the victim had messaged her that she had a problem and told her that her boss had held her breast. When they spoke on the phone, PW3 testified that the victim was crying said that she was scared for the victim. The victim explained that she did not know the process in Singapore about making a police report and PW3 was scared that the victim might go to jail.

20     On the same morning, as DW4 had forgotten to bring a file to school, the victim took the file with her and passed it to DW4 in school. The victim sent text message (P8) at around 9.17am to DW2 which stated:

> Mam I thought I will be very happy going back..

> I respect you and sir,,,I treat you as a family ..as the way you treat me..

> I’m very sad..

21     Thereafter, at around 10.00 am, she went to Serangoon Neighbourhood Police Centre and lodged a police report (P1) where she stated:

> On 08/02/2019 and 28/03/2019, at the said location, I was touched by my male employer.

22     The victim testified that she had decided to lodge a police report as she was still staying with the accused and she was scared that “things might happen” if she did not lodge a police report. At the police station, she sent PW3 a text message stating that she was at the police station.

23     PW3 testified that that she subsequently met the victim in April 2019 and asked her if she was alright. The victim said that she was depressed and PW3 testified that she could see this from the victim’s face. PW3 noticed that the victim’s eyes were swollen from crying and she had lost a lot of weight.

24     PW4 was the Myanmar maid who worked for the accused’s neighbour. She testified that the victim had told her face to face on one occasion and on another occasion texted her to say that her employer had touched her. At the face to face meeting the victim had demonstrated to PW4 how she had been touched. PW4 demonstrated this in court by touching her shoulders and her breast. PW4 estimated that the time span between the two face to face meetings was a few days but she was not very sure of this.

25     The victim testified that during the December school holidays in 2018 she had accompanied the accused and his family on a trip to China. DW2 had arranged that the victim should pay for her own air ticket to China. DW2 asked the victim if was going to China and she said that she did not want to go as she did not have money to pay for her own air ticket. The victim testified that the accused told her that he would pay for her air ticket but that she should not tell DW2 as DW2 would get angry. She recalled that she gave DW2 $200 as additional payment for the ticket.

## Prima facie case

26     The defence did not make a submission of no case to answer. I called for the defence on all three charges as I was satisfied that a _prima facie_ case had been made out by the prosecution.

## The defence

27     The accused called a total of four witnesses for the defence. This comprised the accused, his wife (“DW2”), his mother (“DW3”) and his son E (“DW4”).

28     At the material time, the accused was working as an Operations Manager for ST Logistics Private Limited where he worked Mondays to Fridays from 8.20am to 6.00pm in the evening. He started at that job since February 2019.

29     In 2019, the accused confirmed that the Yellow Room was occupied by the victim and M, the Blue Room was occupied by D and the master bedroom was occupied by the accused, DW2 and DW4.

30     The accused explained that there was a laundry basket placed between the two mattresses in the Yellow Room as DW2 was not comfortable with M being too close to the victim when they slept because if one person fell sick the other person may contract the illness easily.

31     The accused testified that the house rule was that all the bedroom doors had to be left open at all times even when the occupants in the room were asleep. The reason originated from the time when the accused’s father-in-law was unwell and should he cry out for help, there could be an immediate response from the other family members. Another reason was that the open doors would allow for adequate airflow and ventilation in the house.

32     The accused confirmed that the lights would be switched off when the occupants in the room were asleep.

33     With regard to the alleged incidents on 8 March 2019, the defence was one of alibi as that evening the accused not at home, having to send his son to the tuition centre, attend church and then send his mother home.

34     27 March 2019 was a Wednesday and the accused did not go to work that day as he had to attend a two-day course from 27 to 28 March 2019 from 9.00am to 5.30pm. On that day, he reached home around 7.10pm to 7.15pm.

35     On reaching home, he went to take a shower in the master bedroom bathroom and had his dinner at the dining table. DW4 then asked him for his help for his Chinese literature assignment. The accused assisted DW4 with the assignment from 7.30pm to 10.30pm. The accused’s wife came home about 10.00pm.

36     After he finished helping DW4 with the assignment he went to the Blue Room to watch the Chinese news till about 11.00pm. D had stepped out of the Blue Room and was sitting on the sofa in the living room. The accused continued to watch television in the Blue Room till about 11.40pm. He told D who was still on the living room sofa that he was going to sleep. The accused then headed to the common toilet to use it. After he had finished using the toilet, he noticed that M’s pillow in the Yellow Room had fallen off onto the ground. He then walked into the Yellow Room, bent forward and picked up the pillow. He positioned the pillow behind M’s head which was on the mattress. At that point in time, he noted that the victim was lying on her own mattress. He did not pay attention to what position she was lying in. He then walked over to where the window was as that was where M’s bolster had fallen. He bent forward and picked up the bolster and tucked in between M’s thighs. When he did that, M stirred and he then sat down on the mattress and patted him back to sleep. The patting of M took about 20 to 30 seconds. The accused said that this was not the only occasion when he had done this for M and he had done it for his other children as well. He then returned to the master bedroom and noted that DW2 was still awake, using the phone. By this time DW4 was asleep on the master bed with DW2. He then walked to the single mattress on the floor of the master bedroom and went to sleep.

37     The accused denied that he had touched the victim that evening whilst he was in the Yellow Room.

38     On the evening of 28 March 2019, the accused got a call from DW2 who said that he had touched the victim the night before. His immediate response was “what nonsense was the victim talking about and since when did such a thing happened”. The accused could sense that his wife was upset and disturbed and he accordingly went home to sort the matter out.

39     When he reached home, DW2 and his mother were present. The first question the accused put to the victim was why she was telling his wife that he had touched her when he had come into the room only to adjust M’s pillow and bolster. The victim responded that she did not know and the accused told the victim “not to anyhow say” and get him into trouble. He told his mother in Cantonese that the victim was talking nonsense and to ignore her. He then sent his mother home.

40     On 29 March 2019, DW2 called the accused and said that the victim had gone to make a police report against him. The accused said that if she wanted to lodge a complaint there was nothing he could do to stop her and that she was behaving in an incoherent manner.

41     On the China trip, the accused told the victim although she had to pay for the ticket, it was a once in a lifetime experience and the rest of the costs and expenses would be absorbed by DW2. The accused said he would lend her $600 and she did not have to pay her back in one shot and the victim agreed to this and the accused passed her $600. He did not press her for repayment of the $600 subsequently.

42     DW2’s evidence on the China trip was that she had sought confirmation from the victim if she wanted to go to China with them and encouraged her to go as they treated her as family but she had to pay for her own air ticket. There was a series of text messages on this with DW2’s sister on the booking of the tickets which was admitted as D14. In the end, DW2 said she would pay for the victim’s ticket first and this would be deducted from her salary subsequently but she had forgotten to do so and the victim did not pay her back.

43     DW3’s evidence pertained to the 1st and 2nd charges to substantiate the accused’s alibi defence. DW4’s evidence pertained primarily to the 1st and 2nd charge although a portion of his evidence related to the accused assisting DW4 with his Chinese literature assignment from 7.30pm to 10.30pm on 27 March 2019 as well as to events after the incident on 28 March 2019.

## The prosecution’s closing submission on the 3rd charge

44     The prosecution made the following closing submissions:

> a.     The victim’s testimony was textured and internally consistent.

> b.     The victim’s testimony on her behaviour after the incident was externally consistent with the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses and defence witnesses.

> c.     The victim had no motive to lie and falsely implicate the accused.

> d.     The victim’s behaviour during and after the incident was explicable and did not raise a reasonable doubt.

45     The prosecution submitted that the victim was candid and forthright in her testimony and did not embellish her evidence. For instance, the victim, candidly admitted that she did not see the face of the person who touched her and explain her logical thought process in how she concluded it was the accused who had done so.

46     The prosecution submitted that the victim’s evidence that she sent a text message to DW2 asking if she could lock the room door as someone had disturbed her was corroborated by DW2.

47     The prosecution also submitted that several witnesses had seen the victim’s troubled demeanour leading to her lodging of the police report which bolstered her credibility. PW4 met the victim when she was on her way to the police station. The victim told her that she was not going to work for the employer anymore. PW4 saw the victim crying then.

48     DW4 met the victim just before she went to the police station and noticed that she had been crying as her cheeks were puffy and her eyes were red and there were tears around her eyes.

49     PW3 spoke to the victim over the phone on the day of the police report. The victim told her that her boss held her breast and the victim was crying over the phone. PW3 met the victim sometime in April 2019 and stated that the victim looked depressed because she could see that she was crying, as her eyes were all swollen and she had lost a lot of weight.

50     PW1 was the duty police officer who attended to the victim at the police station. She recalled that the victim was quite “agitated and upset” then.

51     As for whether the victim had any motive to falsely implicate the accused, the prosecution submitted that the victim had a pleasant relationship with the accused and DW2 and this was admitted by the accused and DW2. The prosecution submitted that the alleged disputes as raised by the defence were “mere distractions” and not even supported by the evidence from the defence.

52     The prosecution submitted that the accused’s defence for the 3rd charge was a bare denial and there was no objective evidence to support or corroborate his defence. While DW 2 was in the master bedroom at that time of the offence, she admitted that she did not see the accused entering the Yellow Room.

53     As for the two photos (D5 and D 10) tendered by the defence of the Yellow room, the prosecution submitted that these photographs did not accurately depict DW2’s view of the Yellow Room. D5 was taken when the light in the Yellow Room was on but the offence was alleged to have taken place when the light was off. D10 depicted two photographs, with one taken at the door of the Yellow Room while the other taken in the Yellow Room. The prosecution submitted that D10 was not helpful to the defence as DW2 had admitted that neither photo in D10 was an accurate depiction of her view of the Yellow Room from the master bedroom.

## The defence’s closing submission on the 3rd charge

54     On the victim’s account of the incident, the defence submitted that it was untenable that the victim would react after realizing that someone had touched her breast in a circular motion by simply pushing the hand away and watch the perpetrator leave the room. If this had indeed happened, the defence submitted that all she needed to do was to go to DW2’s room and inform her what he had done to her or text DW2 to inform her of the incident.

55     The defence submitted that the victim’s evidence was “increasingly unbelievable” that the accused would enter her room to outrage her modesty with his family members still awake with all the room doors left wide open. The defence cited the case of _AKD v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 1029</span> (“_AKD”_) where the High Court remarked at \[18\] that it was “unlikely that the appellant would conduct himself in such a vulgar manner openly in his home” when the offender’s wife could have come in at any time from the living room and it was “difficult to contemplate any husband taking the same risk in the circumstances”.

56     The defence took issue with the victim’s evidence when DW2 had asked her who came into her room, and she replied by saying “I don’t know” and did not say that it was accused and repeatedly told DW2 she was not sure who came in and touched her. When asked why she had done that, the victim said “Yes, because I’m scared that---I’m _scared that Ma’am might get angry to me_.” and when further probed on this, she changed her reasoning and said “I’m _scared that Ma’am will talk to Sir and Sir will become violent_.”

57     The defence submitted that the victim’s evidence was contradicted by PW4’s evidence as it did not comport to the timeline or where and how the victim had told PW4 of the incidents.

58     The defence submitted that the accused had been forthright and consistent in his denial of the 3rd charge and that there was “absolutely no reason for \[the accused\] to even place himself in the yellow room during the time period after 11:40pm.” The defence submitted that if he wanted to contrive a version of events he could have distanced himself entirely from the scene and yet he admitted that he entered the Yellow Room for the sole purpose of putting M’s pillow and bolster in place.

59     The defence submitted that both D and DW2 were awake at that time and DW2 was texting D at 12:16am and that she had testified that she had walked out of the master bedroom about two times that night after texting D to see if he was indeed seated outside. The defence submitted that DW2 could see a portion of the Yellow Room from the master bedroom at that the corridor lights were not switched off and the Yellow Room was not totally dark even if the room lights was off.

60     The defence submitted that the victim’s evidence with regard to the China trip that the accused had simply given her $600 without expecting her to repay him simply did not accord with logic given that there was absolutely no reason for him to do that, especially when the family did not require the additional help during the China trip. The defence submitted that the victim’s ambiguous responses did not seek to clarify this aspect further and had cast doubt on her credibility and her motivations as a whole.

## The court’s decision on the 3rd charge

### Evaluation of the evidence

61     In cases of sexual assault, it was often a case of one person’s word against another. In such a scenario, a victim’s evidence should be “unusually convincing” or otherwise corroborated by independent witnesses or other evidence so that it could be relied upon to be the basis of a conviction- see _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”).

62     In _GCK_ the Court of Appeal explained further on what “unusually convincing” meant at \[88\], \[90\] to \[92\]:

> The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is **“so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”**: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that **“a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’**” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]).

> …Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard **entails that the witness’s testimony** **_alone_** **is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt**: see _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[73\].

> \[emphasis added\]

63     In assessing the credibility of a witness, in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Arthan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>, Yong Pung How CJ held at \[9\] that a judge can make a finding on based on some, or all, of the following factors:

> a.     The witness’s demeanour;

> b.     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence; and

> c.     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

64     That said, this was _not_ a case of a conviction being dependant solely on the victim’s evidence as there was other evidence corroborating her testimony including those of the defence and prosecution witnesses which I will discuss.

65     The prosecution’s submission on the victim’s evidence with regard to the 3rd charge was as follows:

> The Victim was candid and forthcoming throughout her testimony. She did not embellish her evidence. For example, when asked how she knew that it was the Accused who touched her in the incident of the 3rd Charge, the Victim candidly admitted that she “did not see the face”. The Victim was frank in explaining her logical thought process that it could not have been anyone else in the family given the body shape and size of the person leaving the room.

66     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the victim did not embellish her evidence. She could well have stated that she saw the accused’s face, rather than deduce that it was him by his physique and the process of elimination. For example, she did not embellish her evidence when DW2 asked her if the accused had touched her on the Saturday mornings when they went marketing and she said no.

67     As for the defence’s submission on why the victim did not react the moment someone touched her breast and immediately inform DW2 of the incident, as held by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> (“_Yue Roger_”), victims of sexual abuse may react in different ways and there is no fixed template or stereotypical way on how a victim should react. The victim testified that she wanted to send a message to DW2 but did not do so as she did not want to disturb DW2 who she thought was sleeping. In any event, the victim did push his hand away and by the time she opened her eyes from her deep sleep the accused was leaving the room. Further, the victim did react to the incident that evening which I now turn to.

68     On 28 March 2019 at 8.41pm, it was undisputed that the victim sent a text message (P8) to the accused’s wife DW2 asking if she could lock her \[room\] door later. When DW2 asked the victim about the text message, the victim said that it was because someone had gone into her room and disturbed her. When DW2 asked her if she knew who it was she said she did not know. DW 2 also testified that in the 22 months that the victim had been working for the accused’s family, the victim had never asked to lock the bedroom door. In my view, there was no reason for the victim to send a contemporaneous text message to DW2 with such an unusual request had there not been an incident as she had described.

69     The victim’s evidence was further corroborated by the defence witnesses as it was DW2’s evidence was that in the evening of 28 March 2019 she asked D if he had gone into the room and he said no. It was not DW4 as he was asleep at that time and it could not be M as M was asleep next to the victim. When the accused returned him home, DW2’s evidence about the incident was as follows[^2]:

\[emphasis added\]

70     When asked as to her hesitancy in naming the accused as the person who touched her to DW2, the victim explained that she was concerned that DW2 might confront the accused and the latter might become violent. To this end, DW2’s testified that the accused was angry when asked about the incident. Based on the accused’s angry reaction that evening, I accepted the victim’s explanation of why she dared not name the accused to DW2. In any event, she did identify the accused (by stating that she was touched by her male employer) when she made the police report P1 the day after the incident.

71     Unlike the 1st and 2nd charges where the defence was one of alibi, with regard to the 3rd charge the accused did not deny that he had gone into the Yellow Room where the victim was sleeping that evening but stated that he had gone in to adjust M’s pillow, and denied that there was any physical contact with the victim.

72     On 29 March 2019, the victim sent a message to DW2 at 9.17 am in P8 stating that she thought she would be very happy going back and that she respected DW2 and the accused and treated them as family as the way they treated her but stated that she was very sad. Shortly thereafter at 10.23 am, the victim made the police report P1 and stated her male employer had touched her. PW1’s evidence was that the victim was quite “agitated and upset” when making her police report.

73     DW4 also testified as to the victim’s demeanour on 29 March 2019 when he saw the victim[^3]:

> While I was collecting the M---sorry, while I was collecting the MPCC black file from the MRT side gate I noticed that she just finished crying and this is because her face was quite puffy like her cheeks and her eyes were quite red and I could tell that there were tears around her eyes. So, I took just the file and say, “Thank you.” And I went along for my recess.

74     PW4 testified that she had encountered the victim who told her that she was not going to work for the employer and was going to the police station. PW3 testified that the victim sent her a message on 29 March 2019 that she had a problem and they talked on the phone and the victim told her that her boss had held her breast and the victim was crying on the phone. PW3 also saw the victim in April 2019 and asked her how she was and the victim said that she was depressed and PW3 could see that the victim’s eyes were swollen and that she had lost a lot of weight.

75     The defence submitted that it was “increasingly unbelievable” that the accused would enter her room to outrage her modesty with his family members still awake with all the room doors left wide open and relied on the case of _AKD._ In _AKD_ the offender was accused of rubbing his left cheek against the complainant’s right cheek and placing his penis against the back of her body in the kitchen. The complainant’s evidence was that she thought the offender was drunk and did not realise what he was doing and as such did not feel outraged at that time. In other words, the offender’s actions were ambiguous as to whether he was outraging the modesty of the complainant in _AKD_ as opposed to the present case where the victim had felt the accused touching her breast which caused her to subsequently text DW2 for permission to shut the room door.

76     In my view, the victim’s behaviour after the incident, such as texting DW2 that evening requesting to close the room door and making the police report the following day as well as that of the defence and prosecution witnesses corroborating portions of her evidence was consistent with her version of events that she had been molested by the accused. This can be contrasted with the complainant in _AKD_ where she thought the offender was drunk and did not realise what he was doing and did not feel outraged at that time. I therefore find that the judge’s comments in _AKD_ were case specific and can be distinguished from the present case.

77     I was of the view that the photos D5 and D10 as submitted by the defence did not assist the defence as they did not simulate the actual conditions that night or DW2’s line of sight from the master bedroom to the Yellow Room. The accused had committed a fleeting touch on the victim’s breast when the lights were off in the Yellow Room while the victim was asleep with her head away from the room door. At best, DW2 could only see was the tip of the victim’s mattress where the victim’s legs were, whereas the victim’s head which was at the other end of the mattress away from the door and away from DW2’s line of sight. In any event, DW2 did not see the accused entering the Yellow Room.

78     Turning to the defence’s contention that there was ‘absolutely no reason” for the accused to place himself in the Yellow Room at the time of the offence in the 3rd charge, it was not in dispute that the victim had texted DW2 that someone had come into the room to disturb her. In my view, by the process of elimination based on where the accused’s family members were at that time, it would have been hard for the accused to deny that he had gone into the room and he had conceded this in front of the DW2 and the victim on the evening of 28 March 2019.

79     As for the alleged inconsistencies between the victim’s evidence and PW4’s evidence such as whether the victim had sent a text message to PW4, the sending of the text message from the victim to PW4 pertained to the 1st and 2nd charges and not the 3rd charge. Further, while there were discrepancies as to the interval between the narration of the incidents by the victim to PW4, I was prepared to make allowances for such discrepancies as to the time frame due to the passage of time and allowances ought to be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection (_PP v Singh Kalpanath_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 158</span> at \[60\]). Further, a victim of a sexual assault cannot always be expected to provide a completely similar and full account every time she discloses the offence to another person, see _PP v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 490</span> at \[79\].

80     In fact, the existence of discrepancies would in fact suggests that the witnesses had not concocted their accounts of what had happened, see _PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)_ <span class="citation">\[1977\] 1 MLJ 15</span>. In my view, this did not affect the substance of what the victim had told PW4, namely that the victim’s employer had touched her on the breast.

81     PW4’s evidence on how the victim had demonstrated was as follows[^4]:

> Q    That’s what she---she demonstrated to you?

> A    Correct, Sir. She explained by demonstrating, yah.

> Q    And the demonstration once again is what you have shown us, because that is what she showed you, is it? Can you show us again with your hands? You are touching both your shoulders and? And---and the---and her---

> A    Breast.

> Q    and her breast. Okay.

82     To this end, while PW4’s evidence under cross-examination was that she was unsure if the victim had sent her a text message telling her that the accused had come into her room and lay down next to her on the bed, she could recall the demonstration by the victim as follows[^5]:

> Q    Can’t remember, is it? Listen to this very carefully, please. Do you remember your neighbour’s maid ever either telling you or texting you that her employer had gone into her room and lay down next to her on her bed? Yes or no, you know?

> A    I remember she demonstrated touching her body.

83     Next, I turn to the issue of whether there was any motive for the victim to make false allegations against the accused.

### Motive

84     The victim had been working as a domestic helper for the accused’s family since 27 April 2017. By all accounts she had a good relationship with the accused’s family and during the cross examination of the victim, the victim affirmed this and was emotional in saying so when describing her relationship with DW2[^6]:

85     This was further supported by the victim’s text message sent on 29 March 2019 to DW2 (P8) which said that she respected the accused and DW2 treated them as a family as the way they treated her. DW2 had also encouraged her to come with them to China as she had treated the victim as family.

86     While the defence witnesses did not attribute any specific motive to the victim for making the allegations against the accused, the defence submitted that a motive on the part of the victim to make a false complaint “simply could not be ruled out” and suggested three possible incidents in its submissions which may have amounted to a motive for the victim to make the police report P1.

87     The first was the iron incident. Sometime in January 2019, the accused scolded the victim because she dropped an iron on the parquet floor in the bedroom. This caused a chip in the parquet floor and the accused was very angry. The victim admitted that the accused was angry with her and scolded her due to the incident. However, the accused conceded during cross-examination that he did not take any action against the victim apart from scolding her on the day of the incident. He also agreed that there was no prolonged lasting tension from this incident.

88     The second was the dispute with DW4 on 28 March 2019. This occurred when M was watching television while doing his homework and DW4 then proceeded to take the television remote control away from M. The victim then got agitated with DW4 and pulled him and threw him off the bed. As this incident had nothing to do with the accused, I do not see how it could possibly have prompted the victim into making a false police report against the accused for outraging her modesty. It is pertinent to note that on the following day, the victim retrieved DW4’s file for him which he had left at home and passed it to him in school which suggested that the incident with DW4 the day before did not have any lingering effect.

89     The third related to the China trip. There was apparently an amount of $600 outstanding from the loan for the accused for the China trip. DW2 also testified that the amount of $900 was to be deducted from her salary but this was never eventually deducted as she had forgotten about it and the victim did not pay her back. The victim’s evidence was that she did not owe the accused anything as they did not discuss about the payment. Given that the $900 was never deducted from the victim’s salary and that she was not pressed for payment of $600 by the accused, I see no reason why this would amount to a motive for her to make allegations of molest against the accused. In any event, both the accused and DW2 conceded that the loan was never a source of tension between the victim and them.

90     At the end of the day, the defence could not have its cake and eat it. The defence witnesses had testified that there was no ongoing source of tension between the accused, his family and the victim and the defence cannot at the same time suggest that there could be some motive on the victim’s par to falsely implicate the accused. I would add that the victim’s text to DW2 in P8 just before she made the police report that she was sad to go back and that she treated them as family as they have treated her was not suggestive of someone who was out to falsely implicate the accused. I accordingly found that there was no motive for the victim to make false allegations against the accused.

### The acquittal on the 1st and 2nd charges and its impact on the victim’s credibility

91     The victim had testified that the incidents in the 1st and 2nd charges took place on 8 March 2019 and she explained that she was certain of this date as she had anchored the event as having happened after Chinese New Year which fell on 5 and 6 February 2019 when they did not go to the market that period as they were busy visiting relatives. The defence’s position was that the accused was out for most part of the evening of 8 March 2019 and could not have committed the offences in the 1st and 2nd charges.

92     In the course of the trial, there arose a discrepancy on the evidence as to the date in which the incidents in the 1st and 2nd charge had taken place. In the victim’s police report (“P1”), the dates “28/02/2019” and “28/03/2019” were stated as the dates on which the victim was touched by her “male employer”. 28/02/2019 was then crossed out and amended to “08/02/2019” with the victim countersigning on the amendment. The date of 28/03/2019 (on which the 3rd charge is based) remained unchanged. The defence produced exhibit D9 which was a series of text messages between the accused and the pork seller in the market which showed that the accused had made orders for pork on the various Fridays leading up to 8 March 2019.

93     P11 were tendered by the prosecution to reflect the accused’s car movements from the various car parks at his place and his mother’s place and P 15 was the log report of whether there were any incident relating to the car park gantries. The prosecution sought to rely on P11 to rebut the defence’s claim that the accused had left the house on 8 March 2019 at 7.00pm, dropped M at the tuition centre, gone to church with the accused’s mother and DW4 and picked up M later that evening and returned home at 9.30pm. While P11 did not register any movement of the accused’s car from 7.00pm to 9.00pm on 8 March 2019, it showed that the accused left his residence car park at 9.02pm and returned at 9.23pm.

94     D6 was a text conversation between the accused and his wife DW2 sent by the accused at 9.08pm on 8 March 2019 informing her that he was waiting for M at the tuition centre and the accused has asked if she wanted him to pick her up. At that time DW2 was out with her friends at Suntec City.

95     I found that both D6 and P11 did not gel with the prosecution’s narrative of events where the victim had testified that that the offences were committed close to 9.00pm when she had finished cleaning up after dinner and had gone to her room to rest.

96     Further, in her police report P1 and her further statement to the police D2, the victim had stated that the offence was not committed on 8 March 2019 but on 8 February 2019.

97     In court, the victim gave two other reasons as to why the incidents in the 1st and 2nd charges took place on 8 March 2019. The victim testified that PW4 had texted her on the night of 8 March 19 after the incident asking how she was and the victim replied that she was sad and scared as her male employer had come into her room and lay beside her. When questioned on this text message, PW4’s evidence was that there could have been a text message but she could not recall when it was sent and she no longer had the text message.

98     The other reason was that the victim saw her cousin (PW3) two days after the incident on 10 March 2019 and informed her that she hated her employer but did not go into specifics. PW3’s evidence was that the victim saw her on 10 March 2019 and told her that she was stressed with her employer but did not elaborate further.

99     In the circumstances, I found that there were discrepancies in the prosecution’s case as to whether the incidents in the 1st and 2nd charges had occurred on 8 March 2019 in the light of D6, D9 and P11, as well as P1 and D2.

100    At the close of the prosecution’s case, there was an unopposed amendment to the 1st and 2nd charges by the prosecution to broaden the timeframe with the words “in the evening of” but _the date remained at 8 March 2019_ for the 1st and 2nd charges. The prosecution’s unwavering position was that the offences took place on 8 March 2019 for the 1st and 2nd charges.

101    The prosecution’s case centred on the specificity of the date 8 March 2019 as framed in the 1st and 2nd charges, and even after the amendment to the 1st and 2nd charge to widen the time frame, the date remained as 8 March 2019. As such, there was no latitude within the 1st and 2nd charges as framed to allow for an erroneous recollection of the date by the victim to fall within a wider date range. In the circumstances, I found that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a key element of the 1st and 2nd charges, namely that the incidents had taken place on 8 March 2019, and for this reason the accused was acquitted on the 1st and 2nd charges.

102    As Yong Pung How CJ observed in _Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP_ \[1997\] 2 SLR (R) 253 at \[40\], there was no rule of law that that witness’s testimony had to be believed in its entirety or not at all. In my view, assessing the victim’s credibility was not a binary exercise and any shortcomings in the victim’s evidence with regard to the offences having been committed on 8 March 2019 in the 1st and 2nd charge did not undermine the victim’s evidence and credibility with regard to the 3rd charge which related to an entirely separate incident on a different date. As I had stated earlier, the victim’s behaviour after the incident such as texting DW2 and requesting to close the room door and making the police report the following day as well as that of the defence and prosecution witnesses corroborating portions of her evidence was consistent with her version of events with regard to the 3rd charge. As such, I did not agree with the defence’s submission that this was a case where there was a “systematic and widespread pattern of many inconsistencies coming together on material aspects of the case.”[^7]

103    Further, I also did not agree with the defence’s submission that the victim’s evidence account as to how the two alleged incidents as alleged in the 1st and 2nd charge as well as her reaction during and after was necessarily inconsistent and as I have earlier stated there is no fixed template or stereotypical way on how a victim should react when she was being touched inappropriately- see _Yue Roger_ at \[30\]. In the circumstances, if there is any critique to be directed at the victim’s credibility, it would at the highest, be that there was a reasonable doubt that the offences in the 1st and 2nd charges were committed on 8 March 2019 (as opposed to having been committed on another date).

### Conclusion on the 3rd charge

104    As I had stated above, while allowances may be made for the victim to have recalled the dates wrongly, this was not an option given the specificity of the date in the 1st and 2nd charges. As the evidence had raised doubts as to whether the incidents did take place on 8 March 2019, I found that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the 1st and 2nd charges occurred on 8 March 2019. As such, the acquittal on the 1st and 2nd charges arose as a reasonable doubt had arisen as to whether the offences could have taken place on 8 March 2019.

105    With regard to the 3rd charge, I was of the view that the following pieces of evidence which included evidence from the defence and the prosecution witnesses lent credibility to her account of events:

> a.     The victim’s text to DW2 on the same day telling her that someone had disturbed her and asking DW2 if she could lock the door, this being the first time in 22 months that such a request had been made to DW2 since she stated working for the family,

> b.     The victim recognising the person who touched her as the accused by his physique and DW2 confirming that it was not DW2, DW4, D or M,

> c.     the accused not denying that he had entered the room where the victim was sleeping (albeit denying that there was any contact),

> d.     DW2’s evidence that the victim had showed her the gesture that she was touched on her breast,

> e.     the victim’s text message to DW2 the following day that she was very sad to be going home and that she treated them as family as they had similarly treated her,

> f.     PW4’s evidence that the victim had demonstrated to her that her employer had touched her on the breast and that she had encountered the victim who told her she was not going to work for the employer and was going to the police station,

> g.     DW4’s evidence that when he saw her on 29 March 2019 she was crying,

> h.     the victim’s making of the police report P1 that her employer had touched her on 29 March 2019, the day after the incident,

> i.     PW1’s evidence that the victim was quite “agitated and upset” when making her police report,

> j.     PW3’s evidence that the victim spoken to her on 29 March 2019 and informed her that the accused had held her breast and that she was crying,

> k.     PW3 seeing the victim in April 2019 and observing that the victim was depressed, with her eyes swollen and that she had lost a lot of weight, and

> l.     the absence of any motive for the victim to make a false report against the accused.

106    The accused did not deny that he was in the Yellow Room at the material time. As I have stated, the victim’s evidence was corroborated by the evidence from the defence and prosecution witnesses as highlighted above. I had also rejected the suggestion that the victim possibly had a motive to implicate the accused. I accordingly rejected the accused’s defence that he did not touch the victim.

107    In the circumstances, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, I was satisfied that the victim’s account of the events as stated in 3rd charge was unusually convincing and at the same time corroborated by the evidence from the defence and prosecution witnesses. I accordingly found that the prosecution had proven this charge beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused was convicted on the 3rd charge.

## Antecedents

108    The accused is untraced.

## Sentence

### The prosecution’s submission on sentence

109    The prosecution sought a global sentence of 13 months’ imprisonment and an additional 2 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.

110    The prosecution submitted that the following offence-specific factors were relevant in the present case.

111    The offence involved an intrusion of the victim’s private parts, as the accused had touched the victim’s left breast. There was no skin-on-skin contact as the touch was over the victim’s T-shirt. The touch lasted for a few seconds.

112    The accused committed the offence at midnight, while the victim was fast asleep at home. This constituted a gross intrusion into the victim’s privacy because this was when and where the victim would least expect to have her modesty violated. In _PP v Purwanti Parji_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 224</span>, V K Rajah JC (as he then was) made the following observations at \[21\]:

> The privacy and sanctity of the home constitute a sacred right. Having said that, the relationship between an employer and a domestic worker is not a private matter in which public policy has no role to play or right to intrude. Domestic workers are not chattels to be abused and debased with impunity. **The sanctity of hearth and home should be respected and preserved in such a manner that both household members and domestic workers enjoy secure expectations and total peace of mind** that physical violence in any form is alien and wholly impermissible in the context of their relationship.

113    There was exploitation of a vulnerable victim as the victim was a foreign domestic worker working for the accused and his family. Parliament, by enacting Section 73 of the Penal Code, had made it clear that foreign domestic workers were particularly vulnerable and enhanced protection was necessary.

114    It was clear from the victim’s testimony during trial that this incident had caused significant emotional trauma to her. Immediately after the incident, the victim felt so scared that she did not sleep the whole night. She was afraid that it might happen again.

115    The day after, she asked DW2 for permission to lock her bedroom door that night and had never made such a request throughout her 22 months of working for the accused’s household. PW3 corroborated that the victim was traumatised as PW3 testified when she met the victim in April 2019, she stated that she “_can see that she keep on crying, because her eyes are all swollen. And if she is already skinny, you can see that she even lose a lot of weight._”

116    As for the offender-specific factors, the prosecution submitted that the fact that the accused was a first-time offender was a neutral factor. It was not positive evidence of good character that could in turn be considered a valid mitigating factor.

117    Taking all the factors into consideration, the prosecution submitted that the present case fell in the middle to higher end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework set out by _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 9</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”).

118    The prosecution relied on the sentencing precedent of _PP v Jacob Kumar Ross s/o B Isaac Ross_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 68</span> _(“Jacob Kumar Ross_”). The offender, untraced, was the employer of the victim, a 30 year old foreign domestic worker. The offender was charged with four counts of Section 354(1) read with Section 73(2) Penal Code. He pleaded guilty to two charges and consented for two charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The first charge stated that on 7 January 2016, at or about 8.30am, while the victim was tidying up the children’s bedroom, the offender entered the room and kissed the victim on her right cheek. The victim pushed the accused away and told him he could not kiss her. He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment.

119    The second charge stated that two days after at about 8.30 am, while the victim was tidying up the children’s bedroom, the accused entered the room and hugged the victim from the front. He used both his hands to squeeze the victim’s breasts. There was no skin-on-skin contact. He was sentenced to eleven months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

120    The prosecution submitted that the facts of the second charge in _Jacob Kumar Ross_ was similar to the present case as both cases involved the touching of the victim’s breasts with no skin-on-skin contact. However, the prosecution submitted that a two month uplift ought to be imposed as the accused had claimed trial in the present case and the facts of the present case was more egregious as the offence had been committed at midnight while the victim was asleep.

121    All things considered, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least 13 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

122    The prosecution also submitted for an additional 2 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning as the dominant sentencing consideration for cases involving foreign domestic workers as victims were deterrence and retribution, see _ADF v PP_ \[2010 1 SLR 874 (“_ADF”_) at \[55\]. The prosecution submitted that while _ADF_ was a case involving voluntarily causing hurt to a foreign domestic worker, the same considerations should apply in the present case where outraging of modesty was involved. The prosecution submitted that caning was imposed in _Jacob Kumar Ross_ which involved facts similar to the present case and but for the accused’s age, caning would have been imposed in the present case. As such, an enhancement of sentence was necessary to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning lost be reason of the exemption under s 325(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).

### Mitigation

123    The defence submitted for a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment.

124    The defence submitted while the victim’s breast was touched it was a fleeting touch for only for a few seconds over her clothes with no skin to skin contact. The defence submitted that the case fell within the lower end of Band 2. The defence also submitted that there was no physical harm or psychological harm cause to the victim. The defence submitted that while the victim did testify that she was distressed when she made the police report, this did not amount to psychological or physical trauma suffered.

125    The defence submitted that there were no aggravating factors in the present case.

126    As for the mitigating factors, the defence submitted that the accused was a family man who has never been on the wrong side of the law. He was a dedicated and extremely hardworking father to his three sons, who were all dependent on him emotionally and financially for their day to day needs.

127    It was the defence’s submission that in the present case, there was no need for an imprisonment term in lieu of caning as there were no grounds for enhancement of the imprisonment term given the lack of any substantial aggravating factors. This was also not the case where this offence took place with the accused knowing that there was prospective caning or the fact that he would avoid it when he turned 50 years of age. The defence submitted that the accused had turned 50 only in 2020. As the offence took place in 2019, the defence submitted that it could not have been in the accused’s contemplation at the time of the offence that he would avoid caning at the conclusion of his case.

### The court’s decision on sentence

128    Based on the consideration of offence-specific factors, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment ass set out in _Kunasekaran_:

129    At the second step, the court would consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that related to the offender generally but which were not offence-specific (_ie_, offender-specific factors).

130    Both sides agree that this was a Band 2 case within the _Kunasekaran_ framework:

> Band 2: includes cases where **two or more** of the offence-specific factors present themselves. **The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact**. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception. **The sentence to be imposed would be five to 15 months’ imprisonment.**

131    The relevant offence specific factors would be (a) the degree of sexual exploitation; (b) the circumstances of the offence; and (c) the harm caused to the victim.

132    In my view, the offence specific factors that were relevant were the touching of the victim breast (over the clothes for a few seconds) while she was asleep, the fact that the accused and the victim were in an employer/domestic worker relationship and that the incident had affected her emotionally as evidenced by the fact that the victim was affected enough to ask DW2 to lock the room door, the evidence of PW1, PW3 and DW4 that she was crying as being distraught and her making a police report shortly after the incident. In the circumstances, I was of the view that the case would fall within the middle part of the part of Band 2 with a starting point of 10 months’ imprisonment.

133    In terms of aggravating and mitigating factors, the fact that the accused had claimed trial is a neutral factor. Given that he was convicted on one charge, I treated this as a single incident. As for the various testimonials submitted on behalf the accused, none of them pertain directly to the commission of the offence and I did not give any mitigating weight to them. In the present case, I did not see the need to make any further adjustment and the sentence of imprisonment remained at 10 months’ imprisonment.

134    The prosecution sought to rely on _Jacob Kumar Ross_ but that was a pre-_Kunsekaran_ case which also involved escalation of conduct on the offender’s part as well as two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In this regard, I found the case of _PP v Cheng Kin Ham Stanley_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 66</span> (“_Cheng Kin Ham Stanley”)_ which was post- _Kunesekaran_ more similar to the present case where the offender had hugged the victim from behind and used his finger to press her left breast. He was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, with 1 one month’s imprisonment added as an aggravating factor due to escalation of conduct. If I were to deduct the one month’s imprisonment added for escalation of conduct in _Cheng Kin Ham Stanley_, I arrived at a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment.

135    Had the accused been under 50 years of age, I would have imposed caning of 3 strokes as there was abuse of the employer/domestic worker relationship and intrusion of her private parts. Following _ADF_ which concerned the assault of foreign domestic workers with the sentencing principles being deterrence and retribution, I was of the view that the dominant sentencing principles where employers sexually abused their foreign domestic workers should similarly be deterrence and retribution.

136    In _Amin bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 315</span> (“_Amin bin Abdullah”_) it was held at \[65\] where the need for deterrence has been identified as the dominant sentencing principle behind the imposition of caning, there were at least two factors that should be taken into account in determining whether an enhanced term of imprisonment will further the objective of deterrence. First, whether the additional term of imprisonment was needed to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning having regard to why the offender was exempted from caning. The court held that generally persons exempted by age (as opposed to medical grounds) would likely to have known that they would not be caned and for this class of offenders, an additional term of imprisonment was called for. Second, the court should consider whether the additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. One key factor would be the length of imprisonment the offence already carried and for offences with a long minimum term of imprisonment it was less likely that an enhancement would be an effective or meaningful deterrent.

137    While the accused’s age was shy of 50 at the time of the offence, given the accused was now exempted by age from caning and given that the length of imprisonment was not particularly long in this case, I was of the view that an additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. Further, I was of the view that retribution was additionally a relevant sentencing principle here which I now turn to.

138    The court in _Amin bin Abdullah_ held at \[70\] that where retribution was the dominant sentencing objective behind the imposition of caning, then the need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning lost by reason of the exemption would be a factor militating in favour of enhancing the offender’s sentence and this should similarly be considered with reference to the existing sentence. In this regard, as the existing sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment was not particularly long, I agreed with the prosecution that an enhancement of sentence is necessary to compensate for the retributive effect of caning lost by reason of the exemption under Section 325(1)(b) of the CPC.

139    As I would have imposed caning of 3 strokes had the accused not be exempted from caning, I ordered an additional 2 months’ imprisonment in lieu of 3 strokes as per the guideline in _Amin bin Abdullah_ of up to 3 months’ imprisonment for 1 to 6 strokes avoided pursuant to s 325(2) CPC.

140    The global sentence would be 10 months’ imprisonment and an additional 2 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.

141    The accused is on bail pending the appeal.
