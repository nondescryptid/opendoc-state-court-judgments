\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9291/2019/01.\]

25 November 2019

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

The accused, who was unrepresented, pleaded guilty to two charges and was given the lowest possible aggregate imprisonment term. He has filed this appeal against the sentence which he is presently serving.

## Charges

2       The accused pleaded guilty to two charges as follows:

> i.     ‘LT2’ charge for consumption of a specified drug (monoacetylmorphine) under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185); and

> ii.     House trespass under s 448 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224).

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused admitted to the following facts without qualification:

> The accused is R Anpazhakan, a 51-year old Male Singaporean, holding NRIC No. XXX.

> FIRST INFORMATION REPORT

> 2.    The complainant is one Uma Devi d/o Vasagam. She is the co-owner of Block 550A Segar Road, #XXX, Singapore (the ‘Unit’).

> 3.    On 24 May 2019 6.08 pm, the complainant called the Police '999' hotline informing that the door to her bedroom had been damaged, and that the CCTV camera of her house was missing. The incident location was given as the Unit.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO MAC-909282-2019

> 4.    Investigations reveal that the complainant and her husband, one Anbalagan s/o Ramuti are co-owners of the Unit. On 22 May 2019 at about 11:00 am, the complainant left the unit for work. On 24 May 2019 at about 6:05 pm, she returned to the Unit. Although the front door and windows the unit were still secured, the complainant discovered that there was a hole at her bedroom door. This hole, which was not present when she had left the unit, had been filled up with tissue paper. Upon further checks, she observed that the door to another bedroom also had a hole in it. This door was still locked.

> 5.    Investigations further reveal that on the 24 May 2019, a CCTV which had been affixed in the living room had been knocked down. However the SD card therein was still intact. Upon viewing the footage contained therein, it was discovered that the accused had entered the Unit sometime on 24 May 2019.

> 6.    The accused’s presence was also captured from the Police CCTV (POLCAM) footage at the void deck of the Unit. The accused was spotted climbing the parapet wall to enter Unit from the ground floor at or about 3:40 pm on 24 May 2019. He was also seen leaving the unit by scaling down from Unit (which is on the 2nd floor) about 1 hour later.

> 7.    Through investigation, the accused was traced and he was arrested at his home. The accused admitted climbing the parapet wall and entering into the unit through the kitchen area by climbing over the kitchen railing. The accused claimed that he had done so as he was looking for 2 pawnshops tickets that complainant’s husband had retained from him as security for a friendly loan. The accused informed that he had heard that complainant’s husband had been arrested by CNB on 22 May 2019, he had wanted to retrieve his 2 pawnshop tickets and redeem his pledge.

> 8.    Investigations however disclose that complainant had discovered, in addition to the aforesaid damage, a note that had been written by the accused and left behind by him, which read, “Sorry for the inconvenience. Bala I came and clear the ice. Keys gave back. Escape bang la”.

> 9.    By virtue of the foregoing the accused has therefore committed an offence of House Trespass, punishable under Section 448 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> FACTS RELATING TO DAC-923710-2019 : LT-2 CONSUMPTION OF A SPECIFIED DRUG – MONOACETYLMORPHINE

> 10.    Following his arrest, on 10 June 2019 at Blk 208 Petir Road #XXX HDB-Bukit Panjang Singapore 670208, the accused was brought to the Woodlands Police Division HQ for a urine test, where he provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “P-SL-19-00385-1 R ANPAZHAKAN SXXX” and “P-SL-19-00385-2 R ANPAZHAKAN SXXX” in his presence. The said urine samples were sent to the Health Science Authority (HSA) on 11 June 2019 for analysis.

> 11.    On 13 June 2019, HSA issued 02 certificates under section 16 of the MDA Cap 185, bearing Lab No: AT-1933-05304-001-01 & AT-1933-05304-002-01.

> 12.    Siti Aisyah Binte Jamil, an Analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked “P-SL-19-00385-1 R ANPAZHAKAN SXXX”, issued the certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1933-05304-001-01 stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Monoacetylmorphine.

> 13.    Kwok Yi Ling Miiko, an Analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked “P-SL-19-00385-2 R ANPAZHAKAN SXXX”, issued the certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1933-05304-002-01 stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Monoacetylmorphine.

> 14.    Monoacetylmorphine is a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (CAP.185)

> 15.    The accused had consumed the said specified drug without authorisation under the MDA (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder and had thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the said Act.

> 16.    The accused had before the commission of the said offence, been convicted on 21 August 2014, in the District Court, No. 10 (vide DAC26747/2013), for an offence of Consumption of a Specified Drug, to wit, Morphine, under S. 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Edition), punished under S. 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Edition), and sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment, for which conviction and punishment has not been set aside, and he is thereby liable to enhanced punishment under S. 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Edition).

## Antecedents

4       The accused has a number of antecedents including the predicate LT1 conviction in respect of the present LT2 charge. In light of the prosecution’s minimal sentencing position, there is no necessity for the accused’s previous criminal antecedents to be set out. The prosecution also did not highlight or rely on any specific previous antecedent.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

5       The learned prosecutor did not seek anything higher than the minimum sentence to imposed in respect of the LT2 charge i.e. 7 years’ imprisonment. The DPP did not make any submission as regards the charge for criminal trespass. The prosecution also did not have any objections for both sentences to run concurrently.

## Mitigation

6       In his oral mitigation, the accused said he was remorseful and truly sorry for the offences. He also said he took some medication prescribed by IMH and was intoxicated. However, he maintained that he was not qualifying his plea of guilt.

7       I noted that the accused was ordered to be sent for psychiatric observation after he was charged in court. The psychiatric report (dated 24 June 2019) stated that the accused was diagnosed with substance and alcohol use disorder but that these conditions did not contribute to his offences. He was also not overtly depressed. He was not of unsound mind at the time of the offences and was certified fit to give his plea to the charges.

## Sentence

8       In respect of the LT2 offence, the prescribed minimum sentence is seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. I sentenced the accused to the prescribed minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment. In view of the accused’s age at the time of sentence, he was not liable to caning.

9       The accused could have but did not receive an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning as permitted under s 325(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The prosecution did not press for an additional term of imprisonment and as such, the court did not consider it necessary to do so.

10     In respect of the offence of criminal trespass, I imposed a short custodial sentence of 1 week’s imprisonment.

11     Finally, I ordered the terms of imprisonment in respect of the two charges to run concurrently. The sentence was back-dated to take effect from the day he was first remanded i.e. 12 June 2019.

12     Effectively, the shorter one-week sentence for the charge of criminal trespass would be subsumed within the longer sentence for the LT2 offence. I considered that the prosecution did not press for consecutive sentences. Perhaps the prosecution thought that the two offences arose from a single arrest and were, albeit in a very loose and broad sense, part of the same transaction. The prosecution could very well have mounted strong arguments for a consecutive sentence but did not choose to do so. As such I did not pursue the option of a consecutive sentence.

## Conclusion

13     In conclusion, given that the absolute minimum sentence was imposed in respect of the LT2 charge which was then ordered to run concurrently with the one-week imprisonment sentence for the charge of criminal trespass, the final aggregate imprisonment sentence was the lowest that the accused could have received in respect of both charges.

14     Therefore, the aggregate sentence could not be said to be manifestly excessive. I can only surmise that the accused filed this appeal because he has either changed his mind about pleading guilty or that he did intend to qualify his original plea of guilt.
