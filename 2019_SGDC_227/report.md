### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

The accused person, a 54-year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to 3 counts of failure to report for urine tests under Regulation 15(3)(f) and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (MDR) Regulation 3. He failed to present himself for urine tests on 27 April, 30 April and 7 May 2018 to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters;

2       The accused was sentenced to serve 8 months imprisonment in total, with effect from the expiry of his current imprisonment term. He is now appealing against his sentence.

## Statement of Facts (SOF)

3       The SOF which the accused admitted without any qualification disclosed the following material facts:

4       On 17 May 2018 at about 11.30 pm, the accused was arrested by police officers, along Siglap Road, Singapore, on suspicion of having committed drug related offences.

#### The 3rd, 4th & 5th Charges (DAC-923569-2018, DAC-923570-2018, & DAC-923571-2018)

5       On 6 March 2017, the accused was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Reg 3) (the Regulations).

6       Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Regulations, the accused was required to present himself for urine tests at Bedok Police Division Headquarters on every Monday and Friday, of each month, commencing on 20 March 2017, during the period of supervision, that is from 17 March 2017 to 16 March 2019.

7       The accused failed to present himself for his urine test on 27 April 2018 (Friday), 30 April 2018 (Monday), and 7 May 2018 (Monday). He admitted that he had no valid reason for doing so, and that he had stopped reporting for his urine tests as he had relapsed into drug consumption.

8       The accused has thereby committed three counts of an offence under Reg 15(3)(f) p/u Reg 15(6)(a) of the Regulations.

## The Antecedents

9       The prosecution disclosed that the accused has the following antecedents under the MDA:

10     In addition, the accused was subjected to 4 Drug Supervision Orders since 1993 with the latest being on the 17 March 2017 and he was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre in 1995. The accused was also traced for other offences.

## The Sentence

11     The accused has been convicted of 3 charges under the MDA for having failed to report for a urine test which is punishable with imprisonment up to 4 years or a $10,000 fine or both.

12     The prosecution, in their written address on sentence, sought a sentence of 4 months imprisonment per charge with 2 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment. The accused in mitigation said little, except to say that he had pleaded guilty and sought for his sentence to run immediately.

13     By way of background, this accused was first charged on 26 May 2018 and faced 2 counts of consumption of a specified drug, namely monoacetylymorphine and methamphetamine, both LT1 charges, and 3 counts of failure to report for urine tests on 27 April 2018, 30 April 2018 and 7 May 2018. The accused chose to claim trial to the 2 consumption charges, was eventually convicted and sentenced to serve in total 6 years imprisonment on the 16 April 2019. Before sentence was passed he rejected the prosecution’s plead guilty (pg) offer on the remaining 3 charges of failing to report for urine tests. The accused appealed against his conviction and sentence on the 2 LT1 charges and his appeal against both conviction and sentence was dismissed on the 31 July 2019. He therefore appeared on the 16 October 2019 as a person who was currently serving his sentence of 6 years imprisonment which was backdated to the 17 May 2018.

14     Prior to the current pg date, the accused’s case on the remaining 3 failure to report for urine charges was fixed for 5 pre-trial conferences (PTC) on 7 May, 2 July, 13 August, 3 September and 1 October 2019. At the first 4 PTCs the accused maintained his position to claim trial to all 3 charges. It was only at the last PTC on 1 October 2019 that he decided to plead guilty to all 3 charges after investigation into his claims of having valid medical certificates had been investigated and proven to be unmeritorious.

15     The accused has shown little remorse here. With regard to his 3 counts of having failed to report for urine tests, he eventually admitted that “_he had no valid reason for doing so, and that he had stopped reporting for his urine tests as he had relapsed into drug consumption._”[^1] He had unreasonably insisted earlier that he had valid medical certificates which was not borne out by the investigation. I took into account the fact that a drug supervision order is one of many measures enacted under the Law to ensure that drug addicts do not return to their habits of abusing drugs. Drug activities are regarded as a dreaded scourge and the predominant interest is the protection of society from the menace and social evils associated with drug abuse. Deterrence therefore takes centre stage in determining the appropriate sentence for offences under the MDA Act and its regulations.

16     In this case, the accused has not complied with the supervision order as he had relapsed into taking drugs, by his own admission. The sentencing norm is a sentence of 4 to 6 months’ imprisonment for first time offenders, a category in which the accused belonged to since he does not have any previous convictions of having failed to report for urine tests, even though he has antecedents under the MDA since 1993, a substantial period of more than 25 years. Exercising some leniency towards him I accepted the prosecution’s submission for a 4-month imprisonment term for this offence per charge and by operation of law, 2 terms of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively.

17     The accused, I believe, is dissatisfied that I had ordered his global sentence of 8 months imprisonment to run at the expiry of his current sentence. Under section 322 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court has the option of ordering the sentence to run immediately when sentence is pronounced or at the end of the expiry of the current sentence, if a person is undergoing imprisonment when the sentence is passed. I declined to order the sentence to run immediately, as to do so would result in the accused not receiving any punishment for the 3 counts of his failure to report for urine tests and his current sentence of 6 years would only expire, at the earliest, on 16 May 2022. Such an approach would be inappropriate considering the lack of remorse on his part and the fact that his 6 year sentence for his LT1 charges of consumption of specified drugs protect different and distinct legal interests, in comparison to the failure to report for urine tests.

18     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors including the plea in mitigation, I sentenced the accused to 4 months imprisonment per charge, with 2 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively resulting in a total of 8 months imprisonment. I ordered this sentence to take effect after the expiry of his current sentence of 6 years imprisonment.
