Criminal Law – Offences – Outrage of Modesty

25 October 2022

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused age 57 years is the maternal uncle of the teenaged complainant. He claimed trial to three charges of wrongful restraint in order to outrage her modesty and one charge of using criminal force on her, allegedly committed on three occasions when the complainant went to collect pocket money from him.

2       I acquitted the accused and prosecution appeals.

## Background

3       The accused is the elder brother of the complainant’s mother and runs a shop in the Serangoon Road area. He was also primary school friends with the complainant’s father, and they were still close friends at the time of the alleged incidents.

4       The complainant (“C”) has two older brothers and was about 16 years old at the time of the alleged first incident in November 2016. In 2016 she was repeating her Secondary 3 in a school near her home[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) and seeing a school counsellor because of absenteeism and arguments with her mother. She was close to her father a former policeman, and said she could talk to him about everything[^2]. Her father had been made bankrupt for substantial debts in September 2015.[^3] At the time of the trial in August 2020 C was 19 plus years old and in the second year of her finance services studies at ITE.

#### Relationship with the accused and his family

5       The families of C and the accused were close and they would regularly attend family events and have meals together. C said the accused was her father’s best friend and a fatherly figure to her. When they met they would hug to say Hi, and she would behave to him the way she behaved with her father.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

6       C’s mother said their families had also gone on family holidays together. The accused was loving and affectionate to her children and he would advise them and speak nicely to them and they would listen to him. He liked C very much and when they visited each other, he would carry C, put her on his lap and cuddle her.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) He would also help her family financially. The accused had also redeemed her jewellery which her husband had pawned[^6]. When her family members worked in his shop during Deepavali the accused would pay them a salary.[^7]

#### C’s monthly allowance

7       Sometime in the period July to September 2016, C’s mother noticed a change in C. C was disrespectful and talking back and fighting with her, and would also refuse to go for family functions.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) C’s mother was then also having her own financial problems. She gave C a daily allowance of $5 for school, and extra on weekends and when C had ECA or extra classes[^9]. C complained her pocket money was not enough and wanted more money for her outings with friends.[^10]

8       C’s mother spoke to the accused about her family problems as it was affecting her mentally. She requested him to speak to her children and husband. Later the accused called and reassured her that he had spoken to C and not to worry about C’s financial issues. He would take care of them and she need not speak to C. C’s mother said she was not aware that the accused had actually given C money and C continued to receive her daily school allowance.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

9       C’s father said the accused had called him and said he would take care of C’s allowance.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) C’s father then spoke to C about the arrangement. C said both her father and the accused told her not to let anyone else know about the allowance arrangement including her mother.[^13] Sometime in 2016, the accused passed C her first allowance during a family function in the presence of her father. The accused gave her $200 and her father was aware of the amount.[^14] The first few times the accused would pass her the allowance during family events. He would call her and her father to the side, and he always gave her the sum of $200.[^15]

## Overview of the parties’ cases

### Prosecution’s case

10     Prosecution’s case was that the accused wrongfully restrained C in order to molest her on three occasions when she collected pocket money from him (1st, 2nd and 4th charges). During the third occasion the accused also used criminal force on C by grabbing her wrist and waist and attempting to push her into a lift (3rd charge).

11     The first incident occurred in November 2016 outside the Gayatri restaurant at Orchid Country Club. The second and third incidents occurred in the second week of December 2016 and on 21 January 2017 respectively, both at the 5th floor carpark lift lobby of The Verge shopping mall at Serangoon Road.

12     The incidents came to light when C told her school personnel on 1 Feb 2017. Two days later on 3 February 2017 she was taken by them to Choa Chu Kang Neighbourhood Police Centre to make a police report, after her father failed to file a police report by the 24-hour deadline given by the school.

13     Prosecution called nineteen witnesses, including C’s parents, personnel from C’s school and the two friends who had accompanied C to The Verge during the second and third incidents. They also relied on text messages passing between C’s father and the accused and other circumstantial evidence.

### Defence

14     The accused elected to give evidence and did not call any witnesses. He did meet C on the said three occasions to pass her pocket-money of $50 each time but he did not molest her.

### The four charges

15     For completeness I set out the four charges below:

> DAC 921410-2019

## Evidence for the Prosecution

### C’s version of the three incidents

#### November 2016 at Orchid Country Club (“the first incident”)

16     C testified that the first incident occurred in November 2016 during her maternal aunt’s wedding anniversary dinner held at Gayatri restaurant (now Royal Palm restuarant) at the Orchid Country Club attended by her family and relatives.

17     She was seated at a table at the back of the restaurant closer to the entrance[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) with her cousins. Her cousins went to get dinner and she was alone at the table when the accused walked past her and signalled to her by tapping her shoulder and waving to come out of the restaurant. Prior to this he had been giving her a monthly allowance and she knew it was something to do with the allowance.

18     The accused exited the restaurant and waited for her at the side of the restaurant.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) She approached him and he passed her the allowance. She was facing him and the accused put his hands behind her back and she was shocked. He came towards her to kiss her and she tried to move away and dodge but he managed to kiss her on the left side at the corner of her mouth. Eventually he let go and she stepped back.

19     He told her to keep the allowance and not to tell anyone about it, the same thing he said whenever he passed her the allowance.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) She nodded her head and went back to her table and did not speak to anyone about the incident. Later on when she went home her father asked about the allowance and she told him she had received it from the accused. She did not say how much because the accused had been giving her $200 and she had already told her father previously about the amount.[^19]

#### December 2016 at The Verge (“the second incident”)

20     Sometime in December 2016, the accused texted C to ask when she could collect her allowance from him. She did not respond immediately and was having second thoughts after what had happened. However if she did not reply to the accused, the accused would contact her father who would then ask her when she could collect the allowance. She could not say no to her father otherwise he would ask her why. She then said okay to her father and texted the accused who asked her to meet at The Verge in Little India.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) She told her father she was going to meet the accused before she left.

21     C felt it was safer to bring a friend and asked her female friend RN to accompany her. RN (PW13) was then about 21 years old and C’s older brother’s friend. On the way to The Verge, C “roughly told” RN about the first incident and that she was collecting her allowance from her uncle.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

22     When C reached The Verge she texted the accused and he called her and told her to meet at the 5th floor carpark lift lobby. The carpark podium was connected to The Verge shopping mall by a link bridge. She told the accused that she was with a friend so that the accused would know she was with someone and he would not do anything to her like in the first incident. The accused kept insisting that she should leave her friend behind. She said okay to shut him up, but she still brought RN with her and they walked towards the carpark. C told RN to wait at the link bridge, and she went to meet the accused alone at the carpark lift lobby.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

23     The accused was in the lift lobby. He hugged her from the front with both his hands wrapped around her. He tried to kiss her on the lips but she moved her face away. He then grabbed her breast over her clothes with one of his hands with the other arm still wrapped around her. She could not recall which breast he grabbed. It happened very fast, and she felt very shocked and disappointed. He then let go after grabbing her breast and she pushed herself away from him. He then passed her the allowance and told her not to tell anyone about the allowance. She nodded and left.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) It was only later she found that the accused had given her $300.

24     She went to RN who was waiting at the bridge and told her in detail what happened including from the first incident. She was tearing and RN was trying to cheer her up. She then went for lunch with RN.

25     After she left The Verge her father texted her asking whether she collected the money. She texted him to say yes and told him she was going out with her friend. She did not tell him she got $300. Later when she got home her father asked her again whether she collected her allowance but she did not tell him what happened.

#### January 2017 at The Verge (“the third incident”)

26     The accused texted her and asked whether she could come on a particular date and time to collect her allowance. She did not reply as she did not want to meet him after what happened. The accused kept spamming her with texts and calls but she did not reply, and he even called her house phone. He then contacted her father who asked her when she could collect her allowance and why she did not reply her uncle. She told her father she was busy with school.

27     After her father spoke to her she felt that she did not have a choice[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) and told the accused she could see him on the day he suggested. The accused texted her and said he was going to give her $400 this time and “If you keep me happy, I’ll give you more money”. He told her to meet at The Verge. She clearly knew that he had some intentions, because every time he did something to her the money kept increasing.[^25]

28     She felt it was better to bring a male friend along this time. She asked RS (PW11), who was about 19 years old at that time, to accompany her to collect her allowance from her uncle. C told RS about what happened from the first incident including what happened when RN followed her to The Verge. She did not tell him specifically but “roughly told” him that the accused was touching her in an inappropriate manner.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

29     On the day of the meeting C told her father she was going to meet the accused but did not tell him the accused would be giving her $400. Before going to The Verge she had texted the accused to say she was coming with a friend and she had plans to rush off.

30     When she reached level 1 of The Verge she texted the accused and he called her. He was angry and asked her why she brought a friend. No one was supposed to know about the allowance and if anyone saw him he would get into trouble. She lied to him that her friend had driven there and they needed to rush off, and asked him to meet at level 1 of The Verge. The accused said to go to the 5th level car park, and she told him she was not going to leave her friend behind.

31     She went to 5th floor of the mall with RS and texted the accused to say she was on the 5th floor of the mall. She saw the accused coming out of the lift lobby at the back of the mall, but after the accused saw her standing there with RS he went back in and called her a second time. He shouted at her to leave RS behind and to walk towards the link bridge to the carpark. He hung up and she saw him walking towards the car park into the lift lobby.

32     She asked RS to wait at the link bridge and told him that if he heard her screaming, he was to go closer to the lift lobby. She then went to the carpark lift lobby. This time the accused was quiet, unlike previous occasions when he would talk or look at her. He then asked her whether her father knew she was there and whether she told her father anything. She told him her father knew she was there but she did not tell him anything. The accused then went towards the lift and started pressing the lift button.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

33     When the lift door opened, the accused dragged her into the lift by holding on to one of her wrists and to her waist with the other hand without saying anything. Her body was in between the lift doors and she kept pushing herself out of the lift and pushing him away. She asked the accused if he was taking her downstairs and she wanted to tell her waiting friend so he could follow them. The accused replied no need to tell her friend. After she succeeded in pushing herself out of the lift, she told the accused she was going to tell her friend they were going down and she ran to RS.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

34     She told RS she did not know what her uncle was trying to do and that he had tried to drag her into the lift. She told RS she was scared and asked RS to stand closer to the lift lobby so that the accused would know he was outside the lift lobby. RS then went forward to stand closer to the lift lobby.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

35     C went back to the lift lobby again. She told the accused she had to rush off, could he make it fast and that her friend was waiting outside the lift lobby. The accused pressed the lift button again. When the lift came up, he tried to drag her into the lift again the same way by putting one hand on her waist and his other hand on her wrist. This time she did not enter the lift as she kept pushing herself out even before he could drag her inside. She raised her voice about her friend waiting outside and that she had to rush off, and then the accused stopped and came out of the lift.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

36     The accused stood in front of her and hugged her from the front with both his hands wrapped around her. He then squeezed her breast with one hand still on her back, and then he touched the side of her butt with one hand. She did not know which hand he used or which breast he squeezed or which butt he touched. She described the force used on her breast as 7 to 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. She was trying to push herself away but he was holding tight and she felt angry and very disgusted. She repeatedly told him her friend was waiting outside and if he wanted to give the money to give it otherwise she was going to leave. He eventually stopped and passed her $400 and told her not to tell her father or anyone whatever happened. She nodded and left the lift lobby.

37     She went to RS and told him the accused tried to drag her into the lift again and that he touched her butt and squeezed her breast. She was crying and he was trying to console her and cheer her up. They left The Verge and went out and RS was trying to distract her.

38     Her father called her and asked whether she had collected her allowance. She said yes and that she was going out with a friend, but she did not tell him the amount she was given otherwise he would question her or the accused.

### Events of 1st to 3rd February 2017 at school

39     On 1st February 2017[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) C spoke to her school’s student development officer PW2 who had been counselling her on her absenteeism. She told PW2 about the third incident as it was too much for her to handle.[^32]

40     Later the same day, the school counsellor PW4 and C’s form teacher (PW3) spoke to C. All testified that C told them about more than one incident involving the accused.

41     C’s form teacher (PW3) with other school staff later met with C’s father on the evening of 1 February 2017 and told him about the three incidents. C’s father was also told he would be given 24 hours to make a police report, failing which the school would make a police report per the school protocol.

42     C’s form teacher said that C’s father texted her on the evening of the next day 2 February 2017 to say he would not be making the police report.

43     The following day 3 February 2017 C was brought by her form teacher, the part-time school counsellor PW4 and other school staff to the police station in the afternoon[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) to make a police report.[^34] C’s father arrived at the police station later that afternoon with her two brothers and he was angry and arguing with her form teacher and wanted to know who gave them permission to make the police report.[^35]

### C’s father’s account of text messages

44     On the evening of 1 February 2017 after C’s father returned home from the meeting with the school, he sent a text message to the accused (who he called “Panir”) asking whether he had misbehaved with his daughter. The accused called C’s father on his handphone and said he was sorry and to forgive him. C’s father hung up as he was not in the right frame of mind to speak to the accused. The accused then called C’s father on his home line and said the same thing. C’s father told the accused not to call and hung up.

45     C’s father did not tell his other family members about the allegations as he wanted to meet up with the accused face to face to find out what happened.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

46     The next day 2 February 2017, the accused sent C’s father two text messages, one at around 8am and the other at 1210pm.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) C’s father understood the texts to mean that the accused had misbehaved with C and he was asking for forgiveness. C’s father did not respond to any of the texts and he was angry and disgusted.

47     At about 7pm that same evening on 2 February, C’s father called the accused from his workplace as he wanted to meet him to find out what happened. The accused said he was at the airport and was afraid and he asked for help. C’s father asked the accused why he was running away from his own wife and kids and to go home. The accused had already cleared immigration but he decided to detour back out.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

48     C’s form teacher had also texted C’s father that same day 2 February about the police report and told him to stick to the time-frame. He texted her to ask for more time and that he would get back the next day as he did not yet have a chance to meet up with the accused. However he did not meet with the accused on 2 February, neither did he inform his family members about the incident.

49     The next day 3 February 2017 at 1051am, the accused sent him a third text addressing him as Chan and saying he was sorry.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) C’s father was at work on the day shift and did not reply. The school called him at his workplace at about 11am to 1130am to say that C had already been taken to the police station to make a police report. He was very unhappy and wanted to know why the school did not contact him or his wife before doing so.

50     He took half day leave, contacted his two sons and told them what happened, and the three of them went to the police station. He left the police station at 5 plus pm with C and told his sons not to tell their mother. His wife was still at work and he decided not to tell his wife himself as she would not believe him. That evening he called the accused and told him to arrange a meeting with C’s mother the next day so that the accused could tell C’s mother himself.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

51     As for the 13 February 2017 text[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) C’s father subsequently sent the accused, he had sent it to a second handphone number that the accused sometimes used to call him.[^42] He was advising the accused to go and see the IO and told the accused that he was still a friend.[^43]

### Meeting with C’s parents on 4 January 2017 at The Verge

52     The accused picked up C’s parents about 1030am on 4 February near 7-Eleven at Hastings Road and drove them in his van to the 5th level of The Verge carpark. C’s mother was unaware why the accused wanted to meet. After they got out of the van, C’s father told the accused to tell C’s mother what he did to their daughter.

53     C’s father said the accused started crying and held on to C’s mother’s legs, and spoke in Tamil. The accused said that he was sorry and said that he had touched C. C’s father told him to be specific about what he had done. The accused then told C’s mother he had held C, kissed her and touched her breast.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) The accused did not mention dates or locations, or the number of incidents or whether it had happened more than once.[^45]

54     C’s mother was stunned and then started shouting at the accused. C’s father also scolded him. C’s father then broke the news to the accused and C’s mother that a police report had been filed. The accused sat on the floor and started blabbering. Then he moved away and took out his handphone and called his wife’s brother in India and spoke in Tamil. He was desperate and panicking that a police report had been filed. He asked his wife’s brother to call his wife and to hand over his passport so he could go to India. The accused then drove off in his van.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)

### Two meetings with the accused at Stagmont Park

55     On 11 February 2017 after the accused returned from India, the accused called C’s father and said that the accused’s mother had requested for a meeting.

56     C’s parents met with the accused, the accused’s mother and the accused’s wife’s brother Thuraisamy at 830pm at Stagmont Park which was nearby C’s home. The accused pressed C’s parents to withdraw the police case as he was scared he would be charged and convicted, and he was begging them to help him. C’s father refused to withdraw the case. C’s mother was very angry and scolded the accused for looking at C that way.[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)

57     There was a second meeting in 2017 at Stagmont Park after the accused gave his statement to the police but C’s father could not recall when this meeting took place.

58     They met up at eight something in the evening and the same parties were present. The accused said he had given his statement and denied the allegations, and pestered C’s parents to withdraw the case. C’s father refused to withdraw the case. C’s father said the accused’s mother used a “very unhealthy word” on C and he was very angry and walked away from the group who were talking among themselves.

59     After some minutes the accused went to C’s father and apologised for what his mother said about C. He told C’s father he didn’t know what happened that day he behaved like that to C, and again asked C’s father to help him.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

## Evidence for the Defence

60     The accused had been helping C’s family financially. Whenever C’s father asked, he would give small helps with money. C’s mother would go to his shop to help herself to provisions. During C’s puberty celebrations, he gifted C with 25 pounds of gold and jewellery and $5000. Whenever C’s family members helped out in his shop during the festive season, he would pay them a salary.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

61     Both C’s parents had requested the accused to assist C with money. C’s mother had called him and said C was not focusing on her education or listening to her and she asked the accused to advise C. She also requested the accused to give C money if C should ask the accused for money. C’s father also said that C was distracted and asked the accused to discipline her, and to help C with money.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) He would inform C’s parents whenever he passed C money.

### Accused’s account of the three incidents

62     At the Orchid Country Club function, C was seated at the reception table, which was just outside the entrance of the restaurant. He was having some conversation with the relatives at the bar counter inside.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) Before the function, C had called him to say she needed $50. C said her parents were not giving her money for her educational expenses and that she needed to buy books. He told C he would pass her the money at the function.

63     He approached C at the reception table and passed her $50 and told her to keep it. There were people around. He then went back into the restaurant.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52)

64     As regards the December 2016 meeting at The Verge, he had met C at The Verge carpark. He had dropped his wife at his shop and then parked his van at The Verge carpark where he had season parking.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) His wife did not like it when he helped C’s family financially. The Verge carpark had seven levels and he could not recall on which floor of the carpark he met C, but confirmed it was on the floor with a link bridge to the shopping mall podium.

65     On the day itself, C told him she had brought a friend along but he did not see the friend. He did not say anything to her about the friend as it was not a big thing to him.

66     C came alone to the lift lobby and he passed $50 to her. To him $50 was a big amount and he did not give her $300. He could monitor his shop from his phone and could see it was crowded. He took the lift down and left. Normally when he gave money to C, he would let her parents know.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

67     As regards the third incident in January 2017, he could not recall the date and time he met C to pass her the allowance.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) C had called and said she needed money as her parents were not giving her money for her education-related expenses. He asked her why she was all the time asking for such a big amount.

68     He was busy as it was Thaipusam period but she forced him to meet saying she needed money. He told C to meet at The Verge carpark as it was a convenient spot for him as he parked his van there after dropping his wife at the shop.

69     He could not recall the floor, but it was the floor with a link bridge to the shopping mall. C did not say that she had any friend with her and he did not see any friend at the link bridge. He was rushing and had to go to his shop. He told her to take the $50. C thanked him and said even in his busy schedule he had still come to help her. She kissed him on both cheeks and he kissed her on both cheeks and tapped her shoulders. He left immediately after giving her the money. It was Thaipusam time and crowded, and there were people at the carpark.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56)

70     He did not know why C made the allegations about him and it was a “mystery to me” although he saw that RN had testified in court that C had the habit of persistently lying.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57)

### Events of 2 to 4 February 2017

71     On 2 February 2017 he was at the airport when his wife called to say his mother was unwell. C’s father also called him and the accused told C’s father that he was already aware. He felt troubled and decided to return home, and the ICA travel records showed his arrival back at 8pm the same day. He made monthly trips out of Singapore for his medical needs as well as to buy things for his shop.

72     He denied that there was any meeting at The Verge with C’s parents on 4 February 2017. He left for India on 4 February 2017 in the afternoon at 240pm and returned on 11 February 2017. No one called him about any incident involving C.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

73     Just after his return from India, C’s father called him and told him that the IO had asked the accused to go and see him.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) He was told it was about misbehaviour and molest of C. He gave a statement to IO Stephanie denying the molest.[^60]

74     The accused disagreed that the meetings at Stagmont Park took place just after his return from India. It was only after he had given his statement to IO Stephanie on 3 March 2017[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61) that C’s father called him to meet, and asked the accused to bring his mother to the meeting.

75     They met at Stagmont Park at about 9pm. He attended this meeting with his mother and his brother-in-law. The accused was very angry about them complaining against him. He denied doing anything and asked them why they complained against him. C’s mother then spoke to their mother to ask that the accused settle C’s father’s bankruptcy debts. He only became aware of C’s father’s bankruptcy at this meeting. It was a short 15-minute meeting and he left with his mother when he heard that.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

76     About 10 days later, C’s mother called their mother and asked to meet again. They met a second time at Stagmont Park. C’s mother had said she would try to withdraw the case in exchange for discharging her husband’s bankruptcy. C’s mother asked their mother what decision they had made on the bankruptcy. Their mother said the accused had disagreed.

77     The accused did not know what plans C’s parents had or their motive, but under normal circumstances he would have helped them with the bankruptcy debts.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

### Text messages to and from C’s father

78     As regards the three text messages sent to C’s father’s handphone[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) on 2 and 3 February 2017 from the handphone number XXX747 (“747 number”), the accused said that it was his phone number but he had given the SIM to his worker Kumar, who was now in India. He was not aware of these messages until he saw them in court.

79     As regards the text message sent by C’s father on 13 February 2017[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) to telephone number XXX549 (“the 549 number”), he was unaware about this message until he saw it in court. He did not have access to this phone.[^66]

## Assessment of Evidence and Findings

### Issues and applicable legal principles in assessing the evidence

80     The issues to be determined were whether the accused had committed the alleged acts on C in the three incidents as set out in the four charges, and whether they were committed with the requisite intent.

81     Where prosecution relies substantially on a victim’s testimony to sustain a conviction, the victim’s evidence must be unusually convincing in the sense that it is sufficient in and of itself to overcome any doubts that may arise from the lack of corroboration. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the only standard to be applied in criminal proceedings even when the victim’s testimony is uncorroborated and forms the sole basis for a conviction: _PP V Wee Teong Boo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 56</span> at \[44\].

82     The unusually convincing standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence of the accused where it was the case of one person’s word against another’s. The assessment of the prosecution’s evidence under the unusually convincing standard must be made with reference to the totality of the evidence including the case for the defence. The evaluative task is not just internal to the prosecution‘s case but also comparative in nature: _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span> at \[149(g) and (h)\].

83     A victim’s testimony may only be found to be unusually convincing by weighing the demeanour of the witness alongside the internal and external inconsistencies found in the witness’s testimony. Where the evidence of a victim is not unusually convincing, a conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the victim’s claims: _AOF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_AOF_”) at \[115\] and \[173\].

### Overview of the witnesses and evidence

84     Before I proceed with my detailed findings, I set out an overview of my general findings about the principal witnesses and the evidence.

85     C was about 16 years old at the time of the alleged incidents, and her account of her actions and reactions were assessed in that light. She had provided plausible reasons for the delay in telling her parents about the alleged incidents: that the matter was sensitive because the accused was not only her maternal uncle but also her father’s best friend, and she feared her family would not believe her.

86     I rejected counsel’s various attempts to discredit C on the basis that she had delayed in telling her parents about any of the incidents, that she would repeatedly meet the accused despite claiming to have been molested by him on previous occasions, and that she did not scream or shout or react during the alleged incidents or refuse the accused’s money. All these submissions rested on assumptions as to how a molest victim should or should not act react or behave.

87     As the court in _PP v Koh Rong Guang_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 117</span> at \[87\] observed in relation to a 13-year-old victim who continued to meet her abuser which appeared strange, an adult may be expected to react in a certain way but a juvenile could not be expected to react similarly. The court noted that the thinking process assumptions and viewpoint of a juvenile victim may lead to a course of action that may appear unreasonable or improbable. Victims also react and cope differently with assault and trauma and may even rationalise their own actions.

88     However as regards the principal prosecution witnesses, I found the evidence of C and her father riddled with inconsistencies both internal and external. This materially affected their overall credibility, even after due allowance was given for effluxion of time on memory and recollection. The strain on C’s credibility was also exacerbated by the substantial plausibility gaps in her account of the alleged incidents. As the account of a flawed witness should not be rejected in its entirety, I had assessed whether and which parts of their accounts the court could safely accept. However the inconsistencies were wide-spanning and many related to material issues, and not all of them could be attributed to memory or recollection lapses. In my view deliberate lies had been told and tailored to suit the narrative. All things considered, I did not find C to be an unusually convincing witness and neither was the collective weight of the other available evidence sufficient to make out the prosecution’s case.

89     Of the other prosecution witnesses, I found the school personnel, particularly C’s form teacher (PW3) who was able to recollect details, to be credible witnesses. I accepted their accounts of what C had told them, the school’s interactions with C’s father and C’s emotional state during that period.

90     I also found C’s friends RN (PW13) and RS (PW11) who had accompanied her to The Verge to be mature and truthful witnesses. Neither were in contact with C since 2017 and I accepted that they had given impartial accounts. While testifying, they did not seek to over-reach on matters they could not recall, and took time to try and recollect in response to questions posed. Both were able to give detailed and cogent accounts. Where there were material discrepancies between their accounts and C’s testimony, prosecution did not seek to suggest to either of RN or RS that they could have been mistaken or recollected wrongly on these matters. After assessing RN and RS, I gave weight to their evidence.

91     As for the documentary evidence, The Verge was demolished sometime in September 2017.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) No photographs were taken of the lift lobby where the 2nd and 3rd incidents allegedly occurred. Prior to that, the first IO did visit the scene but she said at that time her focus was on the CCTV footages and she did not direct that photographs be taken.[^68] The court had to rely on sketches as drawn by the various witnesses for an idea of the rough layout of the link bridge and the carpark and the lift lobby. As the sketches were not drawn to scale it could not be ascertained how far away the parties were from each other and how much of the inside of the enclosed lift lobby could be seen by the carpark users.

92     It appeared that more objective evidence might also have been available if investigative efforts had been more prompt and decisive. In addition, the contemporaneous call logs and texts between the parties and the accused could have supported the many disputed claims one way or the other, but were irretrievably lost.

93     The handphones of C and C’s father were seized late in the day by the third IO. In the case of C’s iPhone, it was only seized on 28 August 2020 after the trial had already started,[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) by which time C had long forgotten her password and her handphone was locked and remained locked despite forensic attempts to unlock the iPhone.

94     As regards the texts in C’s father’s ASUS handphone, C’s police report was filed on 3 February 2017 and the accused had given his statement on 3 March 2017. The first IO had examined and taken photographs of the four texts in C’s father’s ASUS handphone on 30 March 2017, nearly two months after the incidents were first reported. She also did not direct photographs to be taken of the call logs as she thought it was not unusual for C’s father and the accused to be calling each other. She returned the handphone to C’s father as he said he needed to use the phone,[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70) and C’s father’s handphone was not seized until 31 January 2018 and by then contained very sparse and redacted information.[^71]

95     As for the CCTV footages at The Verge, the first IO confirmed that there were indeed CCTV cameras around the lift lobby area where the alleged incidents took place. But when she visited the scene on 23 February 2017 nearly three weeks after C made her police report, she was told by the security team that the footages were already over-written.[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72)

96     As for the accused, he was an inconsistent witness and had told the court many untruths, including lies that he was not the one who had sent C’s father the three texts from the handphone number 747 and that he had not met C’s parents at The Verge on 4 February 2017. He had also variously attempted to bolster his defence, including alleging that C’s parents were pressuring him to discharge C’s father’s bankruptcy debts in exchange for withdrawing C’s police report.

### Substantial implausibility in C’s account of the molest incidents

97     I found C to be an intelligent witness and measured in her responses. However she was not a forthright witness. Her allegations of how she was molested in the three incidents had a stock rehearsed tone and quality, which contrasted sharply with her shifting testimony of the material and contemporaneous events. Her narrative was not only littered with inconsistencies, her account of the first and third incidents was imbued with multiple layers of implausibility.

98     In particular, her testimony of the third incident where she alleged she was twice dragged towards the lift by the accused before she was molested was dramatic, but revealed gaping plot holes when examined more closely. I shall begin with the third incident.

#### 21 January 2017 at The Verge

99     I summarise C’s account: she went into the lift lobby to see the accused twice. On the first occasion the accused tried to drag her into the lift by holding onto her wrist and her waist. She broke free and ran back to her male friend RS waiting for her at the link bridge, but she decided to return to the lift lobby a second time. The accused again attempted to drag her into the lift before stepping out of the lift to molest her by wrapping his arms around her, squeezing her breast and then touching her butt.

100    I accepted that C had gone into the lift lobby twice that day. RS had corroborated that C had slow-jogged back to him at the link bridge before again returning to the lift lobby alone a second time. However C’s claims of what happened at the lift lobby were wholly uncorroborated.

101    I made two observations. First, that the accused was actually inside the lift lobby on the first occasion was based solely on C’s claims. RS testified that he did not see the accused entering the lift lobby, and from his initial position at the link bridge he could not see anything inside the lift lobby. This was despite C testifying that the accused saw both of them together and when she was with RS she had seen the accused walking from the mall towards the carpark into the lift lobby. RS said that it was only when he moved closer to the lift lobby after C went back the second time that he saw there was someone in the lift lobby although he could not see his face or appearance.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73)

102    Second, if the accused were indeed in the lift lobby the first time C went there and had tried to drag C into the lift, I did not rule out the possibility that the strong lure of the monetary allowance could have motivated C to return to the lift lobby alone a second time.

103    However C’s claims of what happened at the lift lobby during both encounters was a doubtful story on many fronts. If the accused had indeed tried to drag C into the lift on the first occasion she met him at the lift lobby, this would be the first time the accused had used bodily force to drag her. If C the unwilling victim had indeed broken free and run off towards her friend RS, it was most improbable that the accused would be standing at the lift lobby patiently and expectantly awaiting the return alone of his victim who had just escaped from his physical clutches. All the more so in this case, as C said the accused had been told that C’s friend was waiting for her nearby on the same level, and that the accused had even seen them together, so he would know that C was not making an idle threat that her male friend was close by.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) These gaps were not addressed in evidence.

104    So according to C’s account, the accused would have been waiting at the lift lobby for his escaped victim, without knowing whether his victim would actually return, or whether C would return with her male friend to confront him. Furthermore, the accused would also be waiting for her with continued mal-intent on his mind, because C alleged that when she returned the second time he started dragging her towards the lift again, before eventually stepping out into the lift lobby to molest her. According to RS the incident lasted 15 to 20 minutes,[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) and even if RS was not held to any exact time estimation, it was clear that C did not have a brief encounter with the accused. The accused would have had to believe that throughout this segmented episode there would not be any passerby in the vicinity of the carpark, lift lobby or the lifts who would witness or interrupt his intended nefarious acts, that C would not call out for help and that C’s male friend would keep out of the lift lobby.

105    Prosecution submitted that the accused was brazen and could have committed the offences in full view of potential witnesses, and even if getting caught was a potential outcome.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76) The court agreed that the offences could have been committed in a public place, as molesters have been known to be brazen and take risks even with potential witnesses around. However the plausibility of C’s claims was a relevant consideration in assessing the evidence.

106    As the court observed in _PP v Wee Teong Boo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 56</span> at \[60\] to \[61\], the rashness of an act did not mean that it could not have happened. However implausibility was a relevant factor to be considered in assessing whether the relevant threshold of proof had been met. The court had found it doubtful that the accused doctor would have attempted penile penetration on the complainant in the clinical examination room, which had a sliding door with clinic assistants and patients waiting outside. The sliding door could not be locked and the complainant could have screamed for help. For the court to find that the accused had raped the complainant under such audacious circumstances he must have believed he could get away with it, and that the complainant would not know that she was being raped and would remain completely silent during the ordeal.

107    Adding to the implausibility of the account was C’s testimony of her exchange with the accused when he was trying to drag her into the lift, which bordered on surreal, even though at all times I bore in mind that C’s thought processes and actions were that of a 16-year-old.

108    According to C, when she was being forcibly dragged and fighting to pull herself out of the lift on the first occasion, she told her assailant she wanted to tell her waiting friend where the accused was taking her so he could go with them. This was in the midst of a supposedly on-going physical struggle, and there could be mistaking the accused’s ill-intent even to a 16-year-old because the accused was using physical force to haul her into the lift. Yet C’s immediate concern was not for herself or her personal safety or telling the accused to stop, but naively telling her assailant that she wanted her friend to come along with them to wherever the accused was forcibly taking her.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) Moreover, despite the accused supposedly forcibly dragging her, C did not feel it necessary yet to seek any help from RS who she said she had brought along to feel safer, even though the accused was someone she said had already molested her on two previous occasions. This was all the more surprising given that in her carefully laid-out testimony, she claimed to have anticipated herself screaming for help and testified that she told RS to go into the lift lobby if he heard her screaming.[^78]

109    C further testified that after she had pushed herself out of the lift and broke free, she told the accused she was going to tell her friend they were going downstairs so he would not just be waiting there for her.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) This would be a most curious thing to tell an assailant she had just physically freed herself from, to want to inform him about her intended course of action and simultaneously suggesting to him that actually she was not quite averse to following him into the lift. C’s testimony was ambivalent and lacked cogency as to whether she was wholly unwilling to get into the lift with her molester altogether, or only that she was not averse to following the accused into the lift if she could tell RS about it so that he was not kept waiting.

110    Neither did RS corroborate C’s claims that she wanted to tell RS about going downstairs with the accused. RS said when C returned from the first encounter, she only told him the accused tried to pull her into the lift. After he told C to leave and not collect the cash, C thought a while and replied that she wanted to go back and say bye to the accused and leave.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80)

111    All things considered, she gave an incongruous account of the accused waiting for her to return to the lift lobby alone for a second encounter, after a physical struggle and escape by an unwilling victim had just taken place, if the accused was indeed in the lift lobby the first occasion.

112    As for C’s claims of what happened the second time at the lift lobby, C said she specifically told the accused her friend was waiting just outside the lift lobby.[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81) There was no evidence the accused actually knew or saw where RS was positioned on the 5th level. As such the accused would not know how far away or near RS was to the lift lobby, or for that matter, whether or not RS could see them if the accused had indeed tried forcibly dragging C into the lift or molesting her the second time. Neither would the accused know with certainty whether if and how C would have reacted to his acts, and if she did, he would have to believe that neither RS nor a passerby would come into the lift lobby.

113    Both the carpark and lift lobby were public areas and it was not disputed that there were CCTV cameras at the lift lobby area. The possibility of someone in the carpark looking into the lift lobby, emerging in the lift lobby or using the lifts could not be discounted even if human traffic was light on that floor. According to the accused’s unchallenged evidence, level 5 was not the topmost carpark floor where possibly human traffic could be the most sparse, and he said it was also Thaipusam period and crowded.

114    Prosecution had belatedly sought to suggest to the accused that the door to the lift lobby was closed and persons inside the lift lobby could not be seen by carpark users, although no evidence had been led by prosecution from C, RN or RS to support the suggestion that the door to the lift lobby was closed at the relevant time. This was disputed by the accused who testified that the door opened inwards and was always opened. RS had also testified that he was able to see someone inside the lift lobby from behind the small pillar in the carpark across the lift lobby where he had stationed himself so he could not be seen by the accused[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82).

115    In fact, I found C’s claim about the accused trying to drag her into the lift against her will rather baffling. First, the carpark lift was a public lift which could be used by anyone, and even if the accused managed to successfully drag her inside the lift against her will, any struggle inside the lift or even after they emerged from the lift would not be unnoticed. Second, what was the accused’s intent and purpose of dragging her into the lift? Was the accused intending to drag his unwilling victim into the lift or take her somewhere else more secluded so he could commit nefarious acts on her ? However according to C the accused had already molested her at the very same lift lobby in December 2016 despite knowing that C’s friend was with her, and in any event C claimed the accused eventually also molested her at this same lift lobby during the third incident even though RS was waiting nearby.

116    Before I move on to the alleged first incident, I will deal briefly with prosecution’s other submissions about the third incident. Prosecution submitted that the accused had selected the lift lobby as the meeting point with the intention of molesting C as it was an enclosed area and not visible from the carpark. [\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83) However prosecution had failed to prove that the lift lobby door was closed and not visible from persons in the carpark. Neither did I find anything sinister about the meeting point _per se_. The accused said he usually parked his vehicle at the carpark, and he had used the carpark lift to go down after handing C the money as he was rushing to go to his shop.

117    Prosecution also submitted that C was not cross-examined about the alleged third incident and the court was entitled to treat C’s testimony of the incident as undisputed.[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) On this it was not clear whether counsel’s failure to examine C was inadvertent or deliberate. At the end of the second day of trial on 19 August 2020, counsel had informed the court that he had more questions for C on the second incident before he would move on to the 3rd and 4th charges.[^85] When the trial resumed some four and a half months later on 5 January 2021 there was a protracted exchange between prosecution and defence arising from C’s locked handphone and eventually counsel went on to examine C on matters unrelated to the alleged incidents.[^86] In any event the non-examination by counsel on the third incident did not mean that C’s account was to be accepted as truth and her claims had to be assessed for veracity.

#### 1st incident at Orchid Country Club

118    I turn now to C’s account of the alleged first incident at the Orchid Country Club.

119    According to C, she was molested by the accused at the pillar in front of the glass frontage of the restaurant.[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87) It was not disputed that the posters and the metal stands at the pillar as seen in the photographs[^88] were not there at the time of the alleged incident, and the restaurant was unchanged from the photographs except that it was now run by another operator under a different name.

120    The accused gave a shifting account of where he had passed the allowance to C. During C’s cross-examination, counsel had put to C that she was standing outside near the glass entrance doors[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89) using her telephone when the accused passed her $50.[^90] This version was broadly consistent with what was stated in the accused’s police statement[^91] and the Case for Defence.[^92] However during the accused’s testimony, he testified that C was sitting outside at the reception table near the glass entrance doors with other persons when he passed $50 to her.[^93]

121    However C’s testimony that she had been molested at the location near the pillar lacked plausibility, even leaving aside her shifting recount of this incident she gave to her own father: at \[258\]. This pillar where the molest allegedly took place was close to and directly in front of the glass frontage wall of the restaurant. From the photographs it could be seen that this was a clear glass frontage, and where they were allegedly standing would be visible by anyone looking out from inside the restaurant. Added to this was the accused’s unchallenged evidence that the buffet table was resting against this glass frontage on the inside of the restaurant.[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94) Further according to C, the relatives including herself were already seated inside the restaurant when she was signalled to come out of the restaurant and her cousins had gone to get food from the buffet. Prosecution did not attempt to clarify with C her marked position of where they were standing when the molest occurred, nor was it any part of prosecution’s case that there could have been any sort of obstruction of view of the location of the alleged molest.

122    Not only was this pillar right in front of the glass frontage of the restaurant, it was also situated in an open public foyer area. As seen from the photographs, the location C marked was clearly visible by any member of the public descending the grand staircase, or passing through the foyer from any access point apart from the restaurant or the grand staircase.[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95)

123    C testified that the accused was not only hugging her but attempting to kiss her on her lips and she was moving her face away. There could therefore be no mistaking by any of the relatives looking in that direction that the accused’s conduct was improper and unwanted. And even to a passing member of the public not aware of the uncle-niece relationship, the display of unwanted physical intimacy would have attracted notice.

124    I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the molest could have taken place even if committed in full view of potential witnesses. However the plausibility of C’s testimony of the accused molesting her in plain sight of family and other relatives inside the restaurant just steps away had also to be weighed with the inherent improbability that the accused would pick the occasion of a large family function to commit molest on C for the first time.

125    Even if the accused as would-be molester had audaciously picked a visible spot when there were many other more discreet locations nearby, the accused could not have known how C would have reacted to his molest. He would not only have to believe that he would not be seen by any of the relatives or anyone passing by, but also that C would not raise the alarm during the molest, nor subsequently when she returned to the restaurant where there were more than 80 relatives, which included the families of C and the accused.

### C not a forthright witness

#### C’s claimed reluctance to accept and collect her allowance contradicted by multiple witnesses

126    Aside from the substantial plausibility gaps in C’s account of the molest incidents, C made many claims that were contradicted by the other witnesses. Her narrative in court was that she was reluctant to accept the allowance from the accused from the start and subsequently she was also reluctant to meet up with the accused after the alleged first incident but the accused was persistent in wanting to meet her about the allowance.

127    This allowance from the accused was not for C’s school needs or expenses. Both parents testified that they continued to pay C her daily school allowance, but C had wanted more money for her outings with friends. The allowance the accused gave her was in the way of extra pocket money for her non-school activities.

128    C testified that she was reluctant to receive an allowance from her uncle when the subject was first brought up by her father. When her father told her about the arrangement she told him she did not want the money. Her father then spoke to the accused but the accused insisted on giving her the allowance so that C would not trouble her mother. Her father talked to her about the allowance again and she told her father it was up to him and if he was okay with the arrangement she was okay with it too.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96)

129    C further testified that after the first incident she was having second thoughts about meeting the accused to collect the allowance and it was the accused who spammed her with texts and calls to collect the allowance. She had no choice but to meet him to collect the allowance as the accused would contact her father about the collection of the allowance.[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97)

130    Both these claims were directly contradicted by the other witnesses.

131    C’s father said that when he spoke to C about the accused giving her pocket money, she agreed and said okay, and that was all.[\[note: 98\]](#Ftn_98)

132    Multiple witnesses also contradicted C’s claims that she was reluctant to see the accused to collect her allowance. They testified that C told them that she needed the money and she wanted to collect her allowance from the accused, despite making various allegations about the accused to them.

133    PW2 the student development officer said C told her she needed the money as her family was financially tight and she wanted to relieve their financial burden.[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99) PW2 added that C said she still intended to go on meeting the accused with a friend because she needed the money, despite telling PW2 that the accused had touched her inappropriately on two previous occasions and PW2’s advice to her not to go.[^100]

134    RN also said that prior to the alleged second incident in December 2016, C had told her she needed the money and wanted to collect the allowance from the accused. Moreover after the alleged second incident, RN had advised C not to see the accused the next month, but C had still proceeded to meet the accused accompanied by her male friend RS in January 2017.[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101)

135    As regards the alleged third incident at The Verge, her male friend RS said that when C first told him that her uncle was looking at her the wrong way, he told her not to go but C still wanted to collect the money. After C slow-jogged back to him at the link bridge and told him the accused had tried to pull her into the lift, RS again advised her there was no need to collect the money and to just leave. Despite his advice C still headed back to the lift lobby to see the accused a second time that day.[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102)

136    C’s claimed reluctance to collect the allowance belied her eagerness for the money, as evident also from her own account. She testified that prior to the alleged third incident at The Verge in January 2017, the accused had texted her to say that he was going to give her $400 and if she kept him happy he would give her more money. She said she “clearly knew” that he had some intentions,[\[note: 103\]](#Ftn_103) yet she still went ahead to meet the accused despite RS’s advice not to collect the allowance. Further, as to why she returned to the lift lobby a second time during the January 2017 incident despite claiming to have been dragged on the first occasion, C testified that the second occasion she asked the accused to pass her the money and to make it fast,[^104] even though RS said C told him she wanted to go and say goodbye to her uncle.

#### Claims about the allowance amounts she received were doubtful

137    C testified that only her father knew about the allowance she received from the accused, and he knew that she was receiving $200.

138    C said that the allowance sum was always $200, until the December 2016 and January 2017 incidents when the accused increased the sums to $300 and $400 respectively. Prior to the alleged incidents her father had seen the accused giving her $200, and every time she got the allowance she would tell her father the amount was $200.

139    However she did not tell her father the sums she received during the three alleged incidents. She did not tell her father about the $200 she received from the accused in the first incident, as her father did not ask her the amount and they both already knew the amount.[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105) She also did not tell her father she had received $300 during the second incident because the accused told her not to tell him,[^106] nor about the $400 received during the third incident as her father might query her why the allowance had been increased.

140    The accused disputed C’s claims and said that he only gave her $50 each time when she called him to say that she needed money. To him $50 was a large sum of money.

141    The sum of $200 which C claimed she always received monthly from the accused would if true, be a generous sum compared to what she received from her parents. However C’s father directly contradicted C’s claims that the accused was giving her $200 and that he was aware she was being given $200. He said he saw the accused _passing a $50 note_ to C during a family luncheon. He was also not aware that C was receiving $200 as he did not ask C about the amount and neither did C tell him the amount.[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107) C’s mother also testified that after the incidents surfaced, C told her that initially the accused gave $50, but over time the amount increased to $100, $200, $300.[^108]

142    Neither did C’s father corroborate C’s adamant claims that she did not tell him about the sums she received during any of the three alleged incidents. As regards the $400 received in the third incident, C testified she wanted to avoid questions about why the accused was giving her such a large sum of money.[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109) However C’s father said when he called C who was in Suntec that evening, C told him that the accused had given her a “big amount” and she mentioned the sum of $400 to him, and he told C to thank the accused and she said she already did.[^110]

#### Evidence of school personnel and her friend RN

143    The school personnel and her friend RN provided a small pen-picture of C in 2016\\2017. There was nothing in this evidence that suggested that C was a particularly naïve or sheltered teenager.

144    Her form teacher in 2017, who was also her subject teacher the year before in 2016, described C as intelligent. C would pay attention during her classes and ask intelligent questions, and see her for consultations. This description accorded with what C had described of herself, that she had been a top student in her cohort previously and found it hard to accept when she had to repeat Secondary 3.[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111) C also told her form teacher that her mother was too controlling and her home too stifling and she couldn’t breathe.[^112]

145    In 2016 C had come to the attention of her form teacher, who was also her subject-teacher, for absenteeism. C was referred to and seeing a school counsellor from early 2016 for her problems with school and her mother.[\[note: 113\]](#Ftn_113) It appeared that C’s school issues had surfaced even before 2016. According to the report from the Child Guidance Clinic,[^114] C had been seen by the clinic in July 2014 for depressive and anxiety symptoms and reduced school attendance. In 2014 C would have been in Secondary 2, and this was two years before C repeated her Secondary 3 in 2016.

146    Both C’s form teacher and PW2 had paid C home visits. PW2 testified that she had multiple interactions with C even though she first came to know C only in January 2017. PW2 would go to C’s home to pick her up and bring her to school[\[note: 115\]](#Ftn_115). C admitted she would skip school for three days in a week, and sometimes for weeks.

147    C’s friend RN had frequent interactions with C in 2016. At the time of the trial, RN was 26 years old and a childcare educator based in Australia. She was about 21 years old in 2016 and came to know C as she was friends with C’s older brother.

148    RN described C and herself as close friends and she would meet with C four or five times a week.[\[note: 116\]](#Ftn_116) C was fun and would tell her stories about school. When C wanted to go to the gym RN would accompany her and they would hang out with other friends, including C’s brother’s friends as RN knew them.

149    RN said when C told her about her uncle being touchy, she asked C to tell her parents, but C told RN that her parents were very strict and they did not like her hanging out late. C did not want to let her parents know or they would not allow her to go out anymore and that would make matters worse for her. While C testified that she did not tell her parents about the alleged incidents because the matter was sensitive, which was plausible, it appeared from RN’s testimony that C’s given reason at that time for not telling her parents had also to do with her own personal freedoms.[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117)

150    RN also told the court that C told lies about her whereabouts and involved RN in these lies.[\[note: 118\]](#Ftn_118) RN cut off the relationship with C in 2017 because C would lie to her mother about who she was with and RN would get into trouble as C’s mother would call her. PW2 also testified that C said she had been telling lies to her parents about going to school and hanging out with her friends.[^119]

151    C admitted that she told lies to her family and her friends, and described them as “small lies”.[\[note: 120\]](#Ftn_120) Notwithstanding these small lies, the lies involving RN eventually led to quarrels and RN ending their close friendship. While these lies did not mean that C was lying about the alleged incidents, the C in 2016\\2017 was capable of spinning lies and making use of her good friend RN in her web of lies.

#### C sprung additional molest accusations against a second subject when brought to the police station

152    The contents of the first information report (“FIR”)[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121) admitted as an agreed exhibit were somewhat surprising. Up to that point of going to the police station, C had only complained about the accused and she was brought to the police station as regards her allegations against the accused.

153    The FIR stated the date\\time of the incidents to be from _1 March 2009 to 21 January 2017_, a period of 8 years. Under the Brief Details was written “I was molested by two Male Indian Subjects individually several times at various occasions.” The location of the incidents was stated to be at the address of a residential unit in Pasir Ris.

154    I bore in mind that the recording officer had summarised the complaints and it contained only brief details. Neither prosecution nor counsel had made any attempt to clarify the contents with C, nor was the recording officer called.

155    As no clarifications had been sought from any of the witnesses, to assume that the contents of the police report were consistent with C’s allegations I had to make several assumptions about the FIR:

> (a)     although there was no confirmation from C that the last incident occurred on 21 January 2017, the report included all three incidents alleged against the accused because the time frame of the three incidents fell within the incident period stated in the FIR from 2009 to 21 January 2017,

> (b)     C had made only three complaints against the accused in the FIR, and the remaining incidents in the FIR in the eight-year period related to the second accused, and

> (c)     the single residential address stated as the incident location in the report did not reflect all the incident locations, even though under the Brief Details the recorder had seen it fit to explicitly state that the male subjects had molested C at “various occasions” but omitted any mention that the incidents had occurred at various other locations.

156    For evaluation purposes I was prepared to make the assumptions in C’s favour as she was not the writer of the FIR. However for good order, because the report had mentioned two defendants and offences committed over a lengthy eight-year time frame, evidence should have been led to clarify these matters. It was unsatisfactory that assumptions had to be made that there were no inconsistencies between C’s allegations against the accused despite the way the FIR had been written.

157    C’s additional allegations were made against the accused’s son AS. When C’s father was on the witness stand counsel had sought to ask him about the fact that a complaint had also been made against a second molester and prosecution had objected to these questions. The parties then informed the court that they had agreed pre-trial to redact those portions of PW6’s March 2018 report[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122) relating to the alleged second molester AS and C’s complaints against him. Counsel eventually decided to withdraw this line of questioning and the questions that had been put to C’s father about this second complaint were expunged.[^123]

158    It remained from the contents on the face of the FIR and the evidence led by prosecution that C had without raising any prior complaint suddenly told the police on 3 February 2017 that she had been molested since 2009 when she was only about nine years old by two male subjects. These were serious allegations, and surprising as C had surfaced to the school personnel just two days prior similar allegations of molest but only as against the accused. All three school personnel PW2 to PW4 testified as to this, and C herself said she raised the matter to PW2 because the incidents involving the accused “was just too much for me to handle”.[\[note: 124\]](#Ftn_124) It reinforced the overall impression that C was someone who decided what and how much she wanted to say, when to say and to whom as it suited her, in keeping with her consistently inconsistent accounts of the alleged incidents as narrated to the different witnesses, as further discussed below.

### Contemporaneous witnesses RN and RS contradicted C’s molest claims

159    Prosecution submitted that RN and RS provided corroboration of C’s claims as she confided in them about the accused’s conduct in the alleged first incident and also after the second and third incidents, and their observations of her demeanour in the immediate aftermath was consistent with C’s claims about what had happened.[\[note: 125\]](#Ftn_125)

160    However a scrutiny of the testimony of RN and RS did not bear this out. Not only did RN and RS not corroborate C’s claims of what the accused allegedly did, both the contemporaneous witnesses RN and RS materially contradicted C’s allegations that she had been molested.

#### RN said C only told her the accused tried to kiss her and touch her butt

161    I summarise C’s testimony about what she told RN after the alleged second incident of molest: after the accused molested her she went back to the link bridge and told RN what happened from the first incident and “in detail” about what happened at the lobby and how the accused behaved. C was tearing as she spoke to RN and RN was trying to cheer her up. She told RN she was shocked and disappointed with the accused. RN asked her why her uncle would do that to her and that was all RN said.[\[note: 126\]](#Ftn_126)

162    RN confirmed that C told her to wait at the link bridge while C she went alone to the lift lobby to meet the accused. The lift lobby was on the left side of the carpark just after the end of the link bridge and RN could not see inside the lift lobby.[\[note: 127\]](#Ftn_127)

163    RN testified that she waited 10 to 15 minutes at the link bridge. When C came back to the link bridge, _she looked normal and fine_ and did not give any reaction. It was only after they went downstairs to the seating area at the mall talking that RN noticed that C’s face was “sad and disappointed”. RN then asked C whether she was okay. C told her a “little bit” about her uncle, saying that _he had tried to kiss her and tried to touch her butt_. C did not tell her anything else. RN suggested that C talk to her parents but she refused, and C did not want to talk about the topic further. RN also suggested to C to talk to the police, but C did not want both options. After they walked around the mall and had their lunch C was normal and talking about normal stuff as she usually did.[\[note: 128\]](#Ftn_128) Prosecution did not suggest to RN that her recollection of what C had said to her about the molest or about her interactions with C was flawed or that RN could have recollected imprecisely.

164    RN gave a detailed and cogent account and I accepted her testimony about their interactions that day. While it was possible that C may not have recounted in detail to RN all that the accused had done to her, despite her testimony that she had told RN “in detail”, notably C did not even tell RN in generalised terms that the accused had touched her inappropriately in some manner, but only that he had “tried to” kiss her and touch her butt. This was not consistent with C’s testimony that besides trying to kiss her, the accused had wrapped his arms around her to hug her from the front and _then also grabbed her breast_.

165    As for butt-touching, C did not testify in court that the accused had touched her butt or attempted to do so during this second incident. The touching of C’s butt only surfaced in C’s testimony about the third incident. Although this was not suggested by prosecution to RN, even if RN could have possibly conflated what C told her about the first and second incidents, C herself did not testify that the first or second incidents involved any butt-touching, attempted or otherwise. The attempted butt-touching was something that could only have emanated from C to RN, whether it related to the second incident or the prior first incident, as there was nothing in evidence that C had spoken to RN about the third incident or that RN had otherwise somehow heard about C’s claims of butt-touching.

166    Notably also, C did not at all mention to RN that her breast had been touched or grabbed during this second incident. RN’s account that C did not allege that her breast had been intruded was not inconsistent with what C herself later narrated to PW6, as captured in the Child Guidance Clinic report. The report stated that C informed that the accused had hugged her and “tried” to kiss her but she pushed him away.[\[note: 129\]](#Ftn_129) Neither did C mention to her father there was any breast intrusion during this second incident. C’s father testified that C only told him that that the accused hugged her and kissed her cheek during this incident. There was no allegation made to her father that the accused had contacted her butt or her breast, or for that matter that he had even attempted to do so: at \[259\] below.

167    Neither did RN corroborate C’s claims that C was tearing when recounting the second incident to RN. Based on RN’s account, C was somewhat mercurial in her disposition that day. C appeared normal at the link bridge immediately after she returned from the lift lobby, but had later looked sad and disappointed when they were seated downstairs at the mall. But C was normal again after they had lunch.

168    In my view C was exaggerating her emotional state and claims about what she told RN about the second incident. RN neither corroborated what C claimed to have told her about the alleged molest nor the extent of C’s claimed distress. C had given varying versions of what the accused had allegedly done during this second incident not only to RN but also to other witnesses. Her allegations were that multiple acts of molest including the intrusion of her breast had taken place during this second incident, and these formed part of the charge particulars against the accused. Which parts of her body had been intruded and in particular whether her private parts had been intruded were material issues, and C’s inconsistencies on this could not categorised as matters of mere detail.

#### Gave shifting testimony about events relating to the second incident

169    Aside from the external inconsistencies, there was a shifting quality in C’s testimony about what happened that day.

170    She prevaricated in her evidence about what she told RN that day about the previous incident at the Orchid Country Club. During her EIC, C first said she “roughly told” RN about the first incident when they were on the way to The Verge. Then a short while later during her evidence-in-chief (“EIC”) she denied telling RN about the first incident but only told RN that her uncle gave her an allowance, and it was only after the accused had molested her at the lift lobby that she told RN from the first incident onwards about how her uncle behaved and how he touched her. However during her cross-examination, C then reverted to her first version claim that she did tell RN about what her uncle did to her during the first incident as they were getting closer to The Verge, but RN did not say anything to her but just followed her.[\[note: 130\]](#Ftn_130)

171    C also testified that she brought RN along as she felt safe to know RN was nearby and so that her uncle would not try to do anything funny.[\[note: 131\]](#Ftn_131) She also claimed she defied the accused’s demands to leave RN behind and brought RN up to the 5th level carpark with her, and she told the accused her friend was waiting outside the lift lobby.[^132] When asked during cross-examination why she then asked RN to wait for her at the link bridge where she knew RN was unable to see inside the lift lobby, C gave several different explanations.

172    During her EIC she said there was “no need” to bring RN with her to the lift lobby as it was going to be very fast. Under cross-examination, C then claimed she had “no idea my uncle had intentions”, which was inconsistent with her reason as to why she brought RN with her to collect the allowance in the first place. Then C changed tack and said it was because the accused initially asked her to meet at the carpark, and she did not know that she was going to meet him inside the carpark lift lobby until she saw him enter the carpark lift lobby.[\[note: 133\]](#Ftn_133) However until this point in her evidence when she was pressed about why she had left RN at the link bridge, C had repeatedly testified that the accused had told her to meet him at the 5th level car park lobby after she informed him she had arrived at The Verge.[^134]

173    C further claimed in cross-examination that after the accused molested her she told him that her friend was outside and warned him that if he were to touch her in that manner again she would scream for help. However in her EIC account she portrayed herself as meek after she was molested. She had testified that after the accused molested her, he passed her the allowance and told her not to tell anyone about the allowance. She just nodded her head and then left.[\[note: 135\]](#Ftn_135) She gave a contrasting account on her response to the molest: in one version she was the unprotesting victim who meekly acknowledged her molester’s instructions not to tell anyone about the allowance, and in the other she had boldly warned her uncle off about repeating his actions. Further, C’s claim that in both the first and second incidents, the accused had only specifically instructed her not to inform anyone about _the allowance_ after he molested her. This was curious and raised more issues about the credibility of her claims because if true, it would seem that the accused’s concern was not about whether C would tell anyone about the alleged molest committed against her, but that C should not tell anyone about the allowance that he had given her.

#### C told RS only that the accused had tried to get closer to her during the alleged third incident

174    RS had accompanied C to The Verge in the third incident. At the time of the trial he was 24 years old and studying at the polytechnic. He was about 19 years old and an ITE student at the time of the third incident at The Verge in 2017.

175    RS was introduced to C by RN. After RS started his NS in August 2017, he lost all contact with his friends including C. Although C’s mother said that RS was C’s boyfriend and RN said that C had a boyfriend at that time,[\[note: 136\]](#Ftn_136) neither C nor RS were directly asked whether they were in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship at that time. RS’s evidence which I accepted was that he would meet C about twice a week but not alone, and there would be other friends who would join them.[^137]

176    I summarise C’s account of what she claimed she told RS about the molest: after the accused tried to drag her into the lift the first time, she ran to RS. She told RS she did not know what her uncle was trying to do and when she asked him whether they were going down the accused did not reply. RS was just listening to her. C told RS she was scared and asked him to stand by closer to the lift lobby so that the accused would not try it again. Then she went back to see the accused alone. The accused again tried dragging her into the lift, and when he failed to do so he stepped out of the lift and molested her. She went back to RS and told him what happened. She was crying and told him the accused touched her butt and squeezed her breast. RS was consoling her and trying to cheer her up.[\[note: 138\]](#Ftn_138)

177    Apart from corroborating C’s claim that the accused had tried to pull her towards the lift, RS’s testimony did not support C’s claims that she had been molested by her uncle or that she had told RS that the accused had touched her butt and squeezed her breast.

178    RS had testified as follows: when C slow-jogged back to where he was at the link bridge after the first encounter, she told him her uncle had tried to pull her towards the lift. He then told C no need to collect the cash and to just leave. C was with him a while and thinking, then she told RS she would go back to “say bye and leave”. RS then followed C nearer to the lift lobby as he wanted to help her if anything happened. However he did not want to be directly in front of her uncle. He kept watch from a distance as he did not want to be involved in their money transaction. From where he was near a small pillar, he could see a person at the lift lobby but not his appearance or his face.[\[note: 139\]](#Ftn_139)

179    When C returned the second time to him she was “mood out”, looking down and her face was pale. C told him the accused was trying to pull her to the lift again and “he was trying to get closer to her”. RS told C this should be the last time and she should not collect money from the accused again. RS had also tried to probe C about what she meant by the uncle getting closer to her, but C just repeated that the accused was just trying to get closer to her. He observed that C wanted to tell him that the accused was misbehaving.[\[note: 140\]](#Ftn_140)

180    I found RS to have given a detailed, measured and considered account of what he had observed, and I accepted his evidence. He had partially corroborated C’s claims that she had told him that the accused had tried to drag her into the lift, but RS himself did not see the accused enter or what happened in the lift lobby.

181    RS did not corroborate C’s claims of molest. She did not tell RS that the accused had touched her butt and squeezed her breast as she had testified, or that the accused had hugged her. For that matter and despite C’s claims that she had given RS specific details of how she was molested, C did not even tell RS in generalised terms that she had been molested or that the accused had touched her inappropriately, even considering that she may not have wanted to share details of the molest with RS. This was despite RS making attempts to clarify with C what she meant by the accused trying to get closer to her. Prosecution did not seek to suggest to RS that he could have recollected imprecisely what C had said to him, or clarify RS’s recollection of the incident in any way.

182    I accepted both RN and RS as credible witnesses and gave weight to their testimony. Both were even able to recollect the phrases that C had used when conversing with them. At the highest, the only broad “corroboration” that the evidence of RN and RS could provide was that C wanted to be accompanied when she met the accused to collect pocket money and she had complained to them about the accused’s unwanted advances and attempted misbehaviour. However beyond that, the testimony of RN and RS contradicted C’s claims as to what the accused had supposedly done to her during these two incidents. Notably in both their accounts C had only complained to them that the accused had “tried” to do something to her, and she never said to them even in broad or general terms that the accused had touched her or actually committed inappropriate or unwanted acts on her, even if she did not wish to go into details of any molest with either of them. What C had told her friends in the immediate aftermath of these two alleged incidents was material and carried weight, as they were both contemporaneous witnesses. Their testimony cast further doubt on C’s credibility and her allegations, and reinforced the shifting nature of her claims about the alleged incidents.

#### Neither did C’s friends corroborate her claims about what she said about the prior incidents

183    Both the accounts of RN and RS as to what C said to them about the prior incidents were relevant but carried low probative value as corroborative evidence of the prior incidents. Not only were they complaints emanating from C herself, these incidents had occurred many weeks before C mentioned them to RN and RS in December 2016 and January 2017 respectively.

##### What C said to RN about the first incident

184    C gave a vacillating testimony about what she told RN about the first incident: see \[169\] to \[170\] preceding.

185    This contrasted with RN’s clear account which I accepted. RN said they had pre-arranged plans for lunch that day. C later told her she was going to collect her allowance from her uncle and asked RN to follow her. C told RN that she felt “uncomfortable”. When RN asked her whether she was okay, _C said her uncle was “trying to be a little funny”_ and RN testified these were the precise words that C used. C also said that her uncle was _“trying”_ to be very touchy, and _“trying”_ to kiss her and touch her butt.[\[note: 141\]](#Ftn_141) RN said she was shocked and asked C why she did not tell her parents but C said she did not want to do that. RN asked C to get help from her parents.[^142]

186    RN’s evidence did not corroborate C’s claims about the first incident or what C claimed to have told RN about it, even bearing in mind that C may not have recounted the details of the alleged molest to her. C’s testimony was that the accused had kissed her lips in the first incident, but RN said C told her the accused had only “tried to” kiss her. This echoed what C had told her own father about the first incident, that the accused had only _tried_ to kiss her and hug her during the first incident: at \[258\] below. RN further testified that C had mentioned that there was attempted butt-touching, whereas C herself testified that butt-touching only occurred in the third incident.

187    C had also recounted yet another version of the first incident as recorded in the Child Guidance Clinic report, where C narrated that her uncle had only hugged her and she had pushed him away, without any allegation that he had kissed her or even tried to kiss her.[\[note: 143\]](#Ftn_143) While C had given a plausible explanation that she did not feel comfortable about disclosing all the details of the incidents to PW6 and neither was the Child Guidance Clinic report intended to be a record of her allegations, C had also not mentioned to RN who was with her that day or her father who she said she could talk to about anything that the accused had actually kissed her, even though it was the most intrusive of all the alleged acts allegedly committed against her in the first incident.

##### What C said to RS about the prior incidents

188    C said that when she asked RS to follow her to collect money from the accused, RS asked her what happened. She told him what happened all the way from the first incident. She did not tell RS specifically in detail but roughly told RS that the accused was touching her in an inappropriate manner. RS asked whether her parents were aware and she told him it was hard to tell her parents about it.[\[note: 144\]](#Ftn_144)

189    RS did not corroborate these claims and I accepted his account. He said he clearly remembered that before going to The Verge, C told him that her uncle was _“looking at her in a wrong way”_ and she did not want to go alone to collect cash from her uncle. He said these were _the exact words used by C._ He told C “don’t collect the money from the uncle then”. C said she just wanted to collect the money and then leave. At that time RS did not think that anything would happen and he took it very lightly.

190    It was to be expected that a witness would not recount an incident in the same way each time and details could be left out in a recounting. However in this version told to RS, C was not even telling RS that the accused had attempted anything physical with her but only that he was eyeing her inappropriately. It was material whether the accused was eyeing her inappropriately, had attempted to behave inappropriately with her, or had indeed touched or molested her. Overall I found C to be a shifting witness and prone to embellishing her narrative. As a further instance, she had claimed to the school personnel on 1 February 2017 that she had suffered scratches in the third incident and then showed her form teacher faint marks on her arms.[\[note: 145\]](#Ftn_145) However it was no part of C’s testimony of the third incident that she had suffered any sort of injury during the two encounters, nor did RS who was with her that day testify that C had told or showed him any injury she had suffered, or that he himself had seen any injury on her.

191    Prosecution did not address the material discrepancies between C’s claims and the testimonies of RN and RS, but alluded to witness difficulty in recollecting specific details and the 3.5 to 4 years that had passed between the incidents and the trial. They cited human fallibility in retention and recollection of events, which is to be expected when evaluating the testimonies.[\[note: 146\]](#Ftn_146) However neither RN or RS told the court that they had difficulty recollecting what C had said to them about the alleged incidents and they could in fact even recall the particular phrases used by C in describing the accused’s behaviour, and in particular RS impressed as careful and particular as to what he testified, as he told the court that if it was something he could not recall clearly he would not say. Neither did prosecution seek to suggest to either of RN and RS that they could have recollected imprecisely as to what C had said to them.

### Collective weight of the available evidence

192    Where a complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s claims: _AOF_ at \[173\].

193    I had weighed all the available evidence collectively and they were in my view insufficient to make up the weaknesses in the prosecution’s case which hinged primarily on C’s testimony against the accused. I will now deal with the other available evidence below.

### C’s father gave selective and embellished testimony

#### General observations about C’s father

194    C’s father was a calm and taciturn witness. Father and daughter were close and C said she could speak to him about everything. C’s father had kept close tabs about her meetings with the accused and whether she had collected her allowance. C said she would tell her father before she went to meet the accused each time. Both testified that after she collected her allowance, he would always text to ask whether the meeting had taken place and whether the allowance had been collected. On several occasions, he would speak again to C on the same day about whether she had collected her allowance. For all three incidents, C said her father had asked her whether she had collected the allowance from the accused

195    As seen from his actions after the molest allegations surfaced, C’s father was someone who acted with deliberation and calculation rather than with spontaneity. He had been steadfast in his decision not to tell his wife about the allegations even after the police report had been made and his two sons were told. He took his time to deliberate whether to file a police report and to come up with a plan for his wife to be told about the allegations. He was also restrained about telling his wife about the accused giving C an allowance as the accused had requested of him, even though it was his wife who had initiated with the accused about helping C financially.

196    The meeting at The Verge with the accused was engineered by C’s father. When his wife asked him why the accused wanted to meet them, he told his wife he did not know. He had also decided that he would only break the news that a police report had already been filed to both the accused and his wife at The Verge meeting.[\[note: 147\]](#Ftn_147)

197    C’s father also appeared to have some ability to recount details, when it suited him. For example, neither C nor the accused could recall the date of the last incident in January 2017. C’s father was the only prosecution witness who testified that this incident took place on 21 January 2017. He said that he was working the night shift and had called C late evening and C told him she was at Suntec and had collected the allowance from the accused.[\[note: 148\]](#Ftn_148) He also testified in detail about what C had told him about the three incidents after the allegations surfaced - the location, sequence of events and what was said between the parties, even though these conversations with C about the alleged incidents took place in February 2017 some years prior to trial.[^149]

198    Having considered his testimony and the evidence as a whole, I did not find that C’s father had given a candid or complete account and I found him a manipulative witness. He had given a selective account, particularly as regards his interactions with the accused, and some of his actions had bordered on grey.

#### Tampered with phone records

199    C’s father’s testimony did not recount any substantive conversation between himself and the accused after the allegations surfaced, until the meeting at the Verge on 4 February 2017 where C’s mother was present.

200    I summarise C’s father’s account of his interactions with the accused after the allegations surfaced: on the evening of 1 February 2017 after he returned from the school, he sent a text to the accused asking whether he had misbehaved with C. The accused then called him on his handphone and his housephone but on both occasions C’s father did not wish to speak to the accused. The next morning 2 February 2017, the accused sent him two texts, and then a third text on 3 February 2017.[\[note: 150\]](#Ftn_150) C’s father said he did not reply to any of the accused’s texts and he did not speak to the accused except to ask him to go home when he found out that the accused was at the airport on the evening of 2 February 2017.

201    He said that on 3 February after he found out that the school had brought C to make a police report, he called the accused and asked him to set up a meeting with C’s mother. He met the accused at The Verge with C’s mother on 4 February, and then again some days later at Stagmont Park on 11 February after the accused returned from India. Subsequently C’s father sent a text to the accused’s second handphone on 13 February 2017. They met at Stagmont Park a second time after the accused went to see the IO.

##### Deleted his own texts to the accused

202    C’s father’s text of 1 February 2017 which he said he sent to the accused asking whether he had misbehaved with his daughter was already not among the texts when the first IO examined his handphone on 30 March 2017. The text that he sent to the accused on 13 February 2017,[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151) photographed by the first IO on 30 March 2017, was also been deleted by the time C’s father’s handphone was seized in January 2018. Notably his handphone did not contain any other texts which he himself had sent the accused.

203    C’s father claimed that he was in the habit of deleting his messages or he could have accidentally deleted his own messages.[\[note: 152\]](#Ftn_152) I did not find his explanation credible. He saw it fit to keep the three texts sent by the accused on 2 and 3 February 2017, and the deletion of both his own 1 February and 13 February texts to the accused could not be anything but deliberate and selective. C’s father was also one who acted with deliberation and calculatedness, and that aside, as a former policeman it would not have escaped him the importance of the preservation of texts relevant to the alleged incidents.

204    The deletion of most of his texts and call log information from his handphone was also deliberate and intentional, as apparent from the sparse information left on his handphone, before he eventually handed it over to the third IO.[\[note: 153\]](#Ftn_153)

##### Contents of his deleted 13 February 2017 text to the accused

205    This 13 February 2017 text was deleted from his handphone sometime after the first IO had examined and photographed the text and before the handphone was finally seized by the third IO.

206    Based on his account of the timeline of events, this text would have been sent by C’s father to the accused _after_ the meeting at The Verge on 4 February and also _after_ the first meeting at Stagmont Park.

207    C’s father sent this 13 February text to the accused on the 549 number instead of the 747 number which the accused had used to send him the three texts of 2 and 3 February. C’s father admitted that the 747 number was the one he usually used to communicate with the accused. His sending of this text to the 549 number instead was unlikely to be random as he claimed,[\[note: 154\]](#Ftn_154) just as his subsequent deletion of this 13 February text was deliberate.

208    The tone and contents of this text were somewhat anomalous with his claims that he was very angry with the accused at that time:

> Panir this msg for u

> Watever I hve to day I already spoke to u. Now its ur decision to say wat is da truth in ur statement. Go see da IO went she calls u.

> U must understand da affected party is my daughter. I hve to be truthful to her n stand by her side. My daughter is more impt to me than anyone or anything else. Infact I told ur sister wat u told me n she is very upset, angry and disappointed wat u hve said n done.

> U r n still will be a gd friend

209    C’s father gave a variety of reasons for sending this text to the accused. He said he was updating the accused that he had told his wife about what the accused said, that he was advising the accused to see the IO, and although he had lost his respect for the accused as a brother-in-law the accused was still a good friend.[\[note: 155\]](#Ftn_155) In cross-examination he recanted his explanations and said he did not know why he sent the text to the accused.[^156]

210    The tone of the text was factual and polite. Not only did C’s father feel need to explain why he “hve to” stand by his daughter’s side, the text ended with C’s father affirming the accused as “still” a good friend. At this point of time, it appeared that C’s father was still the accused’s loyal friend, despite what had transpired between the parties at The Verge on 4 February and at Stagmont Park at 11 February 2017.

211    The contents of the text also raised questions as to what else did C’s father have to tell C’s mother about what the accused told him personally, which made C’s mother very upset and angry, aside from what had been said by the accused to both of them at The Verge and Stagmont Park meetings. C’s father’s testimony was that he did not have any substantive conversations with the accused about the allegations, nor did he meet the accused face to face except for the 4 February and 11 February meetings where C’s mother was present. However in this text he was alluding to some exchange that he had with the accused to which C’s mother was not privy.

#### Redacted and selective account of his interactions with the accused

212    The distinct impression was that C’s father was giving a redacted version of what had transpired between him and the accused in the aftermath of the allegations surfacing, and I treated his account of his interactions with the accused with caution.

213    C’s father had kept only texts where the accused was apologising and pleading for help. Looking at the timing and contents of the three texts from the accused on 2 and 3 February 2017, it appeared likely that there were other texts and calls between C’s father and the accused in between. There was a four-hour gap between the first text sent by the accused at 8am on 2 February, and the second text he sent at 1210pm started with “Yes…I had made a stupid mistake…” which suggested some exchange had taken place between them and the accused was acknowledging his mistake in response to something said between them, despite C’s father’s denials of contact during this period.

214    It was also highly unlikely that no substantive exchange about the allegations had taken place between the accused and himself until three days later during the 4 February meeting at The Verge with C’s mother. In fact, C testified that after her father spoke briefly to her at home on 1 February, he spoke to her again later that same day after she woke up and told her that he had already spoken to the accused on the telephone and confronted him.[\[note: 157\]](#Ftn_157) This was inconsistent with her father’s claims that when the accused called him he hung up as he was not in the right frame of mind to speak to the accused.

#### Not a candid witness

##### Made claims contradicted by the school personnel

215    C’s father also made various claims that were directly contradicted by the school personnel, which added to his overall lack of credibility.

216    As to why he did not make the police report within the 24-hour deadline given by the school, C maintained that he had asked the school to give him more time. C’s father gave several reasons for this, the predominant being that he wanted to meet the accused face to face and to confront him.[\[note: 158\]](#Ftn_158) Under cross-examination he claimed it was also because he wanted the family members to know the accused had molested C.[^159]

217    The looming 24-hour deadline for filing the police report would have expired in the late afternoon of 2 February 2017. If meeting up with the accused before deciding to file the police report was a matter of urgency and importance to C’s father, he had time and opportunity to do so from the evening of 1 February. The evidence showed that he could act promptly when he wanted to, for example he went to see the school the same afternoon on 1 February when they contacted him and he also promptly took leave when he found that C had been taken to the police station on 3 February 2017.[\[note: 160\]](#Ftn_160)

218    He further claimed that on 1 February 2017 he was not told by the school about how many incidents had occurred and he was only aware about the third incident at The Verge.[\[note: 161\]](#Ftn_161) When he texted the accused on the evening of 1 February 2017 and also at the time of the 4 February Verge meeting, he only had this incident in mind. He only found out about the other incidents from C sometime between 4 to 11 February before she went to give further police statements.

219    However the evidence of C’s form teacher directly contradicted his claims that he did not file the police report within 24 hours because he wanted to see the accused first and needed more time.[\[note: 162\]](#Ftn_162)

220    C’s form teacher testified that C’s father had already texted her at about 6pm on 2 February 2017 to say that he had already spoken to the accused who “admitted the deed” and he had in fact decided not to make a police report,[\[note: 163\]](#Ftn_163) contradicting C’s father’s narrative that he had asked the school for more time.[^164] These texts passing between C’s form teacher and C’s father were also not found in his seized handphone.

221    As for what had been informed by the school to C’s father about the alleged incidents, C’s form teacher testified that on 1 February 2017 she had also spoken to C who told her about three alleged incidents. PW4 also testified that C had also told her about three alleged incidents although she could not recall the details.[\[note: 165\]](#Ftn_165) C’s form teacher also testified that later that afternoon she was present when the school informed C’s father of all three alleged incidents when they had the face-to-face session with him.

222    From the evidence it was clear that by the afternoon of 1 February 2017 the school personnel were already aware of C’s complaints about three alleged incidents. C’s father’s claim that the school had only selectively told him about the third incident was not credible, and he was also directly contradicted by C’s form teacher on this.

223    As for C’s father’s reaction on finding out that the school had brought C to file a police report, he was variously described by the witnesses as angry or unhappy. C’s father claimed he was unhappy the school had brought C to the police station without first informing her parents. This was a curious explanation, as he had already texted C’s form teacher to say he would not be filing the police report and had already been told that the school would file the police report if he did not.

Claims about the accused’s exit from the airport on 2 February 2017

224    C’s father said that on the evening of 2 February the accused detoured back out of the airport after he called the accused and told him to return home. He said the accused was afraid of being called up by the police. This was disputed by the accused who said that his wife had called him to say his mother was ill.

225    Checking in for a flight and then exiting the airport the same night without boarding was an unusual occurrence and considering its proximity in time to the surfacing of the allegations the day before, C’s father’s claim that the accused was attempting to leave the country as he was afraid to be called up by the police was not implausible.

226    However these claims had to viewed against the factual matrix at that point of time. This 2 February airport episode took place before the police report was filed. Further according to C’s father, up to that point he had only texted the accused whether he had misbehaved with C and they had not spoken about the allegations nor met up, and there was nothing in C’s father’s testimony that he had mentioned any police involvement to the accused. C’s father further claimed that he had received a call from an immigration officer at the airport that evening to verify the accused’s particulars and to confirm that he was the accused’s brother-in-law.[\[note: 166\]](#Ftn_166) It was most puzzling that an immigration officer would indeed resort to calling C’s father an unknown stranger to assist in establishing the accused’s identity. In my view C’s father’s account of this episode should be treated cautiously and it was unsafe to find that the accused was running away as C’s father claimed.

### Text messages of limited corroborative value as regards C’s molest claims

#### Satisfied that the accused used both handphone numbers 747 and 549 at the relevant time

227    I was satisfied that the accused was using the two handphones at the relevant time[\[note: 167\]](#Ftn_167) and the three texts had been sent by the accused from the 747 number. I rejected the accused’s claims that he did not send these texts and that he did not have his own handphone.[^168]

228    Not only was the 747 line registered to the accused, his claim that his employee Kumar was using the 747 number was far-fetched. Why would Kumar a stranger suddenly be apologising to C’s father about his daughter, coincidentally at a time when the molest allegations had just been surfaced?

229    The 549 number was registered to the accused’s wife,[\[note: 169\]](#Ftn_169) but the accused himself had stated it to be his contact number in his 3 March 2017 police statement to the IO.[^170] I was satisfied that C’s father had sent his 13 February text to the accused to this 547 number intending the message to be seen by the accused.

#### Contents of the accused’s three texts

230    Collectively and in summary, in these three texts the accused had pleaded for help and asked for forgiveness, apologised to C and her father, admitted “a stupid mistake” and “real real mistake”, and promised that he would change and it would not happen again. It could be inferred that something had happened between the accused and C, for which he was sorry and for which he wanted help from C’s father.

231    Save for C’s father’s testimony that he had texted the accused to ask if he had misbehaved with his daughter, these three texts were devoid of context of what had passed between the accused and C’s father. Neither did the contents of the three texts mention what acts the accused had committed, refer to any particular incident or when the acts occurred, or contain any information referable to any or all of the three incidents.

232    They were of little value in corroborating C’s account of the multiple acts of molest allegedly committed by the accused against her on several occasions. At the highest and based on C’s father’s testimony that he had asked the accused whether he had misbehaved with C, the inference that could be drawn was that the accused was admitting to misbehaving with C. However not only were the texts non-specific in nature, an admission of misbehaviour was not an admission of criminal wrongdoing. In the context of the uncle and niece relationship, any inappropriate physical contact or advances even if made with C’s consent would be improper and constitute misbehaviour.

### Admission of touching made to C’s parents

233    Both C’s parents testified that there was a meeting on 4 February with the accused at The Verge. Bearing in mind that although both were interested witnesses who had time and opportunity to discuss the events, I accepted their evidence that such a meeting took place at The Verge, and rejected the accused’s denial.

234    C’s mother said this was when she first found out about the allegations and she gave a cogent and textured account of her repeated and re-buffed attempts thereafter to engage C at home about the allegations after this meeting. C’s parents gave broadly consistent accounts about how and why the meeting was initiated, including the accused’s reactions upon hearing that a police report had been made and his plans to leave immediately for India to speak to his brother-in-law Duraisamy. This tied in with the accused’s travel records that he left Singapore the same afternoon on 4 February.

#### Accounts diverged on the accused’s admissions

235    I gave allowance for the differences in recounting the details of this incident. On the material issue of what specific admissions the accused made and how they were made, their accounts diverged.

236    C’s father said that the accused grabbed both his wife’s legs, said he was sorry and asked for forgiveness. The accused said “_I’ve touched \[C\]_” and C’s father then prompted the accused to be specific about what he did. The accused then said _“I hold her, uh, I kissed her and I touched her breast_”.[\[note: 171\]](#Ftn_171)

237    C’s mother said the accused was crying and fell at her feet but she moved away and did not allow him to touch her feet. The accused then raised his palms pleading for forgiveness and said “_I have made a mistake_”. He then said “_I have touched \[C\]_”. Her husband then spoke in a stern tone to the accused and asked him to tell his sister what happened. The accused repeated _he had had touched C and then raised his hand and placed it on his chest_.[\[note: 172\]](#Ftn_172)

238    I accepted their testimony that the accused made a general admission that he had touched C. Both parties testified as to this. C’s mother’s testimony had texturing and a ring of truth. She said she did not immediately understand as she thought the accused meant that he had slapped or hit C, as the accused was someone she trusted to advise C.

239    However whether the accused had actually gone beyond making this general admission about touching C was doubtful. C’s father claimed that the accused not only verbally admitted to touching C’s breast, but also to holding her and kissing her. However C’s mother said the accused only verbalised again a general admission that he had touched C and _then made a gesture_ of placing his hand on his chest. It was only after C’s mother was prompted by prosecution’s question as to whether the accused said anything about which part of C’s body he touched that she then also alleged that the accused verbalised that he touched C’s breast, adding “_and that was all he said_”.[\[note: 173\]](#Ftn_173)

240    I did not accept C’s father’s testimony about what the accused said, which conveniently composited all the multiple acts of molest that C alleged against the accused. It was also inconsistent with C’s mother’s testimony, which was only made after prompting, that the accused only verbalised that he had touched C’s breast. Their accounts had also echoed each other as to how the accused had to be prompted by C’s father before elaborating on his initial admission about touching C. In view of the divergence in their accounts, it was unsafe to find that the accused had admitted to touching C on her breast.

241    In any event, even if the accused had gone as far as admitting that he had touched C’s breast, this admission without reference to any specific incident was of nebulous corroborative value, as C claimed that both the second and third incidents involved the accused grabbing and squeezing her breast respectively. There was nothing said during this meeting as to when and where this touching had occurred, or how many times it happened. It would be entirely speculative that the accused was indeed admitting that he had contacted C’s breast on both occasions, or if he was referring to only one of the incidents, then which one. Moreover even if the accused had indeed said and\\or gestured to C’s parents that he had touched C’s breast, it would be over-reaching to construe this as an admission of criminal wrongdoing by the accused. Any such contact between uncle and niece of this nature would have been inappropriate and improper, even if C had been complicit and had not objected to his physical advances.

### No admissions made at the Stagmont Park meetings

#### Evidence of the parties

242    It was not disputed that two Stagmont Park meetings did take place and the five persons who were present, but it was disputed when these meetings had taken place. C’s father said the first meeting took place on 11 February upon the accused’s return from India, and the second meeting after the accused had gone to see the IO.[\[note: 174\]](#Ftn_174) The accused gave a later time frame for these meetings, testifying that both meetings took place after he had gone to see the IO.[^175] If this was true, these two meetings would have taken place after 3 March 2017 when his first statement was taken. The parties also disputed who had initiated these meetings.

243    I summarise C’s parents’ testimony: both testified that at the first meeting the accused pleaded with them to withdraw the case but they refused. C’s mother further testified that she asked her mother whether she knew what the accused had done. She told her mother “he had touched my daughter” and her mother responded what is wrong with that as the accused was the uncle.

244    Both also testified that at the second meeting the accused told them he had given a statement to the police and again pleaded with them to withdraw the case and asked for help. Again they refused. The accused asked to speak to C and they refused. C’s mother said her mother asked why did they send their daughter to go and collect money from the accused. C’s father said the accused’s mother had used a “very unhealthy word” on his daughter and he then walked some distance away while the family continued to converse. The accused later walked up to him, and when they were alone the accused said he didn’t know what happened that day that he behaved to C like that.[\[note: 176\]](#Ftn_176)

245    The accused’s version was that both meetings involved C’s mother speaking directly to their mother asking whether the accused would settle C’s father’s bankruptcy debts, for which she would try to withdraw the police case against him.[\[note: 177\]](#Ftn_177)

#### C’s parents gave a more cogent account

246    I accepted the testimony of C’s parents that the two meetings were initiated by the accused and his main purpose was to ask them to withdraw the case. Their accounts were more cogent compared with the accused’s.

247    I rejected the accused’s claims that C’s parents had called for the meetings to press him to settle their bankruptcy debts in exchange for withdrawing the case, and that C’s parents had some plan or motive against him.[\[note: 178\]](#Ftn_178) It was highly unlikely that C’s family would frame the accused with false allegations to pressure the accused to settle the bankruptcy debts. Whilst it was true that C’s father had substantial bankruptcy debts at that time, the relationship between the parties was close and the accused had been helping them financially over the years. The accused himself also said that he would have helped them with the debts if they had asked.[^179] C’s father had also been reluctant about filing any police report. In any event, any false allegations would require C’s assistance, and the accused categorically said that C was not involved in any such plans and his allegations were directed only at C’s parents.[^180]

248    As for C’s parents possibly taking the opportunity to link the settlement of the bankruptcy debts to the withdrawal of the case after the allegations arose, I also found this unlikely. C’s father said that as a former policeman he knew it was not easy to withdraw a case like that and of the consequences of interfering with police investigations.[\[note: 181\]](#Ftn_181)

#### No admission of wrongdoing

249    Whilst the accused had asked C’s parents to help him by withdrawing the police case, it was no part of their evidence that the accused had made any express or tacit admissions of wrongdoing at this meeting. C’s father said that the accused was scared that he would be charged and convicted[\[note: 182\]](#Ftn_182). However pressing someone to withdraw a case under investigation and being fearful of the outcome of investigations and court proceedings could not be of any weighty probative value of guilt.

250    Neither was there anything raised during these meetings about C’s allegations apart from C’s mother telling her own mother at the first meeting that the accused had “touched” her daughter. However C’s mother did not say how this touch occurred or where C was touched, and aside from her mother’s retort, there was nothing in evidence about how the accused had responded to her claim.

251    As for C’s father’s claim that the accused told him at the second meeting when they were alone, C’s father’s account was uncorroborated and having regard to his general lack of credibility especially on matters relating to his interactions with the accused, it was unsafe to find that this conversation did indeed take place. In any event, even if such an exchange had taken place, the accused was making a non-specific reference to something he did “_that day_”, and appeared to be referencing a single episode. Likewise C’s mother had testified that at The Verge meeting the accused was asking for forgiveness and admitted that “I have made _a_ mistake”. The accused’s text messages of 2 February 2017 had also referred to “Tis is _the first and last_…” and “ I had made _a_ stupid mistake”, which were not inconsistent with the accused referencing a single episode that occurred “_that day_” which he regretted, contrary to C’s allegations that she had been molested on several occasions.

### Repetition of allegations and circumstantial evidence

#### Repetition of complaints

252    In _AOF_, the court noted that a “liberal” rather than a strict approach in the _Baskerville_ sense is taken towards corroborative evidence. The court looks to the substance and relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate.

253    However the court also noted that the liberal approach to corroboration was subject to certain “inherent conceptual constraints”. Under section 159 of the Evidence Act former statements may corroborate later testimony as to the same fact only if the former statements were made “at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact”. The failure to meet the strict standards of _Baskerville_ corroboration does not rule out the relevance of such evidence but the deficiency is likely to adversely affect the weight that the court may accord to it: _AOF_ at \[173\], \[175\] to \[177\].

254    In this case, the version of C’s allegations of the three alleged incidents most similar to what she had testified had first surfaced on 1 February 2017 to the school personnel, shortly before the police report was filed. I noted that C’s form teacher was able to recount with some detail what C had said to her about the incidents, and they were similar to the claims that C made in court. PW2 and PW4 were only able to recall broad-brush accounts of what C said about these incidents. After C was taken to the police station on 3 February 2017, she had over the course of several conversations with her father and mother separately spoken of the alleged incidents, speaking first to her father, and at a later time, to her mother.

255    Prosecution submitted that C’s recounting of the alleged incidents to her parents and the school personnel provided corroboration of her claims.[\[note: 183\]](#Ftn_183) What C said to the school personnel and to her parents about the alleged incidents was relevant but could only carry limited probative value, considering the lengthy period that had passed between the alleged events and when she first surfaced her complaints to them. The first two alleged incidents occurred in November and December 2016, and some months had already passed before C surfaced them on 1 February to the school personnel. As for the third incident, if it had indeed occurred on 21 January 2017, ten days had already passed before she first spoke of them to the school personnel. As C’s account of the allegations told to her parents, this was at an even later point of time, after she had already crystallised her complaints against the accused to the police.

256    These were subsequent repeated complaints emanating from a complainant who lacked credibility. As _AOF_ noted, subsequent repeated complaints by a complainant cannot in and of themselves constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for unusually convincing testimony: at \[114a\].

257    In any event and notably, C’s father the person to whom C said she could speak freely to about everything, did not corroborate C’s testimony of her allegations against the accused. C’s father testified that he spoke to C about the incidents between the 4th and 11th of February, which was shortly after the FIR was made on 3 February. Prosecution did not seek to clarify or suggest to C’s father whether he could have recollected imprecisely what C had told him about the incidents, and I accepted his testimony about what C said to him.

258    As regards the first incident, C told her father that she was sitting outside at the reception table when the accused approached her and asked her to meet him near the toilet which was some distance from the function hall, and he “kind of try to, you know, uh, hugged her and tried to kiss her”. In this account not only did the location of the molest and where C was when she was approached by the accused about the pocket money differ from C’s court testimony, C had told her father that the accused had only _tried_ to hug and kiss her. This version told to her father was about the accused _trying_ to make physical advances echoed the testimony of RN as to what C said to her about the first incident. RN had testified that C said the accused was _trying_ to be funny and _trying_ to kiss her and touch her butt. Whether the accused had tried to make advances towards C or whether he had actually committed the said acts of molest against C was material.

259    As regards the second incident, C told him that her uncle held her and kissed her _on the cheek_, saying that he was her uncle and it was okay for him to kiss her. However this again materially differed from C’s allegations that in this second incident the accused had hugged her, _tried to kiss her_ and then grabbed her breast. In this version to her father, C claimed to have been kissed on her cheek specifically, whereas C testified in court that the accused had _tried_ to kiss her but she had dodged him by moving her face away. Neither did C tell her father that her breasts had been intruded. Again this echoed what RN testified, that C said the accused had only _tried_ to kiss her and touch her butt, with no mention that her breasts had been intruded.

260    As for the third incident, C told her father the accused pulled her _inside_ the lift_, kissed and touched her breast_. She then went back a second time after the accused called her. She asked the accused what he was trying to do and he said he was her uncle and who else will take care of her. He then passed C the money and told her not to tell anyone what happened including her father. In this version to her father, the molest took place during the _first_ encounter and _inside_ the lift and when C went back the second time it was to collect money. This was materially different from C’s testimony that the molest took place at the lift lobby during the second encounter, and did not involve the accused kissing her but he had touched her butt besides squeezing her breast. Neither did C nor RS testify that C had gone back to the lift lobby a second time because the accused had called her to go back.

#### C’s demeanour and emotional state

261    Prosecution submitted that the various witness accounts of C’s demeanour and her distressed behaviour were consistent with her claims of molest and how the molest had impacted her.[\[note: 184\]](#Ftn_184)

262    I accepted the evidence of RN and RS that they had respectively observed that C looked sad and disappointed and “mood out” and pale after she met the accused, and that C had told them she wanted them to accompany her to collect her allowance from her uncle. I also accepted the evidence of the school personnel and C’s parents that they had observed C to be distressed and not herself in the period after she surfaced the allegations and that C had lost weight, looked dishevelled and had cut herself.

263    These matters would at best be weak circumstantial evidence consistent with the claims that she made, but lent little weight to corroborate her litany of allegations against the accused. In the circumstances of this case, the distress could stem from reasons other than being molested by the accused. To put it plainly, C could have been distressed even if she had been complicit with the accused’s physical advances but felt conflicted with her own actions. Aside from C’s own testimony about the accused expressly propositioning her and her self-knowledge that the accused had intentions, C’s mother had testified that C told her that “_always_ before she takes the money, the uncle will tell her to sayang him.[\[note: 185\]](#Ftn_185) Further C herself had also made contemporaneous claims in the FIR about being molested by a second subject and that molest had been committed against her over a lengthy eight-year period.

264    As for C asking her friends RN and RS to accompany her to The Verge, both testified that this was in the context of pre-arranged social outings and C had thereafter told them she wanted to collect the allowance from her uncle. At the highest this could only be evidence consistent with C’s claims that she wanted her friends to accompany her to feel safe and to deter the accused from molesting her, but was weak circumstantial evidence of C’s claims that molest had been committed against her.

#### C’s apparent lack of motive

265    Prosecution submitted that C had no motive to make up allegations against the accused and prosecution’s burden to disprove the existence of motive did not arise in this case.[\[note: 186\]](#Ftn_186)

266    I agreed that the burden to disprove motive did not arise, and prosecution did not bear the burden of proving that C did not have a motive to falsely implicate the accused. The accused himself had testified that it was a mystery to him why C had made the allegations and that C was not part of any plot by her parents to pressure him.

267    From the accounts, the accused and C had a physically affectionate relationship. This notwithstanding, it was clear from the contents of the accused’s texts and his admission to C’s parents about touching C that some improper and inappropriate conduct beyond the proper bounds of physical contact between uncle and niece had taken place between them. C had told her form teacher she felt dirty taking the money and connected whatever had happened between them with the money she had taken from the accused.[\[note: 187\]](#Ftn_187) However it was not necessary to make any finding on or attribute motive to C for the court to reach its decision. Any apparent lack of motive did not mitigate prosecution’s threshold burden of proving their case beyond reasonable doubt nor could it adequately supply the credibility gaps in C’s testimony.

## Decision – Acquitted

268    C had alleged multiple acts committed by the accused against her without her consent, and that several incidents of molest had taken place. The legal and evidential burden to prove that the accused had indeed committed all the said acts in the manner described in each of the four charges, and that they were committed with the requisite _mens rea_ on each occasion lay with prosecution.

269    As regards the accused, I agreed with prosecution that he had made self-serving claims, gave inconsistent evidence and told deliberate lies to distance himself from the texts he had sent the accused’s father and the meeting with C’s parents at The Verge, where he had made admissions of inappropriate conduct and apologised. However the accused cannot be convicted because he has told lies and admitted to misbehaving with his niece. As the court _in PP v Chee Cheong Hin Constance_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 24</span> observed at \[92\], lies may be told in a misguided attempt to support or embellish an explanation or to deflect blame, or to minimise embarrassment or conceal some other behaviour, and the telling of lies cannot invariably be equated with guilt. As for his other acts such attributing improper motive to C’s parents, leaving for India upon learning that a police report had been filed and pressing C’s parents to withdraw the case, they were circumstantial evidence of weak probative value, and even collectively weighing them with his admissions, lies and inconsistencies and the other prosecution evidence, could not discharge prosecution’s threshold burden.

270    Prosecution’s case turned primarily on the credibility of C and whether she was truthful about the multiple allegations she had made against the accused. I did not find C to be a credible witness, and she had reconstructed a dubious account replete with embellishment, inconsistencies, rationalisation, confabulation, implausibility and outright lies. She had also sought to minimise her motivations and portray herself as an unwilling victim reluctant to collect the pocket-money, which was contradicted by multiple witnesses who testified as to her eagerness for the monies despite being repeatedly advised not to see the accused after she complained about him. I did not find her evidence unusually convincing, and any conviction would be unsafe unless there was some corroborative evidence to support her multiple allegations. In this case the collective weight of the other available evidence could not make up the substantial weaknesses in the prosecution case. The court was not only left in reasonable but quite substantial doubt about what had happened between C and the accused when they were alone, whether the accused had committed the multiple alleged acts against C in the several incidents, and if some improper physical advances had taken place whether C had compromised herself and consented to them.

271    As prosecution had failed to discharge their burden beyond a reasonable doubt on both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ elements of the offences, I acquitted the accused of the charges.
