Criminal Law – Sentencing – Reformative training

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9102/2022/01.\]

6 June 2022

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Ms Nur Syafiqah Binte Mohamad Awal (“**Syafiqah**”), 20 years of age, was involved in various arrangements in which she handed control of bank accounts in her name to other persons, most of whom were unknown to her. These bank accounts were then used to receive various sums of money, which were benefits of criminal conduct. She thus facilitated the control by these other persons of the benefits of criminal conduct. These offences occurred between December 2020 and May 2021. Her younger sister, Nur Atiqah Binte Mohamad Awal (“**Atiqah**”), was involved in similar offences. (Atiqah is the appellant in the related appeal, MA 9101-2022-01.)

2       Syafiqah faced a total of ten charges under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A (“**CDSA**”). On 8 March 2022, she pleaded guilty and was convicted on five charges. The remaining five charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Pre-sentence reports were called to assess her suitability for probation and reformative training. She was unresponsive to the probation officer, and probation was not a suitable sentencing option. She was found suitable to undergo reformative training.

3       On 24 May 2022, she was sentenced to undergo reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 12 months. She filed the present appeal against the sentence on 27 May 2022.

4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

5       Syafiqah pleaded guilty to five charges under s 44(1)(a) and punishable under s 44(5)(a) of the CDSA. The charges were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the _period_ of the offence, the _person(s)_ assisted, the _bank account_ and the _amount_ involved:

> You \[…\] are charged that you, _\[period\]_, in Singapore, were concerned in an arrangement with one _\[person(s)\]_, having reasonable grounds to believe that by this arrangement, the control by _\[person(s)\]_ of his \[their\] benefits of criminal conduct was facilitated, and having reasonable grounds to believe that _\[person(s)\]_ is a person who has engaged \[are persons who have engaged\] in criminal conduct, to wit, you gave control of your _\[bank account\]_ to _\[person(s)\]_, which bank account was then used to receive sums amounting to _\[amount\]_, which sum was the benefits of criminal conduct, namely, offences of cheating under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), of _\[person(s)\]_, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 44(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) punishable under Section 44(5)(a) of the same.

7       Section 44(1)(a) of the CDSA provides:

> \[A\] person who enters into or is otherwise concerned in an arrangement, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that, by the arrangement – (a) the retention or control by or on behalf of another \[…\] of that other person’s benefits from criminal conduct is facilitated (whether by concealment, removal from jurisdiction, transfer to nominees or otherwise) \[…\] and knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that that other person is a person who engages in or has engaged in criminal conduct or has benefited from criminal conduct shall be guilty of an offence.

8       The offence is punishable under s 44(5) of the CDSA:

> Any person who commits an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction – (a) if the person is an individual, to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both\[.\]

### Facts

9       These were the salient facts.

#### Background

10     From November to December 2020, Syafiqah’s mother, Siti Aidah Binte Abdullah (“**Siti**”), became acquainted with unknown individuals known only as “Raymond” and “Kelvin” on an online dating mobile application. These individuals then asked Siti to open bank accounts in her name and to send the linked debit cards to them. As Siti was unaware how to do so, she sought help from her daughter Syafiqah, who complied.

11     Subsequently, Syafiqah began communicating directly with “Raymond” and “Kelvin”. Syafiqah did the following in exchange for payment: (a) relinquishing already-opened bank accounts to them; (b) creating new bank accounts and relinquishing control to them; (c) performing transactions through bank accounts in her control on their instructions; and (d) applying for and sending debit cards to addresses in Malaysia on their instructions.

12     She had reasonable grounds to believe that these bank accounts were being used for the facilitation of benefits from criminal conduct. She knew that her actions were illicit but continued to do so anyway as she received payment for doing so.

13     Meanwhile, from December 2020 to May 2021, the police received reports from multiple victims reporting that they had lost money in a scam. This would generally occur in one of two ways:

> (a)     They would meet an unknown individual on an online dating platform, form a relationship with this person, and subsequently be instructed to transfer large sums of money for various issues cited by the unknown individual.

> (b)     They would come across various job offers on social media platforms or receive these offers by SMS. When they responded to these offers, they were instructed to buy items from online marketplaces on the basis that they would be refunded the full amount with commission.

Subsequently, being deceived by these scams, the victims would transfer money. The money would be transferred to one of Syafiqah’s bank accounts.

#### December 2020

14     Pursuant to her arrangement with “Raymond”, on 10 December 2020 Syafiqah used DBS’s iBanking services to open two bank accounts online: (a) DBS XXX26-0 (“**DBS 260**”); and (b) DBS XXX24-3 (“**DBS 243**”).

15     For DBS 260, Syafiqah performed bank transfers on the instructions of “Raymond”. In total, benefits of criminal conduct of at least S$343,960 were transacted through the account. (DAC-903433-2022)

16     For DBS 243, she relinquished control of the account to “Raymond”. In addition, using DBS’s Video Teller Machines, she successfully applied for four debit cards and had the cards delivered to an address in Malaysia provided by “Raymond” using FedEx’s delivery service. She received S$250 for her actions with regard to this account. In total, benefits of criminal conduct of at least S$173,431 were transacted through the account. (DAC-903434-2022)

17     Further, using DBS 243 and DBS 260, Syafiqah dishonestly retained monies of about S$200,000, which did not belong to her, with the intent of spending the sum on her personal expenses. She withdrew S$9,000 from this sum, which she spent on various items such as clothing and staycations, before the accounts were frozen by the bank.

#### January to February 2021

18     On 23 January 2021, Syafiqah used OCBC’s online banking services to open an OCBC bank account bearing account number XXX-001. Subsequently, sometime in February 2021, she provided her iBanking credentials to “Raymond” and sent the associated debit card to an address in Malaysia provided by “Raymond”. She received S$200 for her actions with regard to this account. In total, benefits of criminal conduct of at least S$10,000 were transacted through the account. (DAC-903438-2022)

#### May 2021

19     In May 2021, Syafiqah used UOB’s online banking services to open a UOB bank account bearing account number XXX95-7. Subsequently, she provided her iBanking credentials to “Raymond” and/or “Kelvin” and sent the associated debit card to an address in Malaysia provided by “Raymond” and/or “Kelvin”. She received S$200 for her actions with regard to this account. In total, benefits of criminal conduct of at least S$113,193 were transacted through the account. (DAC-903440-2022)

#### May 2021

20     Sometime in May 2021, Syafiqah was no longer able to work for “Raymond” and “Kelvin” as she had dishonestly retained their proceeds from criminal conduct in multiple DBS bank accounts for her own personal expenditure.

21     She was then introduced by a friend to one Mohamed Yusri Bin Arepen, whom she knew as “Eddy”. She then entered into an arrangement with “Eddy” and persons unknown, having reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, the control of benefits from criminal conduct of “Eddy” and persons unknown would be facilitated, and having reasonable grounds to believe that “Eddy” and persons unknown were engaged in criminal conduct.

22     On 3 May 2021, she proceeded to the UOB Branch located in Hougang Mall and opened a UOB bank account bearing account number XXX78-6. On the same day, she provided her iBanking credentials to “Eddy”, and handed to him the debit card associated to her account in person. The debit card and iBanking credentials associated with the account created was subsequently handed over by “Eddy” to another person. Syafiqah received S$300 for her actions with regard to this account. In total, benefits of criminal conduct of at least S$111,458.80 were transacted through the account. (DAC-903441-2022)

#### Conclusion

23     Syafiqah profited S$2,050 in total from her various arrangements to facilitate the benefits of criminal conduct. She also dishonestly retained monies of about S$200,000 in multiple DBS accounts with the intent of spending the sum on her personal expenses (above, at \[17\]). She spent S$9,000 from this sum before the accounts were frozen.

## Sentencing

### Charges taken into consideration

24     Syafiqah admitted to five other similar offences, which were taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The salient details of these TIC offences were as follows:

### Calling of pre-sentence reports

25     In a brief oral submission, the prosecution urged the court to call for pre-sentence reports for probation and reformative training. Syafiqah did not mitigate.

26     In my judgment, considering that Syafiqah was a young offender with no prior convictions, the dominant sentencing consideration was rehabilitation. Her offences, however, were serious. She had, in effect, facilitated acts of money-laundering by persons unknown to her. She did so for personal, financial gain despite being aware that the transactions were illicit. Such conduct had to deterred. Given her young age, I considered both probation and reformative training to be relevant sentencing options for her rehabilitation. Accordingly, I called for pre-sentence reports both for probation and for reformative training.

### Probation not a viable sentencing option

27     As it transpired, probation was not a viable sentencing option. The probation officer (PO) was unable to prepare a probation report for Syafiqah as she and her family failed to cooperate during social investigations by the probation officer. The following was reported by the probation officer in an ITC (Information to Court) dated 18 May 2022:

> 3.2    PO managed to have a 1st session with her and her mother on 6 Apr 2022 and a 2nd session with her on 20 Apr 2022. However she failed to leave daily voicemail instructions as instructed by PO on 6 Apr 2022. Syafiqah subsequently failed to respond to PO’s calls and texts since 5 May 2022. PO scheduled another session with her on 11 May 2022 at the PCRS office but she did not turn up nor call or text PO to inform her reasons for failing to report for the interview session. PO called Syafiqah on 12 May 2022 and 13 May 2022 again but she was unresponsive. As of 18 May 2022, Syafiqah continues to be unresponsive.

> 3.3    Syafiqah’s mother was also uncontactable and failed to respond to further texts and calls since 22 Apr 2022. Both Syafiqah and the mother had also failed to provide PO with relevant documents needed to prepare for the Probation Suitability Report (PSR) despite PO’s reminders to them. Her father has also uncontactable since 22 Apr 2022.

> In view of Syafiqah and her mother s subsequent non-responsiveness, PO is unable to complete social investigations in order to prepare the PSR for Syafiqah. Her behaviour so far indicated that she is nonchalant about the Court giving her a chance through calling for the assessment of her suitability on probation, and that her cooperation with PO was shortlived. The mother has also failed to co-operate to get the daughters to contact and respond to PO, although she had initially responded to PO. \[…\]

28     As reported by the probation officer, Syafiqah was nonchalant, and her parents were wholly uncooperative. Probation would require the active participation of the offender as well as the support of the family in the rehabilitative efforts of the offender. These were plainly absent in Syafiqah’s case.

### Suitable to undergo reformative training

29     In the pre-sentence report for reformative training dated 12 May 2022, Syafiqah was found to be physically and mentally suitable to undergo the reformative training regime. Having considered various criminogenic needs domains, such as her family, education, companions, recreation, personality and behaviour, attitude and orientation, the report concluded that “Syafiqah presented with several needs that require intervention, namely in the areas of her family issues, unconstructive use of time, limited pro-social peers, difficulty with employment and impulsivity.” The report went on to recommend that Syafiqah undergo “Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation” if sentenced to reformative training.

### Sentence imposed

30     Given that probation was not viable, the only available rehabilitative sentencing option for Syafiqah was reformative training. The prosecution submitted that Syafiqah ought to be sentenced to reformative training. I accepted the submission of the prosecution that reformative training would be an appropriate sentencing option as the offences were serious in nature and called for general deterrence. Reformative training would serve a much-needed point of intervention for Syafiqah, to facilitate her rehabilitation in a structured environment.

31     At the court mention on 24 May 2022 when the probation and reformative training reports were considered, Syafiqah said that she was pregnant, and pleaded to be given a last chance. She provided no proof, however, that she was indeed pregnant. Even if so, it was not a material change of circumstances in favour of probation over reformative training. Her complete lack of cooperation with the probation officer rendered probation unfeasible (as observed above at \[27\]).

32     I would also add that a community sentence was not available in the present case. Community sentences are provided under Part 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”). Such a sentencing option is generally not available if the offence is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds 3 years: s 337(1)(i) of the CPC. Given that the present offences are punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years, community sentences are excluded.

33     Accordingly, with the view to Syafiqah’s rehabilitation, I imposed a sentence of reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 12 months, in accordance with the recommendations in the reformative training report. The sentence took effect from the date on which the sentence was passed, on 24 May 2022. Syafiqah is presently serving the sentence.
