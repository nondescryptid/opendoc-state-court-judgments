2       At the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the evidence as well as the written submissions before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case on the eleven proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. On 5 July 2019, I found the accused guilty and convicted him in respect of the eleven charges in **DAC 905572-2017 - 2017** to **DAC 905582-2017 - 2017**. On 17 July 2019, I imposed the following sentences:

I ordered the sentences for three of the charges namely **DAC-905575-2017**, **DAC-905578-2017** and **DAC-905581-2017** to run consecutively and the sentences for the remaining eight charges to run concurrently. The global sentence imposed on the accused was _36 months’ imprisonment_ with effect from 17 July 2019.

3       Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal against his _conviction_ through his new Counsel, Mr Ashvin Hariharan of Kalidass Law Corporation in respect of all eleven charges on 17 July 2019. He is presently on bail of $175,000 with one surety pending the hearing of his appeal.

## B.   Undisputed Facts

7       The undisputed facts as agreed by the Prosecution and the Defence in the Statement of Agreed Facts (“_Exhibit PS1_”) in the present case are set out below:

> 1.    The Accused is Leow Quek Chye Andy (“the Accused”), male/43 years old. He was a director of Lansys IT Solutions Pte Ltd (“Lansys IT”) at the material time of the offences.

> 2.    The Complainant is Tay Choon Leng Xavier (“Xavier Tay”), a director and shareholder of Lansys IT.

> 3.    Lansys IT’s business included providing IT services, and supplying and installing electronic network equipment. The Accused assisted to manage Lansys IT’s business at the material time of the offences. His duties included preparing and approving purchase orders, quotations, invoices and delivery orders for Lansys IT.

> 4.    Lansys IT had two OCBC bank accounts, being an OCBC SGD Account No. XXX and an OCBC USD Account No. XXX.

> 5.    Payments made from these two OCBC accounts required the approval of both Xavier Tay and the Accused. Xavier Tay and the Accused each held an i-banking device. The device held by the Accused allowed him to create payment in Lansys IT’s OCBC internet banking account, while Xavier Tay’s device allowed him to authorise the payment created by the Accused.

> 6.    In order to approve payments created by the Accused, Xavier Tay relied on supporting documents (_ie_, Lansys IT’s invoices, customers’ purchase orders, suppliers’ invoices, etc).

> 7.    Details of the emails and supporting documents sent/drafted from the email account “andy.leow@lansys.com.sg” to Xavier Tay and/or Lili Tay, as well as the payment amounts are as follows:-

> 8.    The emails, with the attachements, are at Annexes A – H of the Statement of Agreed Facts.

> 9.    Investigations reveal that payments of the above sums were made to Finaltech Limited and Frontier Insights Pte Ltd, as the case may be.

> 10.    Investigations further reveal that Lansys IT never issued the invoices for the items stated in the invoices to the customers. The customers never ordered the items stated in the invoices attached to the emails. Thus, the invoices that were issued to the customers were forged. The signatures on these forged invoices were identical, digital signatures. No financial loss was suffered by the customers in relation to these forged invoices.

> 11.    The purchase order 20130607-0023103 purportedly issued by CrimsonLogic Pte Ltd to Lansys IT referred to in s/n 2 of the table of the table was also forged because CrimsonLogic Pte Ltd never ordered the items listed in the description and never issued the purchase order. Investigations reveal that CrimsonLogic had issued purchase order 20130607-0023103 dated 8 June 2012 in respect of professional services.

> 12.    For the goods and/or services that were actually ordered by the customers, the customers did receive such goods and/or services and made payment for the same by way of cheques addressed to Lansys IT or bank transfer to Lansys IT. The cheques were not addressed to any other party or individual.

8       Apart from the facts as set out above, these facts were also undisputed:

> (a)     The relevant emails from the accused’s account andy.leow@lansys.com.sg received by the complainant contained forged documents, and that the accused’s name appeared on these documents;

> (b)     The accused had sole charge of the sales operations and the preparation of the relevant documents in Lansys IT. The accused was also the sole person who can raise a payment request via the OCBC online banking portal for Lansys IT to pay out monies and the complainant was the sole person who could approve the raised payment request via the same portal;

> (c)     The accused sold the goods to his personal client NetworkEquipment and NetworkEquipment had deposited the moneys from these sales to the accused’s PayPal account;

> (d)     The goods purchased from Lansys IT’s suppliers were delivered to NetworkEquipment, and funds from NetworkEquipment flowed to the accused’s PayPal account;

> (e)     There was a loan of $350,000 from Lansys Pte Ltd to Lansys IT. The loan arose from the payment by Lansys Pte Ltd of the salaries of four employees from Lansys IT between June and December 2009 and June 2011;

> (f)     There was an arrangement whereby Lansys IT would pass 3% of the profits from projects with values over $1,000 to Lansys Pte Ltd as repayment for the said loan;

> (g)     The complainant, Tay Choon Leng Xavier had instituted civil proceedings against the accused to recover moneys i.e. $1.5 million from Lansys IT that were paid out arising from the forged documents. The accused did not defend the civil suit and judgment in default ordered against the accused;

> (h)     On or about 22 May 2014, the complainant received an email from the accused’s office email account in respect of a request to pay Finaltech Limited US$13,200 in relation to goods ostensibly for Emersion Pte Ltd but Emersion had not ordered the goods and

> (i)     The accused has a Bachelor of Information Technology degree. He previously worked as a Technical Manager of Singapore Computer System as well as an Operations Manager with Ericsson Telecommunications before he became a director of Lansys IT in 2009.

9       It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused and the complainant, Tay Choon Leng, Xavier (PW8), were both directors of Lansys IT Solutions Pte Ltd (“Lansys IT”) at the material time. In essence, between 24 September 2013 and 22 May 2014, the accused had sent emails to the complainant and/or his sister Tay Lili (PW9) and that the complainant had believed the emails in respect of **DAC 905572-2017 - 2017** to **DAC 905581-2017 - 2017** to be genuine requests to authorise payments from Lansys IT’s OCBC bank accounts to Lansys IT’s suppliers. The complainant had therefore authorised ten payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers that amounted to S$254,462.58 and US$12,562.

10     It was also the Prosecution’s case that the email in respect of **DAC 905582-2017 - 2017**, must have been sent by the accused as he was the only person who used the email account and was in-charge of ordering goods and making payment requests to the complainant. It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant had no motive to falsely incriminate the accused. In contrast, the accused owed debts to numerous banks and had every reason to cheat Lansys IT into paying for goods that would eventually be sold for the accused’s own profit.

11     In contrast, it was the case for the Defence that the accused had not sent such emails to the complainant and had not falsified any documents. According to the accused, the complainant had forged these documents and doctored the emails to frame him and “cover-up” the complainant’s criminal breach of trust of Lansys IT’s money.

12     It was also the case for the Defence that any payment that was delivered from Lansys IT’s bank account to Lansys IT’s suppliers for equipment to be delivered to the accused’s personal client, was made pursuant to an accelerated debt repayment scheme to settle the loan of $350,000 from Lansys Pte Ltd to Lansys IT. According to the Defence, the objective of this scheme was for the debt to be repaid by the accused expeditiously. It was also the case for the Defence that it was unlikely that the complainant was aware or cared to be aware who the accused’s personal clients were. The accused had admitted his involvement in this scheme even though it was illegal.

## C.   Issue

13     The main issue before me was whether between 24 September 2013 and 22 May 2014, the accused had sent the relevant emails from his Lansys IT office email account to the complainant containing the forged documents to deceive the complainant into approving the requests for payments.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

14     It was the case for the Prosecution that the accused was solely in-charge of sales in Lansys IT. He was responsible for paying suppliers, issuing Lansys IT invoices and preparing other documents for these transactions. It was submitted that the complainant trusted him by giving him the other i-banking device that allowed him to create payments on Lansys IT’s OCBC internet banking system which would then be authorised by the complainant.

15     It was the case for the Prosecution that the accused was in dire financial straits, as seen by his inability to service his credit card debts to multiple banks. He also visited the local casinos to gamble. In these circumstances, it was submitted that the accused had exploited his position in Lansys IT by ordering goods from Lansys IT’s suppliers for his own purposes. It was further submitted that to obtain the money needed to pay these suppliers, the accused had falsified the supporting documents and sent fraudulent emails to the complainant to cheat the complainant into believing that the goods ordered were for Lansys IT’s customers. It was the case for the Prosecution that unfortunately, this was untrue as the goods were sold to NetworkEquipment. It was submitted that the moneys from these sales were then deposited into the accused’s PayPal account and used for his own private transactions.

16     The Prosecution had submitted that the complainant was cheated into authorising ten payments amounting to S$254,462.58 and US$12,562 in respect of the charges in **DAC 905572-2017 - 2017** to **DAC 905581-2017 - 2017**. It was further submitted that before the accused had sent the email dated 22 May 2014 requesting payment of $13,200 in relation to goods ostensibly ordered by Emersion Pte Ltd, the complainant had discovered discrepancies between a Lansys IT invoice issued to ST Electronics and a Lansys IT invoice the accused had previously submitted in support of a payment request. Thus, the complainant did not authorise this payment.

### Elements of the offence

17     The Prosecution had submitted that to prove a charge under s 420 of the Penal Code, three elements must be satisfied (_Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 946</span> at \[42\] – \[44\]):

> (a)     The complainant must be deceived/deception must have been practised on the victim;

> (b)     There must have been an inducement such that the complainant delivered any property to any person and

> (c)     There must be a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the accused to induce the complainant to deliver the property.

18     For the offence of attempt to cheat under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code, the Prosecution had submitted that it must be shown that (_Chua Kian Kok v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 826</span> at \[26\] & \[36\]):

> (a)    There was a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the accused’s part to induce the complainant to deliver the property and

> (b)    The accused had embarked on the crime proper.

19     It was the Prosecution’s case that in view of the undisputed facts, the email requests for payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers were false as Lansys IT’s customers never ordered the goods that were the subject of the requests for payment. The Prosecution had submitted that accordingly, these emails qualify as “_deception_”. Further, it was submitted that for the requirement that there be a “_dishonest or fraudulent intention_”, a person who tries to deceive another is certainly acting dishonestly, and this element was satisfied. It was also submitted that for the element of _inducement_, the complainant had authorised ten payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers, which he would not have done if he knew the goods from these suppliers had not been purchased on behalf of Lansys IT’s customers.

20     In respect of the attempted cheating offence, it was the Prosecution’s case that the offence of cheating would have been completed the moment the complainant authorised the payment request, and thus the perpetrator had embarked on the crime proper by sending the email to the complainant. Therefore, it was submitted that the crux is whether the accused was the person who had sent these emails to the complainant, thereby deceiving the complainant and dishonestly inducing the complainant to authorise the payments.

21     It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant’s testimony on material issues displayed a high degree of internal and external consistency. It was submitted that as the complainant’s testimony was credible and this Court should place full weight on his testimony.

#### Internal consistency

22     The Prosecution had submitted that the complainant’s testimony about the nature of the emails and the reasons why he authorised the payments forms the mainstay of its case. During his examination-in-chief, after being taken through each of the emails, he had testified that the emails had been sent by the accused. It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant believed that, apart from the email sent on or about 22 May 2014, all the emails were in relation to genuine requests for payment to Lansys IT’s suppliers for goods that were ordered on behalf of Lansys IT’s customers. It was submitted that the complainant authorised ten payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers, which he would not have done had he known that the goods were not meant for Lansys IT’s customers.

23     It was further submitted that the complainant had relied on the accused to handle the financial affairs and the sales operations of Lansys IT. The Prosecution submitted that the complainant also relied on the accused to create the payment request on OCBC’s internet banking system, after which the accused would email the complainant a print-screen of the payment request on OCBC’s internet banking system with supporting documents for the complainant to authorise the payment.

24     It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant’s testimony on critical issues was unshaken and free from material contradictions even under cross-examination. It was submitted that for any minor discrepancies in his evidence or his inability to recall facts fully, these are only to be expected, given that he was testifying about events that took place around four to five years before his court testimony. It was further submitted that Courts have recognised that adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection (_PP v Singh Kalpanath_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 158</span> at \[60\]).21 Therefore, these discrepancies do not detract from the complainant’s testimony on critical issues.

### External consistency

25     It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant’s testimony about the accused’s fraudulent requests for payments was externally consistent with:

> (a)     The fact that all the emails containing forged documents were sent from the accused’s office email account. Tay Lili (PW9), who was the IT administrator for Lansys IT, had testified she had created the accused’s office email account, and only the accused would have had access to the email account with his password. It was submitted that therefore, all the emails received by the complainant must have been sent by the accused. It was further submitted that there was no suggestion that the accused’s office email account had been illegally accessed by a third party during the material period. The accused himself testified that there was no evidence of third party activity in his email account during the material period;

> (b)     It was submitted that the print screens from Lansys IT’s OCBC internet banking webpage showed that the accused was the person who created the request for payment. As the accused possessed the other i-banking device that allowed him to create payment requests on the OCBC internet banking webpage, he must have been the person who created the request for payment. It was further submitted that there was no suggestion that the accused’s i-banking device had been handed to or stolen by a third party during the material period. The accused himself confirmed that the i-banking device was in his possession from 2011 until the time he left Lansys IT;

> (c)     It was submitted that the accused himself had acknowledged that he was the person who had sole charge of the sales operations and the preparation of the relevant documents in Lansys IT. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was consistent with the fact that the accused’s name appears on the Lansys IT delivery orders and quotations, and the purchase orders issued by Lansys IT’s customers to Lansys IT. It was further submitted that the accused’s digital signature also appeared on all the forged Lansys IT invoices, a fact accepted by the Defence. In this connection, the forged documents were based on genuine documents issued by Lansys IT to its customers. From the totality of the evidence, it was submitted that the accused had access to the supporting documents attached to the emails, and had perfect opportunity to forge these documents for his own purposes. Further, as the person who submitted Lansys IT’s documents to an external accountant for accounting purposes, the accused was in the perfect position to hide the fraud by not submitting the forged documents to the accountant;

> (d)     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s decision not to defend himself in the civil suit is probative of the accused’s guilt with reference to the cheating offences. The complainant had sued the accused for S$1.5 million, a significant sum by any measure. Yet, the accused chose to accept liability instead of entering a defence. It was submitted that from his employment history, and his role in Lansys IT, it was plain that the accused was not a clueless individual who would have been overawed by the court process. From his demeanour on the witness stand, the accused clearly had no problems with expressing himself or putting forth his defence. Given these circumstances, it was further submitted that it was striking the accused chose not defend himself from the civil suit, and such conduct is utterly inconsistent with innocence;

> (e)     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had failed to return the laptop he had originally been assigned with when he began working at Lansys IT. It was submitted that the complainant and Tan Boon Hwee (PW10) had given evidence that the laptop the accused returned to Lansys IT after he resigned bore a different serial number from the laptop that he had been originally assigned with. It was the Prosecution’s case that the inference to be drawn was that the accused did not want to return his original laptop, as he had used it to create the forged documents and submit to the complainant the emails containing the fraudulent requests for payment. It was submitted that looking at the totality of the evidence, there was a clear ring of truth and believability to the complainant’s account regarding the email requests for payment sent by the accused and how, prior to 14 May 2014, the complainant had believed representations from the accused that the payments were for the purchase of goods for Lansys IT’s customers. It was the Prosecution’s case that given the high degree of external consistency in the complainant’s testimony and its internal consistency, the complainant’s testimony was credible and should be believed.

### 14 May 2014 email

26     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused was the only person who had access to his office email account. It was submitted that the accused himself had testified that there was no suspicious activity in his office email account. In these circumstances, the email dated 14 May 2014 must have been sent by the accused. As the email was in relation to a fraudulent request for payment for goods ostensibly ordered by Emersion Pte Ltd, a customer of Lansys IT, the email constituted an attempt to deceive the complainant into authorising the payment.

### The complainant had no motive to lie

27     It was the Prosecution’s case that given the strength of the complainant’s testimony, it was unsurprising the accused has alleged that the complainant was falsely implicating him. It was submitted that such an allegation was utterly far-fetched. The complainant’s decision to sue the accused for the return of the moneys cheated, his decision to lodge a police report, and his decision to testify in this criminal proceedings, casted doubt on the existence of any motive to frame the accused. It was further submitted that it beggars belief that anyone would go through this much trouble to frame an innocent man. Such an attempt would be extremely foolhardy as there was a risk of such a scheme being exposed by the investigative process or by the courts. It was the Prosecution’s case that there was not a shred of evidence to suggest that the complainant was so foolhardy that he would risk being exposed as a perjurer.

28     It was submitted that the Defence had averred that the complainant was falsely incriminating the accused to draw attention away from the complainant’s alleged wrongdoing. Lansys Pte Ltd had previously granted Lansys IT a loan. The Defence had contended that the accused and the complainant had hatched an illegal “accelerated repayment scheme”, where Lansys IT funds would be used to purchase goods from its suppliers. These goods will then be sold to the accused’s own customers, like NetworkEquipment, and the sales proceeds would be deposited into the accused’s pay-pal account. After which, the sales proceeds would be handed to the complainant in cash.

29     It was the Prosecution’s case that such a contention was flawed. First, the complainant flatly denied the existence of such a scheme. It was submitted that given the internal and external consistency in the complainant’s testimony on material issues as stated above, the complainant’s credibility was irreproachable, and full weight should be placed on his denial. Second, there was clear evidence that such a scheme was an afterthought. It was submitted that the accused did not mention this scheme in his first statement (“_Exhibit P67_”), and only mentioned this scheme midway through the recording of his second statement (“_Exhibit P68_”), after his lunch break. It was the Prosecution’s case that as the existence of this scheme was critical to his Defence, his omission to mention it at the earliest opportunity was evidence that it was an afterthought. Third, even if the scheme did exist, it was hard to see how that would be considered illegal. The complainant and the accused were the directors and shareholders of Lansys IT. It would have been their prerogative to decide how to conduct Lansys IT’s affairs, and if they chose to have such a scheme then they were entitled to do so. In view of the above, it was submitted that there was no evidence of a plausible motive on the complainant’s part to falsely incriminate the accused, and the Court should give short shrift to the Defence’s claims regarding such a motive.

### The accused had motive to commit the offences

30     It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant’s testimony regarding the offences was corroborated by the evidence showing the accused’s motive for committing the offences. It was submitted that the objective evidence showed the accused was in dire financial straits at the material period i.e. 2013 to 2014. It was highlighted that apart from being the sole breadwinner of a family consisting of his wife and young daughter, the accused had several credit card debts and loans with various banks which he had difficulty servicing. The accused had also maximised his overdraft facilities with various banks.

31     It was submitted that the various bank statements tendered in evidence show that the accused was unable to pay off any of these debts. Given his dire financial straits, the accused clearly had the motive to commit cheating offences by hoodwinking the complainant to authorise payments to suppliers for goods that would then be sold to the accused’s own customer. The sales proceeds from the sale of these goods would then be used for the accused’s own expenses. It was the Prosecution’s case that the existence of this motive was therefore probative of the fact that the accused committed the cheating offences.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

32     It was the case for the Defence that it was well-established that to make out the offence of cheating under s 420, read with s 415 of the Penal Code, three elements have to be satisfied:

> a.     The victim must be deceived;

> b.     There must have been inducement such that the victim delivered any property to any person; and

> c.     There must be a dishonest intention on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property.

33     It was submitted that it was important to set out at the outset there was no reason or need for the accused to cheat the complainant. It was the case for the Defence that the complainant and the accused had agreed on an arrangement for the repayment of the loan owed by Lansys Pte Ltd to Lansys IT. It was undisputed that there was a loan of $350,000 from Lansys Pte Ltd to Lansys IT. This loan arose from the payment by Lansys Pte Ltd of the salaries of four employees from Lansys IT between December 2009 and June 2011. The payroll of these four employees were managed by Ms Tay Lili (PW9), who works at Lansys Pte Ltd. It was submitted that the parties’ positions diverged on the repayment arrangements and the amount that has already been repaid.

34     In relation to the repayment arrangements, the complainant, Ms Tay Lili and the accused had agreed that there was an arrangement whereby Lansys IT would pass 3% of the profits from projects with values over $1,000 to Lansys Pte Ltd as repayment for the loan. It was submitted that the parties’ positions differed in terms of the existence of the second repayment arrangement, which was referred to in the course of the trial as the “accelerated repayment scheme”. It was further submitted that the second repayment arrangement, i.e. the accelerated repayment scheme, was in fact in place, and it was through this scheme that most of the loan was repaid to Lansys Pte Ltd.

35     It was the Defence’s case that there was a need for a second repayment arrangement because under the initial repayment arrangement, the repayment of the loan owed to Lansys Pte Ltd was moving slowly. It was submitted that pursuant to the accelerated repayment scheme, most of the loan was repaid. It was highlighted that according to the complainant and Ms Tay Lili, most of the loan was not repaid, no further steps were taken to recover the rest of the loan and the loan was not written off.

36     It was the Defence’s case that it was unconvincing that the complainant who felt that it was important to help Lansys Pte Ltd recover the money, had simply left majority of the loan, which was a substantial sum of $350,000, unrecovered and unaccounted for (by electing not to write off the sum in Lansys Pte Ltd’s books). It was submitted that it was more likely that most of the loan was already repaid, pursuant to the accelerated repayment scheme, and therefore there was no need to take further steps to recover the remaining sum or to write it off.

37     It was the Defence’s case that there was a spreadsheet maintained by Ms Tay Lili which recorded the amount of money repaid. This spreadsheet was sent to the complainant and the accused via email, and the accused had kept a copy of the spreadsheet in the company’s laptop. It was submitted as the accused had left Lansys IT before the charges were brought against him, there was no way for him to access the spreadsheet. It was the Defence’s case that the spreadsheet remains in the possession of the complainant and Ms Tay, and that it was not tendered at trial by the Prosecution. It was further submitted that the Court should presume, under Section 116 of the Evidence Act Illustration (g), that the spreadsheet, if produced, would be unfavourable to the Prosecution.

38     It was the Defence’s case that given that there was an agreement between the complainant and the accused under the accelerated repayment scheme for equipment to be resold to the accused’s personal clients, there was no need for the accused to cheat the complainant into making payment to the suppliers for equipment that was to be resold to NetworkEquipment.net.

### No personal benefit

39     It was submitted that there was also no reason for the accused to cheat the complainant in the manner alleged by the Prosecution, as there was no personal benefit to the accused at all. The payments approved by the complainant were made from Lansys IT directly to the suppliers, Finaltech and Frontier Insights and the accused did not get any part of the payments made to them. The equipment were never sent to the accused’s house and there was no collusion between the accused and the suppliers. It was further submitted that the goods and/or services ordered by Lansys IT’s customers, the customers did receive such goods and/or services, and payments for the same were made by the customers directly to Lansys IT. It was the Defence’s case that there was therefore no reason for the accused to induce the complainant into making payment to the suppliers, by attaching false customer invoices and purchase orders, as he did not stand to gain anything from this.

### No deception or inducement by the accused

40     In relation to the first two elements of cheating, it was submitted that although it was not in dispute that payments were in fact made out to Lansys IT’s suppliers, it is submitted that the complainant was not deceived by the accused or induced by the accused to deliver the payments.

### Accused’s denial that he sent the emails containing the false documents

41     It was the Defence’s case that the accused denied sending the emails listed at paragraph 7 of the Statement of Agreed Facts to the complainant. It was submitted that although the email print-outs showed that the emails were sent from “andy.leow@lansys.com.sg”, the emails could have been sent by someone else who had access to the accused’s email account.

42     It was submitted that Ms Tay Lili was in charge of setting up the email accounts for the staff of Lansys IT, i.e. she created the email address and the initial password. The accused had continued using the initial password that she had provided and did not change his email password throughout his time at Lansys IT. It was further submitted that it was also the evidence of Mr Tan Boon Hwee (PW10), a network engineer who formerly worked at Lansys IT that the password would not expire, as the email system does not prompt the user to change the email password.

43     It was submitted that Ms Tay Lili had agreed that it is possible for someone who has the accused’s password to log into his email account. The complainant had also agreed that anyone with administrative access to the email server could log in to existing email accounts and send out emails on behalf of the true owner of the account. Further, Mr Tan Boon Hwee had agreed that if the user does not change his password from the original password given by the administrator, the email administrator could log into the email account. It was the Defence’s case that given that the accused did not change his email password throughout his time at Lansys IT, it was possible that Ms Tay Lili, or anyone else to whom she had given the accused’s password, logged in to the accused’s email account and sent those emails from his account.

### Accused’s denial that he created the falsified documents

44     It was the Defence’s case that the accused denied creating the falsified documents listed at paragraph 7 of the Statement of Agreed Facts. It was submitted that the Lansys IT invoice template and digital signature were accessible to others. The template of the invoice was given to Lansys IT by Lansys Pte Ltd, as the intention was for the corporate image to be identical, according to the complainant. It was further submitted that the accused was not the only one with access to the template. Other than the accused, the complainant and Ms Tay Lili also have access to the template. Moreover, it was submitted that there were various ways to create the invoice, e.g. through Microsoft Excel or through Microsoft Word, according to Mr Tan Boon Hwee.

45     It was further submitted that a copy of the identical, digital signature that was seen on all the forged invoices was available in the company’s file server, which was open to all the staff i.e. staff of Lansys Pte Ltd. The accused had testified that the reason why the digital stamp and signature was on the server is for another staff, Gaston to prepare other documents such as delivery orders and maintenance certificates when the accused was not in the office. According to the accused, affixing the digital signature onto an invoice template only requires simply copying and pasting it onto the template.

46     It was the case for the Defence that given that the invoice template and digital signature was accessible by others, and it was not difficult to create an invoice and affix the digital signature on it, it was entirely possible for the forged invoices to have been created by someone else with access to the template and signature.

### Illogical modes of forgery

47     It was submitted that the various ways the forgery has been carried out showed that the accused was not the one who forged the documents. Firstly, it was agreed that the signatures on the forged invoices were identical, digital signatures. On the other hand, the genuine invoices contain signatures that are similar, but with slight differences e.g. the angle of rotation of the stamp, the points at which the signature overlaps with the stamp.

48     It was highlighted that three witnesses, including the complainant agreed that if the original creator of the invoice was trying to duplicate a false invoice, he could simply stamp and physically sign again on the other invoice because it is easy for him to replicate his own signature. If the person trying to create the false invoice was not the original creator of the invoice, it would be easier for this person to replicate the original creator’s signature by using a digital signature in order to ensure consistency. It was the Defence’s case that if the accused wanted to forge the invoices, there was no need for him to use a digital signature as he can simply physically sign on the invoices, as he does for other invoices, and no one would suspect that they are forged as it is his own signature.

49     Secondly, it was highlighted that some of the invoices contained inconsistencies, errors or red flags that would increase the likelihood of detection of the forgery. If the accused was truly the mastermind of the meticulous forgery plan, it would be bizarre for him to forge in such an inconsistent and erroneous manner. Instead, if he had gone to the lengths of such meticulous forging, one would think that he would have ensured the figures and items on the forged invoices are consistent and logical in order to avoid detection. If anything, the state of the forgery committed and the uncovering of the same serves the sole purpose of drawing attention to the accused as the culprit of the plan.

50     Lastly, the complainant claimed that he had discovered inconsistencies in the documents when he looked at documents returned to Lansys IT by RMS, the company’s auditor. Again, if the accused had gone to the lengths of such meticulous forging, one would think that he would have ensured that the documents sent to RMS were consistent, as that would ensure that the forgery would never be discovered, since he was the only one dealing with RMS. It was submitted that the accused having sent the original documents to RMS showed that he had nothing to hide.

### Accused’s admission to his role in the scheme

51     It was the Defence’s case that the accused in his admission to essentially an offence of criminal breach of trust, admitted this even when facing the prospect of criminal prosecution for the same. It was submitted that this, if anything, was a testament of his credibility in Court.

52     On the contrary, it was submitted that the complainant was far less credible as a witness. He was unconvincing when answering why he had elected not to pursue a huge debt owed to him, or even write it off. It was further submitted that he even offered to provide the spreadsheet of Lansys IT’s debt to him, but this was never tendered in Court as evidence to prove the non-payment of the debt. It was the Defence’s case that the complainant’s unreliable evidence was further demonstrated by his responses to the accused’s critical role in securing a sizeable and lucrative contract for the complainant’s company, Lansys Pte Ltd.

## The complainant’s motive

53     It was submitted that the accused suspected that the true culprit behind the forgery was the complainant, and his primary motive was to frame the accused in order to distance himself from the accelerated repayment scheme. The scheme was illegal in nature, minimally an act of criminal breach of trust by the accused and the complainant for stealing from Lansys IT. It was further submitted that the complainant had every interest to dissociate himself from the scheme by denying knowledge of it.

54     It was the Defence’s case that another reason was the fear that the accused would set up a rival company, and this would have an impact on the ability of the complainant’s own company, Lansys Pte Ltd, to secure work for a sizeable and lucrative MINDEF (Army) contract.

55     It was submitted that a few other points also illustrate the suspiciousness of the alleged cheating. On one hand, the complainant had agreed that he was concerned about profit and loss, and in order for him to check and balance the figures, the easiest way would be to check the figures on the invoices and PO; if there is profit margin, he would approve the transaction. According to the Defence, he cared more about the figures than other details like the description of the items, the dates or the reference numbers. On the other hand, he claimed that his suspicions were raised because the documents he received from RMS and the documents he received from the accused’s email account contained the same reference number but different descriptions of items. It was submitted that a duplicated reference number was an obscure thing to check when one is investigating profit and loss, and the complainant was able to ‘discover’ this discrepancy because he was the one who created it.

56     Further, if Lansys IT was really losing money from the alleged cheating by the accused, it would naturally be in Lansys IT’s interest to take on more projects so as to keep the company going financially. However, it was submitted that the complainant had given away a major ICA project without any reason. Finally, as submitted above, the forged documents do not benefit the accused in any way, but benefit the complainant in dissociating him from the accelerated repayment scheme.

### Investigations are lacking

57     It was the Defence’s case that a loop of alleged cheating by the accused could not be closed. It was submitted that “Exhibit P39”, i.e. the table prepared by IO Jane Chen (PW11), showed that for first, fifth, sixth and seventh charges, some of the shipping documents were not retrieved. For the second charge, the shipment could not be traced. Further, for third, fourth, eighth and ninth charges, there were no shipping documents at all. There was therefore insufficient or no evidence, for the respective charges, linking the alleged forged documents to the accused.

58     It was further submitted that in any event, no investigations were undertaken to verify the accused’s claim that he had performed personal trading with NetworkEquipment.net. As such, it was not possible to tell which of the many PayPal payments involving NetworkEquipment.net, as shown in _Exhibit P35_ at page 7, were actually the accused’s personal trades. It was the Defence’s case that IO Jane Chen (PW11) had agreed that even with all the heavy documentation prepared by the CAD in this case, the loop of how the accused was alleged to have cheated the complainant cannot be closed by the investigations. It was submitted that the failure to close the loop was fatal to the Prosecution’s case.

### Documents taken by CAD at face value

59     It was submitted that even though the charges relate to forged documents, and the authenticity of the documents was the key issue, the CAD did not seize the computers of Lansys IT to investigate and obtain the documents, and the forged documents were handed over to the CAD by the complainant and Ms Tay Lili, which were accepted by the CAD at face value. Given that the crux of the accused’s defence was that he did not forge any document and that he was framed, it was problematic that the forged documents forming the key evidence against him were all accepted by the CAD at face value.

60     It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution has not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt:

> (a)     The Prosecution’s witnesses have acknowledged that other malicious actors, instead of the accused alone, could possibly use the accused’s email account to send emails in his name, and forge the documents in question;

> (b)     The complainant and Ms Tay Lili had acknowledged that the accused / Lansys IT owed a large sum of $350,000 to the complainant / Lansys Pte Ltd. The complainant claimed a large portion of this debt remains unpaid, and yet it was never further pursued or written off, or mentioned in Lansys Pte Ltd’s books. It was glaring that the statement of account for this large debt would be maintained in a spreadsheet (separate from Lansys Pte Ltd’s main accounts). The complainant had testified he would provide this spreadsheet to the police, but it was never adduced as evidence. By Section 116 of the Evidence Act, Illustration (g), the Court ought to presume this spreadsheet, if produced, would be unfavourable to the Prosecution’s case, and by extension possibly support the accused’s defence of the existence of the accelerated repayment scheme.

61     It was submitted that on the contrary, the accused’s defence had presented a plausible alternative:

> (a)     The accused had freely admitted to his involvement in the illegal scheme even though it incriminated him. This demonstrated his credibility;

> (b)     The existence and execution of an illegal accelerated debt repayment scheme had resulted in the debt being paid off by the accused to the complainant. This was the only credible explanation as to why the complainant never pursued or wrote off the debt in Lansys Pte Ltd’s books;

> (c)     It was within the complainant’s interest to dissociate himself completely from this illegal scheme. Any admission of his knowledge of the scheme, let alone participation in the same, would incriminate him. In fact, the usage of the accused’s email account to send emails in his name, and the forgery of documents using the accused’s stationery, and the illogical nature of the forged content, gives the optics of emphasising the accused’s criminal activity, but in equal measure, allows the complainant to dissociate himself from the repayment scheme. Ironically, the complainant was able to point to the repayment scheme, disclaim knowledge, and claim he was cheated by the accused via the same;

> (d)     The accused also conducted personal trading activity in his private capacity, also using his PayPal account. He informed the CAD of this when first investigated, but the CAD witness has acknowledged that no further investigations were undertaken to ascertain this fact. The CAD witness has even acknowledged that the loop of how the accused was alleged to have cheated the accused cannot be closed by the investigation findings as they stand.

62     It was the Defence’s case that while it was not crucial to prove or disprove a charge, the Defence had also demonstrated the motivation of the complainant in wanting to incriminate the accused. The fact that he was reluctant to even give due credit to the accused’s role in securing the lucrative MINDEF (Army) contract for the complainant (though he eventually did concede the point), that the Court was not provided with the spreadsheet for the repayment scheme, or that he could not provide cogent explanations for the handling of the bad debt he claims was owed by the accused / Lansys IT, shows to a large extent that he was not a credible witness.

63     It was submitted that taking all evidence in totality, it was patently unsafe to convict the accused. The Defence humbly urged the Court to acquit him of his charges.

## F.   The Prosecution’s Reply

### Accused obtained a personal benefit from the offences

64     In response to the Defence’s assertion that the accused would not have personally benefited from the cheating offences, it was the Prosecution’s case that the assertion was misconceived. It was submitted that without the cheating offences, the accused would have needed a source of funds to conduct his personal trades. Before the accused could sell goods to NetworkEquipment, the accused needed to first purchase the goods from the suppliers and such purchases required money.

65     It was submitted that it was undisputed that the accused was in dire financial straits, being saddled with multiple debts to several banks and having maximized his overdraft facilities. It was the Prosecution’s case that to carry on his personal trades, the accused must have obtained money from somewhere and the cheating offences gave him access to funds which he otherwise would not have had the complainant known the truth.

### Accused never discovered any unauthorized access to his email account

66     It was the Prosecution’s case that the assertion by the Defence that the emails could have been sent by someone who had access to the accused’s Lansys IT email account was speculation and raised no reasonable doubt. It was submitted that the accused himself had conceded during his cross-examination that there was no evidence that third parties had illegally accessed his email during the period when all the emails were sent. It was further submitted that if there had been evidence of such activity, the accused would have detected it and raised it as he used his email account for his business activity. It was the Prosecution’s case that in these circumstances, the only person who could have sent the emails was the accused.

67     Secondly, it was submitted that the accused’s claim that he had never changed his password was dubious. The accused is a person who had worked in various IT-related companies and was certainly no stranger to the email and must have been aware of the risks involved in using the default issued password. It was the Prosecution’s case that it beggars belief that he never bothered to change his password for months and his claim that he did not was merely a convenient excuse designed to explain away the fact that all the fraudulent emails were sent from his email account.

### Spreadsheet irrelevant to the Prosecution’s case

68     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s invitation to the Court to draw adverse inference against the Prosecution for not producing the spreadsheet was misconceived. It was submitted that the contents of the spreadsheet was irrelevant to the Prosecution’s case and thus no adverse inference should be drawn pursuant to illustration (g) of s 116 of the Evidence Act.

69     It was further submitted in _PP v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span>, the High Court declined to invoke illustration (g) against the Prosecution for not adducing the victim’s psychiatric report and the victim’s document containing an account of the events. The High Court held that an adverse inference may be drawn where the document is material to the Prosecution and the decision not to adduce the document was done with an ulterior motive to hinder or hamper the defence. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. It was submitted that the Prosecution’s case rested on the complainant’s testimony which was externally consistent with _inter alia_, the undisputed facts such as the accused’s job scope in Lansys IT and the fact that the accused was the only person who was using the email account (from which the fraudulent emails were sent) at the material time.

70     It was the Prosecution’s case that it appeared that the spreadsheet was relevant to the Defence’s case. The Defence had the option of applying for the production of the spreadsheet and did not do so. It was submitted that the Defence did not cross-examine the IO, Chen Shu Ying Jane (PW11) despite indicating an intention to do so. Given the Defence’s decision not to pursue the production of the spreadsheet, there was no basis to invoke illustration (g) against the Prosecution.

### Alleged inconsistencies in the forged documents

71     It was highlighted that the Defence had asserted that if the accused was truly behind the meticulous forgery plan, he would not have forged the documents in an inconsistent and erroneous manner and that the accused would have ensured that the figures on the forged invoices refer to the same type of goods. It was the Prosecution’s case that this assertion was speculative as it presupposes that a scammer would react in a certain manner when forging documents. It was submitted that it does not detract from the wealth of evidence implicating the accused as per the emails, his role in the company and his dire financial straits which furnished a motive for the offences.

### The complainant’s testimony regarding the discovery of the documents were logical

72     It was submitted that the Defence took issue with the complainant’s testimony that his suspicions were raised when he noticed a duplicate reference number when comparing the documents received from the external accountant and the documents from the accused’s email account. The Defence had asserted that because the complainant was more concerned with the profit margin before approving payment, he would not have checked with the reference number which was obscure. It was the Prosecution’s case that such an assertion was a total non-sequitur. It was submitted that being concerned with one aspect of the document does not mean that one fails to notice other aspect of the same document.

### The complainant has no motive to lie

73     It was submitted that the Defence had averred that the complainant was lying to distance himself from the alleged accelerated repayment scheme and his fear that the accused may set up a rival company that will compete with the complainant’s company. It was the Prosecution’s case that the complainant’s decision to sue the accused for the return of the moneys cheated, his decision to lodge a police report and his decision to testify in criminal proceedings casted doubt on the existence of any motive to frame the accused. It was submitted that it beggars belief that anyone would go through so much trouble just to frame an innocent man.

74     It was further submitted that given the evidence of the accelerated repayment scheme was an afterthought fabricated by the accused, the Defence’s assertion of motive was without factual basis. Further, it was wholly implausible that the complainant would go through so much trouble i.e. instituting civil proceedings, testifying in a criminal trial just to get rid of a business rival. It was the Prosecution’s case that there was therefore no evidence of plausible motive on the complainant’s part to put the accused in negative light.

75     It was highlighted that when asked about the accused returning a laptop with a serial number that was different from the laptop originally assigned to him, the complainant had candidly testified that the inventory list which described which laptop was assigned to which staff was not accurate. It was submitted that this was evidence of the complainant’s honesty as a witness as well as proof that the complainant was not motivated by a desire to falsely incriminate the accused.

76     It was submitted that the Prosecution’s case was coherent and externally consistent with undisputed facts such as:

> (a)     the fact that the fraudulent emails were sent from the accused’s Lansys IT email account;

> (b)     the absence of any shred of evidence showing that the accused’s email account had been compromised by third parties at the material time when the emails were sent and

> (c)     the accused’s dire financial straits which would furnish a motive for him to conduct his personal trades to earn money for himself.

77     It was further submitted that in stark contrast, the Defence’s case was riddled with inconsistencies and premised on speculation. It was the Prosecution’s case that crucially the accused had shown that he had no qualms about concocting tales such as the accelerated repayment scheme to save his skin. In these circumstances, the Prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the Court was urged to find him guilty on all charges.

## G.   The Defence’s Reply

### The accused’s financial situation was not a motive for him to cheat the complainant

78     In response to the Prosecution’s case that the accused was in dire financial straits and hence had cheated the complainant, it was submitted that no evidence had been adduced that show that the accused used moneys obtained from the alleged cheating transactions to service his credit card debts. It was further submitted that there was no evidence adduced to tie the accused’s credit card debts to his gambling activities or which showed the accused suffering losses in his gambling activities. It was the Defence’s case that in fact the accused had explained that he had actually won several games at the casino and overall had a net gain. It was submitted that the reference to the accused’s financial situation and gambling activities were red herrings.

### Emails in question could reasonably have been sent by someone else

79     In response to the Prosecution’s case that all emails received by the complainant must have been sent by the accused, it was reiterated that it was incorrect to say that only the accused would have access to the email account as he did not change his password throughout his time at Lansys IT and the password would not expire. It was submitted that it was therefore possible that Ms Tay Lili or anyone else to whom she had given the accused’s password had logged into the accused’s email account and sent those emails from his account. It was further submitted that the accused had clarified that he did not notice any strange activity in his email account because he usually only checked the ‘Inbox’ whereas the fabricated emails would be available only in the ‘Sent’ folder which he usually did not check.

### The accused’s failure to defend himself in the civil suit is not probative of his guilt in the cheating offences

80     It was submitted by the Defence that there was a good reason for the accused’s failure to file a defence in the civil suit. He was not familiar with the court procedure and accepted that he did not have the financial means to engage a lawyer after having been advised preliminarily by the lawyers of the fees involved. It was further submitted that his lack of familiarity with legal proceedings was evident from his conflation of the civil suit and the criminal investigations.

### No inference should be drawn against the accused for his failure to account for his original laptop

81     It was submitted by the Defence that the accused had explained that the original laptop he was assigned had some battery problems and he therefore made a swap with one of the spare laptops. Further, it was highlighted that there was no proper maintenance of the asset list. The accused had returned the swapped laptop and believed that the originally assigned laptop should still be within the company’s premises.

82     It was highlighted that Mr Tan Boon Hwee had agreed that the record he kept at the point of the accused’s resignation regarding the laptop assignment was not updated or accurate and that it was normal for an employee to swop his laptop if his original laptop malfunctioned. Moreover, despite the rounding up done by Mr Tan Boon Hwee, he conceded he was uncertain whether the accused’s laptop was still somewhere in the premises of the company.

83     It was the Defence’s case if any inference were to be drawn, it should be drawn from the fact that Lansys IT had written off 13 laptops as indicated in his general ledger but there was no evidence that new laptops were purchased to replace them. The inference was therefore that the complainant decided to write off those 13 laptops because he could not be sure which laptop was used to commit the forgery to frame the accused.

### The accelerated repayment scheme was not an afterthought

84     It was the Defence’s case that the accused initially did not link the investigators’ questions to the accelerated repayment scheme as they were asking about the discrepancy in and forgery of the invoices. He therefore did not link their questions to the accelerated repayment scheme. It was submitted that given the volume of invoices the accused managed during his time at Lansys IT, it was fair and reasonable for him to have not immediately drawn the link between the particular invoices he was shown by the investigators to the accelerated repayment scheme.

85     It was further submitted that as the accused had many other clients, he could not remember at that point which client was involved in the accelerated repayment scheme. It was only when the IO showed him a shipping document address to NetworkEquipment.net that he started to recall the events more clearly. It was the Defence’s case that the accused had answered the questions as they were posed to him by the CAD in a factual manner, to the best of his recollection and understanding of the question at hand. It was submitted as evident from an examination of his statement, he was never evasive. Where he at a later point recalled facts that were relevant to earlier questions, he had volunteered them to the CAD which were then recorded in the further statement. This was the case for the accused’s response in relation to the accelerated repayment scheme.

## H.   Assessment of Evidence

86     The accused faced ten charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) and one charge of attempted cheating under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.). In view of the undisputed facts as set out at paragraphs 7 and 8 above, the main issue before me was whether the accused had sent the emails to the complainant containing the forged supporting documents to deceive the complainant into approving the requests for payments from the Lansys IT OCBC bank accounts.

87     In the present case, it was undisputed that the complainant and the accused were both directors of Lansys IT Solutions Pte Ltd (“Lansys IT”) at the material time. Lansys IT’s business included providing IT services, and supplying and installing electronic network equipment. The accused assisted to manage Lansys IT’s business at the time of the offences. His duties included preparing and approving purchase orders, quotations, invoices and delivery orders for Lansys IT. It was unchallenged that the relevant emails from the accused’s office account andy.leow@lansys.com.sg received by the complainant and/or his sister Tay Lili contained the forged supporting documents, and that the accused’s name appeared on these documents.

88     In my assessment of the evidence, I was mindful that the accused was solely in-charge of the sales operations and the preparation of the relevant documents in Lansys IT. He was also the only person who could raise a payment request via the OCBC online banking portal for Lansys IT to pay out monies and the complainant was the only person who could approve the raised payment request via the same portal. Most importantly, I noted that the complainant and the accused each held an i-banking device. The device held by the accused allowed him to create payment requests in Lansys IT’s OCBC internet banking account while the complainant’s device allowed him to authorise the payment created by the accused. I was also mindful that it was unchallenged whenever he requested for payments, the accused would email to the complainant a print-screen of the payment request on OCBC’s internet banking system with the supporting documents for the complainant to authorise the payment.

89     In the present case, I accepted the complainant’s evidence that he had trusted the accused and had relied on him to handle the financial affairs and the sales operations of Lansys IT. I further accepted his evidence that he had relied on the accused to create the payment request on OCBC’s online banking portal using the i-banking device, after which the accused would email the complainant a print-screen of the payment request on OCBC’s internet banking system with supporting documents for the complainant to authorise the payment. I also accepted the complainant’s evidence that he had relied on these supporting documents when approving the payment requests sent to him by the accused.

90     In respect of the proceeded charges, I accepted the Prosecution’s case that between 24 September 2013 and 22 May 2014, the complainant and/or his sister Tay Lili (PW9) received payment requests emails from the accused with the supporting dcuments attached. I also accepted that the complainant’s evidence that he believed the emails referred to in the respective charges in **DAC 905572-2017 - 2017** to **DAC 905581-2017 - 2017** containing the relevant supporting documents to be genuine requests to authorise payments from Lansys IT’s OCBC bank accounts to Lansys IT’s suppliers. The complainant then authorised ten payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers that amounted to S$254,462.58 and US$12,562. The payments of the above sums were made to Lansys IT suppliers i.e. Finaltech Limited and Frontier Insights Pte Ltd in the manner as set of at paragraph 7 of the Statement of Agreed Facts. The goods purchased from Lansys IT’s suppliers were then delivered to NetworkEquipment, and funds from NetworkEquipment flowed to the accused’s PayPal account.

91     I noted that the accused denied sending such emails to the complainant or that he had falsified any documents. It was the Defence’s case that although the email print-outs showed that the emails were sent from “andy.leow@lansys.com.sg”, the emails could have been sent by someone else who had access to the accused’s email account. It was possible that Ms Tay Lili or anyone else to whom she had given the accused’s password could have logged into the accused’s email account and sent those emails from his account as he did not change his password throughout his time at Lansys IT and the initial password assigned to him by the administrator would not expire. Further, according to the accused, it was the complainant who had forged these documents and doctored the emails to frame him and “cover-up” the complainant’s criminal breach of trust of Lansys IT’s money.

92     It was also the Defence’s case that any payment that was delivered from Lansys IT’s bank account to Lansys IT’s suppliers for equipment to be delivered to the accused’s personal clients, was made pursuant to an accelerated debt repayment scheme to settle the loan of $350,000 from Lansys Pte Ltd to Lansys IT. According to the Defence, as there was an agreement between the complainant and the accused under the accelerated repayment scheme for equipment to be resold to the accused’s personal clients, there was no need for the accused to cheat the complainant into making payment to the suppliers for equipment that was to be resold to NetworkEquipment.net.

93     In my consideration of the issue as to whether the accused had sent the emails to the complainant containing the forged supporting documents, I agreed with the Prosecution that the assertion by the Defence that the emails could have been sent by someone who had access to the accused’s Lansys IT email account was speculative and unsupported by evidence. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the accused himself had conceded during his cross-examination that there was no evidence that third parties had illegally accessed his email during the period when all the emails were sent. If there were indeed such activity, the accused would have detected it and raised it as he used his office email account for his business activity.

94     Furthermore, at the material time only the accused held the device which allowed him to create payment requests in Lansys IT’s OCBC internet banking account which he used to obtain the print-screen of the payment request on OCBC’s internet banking system. In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that from the totality of the evidence, the accused had access to the supporting documents attached to the emails, and was in a position to forge the supporting documents for his own purposes.

95     As the accused had a Bachelor of Information Technology degree and had previously worked as a Technical Manager of Singapore Computer System as well as an Operations Manager with Ericsson Telecommunications before he became a director of Lansys IT in 2009, I agreed with the Prosecution that his claim that he had never changed his default password was dubious. As a person with a degree in information technology and a person who had worked in various IT-related companies, he would be cognisant of the risk involved in using the default issued password and not changing it on a regular basis.

96     Based on the above factors, I found that the only person who could have sent the emails in respect of all eleven charges containing the forged supporting documents was the accused. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had exploited his position in Lansys IT by ordering goods from Lansys IT’s suppliers for his own benefit. I also agreed with the Prosecution and found on the facts that to obtain the money needed to pay these suppliers, the accused had falsified the supporting documents and sent fraudulent emails to the complainant to cheat the complainant into believing that the goods ordered were for Lansys IT’s customers.

97     In addition, I rejected the claim by the Defence that the payment that was delivered from Lansys IT’s bank account to Lansys IT’s suppliers for equipment to be delivered to the accused’s personal clients, was made pursuant to an accelerated debt repayment scheme to settle the loan of $350,000 from Lansys Pte Ltd to Lansys IT. As both the complainant and the accused were directors of Lansys IT, it was illogical for the complainant to agree to a scheme whereby Lansys IT’s funds would be used to pay their suppliers for equipment that was to be resold to the accused’s personal client and for the monies to end up in the accused’s PayPal personal account. I agreed with the Prosecution that such a scheme was an afterthought by the accused to evade responsibility for his actions. In addition, I also rejected the unsubstantiated assertion by the Defence that it was the complainant had forged the supporting documents and had doctored the emails to frame the accused as well as to “cover-up” the complainant’s criminal breach of trust of Lansys IT’s money.

98     In view of the evidence before me, I agreed with the Prosecution that the email requests for payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers were false as Lansys IT’s customers had never ordered the goods that were the subject of the requests for payment. Thus, these emails qualify as “_deception_” and the element of deception for the offence of cheating was satisfied.

99     In respect for the requirement that there be a “_dishonest or fraudulent intention_”, I agreed with the Prosecution that a person who tries to deceive another is certainly acting dishonestly, and this element was satisfied. In the present case, the accused had deceived Lansys IT into paying for goods that were not for its own customers but were sold to the accused’s personal client for the accused’s own profit.

100    As for the element of _inducement_, the complainant had authorised ten payments to Lansys IT’s suppliers, which he would not have done if he knew the goods from these suppliers had not been purchased on behalf of Lansys IT’s customers. For the 11th charge, as the accused had sent the email on 22 May 2014 to the complainant which was false as Finaltech Limited had not ordered the goods, even though the complainant eventually had not authorised the payment, the offence of attempted cheating was made out. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven all the elements of the proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the accused guilty and convicted him on ten charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) and one charge of attempted cheating under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

## I.   Antecedents

101    The Accused was untraced.

## J.   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

102    In the Prosecution’s written address on sentence, it was submitted that the accused was entrusted by the complainant with an ibanking device that allowed him to create payments on Lansys IT Solution’s OCBC internet banking accounts. He was also the person who was responsible for paying suppliers, issuing Lansys IT invoices and preparing other documents for Lansys IT’s sales and purchases.

103    It was the Prosecution’s case that unfortunately, the accused grossly betrayed the complainant’s trust by engaging in an elaborate fraud using forged documents, where he cheated the complainant into approving payments amounting to around S$270,000 to Lansys IT’s suppliers, for goods that, unbeknownst to the complainant, were sold to his own customer, a company in the United States. This fraudulent scheme took place from September 2013 to May 2014. The complainant honestly believed that the accused had ordered these goods for Lansys IT’s customers and approved 10 payments.

104    It was submitted that as a result of the accused’s fraud, Lansys IT suffered a loss of around S$270,000. Not a single cent has been recovered and no restitution was made by the accused. Having regard to the aggravating factors, the absence of remorse by the accused, and the sentencing precedents, a global sentence of at least 36 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

### Aggravating factors

105    It was the Prosecution’s case that the aggravating factors for the present were as follows:

> a.      _Multiple offending_

>> As a matter of common sense and general principle, the larger the number of offences committed, the longer the custodial sentence (_PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[46\] (“_Fernando Payagala_”). It was submitted that a serial offender would be hard put to credibly submit that his conduct was the result of a momentary indiscretion, thereby rendering specific deterrence an inexorable consideration.

>> In the present case, the accused was convicted of ten cheating charges and one count of attempted cheating. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused was a serial fraudster and, as per _FernandoPayagala_ at \[46\], the sentence meted out for his individual charges ought to be higher as compared to that meted out to a single offender for the same quantum;

> b.      _Betrayal of trust_

>> The accused was entrusted by the complainant to handle the sales transactions of the company and had been given the other i-token that allowed the accused to create payments on the OCBC internet banking system. Such trust was gravely abused when the accused cheated the complainant into paying for goods that were meant for the accused’s own benefit and not the company’s. As director of the company, the accused’s actions constitute a grave abuse of trust. This was an aggravating factor that attracts the principle of general deterrence (_PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”) at \[24(c)\]);

> c.      _Difficulty of detection_

>> The accused’s had engaged in a fraudulent scheme using forged documents that was difficult to detect. Evidence was led from some of Lansys IT’s customers that the forged invoices were actually based on genuine invoices whose contents were doctored. Evidence was also led that some of the invoices issued by Lansys IT’s suppliers were doctored by removing the tracking number, as these tracking numbers would have shown that the goods would be delivered to an address in the United States. Clearly, the accused was trying to cover up the fact that the goods were not headed to Lansys IT’s customers but to his own customer in the United States. Indeed, it was fortuitous that the complainant managed to discover the fraud, after he had been cheated by the accused on ten occasions. In these circumstances, general deterrence is a crucial sentencing consideration: _Law Aik Meng_ at \[25(e)\];

> d.      _Premeditation_

>> Specific deterrence is appropriate in instances where the crime is premeditated as specific deterrence works best where there is a conscious choice to commit crimes: _Law Aik Meng_ at \[22\]. There was no doubt that the accused’s offences were premeditated and carefully planned. He had carefully forged the documents using actual documents issued by Lansys IT’s customers. Moreover, as the person responsible for submitting the Lansys IT’s documents to an external auditor, he must have deliberately withheld submitting the fraudulent documents, to ensure his scheme would not be detected. His doctoring of some of the invoices from Lansys IT’s suppliers by removing the tracking number is also evidence of premeditation. In these circumstances, specific deterrence was clearly warranted;

> e.      _Significant sums_

>> The sums involved in each charge are significant, ranging from around S$9,000 to S$54,000. For cheating charges, the higher the quantum, the heftier the sentence (_Fernando Payagala_ at \[47\]). In this regard, not a single cent had been made in restitution. While the complainant has sued the accused for return of monies, the accused is now bankrupt and the complainant is unlikely to recover any of the moneys.

106    Given these aggravating factors, it was the Prosecution’s case that stiff custodial terms per charge are justified to reflect the need for general and specific deterrence.

### Absence of mitigating factors

107    It was submitted there was clearly an abundance of aggravating factors and barely any mitigating factors in this case. First, by claiming trial, the accused was not entitled to any discount ordinarily accorded to accused persons who plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. Indeed, despite cheating the complainant of around S$270,000, not a single cent had been made in restitution.

108    Second, the absence of antecedents on the part of the accused was a neutral factor because it was not positive evidence of good character. It was submitted that the absence of antecedents was merely the absence of an aggravating factor that cannot be construed as a mitigating factor: _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> at \[65\]. Indeed, given that the accused was committed of multiple offences, any possible mitigating effect arising from the lack of antecedents was extinguished.

## Individual Sentences

109    It was the Prosecution’s case that from the sentencing table tendered the following could be gleaned:

> a.     For amounts involving $21,000 to $30,000, sentences of 12 to 15 months’ imprisonment have been imposed;

> b.     For amounts involving $11,000 to $15,500, sentences of 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment have been imposed;

> c. For amounts involving $9,777 to $11,000 (s/n 3), sentences of 7 to 8 months’ imprisonment have been imposed.

In view of the multiple aggravating factors stated above, the absence of restitution or recovery of the losses, the Prosecution had sought for the following sentences to be imposed on the accused:

### Global sentence

110    It was submitted that the total amount cheated from the complainant was around $270,000. After making reference to the table of sentencing precedents, it was the Prosecution’s case that a global sentence of at least 36 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the present case.

## K.   Mitigation

111    In his written plea in mitigation, Counsel had submitted that the accused had been convicted of ten charges under s 420 of the Penal Code and one charge under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code. It was the Defence’s case that a global sentence of no longer than 36 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

### Personal Circumstances

112    The accused is married with two children aged three and 11. His elder child was diagnosed with mild autism when she was seven. The accused and his wife work closely with the school to monitor her condition.

113    The accused’s family presently mainly relies on his wife’s income to survive. His wife works as a manicurist, earning around $2,500 per month. Occasionally, the accused is able to find part-time equipment installation jobs which pay around a few hundred dollars per job.

114    In the present case, the total amounts involved in the ten charges under s 420 are S$254,462.58 and US$12,562. The amount in the charge under s 420 read with s 511 is S$13,200.The case most similar to the present case was _PP v Goh Woon Tik_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 178</span>:

> a.     In that case, the offender had also misused his position and the offences spanned over a considerable period;

> b.     The total amount cheated in that case was $265,159.70, which is close to the amount in the present case. The offender made restitution of $9,400.00, so there was still a loss of close to $256,000.00 that was unrecovered;

> c.     Although the offender in that case pleaded guilty, there were more aggravating circumstances in that multiple victims (16 victims in total) were involved;

> d.     The offender there was sentenced to 32 months’ imprisonment in total.

115    It was submitted another similar case was _PP v Teo Chee Kian Dennis_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 26</span>:

> a.     The offender similarly did not have any antecedents. He claimed trial to all his charges;

> b.     He cheated a similar amount of over $200,000. No restitution was made;

> c.     The offences also took place over a considerable period of time;

> d.     The circumstances in that case were more aggravated in that there was a large number of victims (nine victims in total). Furthermore, majority of the victims were vulnerable as they were not highly educated;

> e.     The offender was sentenced to a total of 36 months’ imprisonment and $120,000 fine (i/d 12 months’ imprisonment). (This sentence included a sentence of 4 months and $10,000 fine (i/d 1 month) for a charge under s 83(1) Securities and Futures Act.

It was the Defence’s case that a global sentence of no longer than 36 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

## L.   The Sentences

116    After having considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence as well as the accused’s written plea in mitigation, I imposed the sentences as set out in paragraph 2 above. As the accused had filed a notice appeal against his conviction only, there was no necessity for me to set out the reasons for my sentences.

117    I noted that the global sentences sought by both the Prosecution and the Defence was 36 months’ imprisonment. As I agreed that the proposed length of 36 months’ imprisonment for the global sentence was just and appropriate, I ordered the sentences for three of the charges namely **DAC-905575-2017**, **DAC-905578-2017** and **DAC-905581-2017** to run consecutively and the sentences for the remaining charges to run concurrently sentence with effect from 17 July 2019. The accused is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.
