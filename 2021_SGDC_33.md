17 February 2021

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, 34 years old, pleaded guilty to a single charge of forgery under section 468 of the Penal Code. The charge read:

> DAC 904637/2019

> You, are charged that on or about December 2014, in Singapore, did forge a document, namely, a Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2014 issued to one Pang Cheng Hoe Kevin by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and dated 12 May 2014, _to wit_, by dishonestly altering the document to state a higher employment income without lawful authority, intending that the said document be used for the purpose of cheating Malayan Banking Berhad into approving a loan to Turntables and Solutions Pte Ltd, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 468 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).

2       On this charge, I sentenced the Accused to three months’ imprisonment. Two other charges under section 468 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration at the time of sentencing.

3       Both the Prosecution and the Accused have appealed against the sentence imposed.

## Facts of the Case[^1]

4       At the material time, the Accused was the director of Journey Advisory Pte Ltd, doing loan brokering as a one-man show. The Accused became acquainted with one Pang Cheng Hoe Kevin (“Kevin”) who was at the material time, the director of Turntables and Solutions Pte Ltd (“the company”). In 2014, Kevin intended to expand his business and got to know the Accused who agreed to assist him in applying for a bank loan for the company.

5       In January 2015, Maybank received an application for a loan by the company (“January application”), which included the following supporting documents:

> (a)     Kevin’s personal income tax Notice of Assessment (“NOA”) for Years of Assessment (“YA”) 2013 and 2014 dated 25 May 2013 and 12 May 2014 respectively; and

> (b)     The company’s 2013 balance sheet and profit and loss statement (collectively known as the "financial statements”).

6       Maybank’s credit department rejected the January Application because it discovered that the tax payable dates on the NOAs were not consistent with the typical NOAs issued by IRAS. The department was also not able to obtain a response from Kevin when they had questions concerning his application and the supporting document, which resulted in the application being terminated.

7       In August 2015, Kevin personally submitted another loan application for the company to Maybank (“August Application”). This time, the supporting documents submitted were:

> (a)     Kevin’s personal income tax NOAs for YA 2014 and 2015; and

> (b)     The company’s 2013 and 2014 financial statements

8       Maybank rejected the August Application because its loan application department noted that the NOA for YA 2014 and the company’s 2013 financial statements submitted for the August Application were different from the ones submitted for the January Application. Maybank then informed the authorities about this. The minimum loan application amount for the applications was $20,000.

9       Investigations revealed that sometime in December 2014, the Accused forged the NOAs for the YA 2014 for the January Application. The Accused altered Kevin’s employment income, inflating it by $13,875. The differences between the forged NOA for YA 2014 and the genuine NOA for YA 2014 issued by IRAS were:

10     The Accused admitted that he forged the NOA for YA 2014 by cutting and pasting portions from other NOAs obtained from other clients or his own, and then photocopying the resulting NOA to create this NOA. This was done without authorization by IRAS or Kevin. The accused admitted that he forged the documents in order to increase Kevin’s chances of obtaining the loan from Maybank as they reflected better financials for Kevin. As Kevin’s loan broker, he would receive a commission of between 1.5% to 4% of the loan amount, if Kevin was successful in obtaining the loan.

11     In dishonestly altering Kevin’s NOA for YA 2014, the Accused committed forgery by making a false document with the intent to commit fraud. This forgery was committed with the intention that the document forged would be used for the purpose of cheating Maybank into disbursing the loan to the company. Pursuant to this and the other forged documents submitted, Maybank confirmed that they would have been deceived if the credit department had not discovered the discrepancies in the NOAs submitted in the January Application.

## Antecedents

12     The Accused was a first offender.

## Prosecution’s Position on Sentence

13     The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 468 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for up to 10 years, and the offender shall also be liable to fine.

14     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least six to eight months’ imprisonment based on the following reasons[^2]:

> (a)     The offences involve fraud on a financial institution. It is trite that the key sentencing consideration for such cases is general deterrence, not only because of the need to safeguard Singapore’s standing as an international financial hub by ensuring that financial transactions are easily carried out and yet adequately safeguarded, but also to safeguard the integrity of these financial institutions and their exposure to financial fraud: see _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR 334</span>;

> (b)     The offences perpetuated were deliberate, premeditated and the Accused abused his knowledge and experience from his previous job as a bank officer. It is trite that a deterrent sentence should be _de rigueur_ where an offence is committed with premeditation and planning;

> (c)     The Accused abused his position of trust as Kevin’s broker. As a broker, he had a certain level of credibility and was entrusted by Kevin to obtain the loan properly. However, he made use of his knowledge from his previous job as a banking officer to try and game the system; and

> (d)     The offences involve forged documents purportedly issued by Governmental authority (e.g. NOAs from IRAS).

15     The table of precedents tendered by the Prosecution showed a flavour of sentences imposed in respect of offences under section 468 of the Penal Code, with imprisonment terms ranging from 6 to 28 months. Taking guidance from the case of _Lim Ek Kian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 58</span>, the Prosecution considered the starting point for offences under section 468 of the Penal Code to be 12 months’ imprisonment. In arriving at the proposed sentence of six months’ imprisonment, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) also referred to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lee Chee Siang_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 48</span>[^3].

16     The offender in _Lee Chee Siang_ was a telemarketing officer with Citibank. He used a customer’s NOA and particulars to apply to six different financial institutions for credit card facilities (subject matter of charges under section 468 of the Penal Code). To do so, he abused his position as an employee of Citibank to access Citibank’s computer records to obtain information (subject matter of a charge under the Computer Misuse Act). In _Lee Chee Siang_, the court observed that where the amounts involved in the charges are in the region of $4,000, the sentences would be around four to seven months’ imprisonment[^4]. Bearing in mind the amount _Lee_ had utilised as a result of the credit facility he obtained was about $4,000 and not a large amount, and also the fact that he did intend to repay the banks the credit which he had utilised[^5], the court imposed a sentence of six months’ imprisonment on the section 468 Penal Code offences.

17     In another case highlighted by the Prosecution: _Lim Chu Bok v Public Prosecutor_ (unreported, MA 90/95), a director of a company who instigated an employee to forge the signature of another director so that he may be the sole signatory of a bank account, was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment notwithstanding there was no monetary loss.

18     The Prosecution submitted that the fact that there was no or low monetary loss in both these cases was only one factor to consider. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor urged the Court to consider the high potential loss, the purpose of the forgery as well as the outright gain to the Accused in the form of commission, in finding that a sentence of six to eight months’ imprisonment in this case would be a fair sentence[^6].

## Decision on Sentence

19     Defence Counsel sought a “_hefty fine_” and one day’s jail, on the main premise that the culpability of the Accused’s act and the harm caused were very low[^7]. Key aspects of the mitigation are dealt with in the paragraphs below.

### Level of Culpability

20     It was undisputed that no loss was occasioned by the Accused’s act of forgery since no loan was disbursed by Maybank eventually. However, in my view, the fact that the loan was not disbursed did not affect the level of culpability of the Accused, even though it may be relevant in sentencing since it impacted on the level of harm caused by the act of the Accused. On the facts, I could not agree with Defence Counsel’s assessment of the level of the Accused’s culpability: -

> (a)     Notwithstanding the fact that no loss was suffered by Maybank, the offence of forgery under section 468 of the Penal Code was complete when the Accused altered Kevin's NOA for YA 2014 by inflating Kevin's income by $13,875. His intention to cheat Maybank was well-manifested when he submitted the forged document in support of an application for a loan on behalf of Kevin's company;

> (b)     It was not just a single document which the Accused forged. In this case, the Accused had forged the NOA for YA 2013 and 2014 and also changed the figures in the company's 2013 financial statement for the January application (subject matter of TIC charges);

> (c)     Defence Counsel’s emphasis on the fact that the application for the loan was terminated in the early stages of the application process was of no credit to the Accused. It was due to the vigilance of Maybank officers who uncovered discrepancies in the loan application documents which subsequently compelled the Accused to withdraw the application before any further action was taken on it by the bank[^8];

> (d)     The Accused’s position that that the loan application would not have gone through in any case due to the wrong selection of loan facility by the Accused[^9] (even if the discrepancies in the documents had not been discovered) also did not mitigate the culpability of the Accused. He had forged the documents with the intention of cheating Maybank, only to have his efforts thwarted by his own “_incompetence_”, as the Prosecution described it[^10];

> (e)     Similarly, the continued working relationship between Maybank and the Accused, the retention of the Accused's services as a Maybank agent and the impression that Maybank did not consider itself a victim of the forgery (facts as highlighted by Defence Counsel), did not in any way reduce the level of culpability of the Accused.

21     I agreed with the Prosecution that offences were pre-meditated and deliberate, even if they were arose from a “_momentary lapse of judgment_”[^11], as submitted by Defence Counsel. The creation and submission of a forged NOA was calculated to deceive Maybank and to increase the applicant’s (Kevin’s) chances of obtaining the loan from Maybank. There was also a fair degree of an abuse of trust as the Accused was Kevin’s broker. He had been tasked with the responsibility of applying for the bank loan on Kevin’s behalf and he chose to do it in this manner. One may surmise the Accused’s motivations in doing so since he himself stood to gain financially in the event the loan was approved.

### Level of Harm

22     Further, whilst no actual loss was caused, a fair degree of potential loss could have been occasioned by the wrongful conduct of the Accused if the bank had been any less vigilant. In this case, the minimum loan application amount was $20,000[^12]. There was potential harm which ought to be considered in sentencing. I could not agree with the Defence that the level of harm was “_zero_” just because the quantum of loan was unspecified[^13].

23     The forgery in this case was not simple forgery between private individuals but involved fraud on a financial institution. The sentencing considerations in cases of this nature are well-established in case law. As submitted by the Prosecution, there was a need to safeguard the integrity of financial institutions and their exposure to financial fraud. The sentence imposed must therefore embody a measure of general deterrence.

### The Appropriate Sentence

24     Taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the reasons above, I was satisfied that a fine would not be sufficient, and a short custodial sentence more than one day’s imprisonment was warranted.

25     However, whilst I agreed with most of the Prosecution’s submissions in respect of sentence as highlighted above, I did not find a strong basis for Prosecution’s proposed sentence of six months’ imprisonment. In my view, the level of culpability of the Accused was lower than that of the offender in _Lee Chee Siang_, who used the NOA of one Ong Chin Lim (“Ong”) to apply for credit card and credit facilities to different banks. He stated his own residential address as the correspondence address and appended his signature on the application forms[^14]. He effectively impersonated as “Ong” in applying for the credit facilities. At the material time, Lee was working in Citibank as a Telemarketing officer and had abused his position as an employee of Citibank to access Citibank’s computer records in order to obtain information which could aid in his application of a credit card from Citibank itself. Even though this act constituted a separate charge under the Computer of Misuse Act, Lee’s actions affected his overall culpability. In _Lee Chee Siang_, there was also actual loss suffered by the bank, even though it was unsubstantial. At the time of the conviction, there was $1,000 left unpaid on the credit card. That led the court to recognise that the banks were exposed to a serious risk that Lee may not be able to repay i.e. the potential harm[^15]. I found the facts in the case of _Lee Chee Siang_ more aggravated than the current case.

26     Undoubtedly and as mentioned, there was potential harm in this case which must be considered in sentencing. However, be it due to the incompetence of the Accused and/or the vigilance of Maybank officers, the undisputed fact remained that the application for the loan was terminated at a very early stage of the process and no actual loss was suffered by the bank in any way. There was no actual harm occasioned by the wrongful conduct of the Accused. It was necessary that the sentence imposed in this case did not overlook this key fact, whilst bearing in mind the culpability demonstrated by the Accused.

27     On the level of culpability, Prosecution added that the Accused had “abused his knowledge and experience from his previous job as a bank officer; he made use of his knowledge from his previous job as a banking officer to try and game the system”[^16]. However on the facts, it was unclear how the Accused, having worked at UOB and OCBC as an SME bank officer, selling loan products to customers[^17], had leveraged on his previous experience as a banking officer to “game the system”. It is true that the Accused had forged the documents to put forth a stronger financial position in respect of Kevin and so increase Kevin’s chances of obtaining the loan from Maybank but I was not fully satisfied that such knowledge was exclusive to persons working or who had worked in the banking industry before. There was no elaboration on this particular submission by the Prosecution.

28     Cases involving forgery offences under section 465 of the Penal Code have observed that where no monetary loss was caused, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was appropriate. See: _Public Prosecutor v Mazlan bin Duaji_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 116</span>_; Public Prosecutor v Kwa Tian Hwa_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 119</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Zkert M Rushdi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 243</span>. I was mindful that the Accused was convicted of a forgery offence under section 468 of the Penal Code, a more serious charge. However, bearing in mind the level of culpability and the level of harm, including the fact that the loan application was terminated in its very early stages with no further trouble for the bank, I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment in respect of an Accused who was a first offender and had pleaded guilty, would constitute adequate punishment for him. It was also a sentence which was sufficiently deterrent in nature.

29     The Accused filed this appeal in person and is currently on bail, pending the hearing of this appeal.
