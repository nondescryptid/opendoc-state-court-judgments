6 February 2020

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap. 50A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), for knowingly causing his Apple MacBook laptop to perform a function for the purpose of securing access without authority to the VISA payment network, and using a DBS Bank VISA credit card bearing number XXX issued to one Chan Hian Yi (“the credit card”) to make purchases totalling $9,263 from the merchant “Apple Online Store-SG”.

2       The offence was committed during or around 7 April 2018 to 28 March 2019, spanning multiple transactions, and the charge was amalgamated and read with s 11A of the Act.

3       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification, and was found guilty and convicted. After hearing the parties on sentencing and mitigation, I imposed a term of **three month’s imprisonment** on the accused.

4       At the accused’s request, the commencement of sentence was deferred to 2 March 2020, and the accused was released on bail. He is now appealing against the sentence imposed.

## Statement of Facts

5       The accused was previously one of three co-founders of E-Commerce Enablers Pte Ltd (“the company”), which was established in 2014. The company runs the mobile application, ‘Shopback’. The accused was the Chief Technology Officer in the company before he left in December 2017 over some disagreements.

6       The credit card was a corporate credit card issued to the director of the company, Chan Hian Yi. The physical credit card was kept by the company’s finance team. While the accused worked for the company, the finance team had used the credit card details to make corporate payments via the accused’s personal MacBook. In this manner, the 16 digit credit card number came to be saved in the Clipboard function of the MacBook. The accused also learned the expiry date and CVV number of the credit card by heart after watching his finance colleague type these details in repeatedly.

7       On or before 7 April 2018, the accused decided to use the credit card to pay for personal purchases on the Apple’s Singapore online store, while knowing that he was not authorised to do so. The payment was approved, and no one from the company contacted the accused regarding the matter. The accused thus continued to use the credit card for further purchases, using his personal MacBook.

8       Using the credit card, the accused made a total of 13 orders, with a total of 22 items, from the Apple online store from 7 April 2018 to 28 March 2019. In total, he obtained a total of $9,263 worth of products, as set out below:

9       The company’s head of finance lodged a police report in respect of this matter on 1 April 2019. The accused subsequently made full restitution of $9,263.

## Antecedents

10     The accused is untraced.

## Mitigation

11     The accused was not represented and mitigated on his own behalf.

12     He informed the court that he had resolved the differences between himself and the other co-founders of the company, and had made multiple trips to the company to “undo” what he did. The other co-founders had also tried to “withdraw” the case against him. He acknowledged that what he did was wrong, but requested for a non-custodial sentence to be imposed, so that he could “repair” what he did.

13     The accused informed that his wife was in her last trimester and due to give birth soon. His father is 71 years old and retired.

14     The accused also informed that out of the list of items purchased, only the last two items (purchased in March 2019) were his personal purchases. When queried as to why he had made the other purchases, he initially said that he had bought the items to chalk up an amount of $3000 so that a message would be sent by the bank to his partner, but could not elaborate further as to why. He later admitted that he had no explanation for what he did.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

15     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents and asked for a term of three months’ imprisonment. In particular, the Prosecution pointed out that the offence took place over a number of months, and involved multiple transactions with increasing amounts. Hence, there was a degree of premeditation and persistent offending which ought to be taken into account in sentencing.

16     The table of cases tendered by the Prosecution involved a range of sentences under s 3(1) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A) (“CMCA”) from one month to five months’ imprisonment.

## My decision

17     The main issue in this case is whether the custodial threshold has been crossed.

18     The principle of general deterrence takes precedence in cyber-crime offences, as stated by the High Court in _PP v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[20\]. Cyber-crime undermines “public and international confidence in the commercial integrity and viability of our computer systems”, and also “gravely compromises Singapore’s efforts to position itself as a global e-commerce hub.” This concern holds all the more true in the digital world we live in today, where a significant portion of our commercial transactions takes place online and hence a corresponding need to ensure the reliability of such transactions. In addition, cyber-crimes are easy to commit but difficult to detect. A deterrent sentence is therefore necessary.

19     While a deterrent sentence may not always take the form of a custodial sentence, I was of the view that a custodial term was necessary in the present case due to a number of aggravating factors:

> (a)     This was not a one-off impulsive offence committed by the accused. The offence involved multiple transactions which took place over the course of almost a year. In addition, as the Prosecution pointed out, the accused appeared to get more daring as the months went by, as demonstrated by the value of the transactions. There is no indication that he would have stopped his offending if a police report had not been lodged.

> (b)     There was a breach of trust in that the accused had come by the credit card details in the course of his work in the company. No matter what the quarrel he had with the company, there was simply no excuse for his behaviour which persisted for almost a year.

> (c)     The total value of the transactions amounted to $9,263.

20     The case precedents[^1] as cited by the Prosecution also demonstrate that custodial terms have generally been meted out for similar offences:

> (a)      **_PP v Muhammad Hamdan Bin Juhaimi_** (unreported, DAC 908364-2014 & Ors)) – The accused (untraced) found and kept his ex-employer’s ibanking token. The accused knew the password because he had helped to set up the ibanking account. He accessed his ex-employer’s ibanking account to transfer money to his own account on six occasions without the latter’s authorisation and knowledge. The total amount involved was $3,787. The sum involved for the proceeded charge under s 3 of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (Cap 50A) (“CMCA”) was $1,080. Full restitution was made. He was sentenced to a term of **two months’ imprisonment** for the charge under s 3(1) CMCA. He faced other charges under the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”), CMCA and the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“MDA”).

> (b)      **_PP v Nadia Sherilyana Sami’an_** (unreported, DAC 369-2012 & Ors) – The accused (traced for theft) dishonestly took two ATM cards from two victims without consent, and used the cards to access their bank accounts and made two unauthorised fund transfers to bank accounts belonging to her stepmother and an acquaintance. The sum involved for the charge under s 3(1) CMCA was $4,330. No restitution was made. She was sentenced to a term of **four months’ imprisonment** for the charge under s 3(1) CMCA. She faced other charges under the PC and MDA.

> (c)      **_PP v Kapoor Pardeep_** (unreported, DAC 905748-2018 & Ors) – The accused (untraced) found the victim’s credit card and misappropriated it. He used it to make two online transactions. The proceeded CMCA charge involved an amount of $191.13. No restitution was made because although the accused offered, the victim could not be contacted to facilitate this. He was sentenced to **one month’s imprisonment** for the CMCA charge. He faced other charges under s 403 and s 417 of the PC involving the same credit card.

> (d)     In **_PP v Muhammad Nizan Bin Sahar_** (unreported, MAC 908702-2017 & Ors) – The accused (untraced) misappropriated the victim’s handbag and its contents, which included a credit card. He used the card to make one store purchase to the amount of $60.75. This was the subject matter of the CMCA charge. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to **two months’ imprisonment** for the CMCA charge. He faced other charges under s 403 and s 379 of the PC.

21     I did not find that there were any exceptional factors in the present case to warrant a departure from the usual norm of a custodial term. The main thrust in the accused’s mitigation plea was that he had made full restitution and that the co-founders i.e. the victims, had forgiven him. The fact that full restitution had been made was a relevant factor which I took into account in sentencing but I did not think that this factor alone would take the case out of the custodial threshold. This is especially in view of the aggravating factors set out at \[19\] above.

22     The other factors raised in mitigation were the accused’s own family circumstances, and the fact that his wife would be delivering soon. However, absent exceptional circumstances, personal hardship or hardship to an accused’s family resulting from the criminal conviction and sentence carries very little, if any, weight in mitigation. (See **_PP v Tan Fook Sum_** <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[31\]) There were no such exceptional circumstances in the present case.

23     Given that (a) the principle of deterrence applied, (b) there were aggravating circumstances in the present case and (c) the case precedents, I was of the unequivocal view that a custodial term was called for in the present case.

24     The maximum fine for the offence under s 3(1) of the CMA is $5,000.

25     In determining the length of the custodial term to be imposed, I took into account the fact that the accused was a first time offender and had made full restitution. Based on the precedents cited, I agreed with the prosecution that a term of **three months’ imprisonment** was appropriate and sufficient, and imposed it accordingly.

## Conclusion

26     In all the circumstances, I was of the view that the sentence of three months’ imprisonment was appropriate and justified. At the accused’s request, I allowed the sentence to be deferred to about a month after the estimated due date of his child, and the accused was released on bail accordingly.
