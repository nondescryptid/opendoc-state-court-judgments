Tort – Negligence

29 May 2020

### District Judge Lynette Yap:

## Introduction

1       On 7 March 2015, sometime after 3.00am, a traffic accident occurred between a car driven by the plaintiff and a Transcab taxi driven by the defendant along the Central Expressway (CTE) in the Chin Swee tunnel towards Outram Park exit. The plaintiff suffered personal injuries as well as damage to his car and brought this claim in negligence against the defendant.

2       The plaintiff and the defendant gave very different accounts of how the accident had taken place. The plaintiff claimed that he was driving his car along the centre lane of the 3-lane carriageway of the CTE, when the defendant, who was driving his taxi along the first lane from the right, swerved left abruptly and collided into the right side (near the front) of the Plaintiff’s car, causing the Plaintiff to lose control of his car, which ended up spinning 180 degrees to face oncoming traffic.

3       The defendant on the other hand contended that he was driving his taxi along the centre lane when his taxi broke down[^1]. He turned on his hazard lights and waited for traffic to clear so that he could alight from his taxi and take out the breakdown sign. While he was waiting, the plaintiff collided into the rear portion (towards the left) of his taxi.

## Issue to be determined

4       The issue before the court was purely a factual one: which account of the accident was more likely to have occurred? It is pertinent to note, in this respect, that the defendant did not advance an alternative version in his Defence (Amendment No. 2). In the defendant’s closing submissions (“DCS”), he accepted that contributory negligence of the plaintiff was not an issue before the court[^2]. Therefore the issue was, which of the distinctly different versions of the accident advanced by the parties had occurred, in which case responsibility for the accident would wholly rest on either the plaintiff or the defendant respectively.

## My decision

5       Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, on a balance of probabilities, I accepted the plaintiff’s account. The defendant has appealed against my decision and I now set out the full grounds of my decision.

### The physical damage to the vehicles

6       I considered whether the physical evidence corroborated the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s account. Based on photographs taken of the vehicles after the accident, I found that the physical damage to both vehicles supported the plaintiff’s account. This conclusion was consistent with the opinion of the plaintiff’s accident reconstruction expert.

#### The physical damage to the defendant’s taxi

7       The photographs showed that the damage to the defendant’s taxi was at its left side and not its rear, as follows:

> (a)     Substantial damage was observed on the left side of the taxi. There were two holes on the left side of the rear bumper and dents on the rear left wheel rim, fender and rear left door. These indicated that there had been direct impact with the left side of the taxi. The following photograph showed that the damage was to the left side of the taxi[^3].

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image1.png)

> (b)     In contrast, there was no damage to the taxi’s rear portion. The following photograph was the only photograph exhibited by the defendant in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of the rear portion of his taxi[^4]. It showed that the side edges of the taxi’s rear boot lid were not bent or dented, indicating that there had not been any direct impact to the taxi’s rear.

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image2.png)

#### The physical damage to the plaintiff’s car

8       The photographs showed that the damage to the plaintiff’s car was confined to its right side (near the front), and the right front wheel. This damage was extensive. However, the front portion of the plaintiff’s car was not damaged at all. A photograph of the front of the plaintiff’s car[^5] is reproduced below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image3.png)

9       In short, the objective evidence in the form of photographs showed that the physical damage was to the respective sides of the two vehicles, and that the damage occurred by way of a side-to-side collision. This was consistent with the plaintiff’s account of the defendant swerving into his path from right to left, while firmly contradicting the defendant’s account that his taxi had been stationary on the centre lane when it was collided into by the plaintiff’s car from behind.

### The position of the vehicles after the accident

#### The position of the defendant’s taxi after the accident

10     The defendant alleged that he had been hit in the rear (towards the left) while he was stationary in the centre lane, as illustrated in the sketch plan which was attached to his police report and his Singapore Accident Statement[^6] (which he submitted to Transcab’s insurer) reproduced below. In the sketch plan, the defendant’s vehicle is labelled “A” and the plaintiff’s vehicle is labelled “B”:

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image4.png)

11     It was difficult to reconcile the defendant’s account with the angled position of the defendant’s taxi after the accident. It was evident from the following photograph[^7] that, post-collision, the taxi’s front came to rest in about the centre of the centre lane, angled towards the left, and its rear was close to the extreme right lane. This angled position was inconsistent with the defendant’s account that he had been in a stationary position in the centre lane, and that the plaintiff had collided into his rear.

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image5.png)

12     Had the plaintiff’s car collided into the rear portion (towards the left) of the defendant’s taxi, as claimed by the defendant, it was far more probable that the defendant’s taxi would have been pushed to angle to the right rather than the left. The angle of the defendant’s taxi after the accident was more consistent with the plaintiff’s account that the defendant was in the midst of switching from the right lane to the centre lane when a side-to-side collision occurred.

#### The position of the plaintiff’s car after the accident

13     The position of the plaintiff’s car after the accident was also inconsistent with the defendant’s account of the plaintiff’s car colliding with the defendant’s taxi from the rear. The following photograph showed the plaintiff’s car after the accident[^8].

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image6.png)

14     The plaintiff’s car ended in the left-most lane, a few metres in front of the defendant’s taxi, having spun 180 degrees to face oncoming traffic following the collision. This was far more consistent with the plaintiff’s account of the defendant’s taxi having collided side-to-side with the plaintiff’s car (i.e. the left side of the defendant’s taxi coming into contact with the right side of the plaintiff’s car). It would have been improbable for the plaintiff’s car to have somehow spun _in front_ of the defendant’s taxi, had the plaintiff collided into the defendant’s taxi from the _rear_, as the defendant claimed.

### The GPS data and the reports of the traffic accident reconstruction experts

15     Each party called a GPS expert and a traffic accident reconstruction expert to support their account of what had transpired.

#### The GPS data

16     The defendant relied on the GPS records of his taxi to prove that the taxi was stationary at 3.28am, and that between 3.28am and 3.29am, there were annotations to show that the defendant turned the taxi’s ignition off and on twice and the taxi remained stationary thereafter. In my view, this evidence is inconclusive. Although the plaintiff had given an estimate of the time of the accident to be at or about 3.40am, the exact time of the accident between the vehicles is unknown. While the GPS data does indicate that the defendant had turned the taxi’s ignition off and on twice, it is inconclusive as to whether this occurred before or after the accident.

17     The inconclusiveness of the GPS data was acknowledged by the defendant’s own GPS expert Mr Adrian Long, who agreed with the plaintiff’s GPS expert Mr Lim Chee Wee that based on the data provided, it was impossible to determine whether the defendant’s taxi had been in motion or stationary at the time of the accident[^9].

18     The defendant’s GPS expert acknowledged that Transcab taxis did not have a G sensor and could not have determined the location of the defendant’s taxi in the tunnel[^10]. He also admitted that from 3.26am, the defendant’s taxi appeared to have entered the CTE tunnel. There was no GPS and GSM signal as there was no line of sight to the GPS satellite, and no data on the taxi’s location was recorded[^11]. Since the GPS signal was lost, the satellite would fix the taxi’s location at its last position outside the tunnel[^12].

19     The defendant contended that the GPS data was subject to the presumptions of authenticity and accuracy set out in section 116A(2) and (1) of the Evidence Act respectively. With regards to authenticity, I was satisfied that the GPS data was authentic. With regards to accuracy, I accepted that the GPS records accurately showed that the defendant turned the taxi’s ignition off and on twice, and that by implication, the taxi was stationary at some point. However, the GPS data neither showed where the taxi was inside the tunnel, nor whether the taxi was stationary before or after the accident. This was specifically acknowledged by the defendant’s own GPS expert Mr Adrian Long, hence it was not even his own evidence that the GPS data was accurate in these respect. Therefore, the defendant’s own expert’s evidence had rebutted any presumption of accuracy as far as this particular issue was concerned.

#### The reports of the accident reconstruction experts

20     Both parties called accident reconstruction experts to support their accounts of the accident. The plaintiff called Mr Ang Bryan Tani (“Mr Ang”) of LKK Auto Consultants Pte Ltd and the defendant called Mr Melvin Lum (“Mr Lum”) of Koays Accident Reconstruction Pte Ltd. Both experts submitted a report with their opinions on the cause of the accident.

21     Both experts relied on different methods of analysis to support their opinions. The defendant’s accident reconstruction expert sought to establish that the defendant’s taxi was stationary around the time of the accident and relied on two key points – the GPS data and calculations based on the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The plaintiff’s accident reconstruction expert focused on the damage pattern of the vehicles and a technical analysis based on the accident scene photographs and a consideration of the point where the vehicles came into contact with each other.

22     I found the report of the plaintiff’s accident reconstruction expert to be much more useful in assisting me to arrive at my decision. He explained that:

> (a)     The two dents found on the rear left wheel rim of the defendant’s taxi indicated that the taxi’s left rear wheel rim was rotating at impact, as the dents were opposite each other, facing the centre of the wheel rim. If the taxi had been stationary, its wheels would not have been rotating and the direction of the two dents would have been in the same direction i.e. rear to front, following the direction of impact. The analysis from his report[^13] is reproduced below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image7.png)

> (b)     The damage to the defendant’s taxi indicated there had been direct impact with the left side of the taxi. Substantial damage was observed on the left side of the taxi. There were two holes on the left side of the rear bumper, dents on the left of the rear fender above the rear left wheel, dents on the rear left wheel rim and dents on the lower part of the rear left door, adjacent to the rear left wheel. The analysis from his report[^14] is reproduced below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image8.png)

> (c)     The plaintiff’s car sustained extensive impact damage confined to a single area. Analysing the photograph of the plaintiff’s car referred to in paragraph 8 above, damage was observed to be confined to the car’s right side (near the front) and right front wheel. This was consistent with my finding that the front portion of the plaintiff’s car was not damaged at all.

> (d)     The physical damage to both vehicles supported the plaintiff’s account that the damage occurred by way of a side-to-side collision since the damage was to the respective sides of the two vehicles. The analysis from his report[^15] is reproduced below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0130_Image/[2020] SGDC 0130_image9.png)

23     His detailed analysis was supported by reference to photographs of the accident scene and photographs of the damage to the taxi and the car. He concluded that what had happened at the material time was as follows:

> (a)     The defendant’s taxi was travelling on the extreme right lane whereas the plaintiff’s vehicle was on the second lane from the right, along the left and slightly towards the rear of the taxi;

> (b)     The taxi encroached into the travelling path of the plaintiff’s vehicle as the taxi changed lanes;

> (c)     The right front body of the plaintiff’s vehicle then collided onto the left rear body of the taxi. Simultaneously, the plaintiff steered towards the left. I found this to be a likely reaction of a driver to an impact to the right side of his vehicle;

> (d)     The impact and steering action resulted in the plaintiff’s vehicle spinning 180 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction before coming to a complete stop on the extreme left lane with its front facing against the flow of traffic; and

> (e)     The taxi stopped in an angled position by the braking action of its driver[^16].

24     In contrast, I found the defendant’s accident reconstruction report to be of much less assistance as his report primarily focused on the GPS records in a 3-minute period around the time of the accident and calculations based on the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.

25     With regards to the GPS data, the defendant’s accident reconstruction expert stated that between 3.25am and 3.28am, there was “a gradual decrease in speed from 50 km/h to 0 km/h over the span of approximately 3 minutes” and “it is highly unusual for any driver to take 3 minutes to slow to a stop after a collision”[^17]. However, as indicated above, the defendant’s own GPS expert had conceded that the GPS system in the taxi was not linked to the odometer of the taxi and did not show its actual speed[^18]. The defendant’s GPS expert further admitted that at 3.26am and 3.27am, there was no GPS and GSM signal and no data had been recorded, because the defendant’s taxi had entered the CTE tunnel and there was no line of sight to the GPS satellite[^19]. It is therefore plain that the apparent decrease in speed was affected by the taxi’s GPS signal being lost, since the defendant’s GPS expert conceded that when the GPS signal was lost, the satellite would fix the taxi’s location at its last known position before entering the tunnel[^20].

26     The defendant’s counsel accepted the futility of relying on the GPS data for this purpose. In the defendant’s closing submissions, it was conceded that at 3.27am, no GPS data was transmitted from the taxi to the GPS satellite as the taxi had entered a completely sheltered portion of the tunnel[^21]. Accordingly, the analysis of the defendant’s accident reconstruction expert based on the GPS data was fundamentally flawed.

27     Next, with regards to the calculations of the defendant’s accident reconstruction expert on the speed of the defendant’s taxi when the accident occurred, one of the key parameters he had used in his calculations was the distance between the point of impact (the “POI”) and the point of rest (the “POR”) of the vehicles. He stated that he had relied on one photograph of the scene to identify the approximate POI through “regressive iteration of the gouge/scratch marks”[^22]. However, I concluded that this reliance was ill-founded, as I accepted the plaintiff’s accident reconstruction expert’s evidence that, while it was clear the accident had occurred some distance behind where the taxi eventually ended up, it was not possible to tell where exactly the vehicles had first impacted each other (the POI). This was because the point at which the wheel rim or undercarriage of the plaintiff’s car eventually broke and came into contact with the road, thereby creating the gouge marks, was not indicative of where the vehicles had first impacted each other[^23].

28     Since I found that the defendant’s accident reconstruction expert’s underlying factual assumptions regarding the distance between the POI and POR were flawed, I found that his consequential calculations and the use of the “monte carlo simulation method” were of limited assistance in determining that the defendant’s taxi had been stationary at the time of the accident.

29     In addition, I found the defendant’s accident reconstruction expert’s analysis of the physical damage to the vehicles to be inconsistent. When analysing the physical damage to the defendant’s taxi, he stated that if the defendant’s taxi “had been turning left or changing lanes…then its left rear fender, bumper and door would sustain major intrusion, its door/fender would not have sustained buckling damage, its left rear wheel assembly would have been pushed from left to rear into the vehicle…”[^24]. However, he contradicted himself when in his description of the damage to the defendant’s taxi, he conceded that the taxi’s left side (rear portion) had in fact “sustained major contact and induced damage” and its left rear fender had an “intrusion” from “left to right”[^25].

30     I also found it difficult to accept his reasoning regarding the absence of damage to the front of the plaintiff’s car, where he stated that the defendant’s taxi could not have encroached from the right since in that event the plaintiff’s car “would sustain major intrusion to its front portion”[^26]. However, the defendant’s own case was that the front of the plaintiff’s car collided into the rear of the defendant’s taxi, in which case, substantial damage to the front of the plaintiff’s car must have been even more likely. In short, the absence of any damage to the front of the plaintiff’s car, which is clear from the photographic evidence, is far more supportive of a side to side collision than a front to back collision.

31     Taken in totality, I accepted the overall conclusion of the plaintiff’s accident reconstruction expert’s report and it reinforced my finding that the plaintiff’s account of the accident had transpired.

### Further observations

32     I accepted the plaintiff’s submissions that the fact that no repairs were carried out to the defendant’s taxi other than the damage caused by the accident[^27], was inconsistent with the defendant’s account that his taxi had broken down at the material time. I agreed with the plaintiff that if the taxi had indeed broken down, there would have been some repairs to the defective parts or at least some complaints by the defendant and requests for checks to possible defective parts that caused the break down, to prevent this from occurring again. The defendant’s taxi was already in the Transcab workshop, and it made little sense not to raise this issue for investigation since it was allegedly the cause of the accident. The defendant appeared to be meticulous in reporting issues with his taxi that needed servicing and repair, as evidenced by the vehicle servicing and repair records of the defendant’s taxi from the period 17 March 2014 to 2 March 2016[^28]. Yet there were absolutely no records of any remarks or complaints that his taxi had broken down. The General Manager of Transcab taxis, Ms Jasmine Tan had also confirmed that Transcab’s mechanics had done a check on the taxi, but there was nothing wrong with the vehicle[^29].

## Conclusion

33     For the reasons given above, I accepted the plaintiff’s account of the accident, that he was driving his car along the centre lane when the defendant who was driving his taxi along the first lane from the right, swerved left abruptly and collided into the front right of the plaintiff’s car. Accordingly, I found that the defendant was negligent. The defendant had not pleaded an alternative version in his Defence (Amendment No. 2) and had conceded in his closing submissions that contributory negligence of the plaintiff was not an issue before the court. Parties had reached an agreement on the quantum of damages and I entered final judgment for the plaintiff at the agreed quantum as follows, $10,000 as general damages, $4,410.50 as injury related special damages, $28,589.50 as non-injury related special damages. I fixed costs at $18,000 with disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.
