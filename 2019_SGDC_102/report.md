Tort - Negligence – Contributory Negligence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 19/2019.\]

22 May 2019

### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

## INTRODUCTION:

1       The defendant has appealed against my decision to find entirely against him in this matter where he had reversed his vehicle into, and thus injured, the plaintiff. I set out the full reasons for my decision.

## BACKGROUND:

2       The plaintiff was a supervisor at a motor workshop at No. 19 Kim Chuan Terrace, at which this accident occurred. The defendant was the driver of a motor panel van.

3       On 10th March 2015, at about 1.30pm, the plaintiff was talking to a colleague at the front entrance to the workshop with his back to the outside. The defendant had parked his van outside the premises to make a delivery to the workshop. Upon his return, and after waiting awhile for a car behind his to move, he made a three point turn with a view to leaving the place. As he reversed his van towards the entrance of the workshop, he did not see the plaintiff at the entrance until quite late when he noticed the plaintiff turning around. The rear of defendant’s van struck and knocked down the plaintiff.

## THE PLEADINGS:

4       The plaintiff’s pleaded case is that he was standing at the front entrance of the work shop when the defendant reversed the panel van and collided into him.[^0] Amongst other particulars, the plaintiff said that the defendant had failed to see the plaintiff standing at the front entrance of the workshop in sufficient time or at all to avoid a collision and that the defendant had failed to keep a proper look out.[^1]

5       The defendant’s pleaded case denied all negligence. He averred that he was reversing carefully and slowly at the entrance after checking his rear and blind spots when the plaintiff knocked on the rear right corner of his van and alleged that the defendant’s van had knocked into him.[^2] Amongst other particulars of negligence, the defendant stated that the plaintiff had failed to have regard for his own safety by standing at the entrance.[^3]

## THE EVIDENCE:

6       In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff stated that he was at the front entrance of the workshop when the defendant reversed the van into him.[^4] In cross-examination, the plaintiff vacillated and said that he was actually within the compound of the workshop.

> QNow, you tell me that---tell His Honour that you were inside the compound. You agree that both comp---Mister, I haven’t asked a question yet. You must allow me to ask the question then you can answer to his Judge then we can be faster. I’m so sorry. Thank you, Mr. Lee. So, you agree that these are conflicting versions. Agree or not?

> AThe front entrance was the position where I stood and facing inside.

> QOkay. So, you confirm for the Judge that the accident happened at the front entrance of number 19, correct?

> AI was at the front entrance, yes.

> QAnd the front entrance that we are talking about, so His Honour can identify, is found on 2AB page 24, agree? Where the blue lorry is parked.

> AI was standing inside of the front entrance.

> QMr.---Mr. Lee, in your affidavit, you say, “At the front entrance”, then when I asked you, “Is it at the front entrance?”, you agree. Now you are telling me it was inside the front entrance. You must make up your mind, Mr. Lee. If you have a poor recollection, please tell us so. Please clarify.

> AIt was inside of the front entrance.

> QAnd could you tell us how far inside? 1 metre? 2 metre?

> ANot far---not far, just a short distance away.

> QCould you help us to tell us it---the distance? If you can’t, it’s okay, but I’m just asking you if you can help.

> A1 metre, Sir.

> QSo, is it exactly 1 metre? I think you are saying roughly 1 metre. Does that what you are to---saying? I just want to be fair to you.

> AAround 1 metre.[^5]

7       In the defendant’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he said that as he reversed slowly “into the compound of the said work shop while checking \[his\] right wing mirror”, he “suddenly saw the plaintiff who was having his back to \[his\] van seemingly talking to someone. Suddenly he turned around and I felt a slight impact at the rear of \[his\] van.”[^6]

8       In cross-examination, the defendant was to say that the plaintiff ran towards and collided into his reversing van:

| 

Q

 | 

No. That’s not my---my point. My point is, you said, “Suddenly a man who was in---inside the compound”.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, am I right that this man is the Plaintiff?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And according to your police report, the Plaintiff was inside the compound of number 19 Kim Chuan Terrace?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Not inside the gate entrance yet.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But Mr. Tan, your police report say, “A man who was in---inside the compound”.

 |
| 

A

 | 

He was inside and then he was talking and then he just ran out.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Wait, wait, wait. Now, you are saying he ran out?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, because the location where he fell onto the road, I was outside the gate.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I put it to you from reading page 2AB8 of your police report, you said the Plaintiff was inside the compound?

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

So ask---you are putting it to him?

 |
| 

Low:

 | 

Yah. That---based on his own police report, Plaintiff was inside the compound of the workshop.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Now, now you are saying or telling the Court that the Plaintiff ran out from inside the compound. Where did he run to?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He ran by the side of my vehicle. My car was reversing, so he ran over and knocked onto my car---knocked on my vehicle, sorry.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Your story is that the Plaintiff was inside the workshop, the compound, his workshop, ran towards your vehicle and knocked into your vehicle?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, your version is that, it was the Plaintiff who ran towards your motor van and bumped---knocked into your motor van. Is that correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But if we look at 2AB8, you said Plaintiff turned around after talking to his colleague and knocked onto the right rear portion of your vehicle and fell.

 |
| 

Teo:

 | 

Where you reading for?

 |
| 

Low:

 | 

2AB8, his police report.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I wa---yes, I saw him talking to his colleague, then suddenly he just make the turn and just collide and then he just knocked onto the por---knocked onto the---my vehicle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

It’s not my point, it is in your police report. You not---did not say he ran towards your vehicle, but now you are telling the Court, you are saying the Plaintiff ran towards your vehicle.

 |
| 

A

 | 

All along, in my police report, I told the police officer that he was the one who knocked onto my vehicle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. But you are now saying that he also ran towards your vehicle and knocked onto your vehicle. Is that correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, that’s my stand.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How did he knock into your vehicle?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He was talking and suddenly he just turned around and knocked into my vehicle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Are you saying that he threw his body onto your vehicle?

 |
| 

A

 | 

His whole person turned and knocked onto my car---on---onto my vehicle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So, your version now is he turned, ran and knocked onto your vehicle?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He was talking to his colleague, he was moving backwards, and then suddenly he just turned and knocked onto my car---on---onto my vehicle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Tan, now you are saying he did not run but---did he run or he---did he turn or walk backwards towards the \[inaudible\]?

 |
| 

A

 | 

He was moving backwards, and then suddenly he turned and then knocked onto my vehicle.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, all this awhile, were you still reversing your motor van into the compound of the workshop?

 |
| 

A

 | 

After he collided onto my vehicle, I stopped.[^7]

## FINDINGS:

## The plaintiff was at the entrance:

9       The learned defendant’s counsel, Mr Teo Weng Kie submitted that the plaintiff’s evidence that he was within the workshop compound when the accident occurred departed from his pleaded case. I agreed that it was not open to the plaintiff to say that he was somewhat within the workshop compound because this was not his pleaded case; see \[4\] above. In his AEIC (see \[6\] above), the plaintiff had likewise placed himself at the entrance to the workshop.

10     At the same time, I was not prepared to find that the plaintiff was outside of the workshop compound and on a public road in that the defendant’s police report placed the plaintiff inside the compound. The defendant’s police report[^8] made about three hours after the accident stated that as he reversed, “Suddenly \[the plaintiff\] who was inside the compound turn (_sic_) around after talking to his collegue (_sic_) and knock (_sic_) onto the rear right portion of my vehicle and fell.” While the defendant’s Defence did not make clear his version about the plaintiff’s location, the defendant’s AEIC (see \[7\] above) seemed to reinforce his police report that the plaintiff was within the workshop compound when he stated that he was reversing into the workshop compound.

11     Given the foregoing, including the constraints of the plaintiff’s pleaded case, I found that the plaintiff was at the entrance to the workshop compound when the accident took place. He was not on a public road, a point which, as I shall explain below at \[17\] to \[22\], went to the issue of contribution.

## The plaintiff did not run towards the van:

12     In closing submissions, Mr Teo did not refer to the defendant’s version in cross-examination. Instead, Mr Teo stated the defendant’s version as follows: “Suddenly the plaintiff knocked onto this rear right corner and alleged that the defendant’s van had knocked into him (see BA page 31 paragraph 5).”[^9] In fact the version that Mr Teo cited was the defendant’s pleaded version – see \[5\] above. The defendant’s version in the AEIC, set out at \[7\] above, was that the plaintiff turned around just before impact. I thought that there was reasonable basis in the learned plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Winston Low’s, criticism of the defendant’s inconsistencies.

13     I found the defendant’s case as he made it under cross-examination at \[8\] above rather hard to believe. His testimony was that as he reversed, the plaintiff turned around and ran towards his van, colliding into it. Both the defendant’s police report and AEIC (see \[10\] above) stated simply that the plaintiff turned around and this was followed by impact. It was therefore my finding that as the plaintiff stood at the entrance to the workshop compound talking to his colleague, the defendant reversed into the plaintiff; the plaintiff did not run towards and collide into the defendant’s van.

14     Moreover, in the disconnect between the defendant’s testimony and the closing submissions (see \[12\] above), when push came to forensic shove, lay a problem. The defendant’s testimony, being a departure from what went before, disowned his earlier version which omitted the material point that the plaintiff ran towards the van. Counsel in referring to the early, pleaded version of his client’s case implicitly disowned his client’s later, testimonial version. Each meant that the defendant’s testimonial allegation that the plaintiff ran towards and collided into his van was not to be believed.

15     My finding is that, based on the defendant’s admission in his AEIC (at \[7\] above), he saw the plaintiff with his back towards the van and then turning around.

## The defendant at fault:

16     More likely than not, the defendant mis-judged his distance from the plaintiff thus causing the accident.

## No contributory negligence:

17     In closing submissions, Mr Teo had asked for 50% contribution against the plaintiff for failing to keep a proper look out for vehicles. Mr Teo relied on _Tan Siok Yee (suing by the committee of the person and estate of Liew Chee Kong_ v _Chong Voon Kee Ivan_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 157</span> where the High Court found 50:50 in a case where a vehicle was reversing an unreasonable distance on a public road in order to use a just-vacated parking lot and struck a pedestrian who had stepped out from between parked vehicles onto the road. Justice Lai Siu Chiu’s reason for finding the plaintiff 50% contributorily negligent was that she had an equal duty as a pedestrian to mind her own welfare by keeping a watchful eye for vehicular traffic when she wished to step onto and cross the road, as may be gleaned from the following extract of the report:

> 52    There is a corresponding duty on the part of pedestrians as road users as can be seen from the following passage (at para 9-231) from the same textbook:

>> Where pedestrians seek to cross the road either near to or at places other than pedestrian crossings, they have no specific precedence and the responsibility for causing an accident more often than not will be shared between the pedestrian and the vehicle driver. Nevertheless, the court has held that a pedestrian may cross a road at ay point he chooses, provided that he takes reasonable care for his own safety. He is not obliged to cross over the road only at an adjacent or nearby light-controlled crossing \[see _Tremayne v Hill_ \[1987\] RTR 131\].

>> …

> 58    At the same time, I have no doubt that the first plaintiff was equally to blame. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no evidence to support the conclusion put forth by the defendant’s closing submission that she had stepped suddenly into the road and that the first plaintiff had failed to exercise due caution for her own safety when she crossed the road. With respect, I disagree. Why else would she not have seen the car and a station wagon at that, being reversed?

> 59    There is no provision in the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Rev Ed) or in its regulations or in our Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11, 1990 Rev Ed) that puts the onus solely on motorists to look out for pedestrians. At law, there is a corresponding duty on the part of pedestrians to watch out for oncoming traffic. Indeed, r 7 of the Highway Code specifically exhorts pedestrians not to step into the road suddenly without looking. According to ASP Lim, that duty equally applies in one-way streets. It also cannot be disputed that it is usually easier for a pedestrian to see a reversing vehicle than _vice versa_ (because every vehicle has its blind spots and a vehicle is a large object) unless the pedestrian’s view is blocked, or he or she is not alert.

> 60    I have no doubt that the first plaintiff suddenly stepped out onto the road from the kerb on the left side of the road. She did so by making her way through a gap between the vehicles parked outside the coffee shop and failed to look out for traffic in the process. Otherwise, she could not have missed seeing the car being reversed by the defendant.

18     I did not think that it would be right to hold the plaintiff contributorily negligent in any degree. The _Tan Siok Yee_ case was distinguishable because it concerned an accident on a public road.

19     What mattered, in my view, was the fact that the car workshop was undoubtedly private premises. The plaintiff was at the entrance to the workshop. This was his work place and he was engaged in conversation with a colleague about work. This being the case the plaintiff was quite within his right to feel at home there. Moreover, the workshop was near the end of Kim Chuan Terrance, a cul-de-sac, where relatively few vehicles might be expected to go to. The plaintiff would not have expected any vehicles to be visiting the workshop and, not seeing him at the entrance, collide into him. Unlike in _Tan Siok Yee_, he was not a pedestrian about to cross a public road.

20     On the other hand, a public road is generally where persons, whether in different types of conveyance or on foot, get from one place to another. The number of interactions among them is tremendous so that road traffic laws are in place to allow the public to more safely use the roads.

21     Each party pointed to action taken by the Traffic Police against the other. The plaintiff had been issued with a warning letter for breaching rule 13(2) of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules (“the Rules”) which states that “No person shall stand, sit, squat, loiter, walk or run on a _road_ in such a manner or in such a position as to interfere with the lawful movement of traffic.”[^10] (italics added) On the other hand, the defendant paid a composition fine for careless driving.[^11]

22     The Rules are issued pursuant to ss 121 and 140 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“the Act”) in which the word ‘“road” means any public road and any other road to which the public has access…’ Whilst the word “public” is not itself defined in the Act, its meaning may be found from s2 of the Act when it states that ‘“public place” means any place or premises, whether privately owned or not, to which the general public or any section of the general public is permitted to have access, whether on payment or otherwise;’ Since it is arguable that the workshop, even though privately owned, is a place to which a section of the general public having business there has access, it is arguable that the road traffic laws, including the Rules, extend to the compound of the workshop. Be that as it may, since each party did not argue the point and was content to assume that police action, whatever its factual basis concerning the location of the point of impact, was correctly taken.

23     I would mention one last point, namely, the defendant’s allegation that his van had a beeping feature when it reversed. I noted that this was not pleaded as a particular of the plaintiff’s alleged negligence. In any case, I was not persuaded that his van really did have this feature, or at any rate that it was working at the time of the accident, because his answers in re-examination appeared to me somewhat tentative.[^12]

## CONCLUSION:

24     For these reasons, my decision was that the defendant shall pay the plaintiff 100% of the damages to be assessed with costs and interest reserved to the assessing Registrar.
