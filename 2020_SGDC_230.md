> These companies are hereinafter referred to as the "Client Companies".

> **POLICE REPORTS**

> 2.    Over 2015-2016, 23 police reports were made against Soilwood and one report was made against Glen Iris, for defaulting on their repayment obligations. It appeared from the reports that Noble was the company through which the informants learnt about investment opportunities in the companies that defaulted.

> **NOBLE’S BUSINESS**

> 3.    On 12 March 2013, the accused and one Steven Ling Hoe Khing ("Steven") set up Angel Capital Consultancy Pte Ltd ("Angel Capital"). On 3 June 2014, the accused renamed Angel Capital with Noble's present name[^1] . Some time in July 2014, Steven resigned from Noble.

> 4.    Apart from Krish, which was introduced to Noble via Steven's personal connections, Noble sourced its Client Companies through newspaper advertisements and a loan broker. Noble conducted general checks to assess if the companies were profitable. Noble requested the companies to provide financial statements for the last two years, a list of their past, current and future projects, and documents evidencing payments the companies received for past projects. Prior to taking on Soilwood as a client, the accused had visited one of Soilwood's construction projects.

> 5.    In May 2014, the accused received a phone call from a Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") officer enquiring about a newspaper advertisement that Noble had put up regarding one of its public seminars as mentioned in paragraph 10 below. The MAS officer advised Nancy to seek legal advice to ensure that Noble's activities were in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in Singapore.

> 6.    The companies listed at paragraph 1 above approached Noble to help them raise funds via crowdfunding, and Noble entered into Consultancy Agreements with each of them to do so.

> 12.    Immediately after the presentations at the seminars, exhibitions, and fairs, Noble's portfolio consultants would immediately guide interested persons to fill up a reservation form with their personal particulars, and the amount they were willing to loan/invest. The reservation form would also state the rate of return on the proposed investment/loan. Anyone could invest/lend in/to the Client Companies through Noble, as long as they had the money except for moneylenders.

> 13    The consultants would later follow up with the persons who filled up reservation forms by collecting a cheque for the investment/loan amount, and obtain the person' s bank account details. The consultants would pass the person' s cheque and bank account details on to the accused or Steven, who would deposit the cheque into the Client Company's bank account and prepare two types of documents for the transaction:

>> a.     Investment[^5]/ Loan Agreements: These were made between the Client Company and the individual investor-lender. They stated the loan tenor, as well as the interest rates to be paid on the loans. (The Client Companies offered the interest rates stated in these documents based on the accused's advice.) Steven and the accused engaged solicitors to prepare the agreements (Tabs 5-8).

>> b.     Deeds of Undertaking/Personal Guarantees: These were personal guarantees provided by the directors of the Client Companies for the loans (Tabs 9-12).

> 14.    The accused or Steven would then facilitate the signing of these documents by the respective Client Company and the individual investor-lender. The Client Company would provide the accused or Steven a cheque for the principal amount of the loan, post-dated for the loan's maturation date (i.e. when the principal amount was due to be repaid), which the accused or Steven would pass on to the individual investor­ lender. At the same time, the Client Company would make a General Interbank Recurring Order ("GIRO") application to pay the regular interest payments due to the investor-lender under the Investment /Loan Agreement.

> 15.    Through this process, Noble raised the following sums from the public for the Client Companies.

> **ACCUSED'S ROLE**

> 16.    While the accused and Steven started Noble together, her role in Noble enlarged over time. The accused started running Noble in November 2013. By the time Steven left in July 2014, she was clearly Noble's directing mind. Her responsibilities in Noble included:

>> a.    Sourcing for potential borrowers;

>> b.    Conducting staff training;

>> c.    Coordinating Noble's marketing efforts;

>> d.    Creating marketing materials for the fund raising projects;

>> e.    Suggesting the terms of the loans such as the interest rate and tenor;

>> f.    Making decisions on Noble's day-to-day operations

> 17.    The accused estimated that between 2014 and 2015, she received an annual income of $150,000 as director of Noble Consulting. In 2013, her annual income as director of Noble Consulting was $140,000. Therefore, she received at least $440,000 in income from Noble between 2013-2015.

> 18.    Between 2014 and 2015, the accused entered into a loan agreement with Glen Iris to lend Glen Iris a sum of $50,000 at an interest rate of 16% per annum and Noble also entered into a loan agreement with Glen Iris to loan Glen Iris a sum of $100,000 at an interest rate of 24% per annum. Glen Iris has not repaid any sums to her.

> **DEFAULTS**

> 19.    Around February 2015, Glen Iris began to default on interest and principal repayments. Glen Iris was wound up in mid-2015, and its director was bankrupted in mid-2016.

> 20.    In August 2015, Soilwood began to default on interest and principal repayments. Its director, Daniel Leong Soon Choy ("Leong") could not be located. The accused visited the addresses of the main contractors which Leong previously said Soilwood undertook projects from, and discovered that those addresses were actually of a coffeeshop and a shophouse. No main contractors actually operated at the addresses that Leong provided.

> 21.    Pursuant to Glen Iris' and Soilwood's defaults, investor-lenders lost a total of around S$9.5m. Around 100 investor-lenders lost monies.

> 22.    At all material time, the accused and/or Noble did not hold any capital markets services license to carry on business in any regulated activity as required under section 82 of the Securities and Futures Act, Cap 289 (Rev Ed 2006).

> 23.    At all material time, the accused and/or Noble was not exempt from the requirement to hold a capital markets services licence to carry on business in any regulated activity under section 99 of the SFA.”

## Case for the Prosecution

5       The Prosecution’s position was that the offence was made out on the undisputed facts. It was further submitted as follows:

> (a)     the investment agreements / loan agreements were “debentures” as defined in s 2 of the SFA and hence were securities;

> (b)     Noble Consulting’s activities constituted “dealing in securities” as defined in s 2 and the Second Schedule of the SFA;

> (c)     the accused consented to Noble Consulting carrying on the business of dealing in securities;

> (d)     the accused did not seek legal advice on whether or not a capital markets services licence (‘CMSL”) was required to carry out Noble Consulting’s business operations; and

> (e)     even if the accused had sought legal advice, the charge against the accused under s 82 of the SFA was a strict liability offence, and the defence of reasonable care was not applicable.

## Case for the Defence

6       The accused gave evidence that she did not flout the law and that she had sought legal advice pertaining to any requirements under the SFA for her business operations from PW1 Lim Heng Chong Benny (“PW1 Lim”), PW2 Koh Khong Khai (“PW2 Koh”) and PW3 Serena Goh Mae Li (“PW3 Goh”). The Defence submitted that:

> (a)     the investment agreements / loan agreements were not “debentures” as defined in s 2 of the SFA;

> (b)     the accused did not “deal in securities” as she merely acted as a “middleman” between interested lenders and the Client Companies;

> (c)     a CMSL was not required as Noble Consulting dealt with less than 30 accredited investors, with reference to the Financial Advisers Act; and

> (d)     the accused had sought legal advice on whether she required a CMSL, or more generally, whether she or Noble Consulting was in breach of any of the applicable regulations.

## Elements of the Offence

7       The prosecution was required to prove that the accused, a director of Noble at the material time, consented to the company carrying on a business of a regulated activity, namely dealing in securities without a CMSL, which was required under the law.

8       That Noble did not possess a CMSL at all times, was not disputed. The main issues canvassed at trial was whether Noble's business model constituted a business of "dealing in securities" and whether the accused had sought legal advice on the requirement to have a CMSL in order to operate her business.

### Whether the offence was a strict liability offence and whether the defence of reasonable care was applicable

9       It was not disputed that the charge against the accused under s 82 of the SFA was a strict liability offence.

10     I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the defence of reasonable care does not apply where the offence involves mistake of law and that whether a CMSL was required was indeed a matter of law.

11     In _Chee Soon Juan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 109</span> (“_Chee Soon Juan_”) at \[52\], it was observed that, despite some academic criticism, “_the existence of the legal maxim ignorance of the law is no excuse has now been too well established and entrenched to be discarded_”.

12     The recently enacted s 79A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224), provides that a mistake of law is not a defence to an offence unless otherwise provided by written law. This was the position even prior to the enactment, as was explained in the parliamentary debates on the amendments to the Penal Code as follows (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (6-5-2019) vol 94 (Mr Amrin Amin, Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs):

> The Bill clarifies defences. First, the law on mistake. The amendments in clauses 21 and 22 will not change the existing law. There are two types of mistake – mistake of fact and mistake of law. First, it will continue to be the case that ignorance of law and mistake of law will not be a defence…

13     In _Chee Soon Juan_, the Court observed as follows on the issue of whether a permit was required for an activity was a matter of law (at \[51\]):

> “Having carefully considered the matter, I am however of the view that the Appellants’ contention cannot stand because it does not raise a question of fact but one of law: _viz_, was a permit required for the activity carried out by the Appellants in May and August 2008. There can be little doubt that if the Appellants were given an opinion or advice by a lay-friend, or a friend who was a law professor, or even a practising lawyer giving advice under a retainer, then their reliance on the mistaken advice or opinion would be of no avail. That must be because the law requires parties participating in such events to have a permit. The fact that an accused thought that he did not need a permit or was advised by a friend or received legal advice to that effect cannot afford him a defence because the need for a permit for certain activities is a matter of law.”

14     Accordingly, if the accused was indeed mistaken as to whether a license is required under a legislative provision, that is a mistake of law to which the defence of reasonable care would not apply. Whether the accused had indeed sought legal advice on the requirement for a CMSL, was irrelevant for the purposes of determining the accused’s guilt.

15     It was submitted that the accused had, between 2013 and 2014, engaged the services of 3 lawyers (PW1 to 3) to give advice on her business model. She claimed that she was never told that her business model flouted the law (see paragraph 43 of Defence Closing Submissions).

#### Engagement of PW3

16     In 2013, the accused, on behalf of Noble Consulting, engaged PW3 Goh, who was then a lawyer at the firm Hin Tat Augustine & Partners and had been in practice for about 10 to 11 years, to draft an agency agreement and investment agreement. The agreements were duly drafted and used for Noble Consulting’s transactions with Krish Chartered Bus Services Pte Ltd.

17     Aside from drafting the above agreements, PW3 Goh’s firm produced a written opinion on whether the accused or Noble Consulting needed to apply for a financial adviser’s licence under the Financial Advisers Act (Cap 110) (“FAA”).[^7] The opinion was that the accused or Noble Consulting would need to consider if financial advice was being given to “accredited investors” as defined in the FAA and, if that was the case, a license would not be required. PW3 Goh’s firm then invoiced Noble Consulting $5,305.06 for one substantive item, “Review of Exclusive Agency Agreement and Investment Agreement”.[^8]

18     The evidence of PW3 Goh was as follows:

> (a)     she was initially engaged to draft an agency agreement and an investment agreement[^9];

> (b)     in the course of the engagement, she raised a potential issue about financial advice being given, and suggested doing a brief review to see if the accused or Noble Consulting required a license, to which the accused agreed[^10];

> (c)     she was under the impression that the accused was familiar with the business and the requisite licenses, and would run checks to make sure they are not in breach of the FAA and SFA[^11];

> (d)     the SFA was mentioned because she had given “casual unsolicited advice” that Noble Consulting should not be marketing its business to members of the public through talks or marketing material because there may be a possibility that a prospectus was required[^12]; and

> (e)     she did not recall being asked by the accused to check on the rules and regulations on crowdfunding, and did not tell the accused that a license was not required for loan-based crowdfunding.[^13]

19     The accused stated the following on her dealings with PW3 Goh:

> (a)     she had explained to PW3 Goh at a meeting that Noble Consulting was doing “crowdfunding”;

> (b)     she also explained to PW3 Goh three types of “crowdfunding”: equity-based, loan-based and charitable donation-based[^14];

> (c)     after explaining the types of crowdfunding to PW3 Goh, she asked PW3 Goh to check whether there was compliance with any MAS regulations, whether there was any licensing involved, or breach of the Moneylenders' Act.[^15]

20     The accused relied on emails between her and PW3 Goh dated 26 March 2013[^16] in support of her evidence that she had specifically discussed crowdfunding with PW3 Goh. The full context of these emails was not articulated but it appears that the accused had sought legal advice relating to her employment contract with her previous company prior to starting Noble Consulting. In response to a question from PW3 Goh about possible proprietary interests her ex-company may have to protect, or whether that company’s business was based on a unique platform or formula, the accused’s reply was that the ex-company claimed to be a “Pioneer in Crowdfunding”, along with a brief explanation of what crowdfunding was.

#### Engagement of PW1

21     After consulting PW3 Goh, the accused then consulted PW1 Lim in 2014. According to her, this was for a second opinion.[^17] PW1 Lim was then a lawyer at the firm Chris Chong & CT Ho LLP specialising in corporate work, focusing on fund management and regulatory compliance, and had been in practice for about 16 years.

22     PW1 Lim’s evidence was that he was introduced to the accused by a colleague in his firm who was acting for the accused in a litigation matter.[^18] The accused wished him to include additional provisions into previously prepared agreements. PW1 Lim therefore prepared what became the agreements for Noble Consulting’s transactions with Glen Iris (Int’l) Pte Ltd and Soilwood Pte Ltd (consultancy agreements, loan agreements and personal guarantees)[^19] and his firm prepared two Statements of Charges of $5,457 each for the drafting of each set of agreements.[^20]

23     PW1 Lim stated the following:

> (a)     he was merely engaged to draft the two sets of agreements and did not provide any legal advice to the accused[^21];

> (b)     the accused had mentioned she was conducting crowdfunding, but he could not recall if she had explained the various types of crowdfunding to him[^22];

> (c)     in meeting with the accused and finding out the business activities of the accused, he was of the view and told the accused that her activities may be problematic under the SFA and FAA and she may require a CMSL for dealing in securities or advising on corporate finance[^23];

> (d)     the accused asked for some reference material on these regulations and, on PW1 Lim’s instructions, his legal assistant sent her some information on applying for exempt corporate finance adviser and exempt financial adviser status[^24];

> (e)     after PW1 Lim explained his concerns, there was a “very strong pushback” from the accused, who said that she was a middleman and that crowdfunding was a “grey area”[^25]; and

> (f)     the accused had never specifically asked him to advice on whether a license was required for her business[^26].

24     The accused’s evidence on her dealings with PW1 Lim was as follows:

> (a)     she was told by PW1 Lim that she did not require a license for moneylending as she was not operating a moneylending business and was only a broker or agent[^27];

> (b)     PW1 Lim had not raised his concerns to her that her business model might run foul of certain legislation including the SFA[^28];

> (c)     she had indeed told PW1 Lim that this was a “grey area”, meaning that she was unsure if her business required to be licensed[^29]; and

> (d)     she had asked PW1 Lim to “check” if she required a license and that was what PW1 Lim was engaged for[^30].

#### Engagement of PW2 and inquiry by MAS

25     In May 2014, the accused engaged PW2 Koh. PW2 Koh was then a lawyer with Oracle Law Corporation and had been in practice for around 17 years. PW2 Koh’s area of practice was corporate commercial work and also commercial and civil litigation.

26     Around the same time, the accused received a call from Nicholas Sim, a Deputy Director at the MAS. This was followed up by an email dated 22 May 2014 stating that the call was on 20 May 2014.[^31] MAS’s call and email were prompted by a newspaper advertisement by Noble Consulting for an event for potential investors to attend. MAS’s email referred the accused to some resources on crowdfunding to help her understand the regulatory requirements that may apply to her business, and encouraged her to seek independent legal advice that the proposed activities were in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in Singapore.

27     PW2 Koh prepared agreements used for Noble Consulting’s transactions with T S Marine Engineering Services Pte Ltd, Scantech Marine Pte Ltd and Adydas Marine Services Pte Ltd. PW2 Koh’s firm invoiced Noble Consulting $2,461 for reviewing an email and attached loan agreement and guarantee, a meeting on 21 May 2014, and reviewing and commenting on a new draft advertisement on 24 May 2014.[^32]

28     PW2 Koh stated the following in Court:

> (a)     he was engaged to review the accused’s existing templates for a loan agreement and personal guarantee and to amend the templates to cater for multiple corporate borrowers[^33];

> (b)     he was under the impression that Noble Consulting’s business had already been operating and did not give legal advice other than relating to reviewing and revising the documents[^34];

> (c)     after his first meeting with the accused, she informed him that she had a query from MAS on Noble Consulting’s advertisement, to which he told her she should clarify with MAS and her existing lawyers and play it safe in the meantime by cancelling the advertised event[^35];

> (d)     the accused had asked him to review the wording of the advertisement to which his response was (in an email on 23 May 2014[^36]) that the advertisement accurately captured that she was doing financing by way of loan financing and not other forms of financing[^37];

> (e)     when the accused engaged him, her business was already running for one or two years, so the issue of licensing requirements for her business did not arise, and he did not advise her on the provisions of the SFA or licensing requirements for her business.[^38]

29     The accused’s evidence on her dealings with PW2 Koh was as follows:

> (a)     she engaged PW2 Koh after receiving the call from MAS, and told him that she wanted to make sure that she was not in breach of any rules or regulations, and therefore asked him to review the agreements drafted by PW3 Goh and PW1 Lim[^39];

> (b)     she explained Noble Consulting’s business model to PW2, and that her understanding from her other two lawyers was that she did not need to be licensed, and moneylending was not illegal[^40].

30     Having reviewed the evidence in its entirety I saw no reason not to accept the collective evidence of the three prosecution witnesses (‘PW1 to 3’). Their evidence was corroborated by each other and consistent with the objective extrinsic evidence before the court.

31     At the outset, the evidence of the PW1 Lim, PW2 Koh and PW3 Goh was unequivocal that they were not engaged to advise the accused on the requirement for a CMSL. The accused’s claims that she had engaged PWs 1 to 3 to advise her on whether a license was required was not supported by any documentary evidence. There was no written opinion on the issue of whether a CMSL was required, or any evidence suggesting that the purpose of engaging PWs1 to 3 was to give advice on this issue. The respective statements of charges for services rendered did not reflect that any of them were engaged to advise on the requirement of a CMSL.

32     The accused had even conceded that she told PW1 Lim that it was a “grey area” suggesting that she was aware that her business activity may be subject to regulation. On the evidence adduced there was no basis to find that the accused had been given improper advice or that she had acted on such advice. I was satisfied that the accused’s assertions that the 3 lawyers had misguided her on the licensing requirements was an afterthought, designed to meet the current charge she is facing.

33     In any case, as observed in _Chee Soon Juan_, even if the accused was rendered improper legal advice, such advice would not exonerate her and would be no relevance to her culpability.

### Were the investment agreements / loan agreements debentures (and hence securities)

34     The Prosecution submitted that as the investment/loan agreements made between the Client Companies and the lenders were all in substance loan agreements they would fall within the definition of "debentures" under s 2 of the SFA, and were therefore "securities".

35     The Prosecution also cited the common law definition of debenture, namely that “_a debenture means any document which either creates a debt or acknowledges it_” (_Levy v Abercorris Slate and Slab Co_ (1887) 37 Ch D 260), submitting that the investment agreements and loan agreements were debentures because they created a debt or acknowledged it.

36     The SFA as in force at the material time contained the following definition of “securities”:

> s2.–(1)    …

> “securities” means –

>> …

>> (b)    debentures, stocks or shares issued or proposed to be issued by a corporation or body corporate;

>> …

> but does not include –

>> (i)    futures contracts which are traded on a futures market;

>> (ii)   bills of exchange;

>> (iii)   promissory notes;

>> (iv)   certificates of deposit issued by a bank or finance company whether situated in Singapore or elsewhere; or

>> (v)    such other product or class of products as the Authority may prescribe as not being securities.

37     “Debenture” was in turn defined as follows:

> “debenture” … includes any debenture stock, bond, note and any other debt securities issued by a corporation or any other entity, whether constituting a charge or not, on the assets of the issuer but does not include –

>> (a)    a cheque, letter of credit, order for the payment of money or bill of exchange; or

>> (b)    for the purposes of the application of this definition to a provision of this Act in respect of which any regulations made thereunder provide that the word “debenture” does not include a prescribed document or a document included in a prescribed class of documents, that document or a document included in that class of documents, as the case may be;

38     On the facts, capital was sought to be raised from investors at large. Noble’s venture appears to be precisely the type of activity which the regulatory regime in the SFA was seeking to address, with the overarching aim of safeguarding unwary investors.

39     As reflected in paragraphs 13-15 of the ASOF, it was undisputed that Noble had engaged solicitors to prepare the agreements which the Client Companies entered into with the lenders. The agreements provided for loan tenor, terms, interest rates, security on the loans and default consequences. PW1 Lim, PW2 Koh, and PW3 Goh who had assisted to draft the said agreements collectively affirmed that these agreements were meant to serve as legally binding loan agreements.

40     There were two features of the agreements that lead to the conclusion that they were indeed debentures, and hence securities, under the SFA. The sole purpose of the agreements was for the Client Companies to raise capital and the lender to make a profit; and the arrangements were marketed to the general public and not merely specific lenders known to the Client Companies.

41     I accordingly found that as these agreements would amount to "debentures" falling within the definition "securities" for the purposes of s 2 of the SFA.

### Was Noble carrying on a business in the regulated activity of dealing in securities

42     Section 82(1) of the SFA provides that no person shall carry on business in any regulated activity, unless he holds a CMSL for that regulated activity. "Regulated activity" is defined in s 2 SFA as "an activity specified in the Second Schedule". Part I of the Second Schedule of the SFA includes "dealing in securities" in the list of regulated activities for the purpose of the SFA. S 82(1) SFA, provides that no one can carry on a business of "dealing in securities", unless he holds a CMSL for "dealing in securities".

43     Part Il of the Second Schedule of the SFA provides that:

> "dealing in securities" means (whether as principal or agent) making or offering to make with any person, or inducing or attempting to induce any person to enter into or to offer to enter into any agreement for or with a view to acquiring, disposing of, subscribing for, or underwriting securities”

44     As reflected in paragraphs 8 to 11 of the ASOF, it is undisputed that Noble solicited investments from the public for its clients. Noble would organise seminars, take part in investment exhibitions and fairs, create marketing materials, such as brochures and flyers, and disseminate them to potential investors; and appoint agents as portfolio consultants to solicit lenders. At the seminars, exhibitions, Noble and representatives of the client companies would make presentations to members of the public, and/or answer questions regarding Noble's role, the Client Companies' businesses, the projects which the Client Companies required funding for; and the terms of the funding/ investments that the Client Companies were seeking such as interest rates, minimum funding/ investment amounts. Noble's representatives encouraged the public to invest in the Client Companies, telling them that these companies had good future prospects.

45     In undertaking the above role Noble was clearly in the business of inducing members of the public to enter into agreements for acquiring securities and thus "dealing in securities". I was accordingly satisfied that this element of the charge was made out.

### Did the accused consent to Noble carrying on the business of dealing in securities?

46     As reflected in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the ASOF, the accused, was the directing mind behind Noble's business. Between 2014 and 2015, she had received an estimated annual income of $150,000 as director of Noble Consulting. Her responsibilities included sourcing for potential borrowers, conducting staff training, coordinating Noble's marketing efforts, creating marketing materials for the fund raising projects, suggesting the terms of the loans such as the interest rate and tenor as well as making decisions on Noble's day-to-day operations.

47     As the directing mind of Noble's business operations it follows that the accused would have consented to Noble carrying on its business of dealing in securities.

### Whether a CMSL was not required because Noble dealt with less than 30 accredited investors

48     The Defence, in making its submission that Noble did not require a CMSL because it dealt with less than 30 accredited investors, appeared to be referring to the exemption contained in the Financial Advisers Regulations. However, that exemption is for the holding of a financial adviser’s license, as opposed to a CMSL. This was clearly not a relevant consideration to the present matter.

## Conclusion

49     For the reasons set out, I found that Noble was indeed dealing in securities, a regulated activity under the SFA, without a CMSL, an offence under s 82 of the SFA. This offence was carried out with the consent and connivance of the accused, as the directing mind of Noble Consulting. The accused was thus liable for the offence under s 331 of the SFA. The accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted.

### The Prosecution’s address on sentence

50     The Prosecution urged the court to impose a deterrent sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment, highlighting the following:

> (a)     the need for deterrence, considering the public policy objectives of regulating the financial services sector, and the statutory licensing regime;

> (b)     the amount of time the accused’s business was running, 2.5 years;

> (c)     the scale of the amount of monies raised from, and lost by, the investors; and

> (d)     that the securities were promoted to members of the public.

### Mitigation Plea

51     The Defence sought a fine of $50,000, urging the court to consider the following factors in mitigation:

> (a)     the accused was the only caretaker of her mother, who was in poor health;

> (b)     the accused was a first offender;

> (c)     the proceedings were not unduly dragged out by the accused;

> (d)     the accused herself lost monies in the investments, and repaid some investors out of her own funds;

> (e)     the accused only promoted the investments and was not responsible for those investments turning sour; and

> (f)     the accused did all she could to ensure that her business model did not flout the law, by taking legal advice.

### Sentencing Precedents

52     In _PP v Tan Sock Kuan_ (DAC-920947-2017) (“_Tan Sock Kuan_”), the offender was convicted under s 82 SFA for running a fund management business, investing primarily in securities. A total of $12 million was invested by six investors, but the amount lost could not be ascertained. The offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment.

53     In _PP v Ng Ngah Hiong_ (DAC/10717/2010) (“_Ng Ngah Hiong”_), the offender was convicted under s 82 SFA also for running a fund management business, by seeking investments from mostly friends (and friends of those friends) for him to trade in stock options. In total, he collected $2,472,740 from 35 investors. The amount owing to the investors was about $500,000. The offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment.

54     The Prosecution submitted the following with respect to the above precedents:

> (a)     that there was no dishonesty involved on the part of the offenders, similar to the present case;

> (b)     the total amounts invested were of a similar magnitude, although lower than in the present case;

> (c)     the loss suffered was $500,000 in _Ng Ngah Hiong_, and was not quantified in _Tan Sock Kuan_.

> (d)     the number of investors involved in both the cases was less than the 145 in the present case;

> (e)     the period of offending was similar – both cases took place over an approximate two year period;

> (f)     the offenders in both _Tan Sock Kuan_ and _Ng Ngah Hiong_ pleaded guilty, unlike the present case.

## Sentencing Considerations

55     In sentencing the accused, I had regard to the following:

> (a)     the scale of Noble’s business and the substantial amounts involved;

> (b)     Noble’s business was wide-reaching – the securities promoted by the accused were promoted to the public at large through newspaper advertisements for seminars, at investment fairs and exhibitions, and through the dissemination of brochures and flyers; and

> (c)     Noble’s operations were organised and extensive; it had many employees and salespersons to carry out the promotion of the securities.

56     The potential harm caused by such organised and large scale operations is heightened, since, aside from the securities being promoted to more people, a member of the public encountering Noble would have reason to assume that it possessed any requisite licenses and complied with any applicable regulations, unlike _Ng Ngah Hiong_, where the offender undertook to manage funds on behalf of friends and acquaintances on a personal and informal basis.

57     I was also not convinced that the accused did all she could to ensure that Noble’s business was in compliance with the law as claimed by the Defence. At the outset, the evidence of the PW1 Lim, PW2 Koh and PW3 Goh was unequivocal that they were not engaged to advise the accused on the requirement for a CMSL, contrary to the assertions made by the accused. The accused’s claims that she had engaged them to advise her on whether a license was required was not supported by any documentary evidence. There was no written opinion on the issue of whether a CMSL was required, or any evidence suggesting that the purpose of engaging the respective lawyers was to give advice on this issue. The accused had conceded that she told PW1 Lim that it was a “grey area”. The accused was cognizant of the risks involved. The weight of the evidence points to her having made no efforts to seek any clarity regarding this “grey area”. Despite the alert from MAS in May 2014, the accused had continued with her business activities. As a result, unsuspecting members of the public lost a total of around $9.5 million.

## Sentence

58     All considered the accused was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of eight months. She is currently on bail pending appeal.
