17 September 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 353 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224).

2       After hearing parties’ submissions, I sentenced the Accused to three weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused was dissatisfied with the sentence and he appealed.

## THE FACTS

3       The circumstances of the offence as set out in the statement of facts (“SOF”) were as follows -

> “5.    On 4 January 2018, at around 7.00pm, the accused went drinking at Clarke Quay with his friends. After they finished drinking, the accused’s friends sent him home as he was drunk. When the accused reached home at around 10.00pm, the complainant brought him to the master bedroom to rest. However, the accused started shouting and behaving in a rowdy manner. He also grabbed the complainant by her arms and threatened to assault her. As the complainant feared for her safety, she ran out of the master bedroom and instructed her domestic helper to hold on to the handle of the door while she called the police at or about 10.41pm.

> 6.    The victim and his partner arrived at the scene at or about 10.53pm. The complainant, who appeared visibly distressed, unlocked the metal gate for them and told them that the accused was in the master bedroom. After the police officers entered the house, they saw the complainant’s domestic helper holding on to the handle of the door to the master bedroom. As they approached the door, the police officers heard the accused pounding loudly on the door and shouting “cao ni ma”, which means “fuck your mother” in Mandarin Chinese, several times. The victim told the accused to calm down before opening the door. The accused then walked out of the master bedroom in his underwear towards the police officers, slamming the door in the process. This prompted the police officers to back away and draw their t-batons. The police officers told the accused to back off, before holstering their t-batons when the accused calmed down a little. 2 other police officers arrived at the scene at around this time.

> 7.    Over the course of more than an hour, the police officers tried to find out from the accused what happened but he was uncooperative and refused to tell them what happened. The accused also continued to shout at the top of his voice sporadically despite the police officers telling him not to do so. In the course of his interactions with the police officers, the accused scolded one SGT Teo Teck Chuan “sha bi”, which translates to “dumb fuck” in Mandarin Chinese, at least 4 times. The accused also told SGT Teo in Mandarin Chinese “wo ta ma de yao shi zai zhong guo wo jiu da si ni le”, which translates to “I fucking beat you to death if (this is) in China”. Furthermore, the accused shouted “cao ni ma”, which means “fuck your mother” in Mandarin Chinese, at one SGT Tee Peng Sheng. The police officers observed that the accused reeked of alcohol.

> 8.    While his fellow police officers talked to the accused, the victim went to talk to the complainant in the master bedroom and found out from her that she called the police because she was worried for her own safety as the accused had strangled her at a family dinner when he got drunk about 2 years ago. As the accused started to shout at the top of his voice and sounded highly agitated, the victim left the master bedroom and went to the living room to see what was going on.

> 9.    On 5 January 2018, at or about 12.05am, the accused tried to walk towards the master bedroom to find the complainant. The victim, concerned about the safety of the complainant, and in the execution of his duty as a police officer, brought the accused towards the sofa away from the master bedroom. At the sofa, the accused repeatedly shouted that the police were restricting his personal freedom and there was a struggle which led the victim to restrain the accused. While the victim was trying to restrain the accused, the accused pushed the victim in the chest which caused the victim to fall onto a sofa behind him. The police officers then arrested the accused a few minutes later. He continued to be uncooperative, refused to walk on his own, and continued shouting at the top of his voice as the police officers brought him away. The victim did not suffer any injury.”

4       Three video footages of the offence recorded from the body camera of the police officers were played back in court.

5       The Accused was a first offender.

## DPP’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

6       In his oral submission, DPP Ng Jun Chong made his case for a sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment. He argued that the overriding sentencing principle was deterrence. Police officers should be protected when they were discharging their lawful duty. They were a class of persons who received the special protection of the law, given that they were exposed to danger and hazards every day.

7       DPP Ng pointed out that the Accused was highly intoxicated when he committed the offence. In _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor[^1]_ (“_Wong Hoi Len_”), intoxication was ordinarily treated as an aggravating factor (at \[26\], \[43\] and \[48\] of the judgment). DPP Ng submitted that this should be the case here. The Accused’s intoxication had led to his persistent uncooperativeness and blatant disregard for authority. DPP Ng also pointed out that the push which the Accused committed on the victim was not a slight one. One of the video footage clearly showed that the victim had fallen backwards heavily onto a sofa.

8       DPP Ng submitted that the case fell into category 1 of the sentencing band in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter[^2]_ (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”). The sentencing range for a category 1 offence was two to nine months’ imprisonment. Fines were appropriate only in very exceptional cases. He argued that the circumstances of the offence rendered a fine inappropriate. DPP Ng highlighted that the case precedents tendered by him showed that sentences ranging from four to five weeks’ imprisonment have been meted out for pushing a police officer. In particular, he pointed out two cases – _PP v Li Xiangnan_ (DAC 916419/17) (“_Li Xiangnan_”) and _PP v Ng Eong Chien_[^3] (“_Ng Eong Chien_”).

9       The facts in _Li Xiangnan_ were very closely similar to the facts of the present case. Police officers, including the victim, were called to the accused’s house over a domestic dispute. The accused had returned home drunk and quarrelled with his wife. He started throwing things around the house. He was uncooperative with the police officers. He shouted at them. Because he refused to calm down, more officers were called to assist. At one point, he shouted out his wife’s name and tried to move to her room. When the victim told him to sit down, he pushed the victim once on the chest. He was thereafter place under arrest after a struggle. He pleaded guilty to a charge under s 353 PC. He was a first offender. He was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment.

10     In _Ng Eong Chien_, the accused had passed out by the side of the road after a drinking bout. He was roused by police officers. When asked for his particulars, he cursed at them and tried to walk away. He pushed an officer who had stopped him. He also verbally abused the officer with vulgarities. His verbal abuse continued when he was placed under arrest and put in the patrol car. He pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, a charge under s 353 PC. He was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment for the s 353 charge. He had some dissimilar antecedents.

## THE DEFENCE’S MITIGATION

11     Mr Sunil, on the other hand, asked for a non-custodial sentence ie, probation, or alternatively, a high fine. He first pointed out the Accused’s crime-free background. He has stayed here for 12 years, was married with two young daughters. If I was not minded to order probation, he argued that a high fine would constitute sufficient deterrence.

12     Mr Sunil emphasised the circumstances of the offence to show that an imprisonment term was not appropriate or warranted -

> (i)     The Accused had no real intention to carry out his threat to assault his wife. It was an empty threat made because of his inebriation.

> (ii)     His behaviour towards the police officers were non-violent. He had shot off his mouth because he was drunk. His behaviour was the result of his inability to understand why the officers were present in his house, and why they had prevented him from entering the master bedroom. He was only wearing his underwear at the time.

> (iii)     He admitted that he had made unsavoury remarks to the officers. He had done so because he was in a drunken stupor. The officers were keenly aware of this.

> (iv)     The footages captured by the body cameras showed that the main purpose for the officers’ presence in the house was to sober up the Accused. In that context, he had complied with their directions to drink water, and to remain in the dining and living rooms.

> (v)     From one of the footages, SGT Teo Teck Chuan had taken the view that the Accused had kept on talking rubbish. SGT Teo had also taken the view that the Accused was not being violent.

> (vi)     His frustration grew as time passed because he could not understand why the officers were in his house, and he was only in his underwear. He had requested to go into the master bedroom to put on his clothes.

> (vii)     He wanted to look for his wife to seek her help because he was not able to fully appreciate why the officers were in his house. His incomprehension was demonstrated by his persistent questions to the officers asking them why they were in his house. Their refusal to reply did not provide the Accused with the clarity that he sought. He also became fearful when the officers brandished their batons, which the Accused thought were firearms.

> (viii)    His exclamation that he was being restrained in his own home was telling as this showed his confused state of mind. This state of mind led to his decision to look for his wife for help. He had also shouted for his wife to call a lawyer.

> (ix)     The Accused could not understand why he was restrained after he had complied with the officers’ earlier directions. That led him to push the victim.

> (x)     The victim did not suffer any injury. He did not seek medical attention.

13     Mr Sunil cited cases where fines were meted out for pushing law enforcement officers. In _PP v Kiranpal Singh s/o Sidara Singh[^4]_ (“_Kiranpal_”), the accused had pleaded guilty to two charges, one of which was for pushing the victim, a Certis CISCO officer under s 352 PC. At the material time, the victim was assigned to protect enforcement officers from the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) on their patrols. The accused was fined $1,200/-. Mr Sunil argued that although the charge was a lesser charge of s 352, the culpability of the accused in _Kiranpal_ was more aggravated than that of the present Accused. This was because the accused in _Kiranpal_ had deliberately and repeatedly challenged the NEA officers’ authority.

14     In _PP v Liang Wayne_[^5] (“_Liang Wayne_”), the accused pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, one count of s 353 PC. He had stamped on the foot of a police officer. He was fined $10,000/-. The accused had shown callous disregard for the police officer’s authority. The act of stomping on the officer’s foot was an entirely gratuitous act. He was intoxicated at the time. The prosecution did not appeal against the sentence. Mr Sunil argued that his client’s culpability should be pegged lower than that of the accused in _Liang Wayne_. Therefore, the fine imposed should be lower.

15     In _PP v Keak Yan Ting Evonne_[^6] (“_Evonne Keak_”), the accused pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, one charge under s 353 PC, for pushing a police officer once on the chest. In ordering probation, the district judge observed in his oral remarks that she had not shown any sign of disorderly behaviour. She had no reason to flee from the place as she had not committed a crime. The district judge also noted that the statement of facts did not set out any basis for stopping or arresting her. It did not state that the accused had done anything wrong. The push was precipitated by the officer holding her as she was about to cross the road. The district judge had found that her action had been directed at the officer’s act of arresting her and less so at them personally.

16     Mr Sunil submitted that the reasoning in _Evonne Keak_ applied with some force in the present case. This was because, firstly, the incident happened in the confines of the Accused’s home. Therefore, this significantly modulated any public interest argument that could be used to justify an imprisonment sentence. That alone would reduce the force of general deterrence as a sentencing principle. Secondly, there was no offence that the Accused had committed or knew that he had committed before he was abruptly restrained. Like _Evonne Keak_, the Accused was not trying to evade arrest or flee. He had simply wanted to look for his wife for solace because he had felt confused and fearful. When SGT Lui tried to restrain him, it was not to arrest him, but to make him sit on the sofa. There was actually no need to restrain him because he had not exhibited any aggressive behaviour towards the officers. SGT Lui had perceived that he was preventing the Accused from seeing his wife for her safety. However, the Accused’s perception should also be considered along with an objective overview of his behaviour prior to being restrained.

17     Lastly. Mr Sunil argued that the Accused’s intoxication should not be regarded as an aggravating factor. Instead it provided the background for why he had reacted uncharacteristically. Instead some mitigating weight should be accorded to it. In support, Mr Sunil cited the case of _Wuu David v Public Prosecutor[^7]_ where the High Court had accorded some mitigating weight on the accused’s intoxicated state of mind in considering that the accused’s actions were uncharacteristic as a result of the intoxication. On the same vein, the present Accused’s action was uncharacteristic with his otherwise respectful and upright character.

## THE FINDINGS OF THE COURT

18     The sentencing consideration for cases of this nature must be deterrence. Police officers were often exposed to violence and aggression in their frontline duties every day. They frequently endangered their lives and risk their personal safety to protect society by maintaining law and order. If incidents of attack on them were left unchecked, this would undermine public confidence in our police officers as figures of authority. This would in turn compromise their effectiveness as the symbol of law and order. It would also have an adverse impact on future recruitment. Therefore, all police officers must be assured that the law would afford them adequate protection and vindication against all types of behaviour that compromised the effective discharge of their duties: see _Jeffrey Yeo_ at \[48\] to \[50\].

19     I declined to call for a probation report. In order for me to call for a probation report, I should first be satisfied that probation was an appropriate sentencing option. In other words, I must find that rehabilitation displaced deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration. Given the nature of the offence, and the circumstances in which it was committed, I was of the opinion that this was not the case.

20     In advocating for a fine, Mr Sunil emphasised the Accused’s state of mind that he said led to the offence (at \[12\](i) to (xi) above). He described the Accused as being confused, unable to appreciate why the officers were in his house, and fearful of them, especially when they pulled out what he thought were firearms. The proverbial straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back was when the officers tried to restrain him from entering the master bedroom to look for his wife for solace.

21     In my view, the Accused had laboured under this state of mind because of his intoxicated state. The question then was whether this state of mind which was the result of the Accused’s voluntary and excessive consumption of alcohol should be accorded mitigating weight. In _Wong Hoi Len_, the High Court held that ordinarily, intoxication should be treated as an aggravating factor. In _PP v Stephen Albert[^8]_, the High Court held that not only was the accused’s intoxication not an excuse for his outrageous conduct, it was actually an aggravating factor. More importantly, the High Court in _Stephen Albert_ stressed that the accused must bear the consequences of his voluntary excessive consumption of alcohol. I was of the opinion that the observations of these two courts applied with equal force in this case. The Accused must bear the consequences of his voluntary excessive consumption of alcohol. This included a propensity towards aggressive behaviour when intoxicated and labouring under a confused state of mind.

22      _Wuu David_ was distinguishable on its facts. The accused in _Wuu David_ had stolen the victim’s handbag at a bar, removed two credit cards, and threw away the handbag and the other contents in it. When he did this, he had been drinking and was inebriated. He subsequently used one of the credit cards to purchase a bottle of liquor, after which, he threw away the credit card. He did not leave the bar with the bottle of liquor. Instead, he stayed at the bar for almost two and a half hours, sharing the bottle with his friends, until he was arrested. The handbag and all the contents were recovered, and full restitution for the cost of the bottle of liquor was made.

23     The High Court concluded that the accused had acted out of character because of his intoxicated state based on his overall conduct that night in question. At \[19\] of the judgement, the decisive factor that influenced its conclusion were two evidence that strongly suggested that the accused had stolen the credit cards with the intention of using them to make only one purchase and no more. On this basis, the High Court found that the accused’s action was a one-off act, and more importantly, the cheating offence did not have the characteristics of the type of credit card abuse addressed in _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_[^9] (“_Fernando Payagala_”). For those reasons, the High Court did not apply the _Fernando Payagala_ sentencing benchmark.

24     In the present case, the evidence did not lead me to the conclusion that the Accused’s conduct was a one-off. The wife had called for police assistance after the Accused had grabbed her arm and threatened her with bodily harm. Fearful for her safety, she had run out of the master bedroom and shut the door. She had instructed her domestic helper to prevent the Accused from leaving the master bedroom by holding onto the door handle while she called for the police. She had looked visibly distressed when the police arrived (at \[5\] and \[6\] of the SOF). Her extreme reaction was understandable given that, in a similar incident two years prior, she had been strangled by the Accused at a family dinner. He had also been drunk at the time (at \[8\] of the SOF). As far as the wife was concerned, the threat was not an empty threat. The Accused conduct was not a one-off.

25     When the police officers arrived at the house, the Accused had pounded loudly on the door of the master bedroom and shouted vulgarities. When they opened the door, he had slammed the door shut and walked towards the officers, forcing them to draw out their batons. It was only when the Accused had seemingly calmed down a bit that they holstered their batons. However, he was uncooperative and verbally abusive to the officers when they tried to question him (at \[6\] and \[7\] of the SOF). Again, the claim that his conduct was an aberration was against the weight of the evidence. Instead all the evidence thus far suggested that the Accused had the propensity for aggressive behaviour when drunk.

26     In relying on _Evonne Keak_, Mr Sunil emphasised the fact that, other than being drunk, the Accused had not committed any offence. The police officers were there to make sure that he sobered up. I would respectfully disagree. The officers were there because the wife had complained of having been assaulted and threatened with further assault. At the very least, an offence of criminal intimidation under s 506 PC seemed to have been committed. In _Evonne Keak_, the fact that the accused had not committed any crime when she was stopped and questioned by the police had weighed heavily in the court’s mind in arriving at his decision on sentence. _Evonne Keak_ was distinguishable from the present case.

27     As for _Liang Wayne_, there was no grounds of decision stating the reasons why the court had decided that a fine of $10,000/- was the appropriate sentence. Reading the Straits Times article dated 4 Jan 18, the district judge had made three significant conclusions which could explain why he arrived at the sentence. First, he accepted that the accused’s defiance of authority was only a momentary one. Second, it was out of character and it happened because of his intoxication. Lastly, he did not regard the intoxication as an aggravating factor because he was not satisfied that the accused had acted defiantly in total disregard to authority, or that he had behaved in a loutish or aggressive or rowdy manner, or that his conduct had alarmed the public. It appeared that the accused had merely said “so what?” before he stamped on the police officer’s foot. Having regard to the facts of the present case, I was not able to arrive at the same conclusions in relation to the Accused.

28     Finally, using _Kiranpal_ as a precedent for a fine in the present case was not an apple to apple comparison because the offence dealt with in that case was different. In any event, there was no written grounds explaining why the particular sentence was meted out. Its utility as a precedent was therefore diminished. In that regard, I would have to treat _Kiranpal_ as an outlier in comparison to the other case precedents.

29     I agreed with DPP Ng’s submission (at \[8\]) that the case fell into sentencing band 1 of _Jeffrey Yeo_. Relying on the case precedents, and in particular _Li Xiangnan_, he asked for a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. On this point, I noted that the Accused had shown a high level of remorse as indicated by his personal letter of mitigation. I also noted the testimonials which attested to his good character. On the basis of these offender-specific factors, I sentenced him to three weeks’ imprisonment. I did not think that it was manifestly inadequate. In _Ng Eong Chien_, the accused was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment when the facts there were more egregious than in the present case.

30     The Accused is presently on bail pending appeal.
