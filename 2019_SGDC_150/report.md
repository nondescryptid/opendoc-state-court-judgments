Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Drug Offences – Misuse of Drugs Act – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9138/2019/01.\]

17 July 2019

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, a 28 year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to a total of 4 charges. One was for consuming a Specified Drug, two were for failing to attend urine tests and the fourth was for criminal misappropriation. An additional two charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC”).

## II.   BACKGROUND FACTS

### A.   The Charges

2       The 4 proceeded charges are set out as follows,

> (i)     _DAC 940796/2018 (“LT1 charge”)_ _:_

> “ ….. on or before 4 December 2018, did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to wit, _11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid_, without any authorization, said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act, and further,

> (ii)   _DAC 901259/2019 (“1st FRUT charge”)_

> “…. on 23 November 2018 (Friday), in Singapore, being a person subjected to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 25 January 2017, issued under Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“MDR”), did fail to present yourself for urine test to the Duty Officer at Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters as required under the said Order and you have thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the aforesaid Regulations and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the MDR”;

> (iii)   _DAC 901260/2019 (“2nd FRUT charge”)_

> “ …. on 30 November 2018 (Friday), in Singapore, being a person subjected to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 25 January 2017, issued under Regulation 15 of the MDR, did fail to present yourself for urine test to the Duty Officer at Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters as required under the said Order and you have thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the aforesaid Regulations and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the MDR”; and

> (iv)   _MAC904371/2019 (“Dishonest Misappropriation charge”)_

> “ … on 3 December 2018, at or about 10.46 p.m., at a coffee shop located at No. 351 Geylang Road, Singapore, did dishonestly misappropriate one iPhone 7 Plus, valued at $1,300.00, belonging to Wu Huigang, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 403 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (“PC”).”

3       As for the 2 charges to which the accused admitted and consented to having them TIC for the purpose of sentencing, they were:

> (i)     one enhanced consumption charge, for the consumption of a Class B controlled drug, namely _Dihydrocodeine_; and

> (ii)     one other charge for failing to attend urine test.

### B.   Facts of the Case

4       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. The facts are relatively straight forward.

5       On 4 December 2018, at about 0001hrs, the accused was arrested in the vicinity of Lorong 6, Geylang _vide_ a Police Gazette Notification for drug offences.

6       He was brought back to Bedok Police Divisional HQ where his urine samples were taken and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. His urine samples were analyzed by HSA and found to contain _11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid. 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid_, a cannabinol derivative is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

7       The accused had been placed on compulsory urine supervision from 25 January 2017 to 24 January 2019 under the provisions of the MDR. The supervision order required him to present himself for urine tests at Tanglin Police Divisional HQ every Friday between 0930-2200 hrs except on public holidays. The accused had failed to present himself for his urine tests on **_53_** occasions without any valid reasons, including Friday, 23 November 2018 and Friday, 30 November 2018, the dates stated in the 1st and 2nd FRUT charges.

8       When the accused was arrested on 4 December 2018, he was found to be in possession of an iPhone for which he could not account for. Subsequent investigations revealed that the accused was at a nearby coffeeshop earlier that same evening when he noticed that a patron sitting nearby had left the coffeeshop without taking his iPhone which he had left on the table with him. The accused thereafter misappropriated the iPhone for his personal use. This act of taking the iPhone was captured by the CCTV installed in the coffeeshop.

## III.   SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

### A.   Antecedents

9       Despite his relatively young age, the accused already has several antecedents. The following table summarizes his drug and property antecedents:

10     The accused confirmed the antecedents to be correct.

#### Inaccurate Entry in the Accused’s Criminal Record

11     At this point, I should highlight that, in writing these grounds, it has come to my attention the antecedents in the accused’s criminal record (“CRO Record”) are inaccurate, in particular, the type of sentence that was supposedly imposed by a subordinate military court. This is despite the fact that the accused had confirmed that his antecedents were correct. It should also be noted that this inaccuracy is not evident on the face of the record.

12     The accused’s CRO record at S/N 1 & 2 show that the accused was sentenced by a military court _vide_ GCM355/10 to 12 months’ imprisonment _each_ for an offence under s.8(b)(ii) of the MDA and another under s.9 of the MDA. The CRO record further indicates that the two sentences of 12 months’ imprisonment were to run concurrently, indicating that the total sentence was therefore to be 12 months’ imprisonment. The conviction and sentence for this s.8(b)(ii) charge forms the basis of the LT1 charge, above (see particulars of the LT 1 charge).

13     The sentence supposedly imposed by the military court, as reflected in the CRO record, appeared unusual for several reasons.

> (i)     First, it is unusual for a military court to sentence an accused serviceman to a term of imprisonment instead of awarding a period of detention;

> (ii)     Second, it is also unusual for a military court to impose individual sentences for each offence instead of one sentence for all the offences that an accused serviceman has been found guilty of, as provided for in r.47(1)(a) of the Singapore Armed Forces (Subordinate Military Courts) Regulations 2004;

> (iii)     Last, but not least, is the length of the sentence imposed by the military court for the s.9 MDA charge. A sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment (or detention) for a s.9 MDA charge appears unusually high and is not within the usual sentencing range for a first offender for that offence, irrespective of whether that accused had been convicted in a military court or a civil court.

14     A subsequent check was made with the Registry of the Singapore Armed Forces Court Martial Centre. This revealed that the accused was indeed convicted by a subordinate military court on 14 September 2010 for an offence under s.8(b)(ii) of the MDA and another under s.9 of the MDA _vide_ GCM 2010/00355. However, the accused was awarded a sentence of 12 months’ **_detention_** (not imprisonment) with effect from 5 July 2010. It should be noted that this sentence of 12 months’ detention was awarded in respect of **_both_** the s.8(b)(ii) & s.9 MDA charges and were not individual sentences. A copy of the Court Martial Summary is attached to these grounds for reference.

15     The entry at S/N 1 & 2 of the accused’s CRO record relating to the sentence and type of sentence imposed by the military court is therefore inaccurate. This would require an amendment by the Criminal Investigation Department’s Criminal Records Office.

16     Consequently, the particulars of the present LT1 charge relating to the type of sentence imposed by the military court is also inaccurate. However, this court is unable to effect the amendment as it is now _functus officio_.

17     Notwithstanding this, the inaccurate entry of the details of the accused’s conviction by the subordinate military court not affect the validity of the accused’s LT1 conviction. The accused was properly convicted and sentenced by a subordinate military court and this conviction had not been set aside to date. This is a previous conviction under s.33(5)(a) of the MDA. This offence, together with his previous conviction on 25 July 2013 in Court 11, _vide_ DAC 17368/2013 for the consumption of _methamphetamine_, formed the basis of his 2 previous convictions and, under s.33A(1)(b) of the MDA, rendered him liable for an LT1 sentence which he faced for the drug consumption charge. The inaccurate entry caused no prejudice to the accused.

### B.   Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

18     The prosecution submitted for the mandatory minimum sentence for the LT1 offence ie. 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. For the offence of criminal misappropriation, the prosecution sought a short custodial sentence of 1 weeks’ imprisonment as the accused had only recently been convicted for a theft in dwelling charge. With respect to the FRUT charges, the prosecution submitted for a higher sentencing tariff of 6 months’ imprisonment per charge in light of the number of times that the accused had failed to present himself for urine tests. The Court was also urged to order the sentence of imprisonment for the LT1 charge, one FRUT charge and the criminal misappropriation charge to run consecutively.

### C.   Mitigation

19     The accused submitted a handwritten mitigation plea. He urged the court to impose “_a lighter sentence_”. A summary of the points is set out below:

> (i)      _Son’s medical condition_. His son suffers from autism and ADHD and requires visits to the doctors which costs $250 per visit;

> (ii)      _Financial problems_. He is the sole breadwinner earning $1,600 per month. In light of his son’s condition, it is difficult to make ends meet;

> (iii)      _Reasons for consuming drugs_. He had consumed drugs (through smoking) due to anxiety and depression. He did not smoke it often;

> (iv)      _Remorseful_ _._ The accused is remorseful and apologizes to the court. He had wanted to turn himself in but was arrested before he could do so

### D.   Reasons for Sentence

20     In determining the appropriate sentence for each individual offence, I have considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. In truth, I found the accused’s plea in mitigation unremarkable. I did not find the personal and family circumstances of the accused to be of significant mitigating value in the circumstances. The fact that he intended turn himself it was really neither here nor there. The fact was that he didn’t.

#### (i)   The LT1 Charge

21     The mandatory minimum sentence for an LT 1 charge is 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. Despite the fact that the accused had been sentenced previously to a trafficking offence, the Prosecution sought no uplift in the sentence for the LT1 charge. Accordingly, I was of the view that it was therefore not necessary impose a sentence that was higher than the _mandatory minimum sentence_ of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for this charge.

#### (ii)   The Criminal Misappropriation Charge

22     The punishment prescribed by law for criminal misappropriation under section 403 of the PC is a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years, or with fine, or with both. The Prosecution has submitted a sentence of a weeks’ imprisonment. For a first offender, the usual sentencing tariff in such a case would have been a fine only.

23     On 3 May 2018, the accused was sentenced to a total of 5 months’ imprisonment. This included a sentence of one months’ imprisonment for a theft in dwelling charge (see the accused’s antecedents at \[9\] above). The present criminal misappropriation charge was committed less than 4 months after his release from prison. Hence I agreed with the prosecution that a short custodial term would be appropriate. I was of the view that a sentence of one week’s imprisonment was not only justified but appropriate in this instant as a specific deterrent.

#### (iii)   The FRUT Charges

24     The punishment prescribed by law for a FRUT charge is a maximum sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment or a fine of $10,000 or both. The accused is a first offender and the usual sentencing tariff for a first offender is a sentence of about 4 months’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, the Prosecution has sought a higher sentencing tariff of 6 months’ imprisonment as the accused, although he was only charged for 3 counts of FRUT (of which only 2 were proceeded with), had failed to present himself for urine tests on at least 53 occasions.

25     I gave the accused an opportunity to explain himself as to why he had absented himself from presenting himself for urine tests on so many occasions, however, he simply repeated what he had written in his plea in mitigation. In short, he had no answer. The Prosecution’s submission for an uplift in the sentencing for the FRUT charges was, in my view, justified and the submission for an uplift of 2 months’ imprisonment was fair in the circumstances of the case.

## IV.   SENTENCE IMPOSED

26     All considered, I imposed the following sentence on the accused.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="27.58%"> <col width="34.36%"> <col width="38.06%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">LT1 Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 940796/2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1<sup>st</sup> FRUT Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 901259/2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months’ imprisonment;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2<sup>nd</sup> FRUT Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 901260/2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months’ imprisonment;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Criminal Misappropriation charge</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC904371/2019</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

27     Under s.307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court has to order at least 2 out of 4 sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively. However, the prosecution had submitted for three sentences to run consecutively, namely the LT1 charge, one of the FRUT charges and the criminal misappropriation charge.

28     In considering this, I am guided by the principles and the analytical framework as laid down by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the _Mohamad Shouffee bin Adam v PP \[2014\] 2 SLR_ 998 when determining the appropriate global sentence. At \[47\], the Chief Justice explained:

> _“This is a principle of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions. The notion of proportionate punishment is one of considerable vintage and features in most articulations of justice.”_

29     The two limbs of the totality principle are essentially, whether the:

> (a)     Aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed; and

> (b)     Effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects

30     In determining the appropriate length of the global sentence, the cumulative sentences had to exceed the longest individual sentence, which was 5 years’ imprisonment. Applying the principles within the framework, I was therefore of the view that the sentence for the LT1 charge should run consecutively with one of the sentences imposed for the FRUT charge.

31     I also agreed with the prosecution for a third sentence of imprisonment to run consecutively. I therefore further ordered that the sentence of one weeks’ imprisonment for the criminal misappropriation charge to run consecutively with the sentence imposed for the LT1 charge and FRUT charge. All three offences were separate and distinct offences committed on separate occasions. In addition, offence of criminal misappropriation was also of a different nature from the drug related offences.

## IV.   CONCLUSION

32     To summarise, I ordered the sentences of imprisonment in _DAC 940796/2018, DAC 901259/2019 & MAC904371/2019_ to run consecutively and that the sentence was to be with effect from 12 December 2018, the date the accused was first remanded into custody. The total sentence imposed on the accused was therefore:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>5 years, 6 months &amp; 1 weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 12 December 2018</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>and 3 strokes of the cane</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

33     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence which I have imposed, now appeals against it. He is presently serving sentence.
