### District Judge Prem Raj Prabakaran:

## Introduction

1       The Defendant is the natural mother of the child at the centre of these proceedings. The child was born out of wedlock in November 2008.[^1]The Defendant and the Plaintiff know each other through the Plaintiff’s daughter.[^2] Sometime in February/March 2009, the Plaintiff started to look after the child. The child was then between 3 to 4 months old. The circumstances in which the Plaintiff came to look after the child are disputed. The Plaintiff claimed that “the Defendant told the Plaintiff to take actual custody \[of the child\] and \[to\] maintain the child”.[^3] The Defendant denied this[^4].

2       The Plaintiff claimed “the Defendant paid the Plaintiff a monthly sum of $400 as the child’s maintenance \[to compensate the Plaintiff\]”.[^5] She also claimed she had “actual custody of the child” from March 2009 to March 2015.[^6] During this six-year period, the Plaintiff further claimed she:[^7]

…solely maintained the child, including but not limited to paying for the child’s food/milk, clothing/diaper, toys, books/stationary \[_sic_\], medical, transport, tour and family outings etc.

3       According to the Plaintiff, the sum of $400 the Defendant gave every month “as the child’s monthly maintenance” was “insufficient to cover the child’s monthly expenses.” As such, “the Plaintiff had to top up at least $500 \[every month\] to cover the same.”[^8]

4       The Defendant, in turn, stated that she “voluntarily paid the Plaintiff \[a\] sum of between $400 and $430 per month to cover the child’s expenses. In addition, extra payments for expenses were made to the Plaintiff on the Defendant’s request throughout the period.”[^9]

5       In March 2015, the Defendant took the child with her.[^10] According to the Plaintiff, “\[t\]o date, the Defendant has failed/refused/neglected to allow the Plaintiff to have access or any other contact with the child.”[^11]

## The Plaintiff’s claim

6       The Plaintiff claimed she “has cared for the child for a period of 6 years[^12] \[and\] had expended a sum of $36,000 to maintain the child \[during this period\]”[^13]. The Plaintiff did not plead any agreement between the parties (whether oral or implied).[^14] According to the Plaintiff, her claim was based on s 70(3) of the Women’s Charter[^15] (“the Act”):[^16]

…for sums expended by her during the time the child was in \[her\] actual custody from March 2009 to March 2015.

## The Defendant’s objection to the Plaintiff’s claim

7       The Defendant, in turn, argued that the Plaintiff has no claim under s 70 of the Act.[^17] According to the Defendant, the State Courts has no jurisdiction to hear the Plaintiff’s claim, which should have been filed with the High Court or a Family Court.[^18] The Defendant therefore applied under O 33 r 5 of the Rules of Court[^19], for the Plaintiff’s claim to be dismissed after a decision on this preliminary issue of jurisdiction.

## My decision

8       I agreed with the Defendant, and dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim on 26 February 2019. These are my grounds of decision.

## The preliminary issue

9       The preliminary issue to be decided was whether a Magistrate’s Court – duly constituted and subject to the State Courts Act[^20] – has jurisdiction to hear an action or a claim under s 70(3) of the Act.

10     Section 70 of Act appears in Part VIII of the Act[^21]. It reads:

PART VIII

MAINTENANCE OF WIFE, INCAPACITATED HUSBAND AND CHILDREN

…

**Duty to maintain child accepted as member of family**

70.—(1)    Where a person has accepted a child who is not his child as a member of his family, it shall be his duty to maintain that child while he remains a child, so far as the father or the mother of the child fails to do so, and the court may make such orders as may be necessary to ensure the welfare of the child.

(2)    The duty imposed by subsection (1) shall cease if the child is taken away by his father or mother.

(**3**)     **Any sums expended by a person maintaining that child shall be recoverable as a debt from the father or mother of the child.**

(4)    An application for an order under subsection (1) may be made by —

(a)    any person who is a guardian or has the actual custody of the child;

(b)    where the child has attained the age of 21 years, the child himself;

(c)    where the child is below the age of 21 years, any of his siblings who has attained the age of 21 years; or

(d)    any person appointed by the Minister.

(5)    Subsections (4) to (9) of section 69 shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to the making of an order under this section.

\[emphasis added\]

11     I agreed with the Defendant that the Magistrate’s Court has no jurisdiction to hear an action or a claim under s 70(3) of the Act.

12     Section 2 of the Act states that the word “court” for the purposes of Part VIII of the Act “means the High Court or a Family Court”. No reference is made, at all, to a Magistrate’s Court constituted under the State Courts Act. The Magistrate’s Court is a creature of legislation. Its jurisdiction is defined and limited by statute. As such, it cannot exercise its powers in matters over which it has no jurisdiction. On this note, s 19(3)(_c_), read with s 52(2), of the State Courts Act states that the civil jurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court “shall not include…any jurisdiction vested exclusively in the High Court \[or\] a Family Court…”.[^22] Parliament has thus seen it fit that only the High Court or a Family Court has jurisdiction to hear an action or a claim under s 70(3) of the Act.[^23]

13     This reading is also supported by the fact that the “debt” referred to in s 70(3) of the Act is not a conventional debt. Rather, it is in respect of “sums expended by a \[non-parent in\] maintaining \[a\] child” [^24] that the non-parent “has accepted…as a member of his family”.[^25] This “duty to maintain \[the\] child”[^26] subsists “while the \[child\] remains the child” and its extent is only in “so far as the father or mother of the child fails to \[maintain the child\]”.

14     A claim under s 70(3) of the Act therefore requires the determination of two preliminary factual issues:[^27]

(a)     Whether the child had been accepted as a member of the non-parent’s family. To this end, there must have been voluntary assumption of parental responsibility for the child’s maintenance on the part of the non-parent.

(b)     Whether the child’s father or mother had maintained the child, given that the non-parent’s duty is to maintain the child “so far as the father or mother of the child fails to do so.”[^28]

15     These are issues a Family Court is best placed to hear evidence in respect of and to make a determination on. I say this bearing in mind that the child (who is now about 10 years old) may well have to give evidence also.

16     In addition, it appears that a Magistrate’s Court exercising jurisdiction over the Plaintiff’s Claim would run counter to s 79 of the Act. This section states that the “Family Justice Rules Committee…may make Family Justice Rules regulating and prescribing the procedure and practice to be followed for the purposes of \[Part XIII of the Act\]”. On this note, s 79(2)(_a_) of the Act states that Family Justice Rules may be made for “prescribing the procedure for applications to the **Family Court** under \[Part XIII of the Act\]” – where s 70 is found. The express reference, here, is to the Family Court and not to the Magistrate’s Court.

## Conclusion

17     In these circumstances, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s Claim pursuant to O 33 r 5 of the Rules of Court. I fixed costs (excluding disbursements) at $7,000.00.
