4 October 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       The applicant is the management corporation for the residential development known as The Infiniti (“the MC”). It seeks an order that the respondents, who own a unit in the development, remove what the MC calls an “unauthorised cabinet” (the “Cabinet”) from the common property outside their unit. The MC seeks also an order that the respondents restore the common property to its “original state and condition”.

2       The Cabinet measures 1.06m in length, 0.36m in width and 1.24m in height. It is meant for shoes and is located in the common corridor beside the front door of the respondents’ unit. It stands with its long side touching the wall but it is not in any way attached or affixed to the wall. The common corridor is just over 1.8m wide: given the Cabinet’s width of 0.36m there is a distance of at least 1.44m between the side of the Cabinet that protrudes furthest into the corridor and the opposite wall.

3       The MC contends that the Cabinet constitutes a breach of two provisions of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C) (“the Act”), namely:

> (a)     Section 37(3)–(4), which provides that a subsidiary proprietor shall not without authorisation make any improvement to his unit that “affects the appearance of any building” in the development.

> (b)     Section 63(c)–(d), which provides that a subsidiary proprietor shall not use or enjoy common property in such a way as to “interfere unreasonably” with another person’s “use or enjoyment” of his own unit or the common property.

4       The MC also contends that the Cabinet breaches various by-laws. Most of these are by-laws prescribed in the Second Schedule of the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (the “Second Schedule”) and a few are additional by-laws made by the MC. It appears from the MC’s written submissions that the by-laws alleged to have been breached are:

> (a)     By-law 3 in the Second Schedule, which provides that a subsidiary proprietor shall not “obstruct the lawful use of the common property by any person” except on a “temporary and non-recurring” basis.

> (b)     By-law 5 in the Second Schedule, which provides that a subsidiary proprietor shall not “mark, paint, drive nails or screws or the like into, or otherwise damage or deface” any structural part of the common property without prior written approval.

> (c)     By-law 9 in the Second Schedule, which provides that a subsidiary proprietor shall not “deposit or throw” on common property “any rubbish, dirt, dust or other material or discarded item” without prior written approval.

> (d)     By-law 13 in the Second Schedule, which makes provision for the responsible use of common chutes or shared receptacles for refuse disposal and the responsible maintenance and use of individual receptacles for refuse disposal.

> (e)     By-law 18 in the Second Schedule, which provides that a subsidiary proprietor shall not do anything “likely to … reduce the level of fire safety in the lots or common property”.

> (f)     An additional by-law providing that a subsidiary proprietor shall not “install any television antenna, air-conditioners compressor and other equipment” at the “common corridor” without the MC’s prior written consent.

> (g)     An additional by-law providing that a subsidiary proprietor shall not “encumber with boxes, store, leave or discard any personal belongings” in any “Common Area”.

## Whether there has been a breach of a statutory provision or a by-law

5       It seems at once clear to me that by-laws 9 and 13 in the Second Schedule have no relevance to this application. Those by-laws concern the disposal or discarding of rubbish and other material that is intended to be thrown away. But the Cabinet is patently not an item intended to be thrown away and so by-laws 9 and 13 do not apply to it.

6       It is also clear to me that the Cabinet does not presently offend by-law 5 in the Second Schedule: the Cabinet is not attached to the wall of the common property, hence there can be no question of driving nails or screws into the wall or otherwise damaging and defacing it. It appears then that the MC invokes by-law 5 to seek redress for alleged damage that occurred prior to the installation of the Cabinet. The Cabinet had a taller predecessor cabinet that was attached to the wall, and the MC says that the installation of this taller cabinet did cause damage to the wall and the respondents failed to reinstate the wall to its former condition when they took it down. But I consider that the MC’s complaint is not well-founded. It is not disputed that when the respondents engaged a contractor to take down the taller cabinet they placed an obligatory $1,000 deposit with the managing agent and this deposit was returned to them without deduction after the work had been completed. Given that the relevant by-law (set out at p 41 of the first affidavit of Chang Joo Whut) specifically empowers the MC to make deductions where there has been non-compliance with its rules and regulations, I find unconvincing the MC’s assertion that the return of the deposit was a “mere formality”. Instead I agree with the respondents’ argument that the fact that the MC returned the deposit in full suggests strongly that it thought at the time that the wall had been satisfactorily restored. I thus conclude that it is more likely than not that any current deficiencies in the wall are the result of normal wear and tear for which the respondents cannot be blamed.

7       As for the additional by-law relating to the installation of “television antenna, air-conditioners compressor and other equipment”, I consider that the Cabinet does not fall foul of that by-law. I think that the reference to television antennas and air-conditioning compressors indicates that, notwithstanding the apparently broad reference to “other equipment”, it is right to construe this by-law as governing only items that are bulky enough that they require affixing to some part of the structure of the common property. Since the Cabinet is not attached to the wall I consider that it falls outside the scope of this additional by-law and so is incapable of contravening it.

8       Turning to s 37 of the Act, I agree with the respondents’ submission that the reference to “appearance of any building” in this provision comprehends only the appearance of the external façade of the building. The Cabinet is located in the common corridor and I am unable to see how it would even be visible to a person looking at the external façade of the building. Therefore it cannot possibly affect the appearance of the building and it gives rise to no breach of s 37.

9       On the issue of fire safety, it appears that the MC argues that the Cabinet increases risk in two main ways: first, it reduces the width of the common corridor available for escape, and second, it is a flammable object that could contribute to a fire’s spreading. Taking the latter point first, given the size of the Cabinet I do not think it would feed a fire to any substantial degree, and given that it is up against a wall on one side and adjoins empty space on the other three sides I am unable to appreciate how it would help a fire to move from one part of the building to another. As to the former argument, the respondents point out that the Code of Practice for Fire Precautions in Buildings 2018 published by the Singapore Civil Defence Force states a minimum width of 1.2m for corridors in high-rise residential buildings. The MC suggests that this minimum width applies to Housing and Development Board flats only and not to private condominiums, but I see no such qualification on the face of the document before me (at p 51 of the first affidavit of Tay Beng Huat) and I can think of no reason in principle why there should be different standards for public and private high-rise housing. Since the Cabinet, being 0.36m wide, diminishes the width of the common corridor to a figure that is not less than 1.44m, it complies with the requirements of the Code of Practice. For these reasons I am not persuaded that the presence of the Cabinet is likely to reduce the level of fire safety in the common corridor and I conclude that there is no breach of by-law 18 in the Second Schedule.

10     I think I can deal with s 63 of the Act and by-law 3 in the Second Schedule together. The pertinent provisions of s 63 prohibit using common property in a way that “interfere\[s\] unreasonably” with another person’s use or enjoyment of the common property or his own unit. Given that all that the Cabinet does is to stand in its place in the common corridor, I think that the only way in which it could possibly constitute unreasonable interference is if it presents an unreasonable obstruction to people using the corridor. So seen the enquiry under s 63 is precisely the same as that under by-law 3 in the Second Schedule, which is whether the Cabinet obstructs the common corridor. It is evident to me that it does not. The only path of travel blocked by the Cabinet is that between the front door of the respondents’ unit and the front door of the unit beside it, and even then the detour called for is minimal. Besides this the Cabinet does not get in the way of any path of travel between the front doors of the units on that floor or between any of the front doors and the lift or the fire escape. As mentioned above the Cabinet leaves available for passage at least 1.44m of common corridor width, and given my understanding from counsel that the corridor serves just four units on that floor I consider that the corridor space left by the Cabinet is wholly adequate for the low volume of human traffic one would expect there. There is thus no breach of s 63 of the Act or by-law 3 in the Second Schedule.

11     This leaves for consideration the additional by-law that provides:

> \[Every Subsidiary Proprietor/Resident shall not\] in any way encumber with boxes, store, leave or discard any personal belongings in any part of the staircases or other Common Area or permit the placing or parking of bicycles and other wheeled vehicles which may obstruct the Common Areas in the Estate.

It seems to me that this by-law comprises three distinct parts: the first concerns encumbering the “staircases or other Common Area” with boxes, the second storing, leaving or discarding personal belongings in those areas, and the third placing bicycles and other wheeled vehicles in a manner that obstructs the “Common Areas”. Only the second part is relevant here. It is phrased very broadly without apparent qualification: in the first and third parts the use of the verbs “encumber” and “obstruct” suggests that the placing of boxes or bicycles must pose an impediment to movement in order to constitute a breach, but the second part contains no similar language. I am compelled to conclude that it offends this by-law to leave any object on common property regardless of the size and nature of that object and whether or not it is an obstruction or mars the appearance of the common property. It follows that the respondents breached this additional by-law by leaving the Cabinet in the common corridor.

12     I should mention that the MC rather belatedly contended that the Cabinet was in breach of s 33 of the Act. This provides that a management corporation may make by-laws conferring on particular subsidiary proprietors “exclusive use” of or “special privileges” in respect of common property. The MC argued that placing the Cabinet in the common corridor amounted to “exclusive use” of that part of the corridor and that unless the MC had made a by-law conferring on the respondents the right to put the Cabinet there they could not lawfully do so. But I do not think this logic is sound. It appears to me that s 33 is an empowering provision that enables management corporations to give specified subsidiary proprietors special rights over common property, and I think it would be quite contrary to the character of s 33 to read it as a restrictive provision that renders unlawful anything that might be considered “exclusive use” so long as the management corporation has not expressly permitted it. According to the MC it would be “exclusive use” to put even one flower pot in the common corridor. If any such use, however trivial, could be challenged on no other basis than that it had not received the blessing of the MC under s 33 of the Act, it seems to me that this would render unnecessary and otiose the fine balance between the potentially competing rights of subsidiary proprietors in respect of the common property that the by-laws in the Second Schedule endeavour to achieve. In the absence of authority supporting the MC’s view of s 33 – I was not shown any – I cannot agree with the MC’s position on this point.

## Whether the order sought should be granted

13     Although I have found that the respondents breached a by-law by leaving the Cabinet in the common corridor outside their unit it does not follow as a matter of course that I should grant the order that the MC seeks. The order sought is in the nature of a mandatory injunction and a consideration of whether the injunction should be issued entails “balancing the benefits and burdens in order to produce fair result”, as Judith Prakash J held in _Choo Kok Lin and another v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2405_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 175</span> at \[56\]. Ordinarily a mandatory injunction should be issued except where (i) the conduct of the applicant “would make it unjust to do so” or (ii) the breach was “trivial” or caused “no appreciable damage” to the applicant and an injunction would “impose substantial hardship” on the respondent “with no counter-balancing benefit” to the applicant.

14     I do not think I can regard the placement of the Cabinet in the corridor as a “trivial” breach relative to the full range of possible infringements of the by-law that the respondents breached: given how widely that by-law is couched it could be a breach to leave even small items such as a flower pot or a pair of shoes in the common corridor, and the Cabinet is substantially larger than that. But from any sensible point of view the Cabinet does not intrude on any person’s rights to any but the most negligible degree. The space it occupies in the common corridor is immediately next to the wall between two units and I cannot imagine that this space would otherwise be utilised by the residents of the other units on that floor. The Cabinet is not tiny but it is not enormous either, and as I have found it does not obstruct movement in the corridor. If one does not visit that floor one would not even know that the Cabinet exists. In the circumstances I find that the Cabinet causes “no appreciable damage” or loss to the MC or to any subsidiary proprietor. While it would be overstating matters to say that it would be a “substantial hardship” for the respondents to remove the Cabinet, requiring them to do so would be a disproportionate response to their breach because there is no real harm caused by the presence of the Cabinet and thus no real benefit to be had by anyone in its removal. For this reason alone I do not think the respondents’ breach warrants making the order that the MC seeks.

15     Then there is the MC’s conduct. I consider that its conduct has been unreasonable and objectionable in two main ways. First, it failed to provide proper reasons to the respondents when asking them to remove the Cabinet. In its initial notice to the respondents dated 20 December 2018 the MC justified its removal request on the basis that the Cabinet breached by-laws 3 and 18 in the Second Schedule, but as I have found neither of those two by-laws were breached. There was on the other hand no reference at all to the additional by-law that the respondents did breach. To compound matters that notice of 20 December 2018 alluded to an earlier notice dated 27 November 2018 in which the MC had expressly “allowed in the corridor” the placement of “one shoe rack per unit” so long as the dimensions of the shoe rack did not exceed 1m in height, 1m in length and 0.4m in width. As the respondents point out, given that it is the width of the shoe rack or cabinet that determines the degree to which it juts out into and so affects movement in the common corridor, and given that the MC’s stated concerns were obstruction of the corridor and fire safety levels, any reasonable person would have been hard-pressed to understand why the MC was taking issue with the Cabinet when its width of 0.36m was less than that of the notional permitted shoe rack.

16     Second, the MC has not been impartial and even-handed in enforcing its by-laws. I accept on the basis of photographs that the respondents put in evidence that there are many other subsidiary proprietors who have left personal belongings in the common corridor outside their units and so infringed the same additional by-law that the respondents breached. Yet there is no evidence in the affidavits that the MC has issued notices or warnings addressed specifically to any of those other subsidiary proprietors. The MC explains that it took action against the respondents because the Cabinet is the “newest and largest” of the offending cabinets in the development, and it says that after it has succeeded in its action against the respondents it will “go after the rest of the infringers” (see the first, second and third affidavits of Chang Joo Whut at paras 15, 20–21 and 6 respectively). But I am not convinced by the MC’s explanation. From the photographs it is not at all obvious to me that the Cabinet is indeed the largest object placed in the common corridors: other plausible candidates appear in the photographs at pp 86, 94, 95, 101 and 103 of the first affidavit of Tay Beng Huat, and there are other examples besides. And even if the Cabinet is the “newest” I do not see how that is a reason to single it out – if anything I would have thought that the “newest” object presents the least prolonged breach and hence the least compelling case for enforcement action to be taken. Given the unreasonably selective manner in which the respondents have been targeted thus far I have doubts as to whether the MC genuinely intends to take any steps against the other subsidiary proprietors. Should I grant the order that the MC seeks it seems to me not unlikely that the respondents would be the only subsidiary proprietors compelled to take remedial action, and that would not be a fair result. It seems to me that in making this application the MC is attempting to secure the Cabinet’s removal without having to risk the ire of the other offending subsidiary proprietors by asserting an intention to enforce the additional by-law against them too, and I do not think it is right and proper for the MC to do that.

17     I therefore conclude that the MC’s conduct makes it unjust to grant the order that it seeks. That is another reason why I dismiss this application altogether even though I find that the respondents have breached a by-law.
