### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 72-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to:

> (i)     a charge under section 128I(1)(_b_) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Customs Act”) for being concerned in dealing with 256kg of cigarettes on which excise duty of $109,312.00 was not paid, with intent to defraud the Government of the excise duty (the “Customs charge”); and

> (ii)     a charge under sections 26 and 77 of the Goods and services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 2005 Rev Ed), paragraph 3 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Legislation Relating to Customs and Excise Duties) Order (Cap 117A, Order 4) and paragraph 2 of the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Customs Act) (Provisions on Trials, Proceedings, Offences and Penalties) Order (Cap 117A, Order 5) read with 128I(1)(_b_) of the Customs Act for being concerned in dealing with 256kg of cigarettes valued at $113,482.80 on which Goods and Services Tax of $7,944.50 was not paid, with intent to defraud the Government of the said tax (the “GST charge”).

The Accused was liable for enhanced punishment under section 128L(5A) of the Customs Act.

2       The Accused was represented.

3       I convicted the Accused on 8 April 2020 after a trial, and the Accused consented to four other similar charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation plea presented by the Defence, I sentenced the Accused to a total of 26 months’ imprisonment and a total fine of $3,517,695.00 (in default, 18 months’ imprisonment) on 8 July 2020.

4       The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the sentence is stayed pending appeal. I now set out my reasons for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       The Prosecution adduced evidence that, on 9 March 2018 at about 9.00am, officers from the Singapore Customs prepared to mount an operation upon receipt of information relating to duty-unpaid cigarettes activities. The officers were instructed to look out for a truck with the license plate GZ6321P (“the Truck”).

6       The operation eventually led to the arrest of the Accused and his accomplice, Ong Lean Tiong (“Ong”) (PW8) at the vicinity of Block 251 Jurong East Street 24 (“Block 251”) on the same day at about 3.30pm. A total of 256kg on duty-unpaid cigarettes were found in the Truck. Both the Accused and Ong were brought back to the Customs Operation Command (“COC”), together with the duty-unpaid cigarettes.

7       Ong pleaded guilty to the charges against him and testified against the Accused at the trial.

8       I will set out the Prosecution’s case in three parts:

> (i)     the events leading to the arrest and the aftermath;

> (ii)     the evidence of Ong; and

> (iii)     the formal evidence.

### The events leading to the arrest and the aftermath

9       In the morning of 9 March 2018, based on information received, several Customs Officers prepared to take part in an operation led by Operations Commander, Chief Customs Officer SG1 Tan Kay Hwa (“CCO SG1 Tan”) (PW5). As part of the operations, Deputy Chief Superintendent Tung Lin Chye (“DCSC Tung”) (PW1) and Chief Customs Officer Tan Chee Hong (“CCO Tan”) (PW4) were tasked to keep a look-out for the Truck[^1].

10     At about 12.45pm, CCO Tan left the COC with Higher Customs Officer Loh Hong Meng (“HCO Loh”) (PW6) in a vehicle driven by Higher Customs Officer Zahid bin Anuar (“HCO Zahid”). They arrived at the vicinity of Changi South Street 1 at about 2.05pm, and waited for further instructions[^2].

11     Simultaneously, DCSC Tung arrived at the vicinity in a vehicle driven by Chief Customs Officer Lim Chong Heng (“CCO Lim”). Upon arrival, DCSC Tung spotted the Truck parked in front of a bus “Bas Pekerja” (“the Bus”). Ong, who was the driver of the Truck, was seen meeting with the driver of the Bus, who was an unknown male Chinese[^3].

12     At about 2.32pm, the Bus left the vicinity before returning a few minutes later. The Bus driver proceeded to park the Bus behind the Truck. Ong then alighted form the Truck and spoke to the Bus driver. Moments later, DCSC Tung observed cardboard boxes, which he suspected to contain duty-unpaid cigarettes, being transferred from the Bus to the Truck by the Bus driver and three other unknown male Chinese[^4].

13     After the cardboard boxes were transferred to the Truck, Ong boarded the Truck and left the vicinity at about 2.36pm. DCSC Tung and CCO Tan, and their teams immediately began trailing the Truck in their vehicles[^5].

14     At about 3.20pm, DCSC Tung spotted Ong driving the Truck into the carpark at Block 251. However, he saw the Truck leaving the carpark immediately after making a round, and proceeding towards the direction of Block 260 Jurong East Street 24 (“Block 260”). At the same time, DCSC Tung spotted the Accused standing at the foot of Block 260[^6] and looking in the direction of the Truck. DCSC Tung then instructed CCO Tan and HCO Loh to “keep observation of” the Accused[^7]. As for Ong, he was seen driving the Truck into the carpark at Block 263 Jurong East Street 24.

15     DCSC Tung saw Ong returning to the carpark at Block 251 in the Truck at about 3.25pm, and driving to the end of the carpark. At the same time, the Accused was observed to be talking on his mobile phone and looking in the direction of the Truck[^8].

16     About five minutes later, Ong alighted from the Truck. He walked towards the carpark gantry where he met the Accused. At that juncture, the Customs officers moved in and detained the Accused and Ong[^9].

17     The Accused was detained by CCO Tan and HCO Loh, and interviewed by CCO Tan[^10]. CCO Tan spoke to the Accused in Mandarin and asked the Accused what he was doing in the vicinity. The Accused told CCO Tan that he was waiting to “buy cigarettes” and pointed at Ong[^11]. CCO Tan understood the Accused to mean that he was intending to buy cigarettes from Ong. CCO Tan then sought instructions from CCO SG1 Tan and was instructed to place the Accused under arrest.

18     After the Accused was arrested, HCO Loh proceeded to record a statement from him at 3.55pm inside Customs vehicle QX1351C, at the carpark of Block 250 Jurong East Street 24. The Accused gave his statement[^12] in Mandarin, which was then recorded by HCO Loh in English. The Accused informed HCO Loh that he came to know Ong about four months ago and had purchased cigarettes from Ong on a few occasions. On the day in question, he had gone to the location to purchase cigarettes from Ong. He was aware that the cigarettes were duty-unpaid, and paid Ong $44.00 per carton of duty-unpaid cigarettes.

19     After the recording of the Accused’s statement (P6), the Accused was escorted by CCO Tan and his team to the Accused’s flat at #09-353 Block 258 Jurong East Street 24. They did not find anything incriminating in the flat and left the flat with the Accused at about 4.40pm for the COC. They arrived at the COC at about 5.10pm[^13].

20     On the same day at about 4.00pm, Higher Customs Officer Yong Chin Fang (“HCO Yong”) (PW7) arrived at the scene and took over the items found in the rear compartment of the Truck. She arranged for a tow truck to tow the Truck to the COC and proceeded to check the canvas bags in the Truck. She found a total of 13 canvas bags and 19 cardboard boxes containing duty-unpaid cigarettes. She ensured that all the doors of the Truck were secured and locked, before the Truck was towed to the COC[^14]. The Truck arrived at the COC at 5.55pm.

21     Upon arrival at the COC, HCO Yong and her team unloaded the seized items from the Truck. At about 7.40pm, the seized items were verified by HCO Yong and her team in the presence of the Accused and Ong[^15]. The seized items comprised 796 cartons x 200 sticks, 40 packets x 20 sticks and 300 cartons x 160 sticks of duty-unpaid cigarettes[^16] (“the seized cigarettes”).

### The evidence of Ong

22     Ong testified that he came to know the Accused, through friends, about two to three years prior to March 2018[^17]. They became friends[^18], and he addressed the Accused as “Uncle Quek”[^19]. Ong further testified that he was introduced to the Accused for the purpose of dealing with duty-unpaid cigarettes[^20].

23     Sometime after Ong came to know the Accused, the Accused passed Ong’s number to “Boss” or “Lao Ban” (“Boss”) and introduced Ong to Boss[^21]. Thereafter, Boss would contact Ong and give him “jobs”, in that Boss would give instructions to Ong on the collection and delivery of “goods”[^22].

24     On the day in question, Ong had gone to Changi South to collect the seized cigarettes. He was to bring the seized cigarettes to Block 251 to “wait for customers” to collect them. Along the way, he received a call from Boss, informing him that he was being tailed by Customs officers[^23].

25     However, Ong continued driving and arrived at the carpark of Block 251. His purpose of going to Block 251 was to wait for customers to collect the seized cigarettes and to meet the Accused. Ong further testified that the Accused’s role was to ask customers to collect duty-unpaid cigarettes that Ong had picked up at Changi South, and to collect money from these customers for the said cigarettes[^24]. While Ong was able to recognise these customers, he did not know their names. After distributing the cigarettes to the customers at Block 251, the Accused would then instruct Ong on where to send the remaining cigarettes[^25]. Ong also testified that, after collecting duty-unpaid cigarettes from “Boss” each time, he would report to the Accused[^26].

26     In addition to taking instructions from the Accused relating to the distribution and delivery of duty-unpaid cigarettes, it was Ong’s evidence that the Accused gave him money for the rental of the Truck for the conveyance of duty-unpaid cigarettes[^27]. The Accused would pay Ong $25.00 for every cardboard box of cigarettes delivered[^28]. Each cardboard box contained 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes[^29].

27     Ong gave evidence that he was arrested with the Accused by Customs officers at Block 251[^30]. He was subsequently brought back to the COC where the seized cigarettes were counted in front of him and the Accused[^31]. After his arrest, Ong gave a statement to a Customs officer implicating the Accused for 50 cartons of the seized cigarettes. He explained that he did so to “help” the Accused[^32] as Boss had previously promised him a sum of $5,000.00 and instructed him to “bear the consequences” alone should he be arrested[^33]. He implicated the Accused for 50 cartons because, while Ong and the Accused were at the COC where the cartons of seized cigarettes were being counted, the Accused told the Customs officer that “he had only bought 50 cartons” from Ong. Ong understood the Accused to mean that the Accused should only be implicated for 50 cartons of the seized cigarettes[^34].

28     Ong was charged in court, and faced charges which mirrored the proceeded charges against the Accused[^35]. Ong eventually pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to a total of 19 months’ imprisonment on 13 March 2018[^36].

### The formal evidence

29     The Prosecution adduced evidence from Senior Customs Officer Muhammad Farhan bin Sumaimi (“SCO Farhan”) (PW3), who was the crime scene photographer on 9 March 2018. SCO Farhan testified that he took 11 photographs on that day comprising the scene of crime, the Truck, the items inside the Truck, and the seized cigarettes laid out at the COC.

30     The Investigation Officer, Senior Customs Officer Sinn Sze Kiat (“SCO Sinn”) (PW9), testified that the Accused and Ong were handed over to him on 9 March 2018. After taking over the investigations, he recorded a statement from Ong on 10 March and a further statement on 11 April 2018[^37].

31     Ong’s statement of 11 April 2018 (“the further statement”) was recorded when he was serving his imprisonment term and revealed that the Accused was involved in the whole consignment of the seized cigarettes[^38]. The excise duty involved for the whole consignment was $109,312.00, and the Goods and Services Tax was $7,944.50[^39]. In addition, the Prosecution adduced evidence through SCO Sinn that the Accused was liable for enhanced punishment in the event of a conviction, as he was previously convicted of a similar offence on 3 August 2012[^40].

32     Higher Superintendent of Customs Tiu Kian Chai (PW2) took the stand and gave evidence pertaining to his encounter with Ong when he attempted to serve a _subpoena_ on Ong to attend court. He testified that Ong was antagonistic and threatened to call the police on the Customs officers before “he slammed the door shut”[^41]. A Warrant to Arrest was issued, and Ong was arrested and brought to court.

## The Defence

### The evidence of the Accused

33     The Accused testified that he was working as a fruit seller at the material time, earning about “$1,000.00 plus” per month[^42]. He claimed to have been a smoker for the past 40 to 50 years, consuming three packets of cigarettes a day[^43].

34     In relation to Ong, it is the Accused’s evidence that Ong was a friend[^44] whom he addressed as “Ah Pui”[^45]. He had known Ong for about four months prior to his arrest[^46]. On the day of the arrest, the Accused was waiting for Ong as he had intended to buy 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes from Ong[^47] for his personal consumption[^48]. However, while he was waiting for Ong, three Customs officers approached him[^49] and he did not get to see Ong[^50]. He denied renting the Truck or giving a sum of money to Ong for the rental of the Truck[^51].

35     In cross-examination, the Accused claimed that on the day in question, he had waited with a lady for Ong to deliver cigarettes to him. He knew that the lady was also “waiting for cigarettes”. However, he did not know who the lady was as that was the first time he saw her[^52]. Neither did he know if she was also waiting for Ong to deliver cigarettes to her[^53].

36     The Accused further claimed that he was a chain-smoker and would purchase duty-unpaid cigarettes every three months as he would “finish the stock” in about three months[^54]. At the time of his arrest, he had more than 10 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes at his flat for his personal consumption[^55].

37     In relation to the location of arrest, the Accused gave evidence that it was the second time he was meeting Ong at that location for the delivery of duty-unpaid cigarettes, and it was one “Ang Lu” who had told the Accused to wait there[^56]. He claimed that he had not seen the Truck previously. He did not instruct Ong to rent the Truck, nor did he give money to Ong for that purpose. He denied paying $25.00 to Ong for each cardboard box of cigarettes that Ong delivered, and the $2,400.00 that he had with him on that day was for the purchase of 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes from Ong[^57].

38     The Accused denied telling any Customs officer at the COC that he intended to buy 50 cartons of cigarettes from Ong at the time when the seized cigarettes were being counted in the presence of Ong and the Accused. The Accused claimed that he was not allowed to speak at that time[^58].

### The Accused’s statement

39     In the course of cross-examination, the Prosecution sought to confront the Accused with a statement (P10) which the Accused had given to SCO Sinn on 10 March 2018. The Defence did not challenge the voluntariness of the statement[^59].

40     In his statement, the Accused stated, _inter alia_, that:

> (i)     he was not a smoker[^60];

> (ii)     the night before his arrest, on 8 March 2018, he was contacted by “Ah Guan” who asked if the Accused was “interested in buying Cigarettes”[^61];

> (iii)     on the day of his arrest, the Accused contacted his “buyer” in the morning and the buyer informed the Accused that she was interested “in buying 50 cartons”[^62];

> (iv)     he contacted “Ah Bui” for delivery to be made, and waited with the “buyer” at the “pickup location” at Block 251[^63]; and

> (v)     the “buyer” was a Chinese female in her 60s, who was about 170cm in height and had shoulder-length hair[^64].

## Closing Submissions

### The Prosecution’s submissions

41     The Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that Ong was consistent in his evidence and was able to provide specific details of the Accused’s involvement in relation to the seized cigarettes. While Ong had initially given a statement to the Customs officers implicating the Accused for 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes, he subsequently gave an explanation on why he had done so[^65].

42     The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused was not a credible witness, and his evidence was riddled with external and internal inconsistencies. The Accused was evasive and failed to put facts, which were pertinent to the Defence case, to Ong[^66].

### The Defence’s submissions

43     The Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that the evidence of the Customs officers was insufficient to prove the charges against the Accused[^67]. As for Ong’s evidence, it ought to be rejected as Ong was not a credible witness and his evidence implicating the Accused for the full consignment of the seized cigarettes was uncorroborated[^68].

44     In addition, the Prosecution had not adduced any “evidence to show that the Accused was dealing with the seized cigarettes” as “he was arrested by Customs even before he had done any physical acts to show \[that he was\] dealing with the seized cigarettes”[^69].

45     The Defence also submitted that “Customs had an agenda to fix and hang the Accused”[^70], and suggested that Ong was in fact given “an early release on tagging” by giving a “new positive statement from prison” which implicated the Accused for the whole amount of the seized cigarettes[^71].

## My decision

### Joinder of charges

46     Section 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) states:

> **Trial for more than one offence**

> **134**.    If, in one series of acts connected so as to form the same transaction, 2 or more offences are committed by the same person, then he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence.

47     I was satisfied that the proceeded charges against the Accused were so connected that they formed the same transaction, and the Accused could be tried for both offences at one trial.

### The ingredients of the charges

48     The ingredients for the proceeded charges are:

> (a)     the Accused was concerned in dealing with uncustomed goods, _i.e._, the duty-unpaid cigarettes;

> (b)     the Accused did so with the intent to defraud the Government of any excise duty (in relation to the Customs charge) and Goods and Services Tax (in relation to the GST charge); and

> (c)     the Accused had a previous conviction for dealing with uncustomed goods under the Customs Act, which conviction has not been set aside.

49     Having dealt with the preliminary point of joinder of charges and the ingredients of the charges, I next considered whether the Prosecution had proved its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The charges against the Accused did not present any complex issue of law.

50     It was not disputed by the Defence that the Accused knew that the seized cigarettes were duty-unpaid cigarettes. The Accused also did not dispute that he was previously convicted of dealing with uncustomed goods under the Customs Act, which conviction has not been set aside.

51     The main witness for the Prosecution was Ong. While the Prosecution called eight other witnesses for its case, the evidence of the main Customs officers provided background facts leading to the arrest of the Accused, and did not implicate the Accused for the full amount of the seized cigarettes. The evidence of SCO Farhan and SCO Sinn was mainly formal in nature.

### Meaning of “concerned in”

52     The Defence submitted that the Customs officers had “tripped or fumbled big time” and “jumped the gun and arrested the Accused…, before he did anything to show a dealing with the seized cigarettes”[^72]. The Defence also repeatedly submitted that the Accused was not observed to have “done any physical acts”[^73] in relation to the duty-unpaid cigarettes. The Defence’s argument appeared to suggest that there must be some evidence of the Accused having physical contact with the cigarettes before the charges against the Accused for being “concerned in dealing” with the seized cigarettes could be established. The Defence did not cite any case law to support its position.

53     On the meaning of the expression “concerned in”, I found the Malaysian case, _PP v Chua Yew Eng & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[1968\] 2 MLJ 108</span> (“_Chua Yew Eng_”), cited by the Prosecution, instructive. While the offence in _Chua Yew Eng_ was for the importation of uncustomed goods, the Court’s observation in relation to the meaning of “concerned in” was applicable to the present case. In that case, the Court held:

> … It is indicative of the fact that whoever imports into the Federation goods contrary to \[the\] prohibition imposed is not the only person covered by the phrase “concerned in”. The person who arranges to have the goods imported into the Federation contrary to the prohibition may be a person who is concerned in the offence… _Anyone interested or who consciously participates in any step whatever to promote or aid the object of illegally bringing goods into the Federation is caught within the purview of the section if such interest or involvement is at a stage prior to the completion of the offence_…

> \[emphasis added\]

54     The position taken in _Chua Yew Eng_, in relation to the meaning of the expression “concerned in”, was followed by the High Court in _Chew Gim Ser v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 201</span> at \[44\] (“_Chew Gim Ser_”):

> There is also the Malaysian case of _PP v Chua Yew Eng_ <span class="citation">\[1968\] 2 MLJ 108</span> where it was held that, in interpreting the phrase “concerned in” in relation to customs legislation prohibiting the importation of certain goods, _a person who arranges for the import of such prohibited goods could be regarded as a person concerned in the offence_.

> \[emphasis added\]

55     In _Chew Gim Ser_, the appellant faced charges under the Customs Act, two of which were for importing uncustomed cigarettes into Singapore. The appellant was convicted at the conclusion of a trial by the trial judge who found that the appellant was “concerned in the importation” of uncustomed cigarettes. His appeal against conviction was dismissed by Yong Pung How CJ who stated categorically at \[43\] that:

> It was clearly not necessary for the appellant to have personally brought the cigarettes into Singapore for him to be held criminally liable, so long as it could be shown that he had caused Khairu to bring the cigarettes into Singapore.

56     It therefore seemed clear to me that the Accused need not have any physical contact with the duty-unpaid cigarettes in order for the charges against him to be made out.

### Ong was a credible witness

57     In assessing the evidence of Ong and the Accused, I took into account their demeanour in court, which was important in cases such as this, where it was one person’s word against the other.

58     The Defence devoted many paragraphs of its submissions on the unreliability of Ong’s testimony alleging that he was not a credible witness who was “proven to be a liar”, and that his evidence was “toxic”[^74] and uncorroborated. In addition, Ong was an accomplice and his evidence should therefore be treated with caution.

59     With regards to Ong being an accomplice, I was mindful of illustration (_b_) to section 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed):

> **Court may presume existence of certain fact**

> **116**.    The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.

_Illustrations_

> The court may presume –

>> …

>> (_b_)    that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution; …

60     In the present case, I did not consider Ong to be unworthy of credit merely because of his status as an accomplice. Ong had already been dealt with, and he had completed serving his sentence at the time he testified in court.

61     In the course of the trial, I was able to observe the demeanour of Ong and the Accused. Ong came across as a forthcoming witness in court. I found him to be a credible witness, and his evidence on his relationship with the Accused and their arrangement with respect to the 256kg of duty-unpaid cigarettes was textured and believable.

62     I was conscious of the fact that Ong had given an earlier version to the Customs officers, implicating the Accused for 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes, instead of the full consignment of the seized cigarettes. I accepted the reasons he gave for initially implicating the Accused for only 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes _i.e._, that Boss had previously promised him a sum of $5,000.00 and instructed him to “bear the consequences”. In addition, the Accused had told the Customs officers, in Ong’s presence, that he had only intended to purchase 50 cartons of the seized cigarettes, which Ong understood the Accused to be telling him (Ong) that the Accused should only be implicated for 50 cartons of the seized cigarettes.

63     I further accepted Ong’s explanation for subsequently deciding to tell the truth in relation to the Accused’s role. He explained that after pleading guilty to the charges and being given a custodial term, he was not paid the promised $5,000.00 and felt that there was a breach of trust on the part of Boss[^75]. In addition, he decided to tell the truth because he came to know from the Customs officer, who visited him in prison, that one of the buyers had been arrested; and that Boss and the Accused had sold duty-unpaid cigarettes to students[^76]. Ong took issue with them selling duty-unpaid cigarettes to students as Ong, too, has a child[^77]. Furthermore, Ong was receiving counselling while in prison[^78]. The Defence did not challenge Ong’s explanation.

64     I rejected the submission by the Defence that Ong had given the further statement implicating the Accused for the full amount of the seized cigarettes in the hope of getting “an early release on tagging” or to spite the Accused, and the possibility of “some hanky-panky” being involved[^79]. These suggestions were not put to Ong in cross-examination. It is trite law that any “matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to \[the witness\]”[^80]. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67[^81] is clear:

> It seems to me to be _absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made_, and not to take his evidence and passed it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit…

> \[emphasis added\]

65     I similarly rejected the suggestion by the Defence that Ong could have given the further statement involuntarily[^82] and the allegation that the Singapore Customs had “a clear motive to hang the Accused, with a larger crime”[^83]. The allegation was preposterous and totally unsupported by any objective evidence.

66     Ong had already been dealt with and served his sentence in relation to the 256kg of seized cigarettes and there is no reason for him to falsely implicate the Accused – he had nothing to gain by implicating the Accused belatedly for the full amount of the seized cigarettes. There was no basis to suggest that Ong could have an advantage to gain from the Singapore Prison Service by co-operating with the Singapore Customs – they are separate entities and the Singapore Customs clearly has no influence over the Singapore Prison Service on issues relating to remission and release of prisoners on electronic tagging.

67     It was also clear to me that this was not a case where Ong was anxious to testify against the Accused. I further disagreed with the Defence that Ong had “ulterior motives to accuse the Accused” for the full amount of the seized cigarettes[^84]. First, it was not put to Ong that he had ulterior motives for implicating the Accused for the full amount. I have dealt, at \[64\], with the effect of failure to put material aspects of the Defence case to a prosecution witness. Second, Ong was a reluctant prosecution witness – having failed to turn up in court on the first day of trial, which resulted in a Warrant to Arrest being issued to bring him to court. When asked why he did not turn up in court, his response was that he did not wish to testify against the Accused[^85].

68     Obviously, this was not a case where Ong was eager to testify against the Accused and get the Accused into trouble. If Ong had wanted to frame the Accused, he would have implicated the Accused for the full amount of the seized cigarettes right from the start, instead of merely 50 cartons. There was no reason for Ong to implicate the Accused for the full amount at this late stage – after all, Ong had already been dealt with and there was nothing to be gained by Ong for giving false evidence against the Accused. There was also no suggestion by the Accused that Ong bore a grudge against him – by the Accused’s account, theirs appeared to be a cordial relationship[^86].

### The Accused was concerned in dealing with the seized cigarettes

69     Having accepted the evidence of Ong, I found that the Accused was concerned in dealing with the seized cigarettes, which included, amongst others:

> (i)     liaising with buyers for the purchase and collection of the seized cigarettes[^87];

> (ii)     collecting payment from buyers at Block 251[^88];

> (iii)     instructing Ong in the distribution of the remaining duty-unpaid cigarettes after Ong had distributed the cigarettes to the customers at Block 251[^89];

> (iv)     instructing Ong to rent a Truck and giving him money for the rental of the Truck for the conveyance of duty-unpaid cigarettes[^90]; and

> (v)     paying Ong $25.00 for each cardboard box of duty-unpaid cigarettes that Ong delivered[^91].

In addition, Ong would report to the Accused each time, after collecting duty-unpaid cigarettes from “Boss”[^92].

### The Accused was not a credible witness

70     As for the Accused’s defence that he was not involved in the full amount of duty-unpaid cigarettes, I rejected his version which was both externally and internally inconsistent. Some of the more glaring inconsistencies are as follows:

> (i)     The Accused claimed that he was waiting with an unknown lady for Ong as both of them wanted to purchase cigarettes from Ong. His evidence in court regarding the unknown lady was totally inconsistent with his statement (P10) – which was that the lady was known to him and was his buyer.

> (ii)     The Accused claimed that he was intending to purchase 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes from Ong for his personal consumption on the day in question. However, it was also his testimony that he had more than 10 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes at home at that time. No explanation was proffered on why there was a need to purchase another 50 cartons of cigarettes when he had 10 cartons at home.

> There would not have been a need for the Accused to stock up on duty-unpaid cigarettes since the Accused claimed that he also smoked duty-paid cigarettes[^93], and could contact Ong anytime he wanted duty-unpaid cigarettes[^94].

> In any event, his claim that he had duty-unpaid cigarettes at home was inconsistent with the evidence of CCO Tan, who testified that he and his team did not find anything incriminating in the Accused’s flat. CCO Tan’s evidence on this issue was not challenged by the Defence.

> (iii)     The Accused claimed that he was a heavy smoker. However, this was in direct conflict with his statement (P10) that he was a non-smoker. In addition, the Accused claimed that he paid about $200.00 to $250.00 per carton of duty-unpaid cigarettes, which was illogical since that would mean that he was paying more for duty-unpaid cigarettes than duty-paid cigarettes.

> Furthermore, the Accused claimed that he had $2,400.00 with him on 9 March 2018, for the purpose of purchasing 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes from Ong. The $2,400.00 would not have been sufficient for him to pay for 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes, if they were priced at $200.00 to $250.00 per carton. Even if I accepted the Accused’s belated claim that the cost was $50.00 per carton of duty-unpaid cigarettes, he would still be $100.00 short.

> (iv)     The Accused claimed that he was not given a chance to speak at the COC and hence could not have told a Customs officer, in the presence of Ong, that he was purchasing 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes from Ong. This was not put to Ong at all when Ong was on the stand, and is suggestive that the Accused’s claim that he was not given a chance to speak at the COC was an afterthought.

> (v)     The Accused mentioned belatedly that the $2,400.00 was to be handed over to one “Ang Lu” for the purchase of 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes[^95].

> This was markedly different from his earlier evidence that he was purchasing duty-unpaid cigarettes directly from Ong, and also from his statement (P10). In his statement, the Accused mentioned one “En Loo” and claimed that “En Loo” had introduced him to one “Ah Guan”. “Ah Guan” was the one who gave Ong’s mobile number to him and told him to contact Ong if the Accused wanted any duty-unpaid cigarettes[^96].

71     Apart from the multiple inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence, the Accused was also extremely evasive on the stand on numerous occasions:

(i) On his alleged cigarette consumption rate (Day 3, page 47)

 |
| 

PO:

 | 

… that would mean that you smoke 1 stick of cigarettes 16---every 16 minutes, correct?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

I didn’t time myself.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

On average. On average, Mr Quek.

 |
| 

PO:

 | 

I’m---I’m giving you the average.

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

I smoked while I was working.

 |
| 

PO:

 | 

So you smoked at shorter durations than 16 minutes from 1 stick to another stick in the mornings? Is that what you are telling us?

I did not continuously smoke cigarettes, but I smoke quite frequently.

Until today, it’s 2 to 3 years.

…

 |
| 

PO:

No, but you will agree with me that’s a marked difference to 4 months?

He know me, I do not know him, because I was doing business, there’s a lot of people buying things from me.

Accused:

No.

72     Given the material inconsistencies in the Accused’s testimony and his evasive demeanour in court, I disbelieved the Accused’s version that his intention was to purchase 50 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes from Ong for his personal consumption. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the Accused accordingly.

## The sentence

73     The Accused is liable for enhanced punishment which includes a mandatory term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 years.

### The Accused’s antecedents

74     The Accused has numerous antecedents dating back to 1967 which include property-related offences, offences under the Road Traffic Act and the Customs Act. His most recent conviction was in 2012 for offences under the Customs Act, for which he was sentenced to a total of 11 months’ imprisonment, and a total fine of $1,511,000.00 (in default, 31 months’ imprisonment). The Accused did not pay the fine.

75     The Accused was also placed under Detention Orders and Police Supervision Orders under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provision) Act between 1964 and 1979.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence

76     The Prosecution relied on the case of _PP v Pang Shuo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 903</span> and submitted for a custodial term of 28 months – 28 months’ imprisonment for the Customs charge and 4 months’ for the GST charge, both sentences to run concurrently.

77     As for the fines, the Prosecution submitted for the mandatory minimum fine of $3,279,360.00 (in default, 17 months’ imprisonment) for the Customs charge and the mandatory minimum fine of $238,335.00 (in default, 3 months’ imprisonment) for the GST charge.

### The mitigation plea

78     In mitigation, the Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that:

> (i)     the Accused was not highly educated and was a low-waged worker who supplemented his salary by dealing with duty-unpaid cigarettes in his younger days[^97];

> (ii)     the Accused’s testimony that his children gave him $3,000.00 every month was not true, and he was only earning about $1,000.00 per month[^98];

> (iii)     the Accused denied being concerned in dealing with all the duty-unpaid cigarettes which were seized on 9 March 2018, even though he had been convicted of the charges[^99]; and

> (iv)     the Accused is of advanced age and ill-health[^100].

79     The Defence also indicated that it was in agreement with the Prosecution’s sentencing position[^101].

### Decision on sentence

#### The Pang Shuo sentencing framework

80     In _PP v Pang Shuo_, the sentencing bands for an offender dealing with duty-unpaid cigarettes were set out by the High Court in the following graph at \[49\][^102]:

![]([2020] SGDC 0164_Image/[2020] SGDC 0164_image1.png)

The High Court explained at \[46\][^103] that in scenario 1, as depicted in the graph, the “offender is assumed to have the following characteristics”:

> (a)     a first-time offender who is not a youthful offender;

> (b)     performing a physical role in the cigarette smuggling operation as a paid worker but with no management control or profit share in the syndicate; and

> (c)     pleads guilty at the earliest opportunity.

As for scenario 2, this would apply to an offender with the following characteristics:

> (a)     a first-time offender who is not a youthful offender;

> (b)     performing a physical role in the cigarette smuggling operation as a paid worker but with no management control or profit share in the syndicate; and

> (c)     claims trial and shows no remorse[^104].

81     The present case falls under scenario 2 of the sentencing framework as the Accused had claimed trial. However, there was no evidence that he played a management role in the syndicate or had a share in the profits earned by the syndicate. The Customs charge against the Accused was under section 128I of the Customs Act, which carries the same punishment as offences under sections 128F and 128H of the same Act.

#### The appropriate sentence

82     In submitting for a custodial term of 28 months’ imprisonment, the Prosecution highlighted that the Accused was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and served a 31-month default term for his conviction in 2012 for similar offences. The total term he served for the 2012 conviction was therefore 42 months. The Prosecution therefore submitted that there should be an uplift of the sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment for the present charges and a global sentence of 48 months’ imprisonment, including the default term, would be appropriate. The Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s sentencing position[^105].

83     The total weight of the duty-unpaid cigarettes involved in the current case was 256kg. According to the graph in _PP v Pang Shuo_, the starting point for the Customs charge is therefore a sentence of about 26 months’ imprisonment for an offender who claimed trial. As for the GST charge, the Prosecution’s submission for a 4-months custodial term is not out of line with the sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution.

84     In the present case, there were no exceptional circumstances raised in the mitigation plea warranting a departure from the benchmark. I agreed with the Prosecution that a global sentence which is higher than the previous term of 42 months was warranted. This was the Accused’s third prosecution for offences relating to duty-unpaid cigarettes – the Accused appeared to be undeterred by previous incarcerations and had continued dealing with duty-unpaid cigarettes after his release from prison. In addition, four other similar charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, and the Accused did not appear to show any remorse – maintaining that he was not liable for the full consignment of 256kg of uncustomed cigarettes despite his conviction.

85     Other than a custodial term, the Accused was liable to a minimal fine amounting to $3,517,695.00. The Defence indicated that the Accused would not be able to pay the fine. In calibrating the appropriate sentence (including the default sentence) against the Accused, I took into account the principle of totality in sentencing[^106].

86     Having the above principle in mind, I imposed a sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment on the Accused for the Customs charge and a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for the GST charge. As both charges related to the same batch of duty-unpaid cigarettes, I ordered both sentences to run concurrently.

87     As for the default sentences, I was of the view that a total default term of 18 months’ imprisonment was sufficient, although the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution would seem to suggest a slightly higher default term. The total sentence the Accused would have to serve, if he was unable to pay the mandatory minimum fine of $3,517,695.00, would therefore be 44 months. I am mindful that this was the Accused’s third conviction for dealing with duty-unpaid cigarettes, and ordinarily, an offender who is a repeat offender will be given a sentence which is higher than the starting point of 26 months’ imprisonment. However, the Accused was 72 years old at the time of conviction and sentencing, and will be about 74 years old by the time he is released. With his advanced age, I am hopeful that he will not re-offend.

## Conclusion

88     Having considered the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, the charges against the Accused, and a global sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $3,517,695.00 (in default, 18 months’ imprisonment) was appropriate.
