### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to 10 charges of committing house-breaking by night in order to commit theft, by using his old access pass to gain entry into the level 1 warehouse of CEVA Logistics Building located at No. 15 Greenwich Drive, Singapore, on the following occasions:

2       The charges were framed under s 457 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”) and, as the house-breaking by night was committed in order to commit the offence of theft, carried a mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment, and a maximum of 14 years’ imprisonment.

3       Another 26 similar charges under s 457 and s 380 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. All the charges involved stealing similar products from the same location, spanning a period from December 2017 to September 2018. The value of stolen goods involved in the proceeded charges amounted to about S$57,000, while the value of stolen goods in all the charges amounted to about S$164,000.

4       After hearing parties on mitigation and sentencing, I imposed a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment for each charge. I ordered two of the sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of **60 months’ imprisonment**. This was backdated to 27 February 2020, when the Accused’s present period of remand first began.

5       The Accused is now appealing against his sentence.

## Statement of Facts

6       The salient points in the Statement of Facts, to which the Accused admitted without qualification, are set out below.

7       The Accused was previously employed by CEVA Logistics as a forklift driver. CEVA Logistics is a company which provides logistical services and warehouse space to other companies to store their goods at a warehouse located at CEVA Logistics Center, 15 Greenwich Drive, Singapore (“the Warehouse”). The Warehouse is a building used for the custody of property.

8       The co-accused is Shahniran Kamisran (“Shahniran”). At the material time, he was employed as a Logistics Assistant with BTFL Pte Ltd (“BTFL”), an online business dealing in baby and beauty products. BTFL rented a space at the Warehouse.

9       The complainant is Azlan Bin Ali, the Head Logistics officer of BTFL.

10     On 4 September 2018 at about 3.40 p.m., the complainant called the police and informed “_Theft in my warehouse happened last night about 11pm. I see from the footage, some stocks taken out without my knowledge._” The incident location was the Warehouse.

11     For the purpose of his employment with CEVA Logistics, the Accused was issued a staff access pass (“the access pass”) which allowed him to gain access into the Warehouse by unlocking a door which secured the Warehouse from unauthorized entry.

12     Sometime in 2017, the Accused began to steal BTFL products stored at the Warehouse for his own use and to sell them for money. He targeted the warehouse space rented by BTFL as it was situated the furthest away from the security staff stationed at the Warehouse.

13     Sometime in April 2018, the Accused was dismissed from his employment at CEVA Logistics, However, he retained the access pass without the consent of CEVA Logistics, even after multiple requests were made for him to return it.

14     After his dismissal from CEVA Logistics, the Accused continued committing theft of BTFL’s goods from the Warehouse on numerous occasions. To facilitate his theft of the goods, the Accused engaged one “Darren”, a delivery driver, to assist him to load the stolen goods into Darren’s van, and to deliver the stolen goods to his customers. For each delivery, the Accused would pay Darren $50. He did not inform Darren that the goods were stolen.

15     The Accused also requested Shahniran to assist him to (a) obtain information on overtime deployment of BTFL’s staff within the Warehouse, in order to assist the Accused to ascertain when he should go the Warehouse to steal items, (b) request that the door to BTFL’s warehouse space be left unlocked so that the Accused could gain access to commit theft therein, and (c) assist in setting aside items belonging to BTFL, which the Accused wished to steal.

### Facts pertaining to DAC 904543-2019

16     On 2 July 2018, the Accused intended to commit theft of BTFL’s goods inside the Warehouse. He arranged to meet Darren at the entrance of the Warehouse. Before heading to the Warehouse, the Accused checked with Shahniran on whether any staff of BTFL was working overtime. Shahniran informed the Accused that BTFL’s staff would usually end overtime work by 8.30 p.m.

17     At about 9.53 p.m., the Accused arrived at the Warehouse. As the door to the Warehouse was locked, the Accused gained access into the Warehouse by using the access pass to unlock the said door. The Accused instructed Darren to drive his van into the loading bay of the Warehouse. The Accused then entered the Warehouse and removed 50 cartons of “GOO.N” baby diapers of unknown sizes, which were in the possession of the complainant, from the Warehouse. The diapers were then loaded into Darren’s van. They had a total value of S$5,380.

18     The Accused then instructed Darren to drive to the residence of one Cho Cho Lwin (“Evelyn”), one of the Accused’s customers. He sold the 50 cartons of diapers to Evelyn for about S$1,250.

### Facts pertaining to the remaining nine charges

19     The Accused used the same modus operandi for the other nine proceeded charges. The details regarding the date, time, stolen goods and what he did with the stolen goods are set out below:

20     On 3 September 2018, the complainant discovered that diapers were missing from the Warehouse. When he viewed the CCTV footage, he saw the Accused and Darren loading the stolen diapers into the van. He then informed the security personnel to keep a lookout for the van.

21     On 4 September 2018, the Accused and Darren returned to the Warehouse for the Accused to steal more goods, and were detained by security personnel. They were subsequently placed under arrest.

22     From December 2017 to September 2018, the Accused returned to the Warehouse to steal goods from BTFL on no less than 36 occasions. The total value of the stolen items was at least $164,689.70.

23     The police managed to recover the stolen goods to a value of about $15,493.04 from the Accused and his customers. The Accused did not make any restitution.

24     Shahniran was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment on a charge of abetting the Accused to commit theft-in-dwelling of items amounting to $807, an offence under s 380 read with s 109 of the Penal Code.

## Antecedents

25     The Accused was traced for betting in a common betting house (2001) and mischief (2009), for which he received fines. On 27 February 2020, he was convicted for drug consumption and sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment. His sentence was backdated, and he completed serving this sentence on 27 February 2020.

## Mitigation

26     In mitigation, the Accused informed that his mother suffered from a stroke and he had a child studying in university, and they both needed him. He apologised to the company for his wrongdoings, and informed that he was regretful of what he had done. He also expressed his wish for his sentences to run concurrently, and for the sentence to be backdated.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

27     The Prosecution requested for a term of at least 30 months for each charge, and a global sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment. The Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) made the argument that an uplift from the mandatory two years’ imprisonment was well justified, as the Accused had committed a series of very serious offences over a protracted period of time. The offences were highly premeditated and involved the roping in of other accomplices. The DPP also pointed out that the quantum of the goods stolen and hence the loss to the victim was considerable, amounting to over $160,000 in total.

28     The DPP also relied on some case precedents under s 457 of the Penal Code, for which sentences ranging from 30 months to 3 years’ imprisonment per charge were meted out.

## Court’s decision

### An uplift from the mandatory minimum per charge was appropriate

29     I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift from the mandatory minimun of two years’ imprisonment per charge was appropriate, bearing in mind the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The Accused had gone on a crime spree by breaking into the Warehouse on a total of 36 occasions over a period of about 10 months. His actions were brazen and reflected a callous disregard for law and order, and respect for the property of others. For the proceeded charges, the offences were committed almost on a weekly basis.

> (b)     The offences were highly premeditated and involved meticulous planning by the Accused. He was the mastermind and had roped in other accomplices to assist him in his criminal enterprise. In particular, he had roped in Shahniran in order to get the inside information he needed to steal from BTFL, essentially instigating Shahniran into committing an offence against his own employer. The Accused himself had also made use of his own knowledge of his ex-employer and abused the access pass given to him in order to commit the offences. In fact, I noted that the series of offences commenced in December 2017, when he was still employed by CEVA Logistics. There was therefore an element of abuse of trust as well.

> (c)     The value of items stolen were significant, amounting to a total of more than $160,000. There was no restitution made by the Accused.

30     I did not find any significant mitigating factors in the present case, although I note that the Accused’s antecedents were unrelated. As such, I did not take them into account.

31     A review of the sentencing precedents showed that an uplift from the mandatory minimum was usually imposed, even for cases which appeared less aggravated.

32     In _Thambusamy Ilango v PP_ (MA 340/93), the offender was not a mastermind, but had driven the accomplice to the company’s premises and waited for the accomplice to gain entry into the premises to steal the items. He later drove the accomplice away. The offender had also previously worked for the same company. The stolen property included cash and Mont Blanc pens, valued at $6,320 in total. The accomplice pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. The offender was convicted after trial and sentenced to a term of 30 months’ imprisonment. The offender had no similar antecedents.

33     In _Yim Kwong Meng v PP_ (MA 217/94), the offender pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, two charges of housebreaking by night under s 457 of the Penal Code. He broke into two shops and stole cash and various items from them, valued at $16,150 and $2,600 respectively. 35 other charges, including 11 under s 457 of the Penal Code, were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was untraced and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment on each of the s 457 charges.

34     In _Kannan a/l Rama Chenderan v PP_ (MA 333/2000), the offender was a security officer who found a key to the cafeteria and proceeded to use it to gain access to the cafeteria after operating hours while he was on patrol duty. He had no right of access after operating hours. He broke into the cafeteria on two occasions and stole a Nokia handphone valued at $190, and cash of $14.85. He had a clean record and was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment for each charge. Both sentences ran concurrently.

35     In _PP v Kuppan Vendathan_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 286</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to one charge under s 457 of the Penal Code. He broke into a coffee-shop and stole items valued at $2,038, from the safe. He was untraced, but the court noted that the offences were highly premeditated. The offender had earlier gone to the coffee shop to unlock a rear door before later returning the same night with housebreaking implements such an iron bar, cutter and screwdrivers. He used the iron bar to pry open the office door in the coffee-shop. He was sentenced to a term of 3 years’ imprisonment.

36     In view of the case precedents as well as the aggravating factors set out at \[29\] above, I was of the view that an uplift from the mandatory minimum term of two years’ imprisonment was warranted, and that a term of 36 months’ imprisonment per charge would have been appropriate and well justified.

### Two of the sentences to run consecutively

37     The Accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted on 10 charges. Under s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) (“CPC”), the court must order the sentences for at least two of them to run consecutively.

38     In view of this, and to avoid imposing a “crushing” sentence on the Accused, I decided to calibrate the individual sentences downwards to 30 months’ imprisonment, and ordered for two of the sentences (DAC 930033-2018 and DAC 904543-2019) to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment.

39     I was of the view that this sentence was not “substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved” and did not have the effect of imposing on the Accused “a crushing sentence not in keeping with his record and prospects”. (See _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[54\] and \[57\]).

## Conclusion

40     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a term of 60 months’ imprisonment was appropriate and justified in the present case, and imposed the same accordingly.
