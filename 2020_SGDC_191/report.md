\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 20/2020.\]

18 August 2020

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim against the first and second defendants, who are his brother and nephew respectively, is for the sum of $161,314.17, being part of the proceeds of sale of a property at Everton Park (“the Property”), that was owned by the parties as joint tenants. The plaintiff claims that the second defendant should not have received any part of the sale proceeds, as had not contributed to the purchase of the Property.

2       I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff and the first defendant are brothers. The second defendant is the son of the first defendant. The plaintiff, the first defendant and their father, Lim Kian Ann, were partners in a grocery business at the Property, known as Lim Kian Huat Mini-Supermarket (“the Partnership”).

4       In 1995, the Housing Development Board offered to sell the Property to Lim Kian Ann, the plaintiff and the first defendant. However, the three partners were unable to obtain a mortgage loan to purchase the Property, because of their advanced age. The second defendant who was 25 years old at that time, was then brought in. With the second defendant as a joint purchaser of the Property, a mortgage loan could be obtained. The Property was purchased by Lim Kian Ann, the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant, as joint tenants for the sum of $630,000.

5       A mortgage loan was obtained from Keppel Bank to finance the purchase of the Property. The bank also provided an overdraft facility to the Partnership, with security on the Property.

6       In 1996, Lim Kian Ann withdrew from the Partnership. However, he continued to remain as a joint tenant of the Property.

7       In 2001, Lim Kian Ann passed away. After his death, the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant remained the surviving joint tenants of the Property.

8       The Property was sold for the sum of $1,360,000 in September 2011. The proceeds of sale were divided equally between the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant in 2012.

9       Unfortunately, instead of being happy with the profit that they had made, the sale of the Property gave rise to the present dispute, as the plaintiff now claims that the second defendant is not entitled to any share of the sale proceeds in the Property. The claim in the action herein was filed in January 2018, almost six years after the proceeds of sale were distributed in 2012.

10     The plaintiff’s claim against the defendants is for the sum of $161,314.17, which the plaintiff claims is his share in the sale proceeds of the Property, that was wrongly received by the second defendant. The plaintiff’s position is that:

> (a)     The Property is a partnership property purchased with partnership funds and that the second defendant held his interest in the Property on trust for the Partnership.

> (b)     The second defendant had no beneficial interest in the Property, as he was never a partner in the business and had not made any financial contributions to the purchase of the Property.

11     The second defendant’s position is that the plaintiff, Lim Kian Ann, the first defendant and the second defendant agreed that they would jointly apply for a bank loan, jointly purchase the Property as joint-tenants and each will have an equal share in the Property and equally divide the sale proceeds.[^1]

12     The first defendant takes the same position as the second defendant.[^2] However, the first defendant did not give evidence at the trial. The first defendant’s daughter, Lim Sue Feng, was appointed as his litigation representative,[^3] as the first defendant was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis which caused fluctuating memory and he lacked the mental capacity to understand court proceedings.[^4]

## Issues

13     The key issues at the trial were:

> (a)     whether the Property was partnership property, and

> (b)     whether there was a common intention that the parties would have an equal share in the Property and its sale proceeds.

## Whether the Property was partnership property

14     In relation to the plaintiff’s argument that the Property was partnership property because the Property was purchased using partnership funds, the plaintiff seeks to rely on section 21 of the Partnership Act (Cap 391, 1994 Rev Ed). Section 21 of the Partnership Act provides:

> _Unless the contrary intention appears_, property bought with money belonging to the firm is deemed to have been bought on account of the firm.

> \[emphasis added\]

15     Accordingly, under section 21 of the Partnership Act, it does not suffice to look at only whether the Property was purchased with money belonging to the Partnership. It is necessary to also ascertain whether there was any contrary intention otherwise.

16     The plaintiff further seeks to rely on the High Court decision of _Sim Yak Song v Lim Chang_ (“_Sim Yak Song_”) \[2003\] 3 SLR (R) 351, in support of his argument that the Property was partnership property because it was purchased with partnership funds.[^5]

17     The key issue in _Sim Yak Song_ was in relation to the rights of retired partners to property which the parties agreed was partnership property. The court held that although the certificate of title of the property listed the retired partners and the remaining partners as joint tenants, the asset was held on trust for the partnership (at \[10\]). The court found that the retired partners did not have a right to the property after they withdrew from the partnership and that the retired partners were merely unsecured creditors of the partnership (at \[12\]). Accordingly, the court ordered the retired partners to sign the relevant documents transferring the property to the remaining partners.

18     I am of the view that _Sim Yak Song_ is distinguishable for the following reasons:

> (a)     In _Sim Yak Song_, it was common ground that the property was partnership property (at \[4\]). In the present case, the plaintiff’s position that the Property was partnership property is disputed by the defendants.

> (b)     In _Sim Yak Song_, the property was listed in the partnership accounts as an asset of the partnership (at \[10\]). The Property in the present case, was not listed in the partnership accounts as an asset of the Partnership.[^6]

> (c)     The defendants in the present case are seeking to rely on an agreement that the parties held the Property in equal shares. Such an agreement, would be evidence of a “contrary intention”, referred to in section 21 of the Partnership Act. No such contrary intention was raised by the retired partners in _Sim Yak Song_.

> (d)     In our case, Lim Kian Ann withdrew from the Partnership in 1996, but continued to be a joint tenant of the Property. The remaining partners, namely the plaintiff and the first defendant, did not ask Lim Kian Ann to withdraw as a joint tenant of the Property. It is therefore inconsistent for the plaintiff to now claim that the Property is partnership property.

> (e)     When Lim Kian Ann passed away, his Estate Duty Return stated that his share in the Property was 25/100.[^7] This again is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s position that the Property was partnership property, as Lim Kian Ann was no longer a partner at the time he passed away in 2001.

19     In the light of the aforesaid, I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s argument that the Property was partnership property because the Property was purchased using partnership funds. It is necessary to take the further step under section 21 of the Partnership Act, to ascertain whether there was a contrary intention.

## Common intention of the parties

20     The plaintiff sought to rely on the Court of Appeal’s decision on common intention constructive trusts in _Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1048</span>. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that a key consideration in determining the parties’ beneficial interest in a property, at \[160 (b)\], is:

> … is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from \[their respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property\]? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead …

21     In the present case, I am of the view that there is sufficient evidence of a common intention of the parties that they held the beneficial interest of the Property in equal shares, as follows:

> (a)     The plaintiff, the first defendant, the second defendant and Lim Kian Ann purchased the Property as joint tenants, even though the second defendant was not a partner in the business. Although the plaintiff’s position is that the only reason for this is because the partners in the business could not obtain a loan because of the age of the partners who were Lim Kian Ann, the plaintiff and the first defendant, I am unable to accept that this meant that second defendant had no beneficial interest in the Property. By agreeing to purchase the Property as a joint tenant, the second defendant exposed himself to liability under the mortgage. The second defendant further exposed himself to liability under the overdraft facility for the Partnership, that was secured on the Property. It makes no sense for the second defendant to have taken on such liability, if he had no beneficial interest whatsoever in the Property.

> (b)     If there was a decline in the partnership business such that the Partnership was unable to pay the sums borrowed, the bank may seek recovery from the second defendant as a mortgagor of the Property, even though he was not a partner in the business. In the premises, I find incredible, the plaintiff’s position that notwithstanding this, the second defendant had no beneficial interest in the Property.

> (c)     The purchase of the Property could not have proceeded if the second defendant was not a party to the transaction, as the other parties could not have obtained a loan on their own because of their advanced age. None of the parties would have benefitted from the transaction, if the second defendant was not brought in to purchase the Property.

> (d)     When the Property was sold in September 2011, with the sale completed in January 2012, the proceeds of sale were equally distributed between the plaintiff, the first defendant and the second defendant.

> (e)     On 12 February 2012, the second defendant sent an email on the sale proceeds received, to the plaintiff’s son, Giovi Lim, asking Giovi to “explain the breakdown to \[the plaintiff\], should he not understand” and that the amount was “To be distributed back to the 3 names as stated in the legal document”.[^8] There was no objection to this distribution in Giovi’s reply to this email.[^9] In cross-examination, when this was pointed out to the plaintiff, the plaintiff claimed that his son “Told me but did not tell me clearly.”[^10] I found this explanation incredible, as the position that the plaintiff is now alleging is fundamentally different from what was set out in the second defendant’s aforesaid email of 12 February 2012. It is hard to believe that the plaintiff’s son would not have known of the plaintiff’s purported position and replied accordingly.

> (f)     The plaintiff claims that he brought up to the first defendant, the issue that the second defendant should not receive any part of the sale proceeds and that his youngest sister, Lim Pek Hua should get a share in the Property having slogged for the Partnership for many years.[^11] He wanted each of them to pay Lim Pek Hua $50,000 from the sale proceeds. The second defendant resisted the claim and a suit was commenced in June 2012 by Lim Pek Hua against the second defendant. However, no suit was commenced by the plaintiff against the first and second defendants at that time.

> (g)     In cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that he had pursued on behalf of his sister, her claim against the second defendant.[^12] Lim Pek Hua’s suit against the second defendant was settled and discontinued in 2013,[^13] with the second defendant agreeing to pay Lim Pek Hua half her claim. There is no reasonable explanation for the plaintiff’s failure to commence his own suit against the first and second defendants at that time. Instead, the plaintiff only commenced the action herein in 2018, five years after his sister’s claim was discontinued.

## Conclusion

22     In conclusion, I found the plaintiff’s case that the second defendant had no beneficial interest in the Property unbelievable. It is more likely that there was an agreement between the plaintiff, the first and second defendants and Lim Kian Ann, that they would each have an equal share in the Property and sale proceeds.

23     Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed with costs.
