30 March 2020

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty before me to one charge, namely:

> (a)     DAC 924627-2019:

>> are charged that you, from 29.11.2018 to 24.06.2019, did contravene the provisions of Section 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), to wit, that without reasonable cause, you did remain in Singapore for a period of 6 months and 27 days (208 days) after the expiry of the Visit Pass issued to you on 29.10.2018 permitting you to remain in Singapore till 28.11.2018 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 15(1), punishable under Section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133).

2       I sentenced the Accused to 5 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $2000 in default 8 days’ imprisonment.

3       The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed an appeal against it. She is released on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

4       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentence.

#### The Statement of Facts

5       The Accused is Nicole Louise Sobotker, a female South Africa national, aged 32 years old. On 24.06.2019, the Accused was arrested by Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at Blk 491G Tampines Street 45, #XXX, Singapore, when she could not produce any evidence to prove that she was staying lawfully in Singapore.

6       She was subsequently referred to ICA Investigation Branch for further investigation. At the time of her arrest, the Accused was in possession of a South Africa passport bearing serial No. XXX, which indicated that she had been in Singapore on a Visit Pass since 29.10.2018.

7       Investigations revealed that the Accused had been entering and leaving Singapore on many occasions between January and October 2018 and had been issued with a 30-day Visit Pass each time she arrived in Singapore. The Accused is aware that she is only allowed to stay in Singapore for 30 days.

8       The Accused last arrived in Singapore by flight on **29.10.2018** and was issued with a 30-day Visit Pass valid till **28.11.2018**. Upon the expiry of the Visit Pass on 28.11.2018, the Accused did not leave Singapore or apply for any extension of stay.

9       She then remained here unlawfully. In addition, a search made with the Data Processing Branch of ICA indicated that after 28.11.2018, no extension of stay was granted to the Accused.

10     The Accused had from **29.11.2018** until her arrest on **24.06.2019**, without reasonable cause, remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period of **6 months and 27 days (208 days)** and has therefore committed an offence under Section 15(1), punishable under Section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133).

#### Antecedent records

11     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

12     The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents showing the range of imprisonment for similar length of overstaying is 4-6 weeks’ of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000. They also highlighted the fact that the Accused only pleaded guilty on the day of the trial.

13     The sentencing table is as follows:

#### Mitigation

14     The Accused who was unrepresented asked for leniency and apologised for committing the offence. She claimed that she had been working in Malaysia for some time and was in the process of being transferred to work in Singapore but she had been wrongly advised on the proper procedure without elaborating further.

#### Principle of Sentencing

15     The sentencing principle in the present case for an offence under the Immigration Act is clearly one of deterrence to ensure that the immigration policies of the country are strictly adhered to. The present offence under section 15(1) punishable under section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act provides for mandatory caning of 3 strokes in addition to imprisonment not exceeding 6 months. Where a person is exempted from caning as in the present case, he will be in lieu of caning be punished with a fine not exceeding $6000. The prescribed sentences reflect the seriousness of such offences and Parliament’s intention to ensure that our immigration laws are not breached.

16     The Accused did not merely just exceed her stay by a few days past the minimum 90-day period which would trigger a more severe punishment but by more than 3 months past the more serious offending period.

17     Imprisonment is mandatory for this offence. There is no discretion for the court to impose a fine. The range of imprisonment can vary from 1 day up to a maximum of 6 months. The most important factor on the length of imprisonment would be the length of overstay. Prosecution has tendered a list of sentencing precedents showing that the sentencing trend is between 4-6 weeks of imprisonment for a period of overstaying of between 6 and 7 months and an average fine that is closer to $2,000.

18     The Accused had been travelling in and out of Singapore frequently. She knew that her visit pass is for a duration of 30 days. She has no excuse for not leaving or for not applying for an extension. She cannot put it down to being wrongly advised on procedure as there is no reason why she could not have gone to the Immigration authority herself to extend her stay. She knew very well when her last date of her permitted stay in Singapore was and she would also know clearly whether there was any permission given to her for an extended stay.

19     Accordingly, I found that there was no significant mitigating factors present other than the fact she had pleaded guilty, albeit at a late stage. I have therefore imposed a sentence that is in line with other similar cases dealt with by our courts based on the same period of overstaying and a plea of guilt.

#### Conclusion

20     The sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine in lieu of caning of $2,000 with a default sentence of 8 days in all the circumstances of the case cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.
