Companies – Oppression – Minority shareholders – Statutory derivative action

27 September 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       The applicant Lee Cheun Ooi (“Lee”), also known as Evans, seeks leave under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50) to bring an action in the name of Wood Pavilion Pte Ltd (“the Company”) against the two interveners Yeoh Mei Ling (“Yeoh”), also known as Vinny, and IDBOX (S) Pte Ltd (“IDBOX”). Lee owns 30% of the shares in the Company and Yeoh owns the remaining 70%. They are the only two directors of the Company. Yeoh and her husband are the only two directors of IDBOX and they each own 50% of the shares in it.

2       According to the draft Statement of Claim prepared by Lee in this application the intended action in the Company’s name involves the following four claims or groups of claims:

> (a)     A claim that Yeoh breached director’s duties owed to the Company – namely her duty to act in the Company’s best interests and her duty to use reasonable diligence in discharging her functions as director – by diverting business away from it to another company called Peak Interior Renovation Pte Ltd (“Peak Interior”) without obtaining substitute business for the Company, and transferring the Company’s key employees to Peak Interior, and selling off the Company’s assets and equipment and reducing it to an empty shell without business, equipment and employees.

> (b)     A claim that Yeoh breached director’s duties owed to the Company – namely her duty to act in the Company’s best interests and her duty to avoid conflicts between her personal interests and the interests of the Company – by giving IDBOX unauthorised discounts in transactions between the two entities, and a related claim that IDBOX was a knowing recipient of these unauthorised discounts, or an alternative claim that Yeoh and IDBOX conspired together to cause loss to the Company by the unlawful means of causing the Company to give IDBOX unauthorised discounts.

> (c)     A claim that Yeoh breached director’s duties owed to the Company – namely her duty to act in the Company’s best interests, her duty to avoid conflicts between her personal interests and the interests of the Company, and her duty to disclose conflicts of interest – by causing the Company to engage in dealings with a business called H L Builder & Contractor (“HL Builder”) of which she is the sole proprietor and by failing to disclose those dealings.

> (d)     A claim that IDBOX breached an oral agreement entered into between Lee and IDBOX prior to the Company’s incorporation (“the Pre-Incorporation Agreement”) the terms of which purported to confer a benefit on the Company, and a related claim that Yeoh induced IDBOX’s breach of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement.

3       For the reasons that follow, I grant Lee leave to bring an action in the Company’s name against Yeoh and IDBOX in relation to the claims in (d) only – that is, the claim concerning IDBOX’s alleged breach of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement and Yeoh’s alleged inducement of that breach. I decline to grant leave in relation to the other claims, which are (or arise out of) the claims against Yeoh for alleged breaches of director’s duties owed to the Company.

4       I should at the outset dispose of a threshold objection raised by Mr Roshan Singh, counsel for Yeoh and IDBOX. The objection is that the State Courts has no jurisdiction to hear this application because the intended action in the Company’s name invokes s 157 of the Companies Act and only the High Court has jurisdiction to hear allegations of breach of the duties set out in that provision. Even though “Court” is defined in s 4(1) of the Companies Act as the High Court, I do not think the objection is well-founded because there is nothing in the language of s 157 that confines jurisdiction to the “Court”, unlike for instance s 216 where it is expressly stated that relief under that provision is granted on an application to the “Court”.

## Alleged unauthorised discounts given to IDBOX

5       I consider first the claims arising out of the allegation that Yeoh gave unauthorised discounts to IDBOX in its transactions with the Company. From the affidavits it appears that the only evidence of this allegation that Lee is able to provide is a statement by a former employee of the Company Ang Beng Hooi (“Hooi”) that he recalls “\[o\]ne time” when he thought he had finalised the Company’s quoted price with IDBOX’s quantity surveyor but later found out that the “final price was different” and was informed by the quantity surveyor that Yeoh had “changed the price” (para 12 of Hooi’s affidavit). Although at this leave stage I need only be satisfied that the Company’s intended claims against Yeoh and IDBOX are “legitimate and arguable” and the “standard of proof required is low” (see the Court of Appeal decision _Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 340</span> (“_Ang Thiam Swee_”) at \[53\]–\[55\]), I think it is right for me to ask whether it is likely that the Company would be able to present any better evidence in support of the claims in the intended action against Yeoh and IDBOX, and if the answer to that is “no”, to consider that it might not be _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to pursue those claims.

6       Hooi suggests in his affidavit that he is unable to furnish more evidence of unauthorised discounts because he lacks access to the Company’s documents which he says are under Yeoh’s and IDBOX’s control, but this does not seem to me a convincing explanation because the correspondence between solicitors exhibited in Yeoh’s affidavit (at pp 163 to 191) shows that Lee was given copies of the Company’s accounting and other records by the end of March 2018, which was almost a year and a half before Hooi signed his affidavit. At the hearing Mr Daniel Tay, counsel for Lee, advanced a different explanation for the dearth of evidence, which was that in order to avoid unnecessary effort and expense Hooi was not asked to go through the documents in detail prior to this application, and even though Lee has some familiarity with the documents he is not as well-placed as Hooi is to give evidence on unauthorised discounts. Mr Tay argued that if Hooi were to undertake a more thorough examination of the documents – as he would should I grant Lee the leave sought in this application – this would likely reveal further evidence of the unauthorised discounts. But I do not accept this argument. First, this supposed obstacle to obtaining evidence was not explained in Lee’s and Hooi’s affidavits, and so I am not inclined to give it any weight. Second, it seems to me that Lee, being a contractor, is well-equipped to read and understand quotations and price lists and contracts and the like, and so I do not think it would have been unduly difficult for him to have identified material documents and to have asked Hooi to comment on that narrower subset of documents. I am thus led to infer that there is in the documents no better evidence of unauthorised discounts than what Lee has mustered so far, which is no more than Hooi’s vague and uncorroborated recollection that Yeoh changed a “finalised” price on one occasion. Also, Hooi does not state, not even in broad and rough terms, what the difference was between that “finalised” price and the “changed” price that Yeoh was responsible for, so it is not possible to say that this caused the Company any significant loss.

7       Given the evidential challenges that the Company would face in mounting claims against Yeoh and IDBOX in respect of the alleged unauthorised discounts, and given that it is not known how much the Company stands to recover even if it succeeds in those claims, I think it is unlikely that the Company will stand to gain any substantial benefit if it pursues those claims. On that basis alone I consider that it is not _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to pursue those claims and it follows that Lee’s application for leave to have the Company do so fails at that threshold.

## Dealings with HL Builder

8       Turning then to the claim against Yeoh arising out of the Company’s dealings with HL Builder – for convenience I adopt the phraseology used in the draft Statement of Claim and call these the “Self-Dealings” – according to the draft Statement of Claim the Self-Dealings “included” the following: (a) the Company obtained work permits for three foreign workers who were then deployed to do work for HL Builder instead, (b) the Company supplied labour to HL Builder, and (c) the Company sub-let part of its rented premises to HL Builder. Although the use of the word “included” is meant to suggest that this is not an exhaustive list of the Self-Dealings I proceed on the basis that those pleaded instances represent the full extent of the Self-Dealings because I consider that if Lee had other Self-Dealings in mind he would and should have described them expressly in the draft Statement of Claim.

9       The principal difficulty that Lee faces in respect of the claim arising out of the Self-Dealings is that it is not at all clear that the Self-Dealings caused either the Company to sustain substantial loss or Yeoh to enjoy substantial profit for which she should account to the Company. The causal connection is asserted in the draft Statement of Claim but the alleged loss suffered and profit earned is not at all particularised. There appears to be documentary evidence that HL Builder benefitted from the labour of foreign workers whose work permits stated the Company as their employer, but those same documents seem to show that HL Builder then paid the Company for that benefit (see for instance pp 407 to 410 of Lee’s affidavit). In the same vein there appears to be documentary evidence that HL Builder used part of the Company’s office space for its own purposes, but the same documents suggest that HL Builder paid for such use (see for instance pp 424 and 425 of Lee’s affidavit). Even though Lee has had ample opportunity to study the documents relevant to the Self-Dealings, he does not allege in his affidavit that the sums paid by HL Builder to the Company for labour and rental were below market rate or in any way lower than they ought to have been. Likewise no such allegation is found in Hooi’s affidavit.

10     The conclusion I draw in respect of the Self-Dealings is that there is no real evidence that the Self-Dealings have caused loss to the Company or resulted in profit for Yeoh. Thus, even if the Company is able to establish that Yeoh breached director’s duties owed to it by causing or allowing the Self-Dealings, it seems to me that the Company will recover nothing more than nominal compensation. For this reason alone I do not think that it is _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to pursue the claim arising out of the Self-Dealings, and Lee’s application for leave to have the Company do so fails at this stage.

## Alleged breach of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement

11     Next I deal with the claims relating to IDBOX’s alleged breach of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement. Lee is the sole proprietor of a business called Wenge Works. It appears that both Wenge Works and IDBOX are in the business of interior design and fitting-out works. Lee says that, around May 2012, he and Yeoh met and decided that it would be in the mutual interests of their respective businesses to set up a dedicated in-house subcontractor staffed with carpenters and general workers to provide specialised carpentry services for Lee’s and IDBOX’s projects. Lee says he and IDBOX thus entered verbally into the Pre-Incorporation Agreement, the key terms of which were that (i) a company would be incorporated to provide Lee and IDBOX with specialised carpentry services, (ii) Lee and Yeoh would respectively own 30% and 70% of the shares in that company, and (iii) Lee and IDBOX would use that company exclusively for specialised carpentry services so long as that company had capacity to carry out work on their projects. Lee says that the Company was subsequently incorporated to serve as the company contemplated under the Pre-Incorporation Agreement. Lee alleges that IDBOX subsequently breached the Pre-Incorporation Agreement by ceasing to use the Company as an “exclusive partner” for IDBOX’s projects, and that Yeoh induced this breach of contract by IDBOX. Yeoh and IDBOX deny the existence of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement: Yeoh says that Lee wanted to set up a carpentry business and asked her help because he did not have sufficient capital, and so they agreed to incorporate the Company, and that is all there was to that.

12     The Pre-Incorporation Agreement is squarely the subject of another action in the State Courts: DC/DC 1193/2018 (“DC 1193”). In DC 1193 the plaintiff is Lee (trading as Wenge Works) and the two defendants are IDBOX and Yeoh, and Lee alleges there that IDBOX breached the Pre-Incorporation Agreement by ceasing to use the Company as “exclusive partner” for its projects and that Yeoh induced this breach, and Lee says that he suffered loss as a result because he could not tender for new projects “without the specialised expertise provided by the Company” (para 10a of the Statement of Claim in DC 1193). There is no doubt that the factual substratum of the Company’s intended claims against IDBOX and Yeoh in respect of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement is identical to that of Lee’s claims in DC 1193.

13     In resisting this application Yeoh and IDBOX argue that there are a number of reasons why the Pre-Incorporation Agreement could not possibly exist, including: (i) IDBOX has all along been using carpentry subcontractors other than the Company, (ii) it does not make sense that IDBOX would have given its blanket agreement to use the Company as its exclusive partner for carpentry services since each of IDBOX’s projects would differ substantially one from another, and (iii) Wenge Works operated in Cambodia and it never subcontracted any carpentry work to the Company. But I do not think it is open to me to find that the Company’s intended claims in respect of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement are hopeless and doomed to fail, and the reason is simply that the equivalent claims made by Lee in DC 1193 survived a striking-out application. The fact that Lee’s claims in DC 1193 were not entirely struck out necessarily means that it is at least arguable that Lee and IDBOX entered into the Pre-Incorporation Agreement, that IDBOX breached it, and that Yeoh induced such breach. As for the point made by Yeoh and IDBOX that the Company was not (and could not have been) a party to the Pre-Incorporation Agreement and did not thereafter ratify the Pre-Incorporation Agreement pursuant to s 41(1) of the Companies Act, I consider it a sufficient answer that the Company might be able nonetheless to enforce the Pre-Incorporation Agreement by operation of s 2(1)(b) of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B) because on Lee’s case its terms purport to confer a benefit on the Company, and it is clear from s 2(3) that the mere fact that the Company did not exist at the time the Pre-Incorporation Agreement was entered into does not preclude the Company from enforcing it.

14     Therefore I think that the Company has a legitimate and arguable claim against IDBOX for breach of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement and against Yeoh for inducing that breach. I will address later the questions of whether it is _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to pursue these claims and whether Lee is acting in good faith in making this application.

## Diverting business, transferring employees and emptying out the Company

15     Lee alleges that Yeoh diverted business from the Company to Peak Interior. But I think that this allegation cannot ground any legitimate or arguable claim that Yeoh breached director’s duties owed to the Company because of two difficulties that are together insurmountable. First, it seems inherently implausible that Yeoh would have chosen in her capacity as director of the Company to give up business that the Company could obtain and to send it Peak Interior’s way instead, and the simple reason for this is that Yeoh has no apparent interest in Peak Interior: she is neither a shareholder nor a director of that company, and there is no evidence in the affidavits that she is somehow connected behind the scenes to the individuals who own or manage Peak Interior or otherwise stands to gain if Peak Interior does well. Second, given that IDBOX was the holder of the power to choose whether to give business to the Company or to give it to Peak Interior, it appears to me that any decision to divert business from the Company to Peak Interior would have been made by Yeoh in her capacity as director of IDBOX and not of the Company. This being so, it could not be a breach of her director’s duties owed to the Company.

16     Lee also alleges that Yeoh failed to obtain substitute business for the Company. But I think that this allegation is unsustainable given the narrative that Lee himself has advanced. On his narrative the whole reason why the Company was incorporated to begin with was to provide specialised carpentry services to IDBOX and Wenge Works. The evidence is that from 2012 to 2016 the vast majority of the Company’s revenue came from IDBOX and Wenge Works (para 36 of Yeoh’s affidavit). On Lee’s own case I consider it must follow that the common understanding between him and Yeoh was that the primary purpose of the Company’s existence was to serve the needs of IDBOX and Wenge Works, and so I do not think it is open to him to allege in the same breath that Yeoh should have got the Company to expand its horizons and to obtain business from other entities, let alone that her not doing so amounted to a breach of her director’s duties owed to the Company.

17     I move at last to Lee’s allegation that Yeoh reduced the Company to an empty shell by selling its assets and equipment and transferring its key employees to Peak Interior or forcing them to resign. The notion that Yeoh embarked on a systematic campaign to move employees from the Company to Peak Interior suffers from the same defect in plausibility that afflicts the allegation that she diverted business from the Company to Peak Interior, which is that Yeoh had no apparent interest in Peak Interior. As for the allegation that Yeoh unreasonably emptied the Company of its assets and employees, Lee makes much of the fact that the Company enjoyed a profit of about $122,000 as at 31 March 2016. As I understand it he argues that there was no good reason to close down the profitable business that was the Company, and hence the Company has at least a legitimate and arguable claim that Yeoh breached her director’s duties by doing that. But I do not think it follows from the past profitability of a company that it is likely to be a breach of the duty to act diligently or the duty to act in the company’s best interests to wind down the business of the company by disposing of assets and reducing manpower and overheads. There may be many commercial considerations that make it a sensible decision to do just that, and the Court is very slow to find breaches of duty in the _bona fide_ commercial judgment of a director.

18     An important point to bear in mind is that Lee was as much a director of the Company as Yeoh was, and on his own case he was entitled to receive salary and fees from the Company as a director. He, like Yeoh, owed the Company a duty to act diligently in discharging his functions and to act in its best interests. If it were indeed a breach of those duties not to obtain substitute business for the Company and to wind down its business, I agree with the Mr Singh’s submission that it is difficult to see why Lee should not be considered at least as culpable as Yeoh. Although Lee asserts that Yeoh took steps without consulting or informing him (para 21 of Lee’s affidavit), it seems to me that it was Lee’s choice to leave the Company in Yeoh’s hands for more than four years from the time the Company was incorporated around the middle of 2012 to the end of 2016. There is no suggestion that during that time Yeoh misled him or his enquiries about the Company’s affairs were stymied by her. It was only in early 2017 that Lee started asking more questions about the Company. So far as Lee’s case is that Yeoh’s breaches of duty occurred before early 2017, it seems to me it must follow that he is equally liable for breaches of duty by his inaction and indifference. And if Lee’s case is that Yeoh’s breaches occurred in or after early 2017, it seems to me that he had just as much opportunity as she had to save and expand the Company’s business but was unable to do so. Either that inability did not constitute a breach of duty or it was a breach for which both of them are liable. What it comes down to is this: the success of any action by the Company against Yeoh for the alleged failure to obtain substitute business and the alleged reduction of the Company to an empty shell depends heavily if not entirely on the willingness of Lee to hold his hand up and acknowledge that he ought to bear equal liability to the Company. I do not think that is at all a realistic prospect given ordinary human nature and given also that there is no hint in this application that Lee accepts any degree of fault on his part. Hence I do not think that the Company has a legitimate and arguable claim against Yeoh in respect of those allegations.

19     If I take a step back and look at the whole picture it seems to me that the true nub of the Company’s complaint is that it legitimately expected to have a regular and ample supply of revenue- and profit-generating business from IDBOX but that eventually dried up. Seen this way, the Company’s real grievance is not that Yeoh breached the director’s duties that she owed to it but that, as one of the controlling minds of IDBOX, she failed to ensure the supply of business to the Company. I think that this grievance may not found a legal action unless the Company’s case in respect of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement is made out, and if it is made out there will be complete satisfaction for that grievance. The proper action is therefore not one for breach of director’s duties against Yeoh but for breach of contract against IDBOX and for inducement of that breach against Yeoh.

## Interests of the Company

20     Having found that the only legitimate and arguable claims that the Company could advance are those relating to the Pre-Incorporation Agreement I consider now whether it is _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to pursue those claims. Mr Singh argues that the disputes between Lee and Yeoh are in essence shareholder disputes and it would not serve the Company well to become embroiled in them. While it may be possible to characterise the disputes about Yeoh’s alleged breaches of director’s duties in that way, I think that the same cannot be said of the claim in respect of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement given that it concerns an external party, that is IDBOX. Mr Singh also argues that it is more appropriate to wind the Company up given that it does not have any business. I accept that it appears unlikely that the Company may be rehabilitated since the relationship between its director-shareholders has broken down and there has been no apparent improvement in the Company’s prospects from early 2017 to date, but if there is some possibility of recovering compensation in an action against Yeoh and IDBOX I think it could be to the Company’s advantage to refrain from winding-up for the time being in order to bring the action.

21     It is not clear what the likely measure is of the compensation that the Company will receive should it succeed in its claims in respect of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement, but as against this I think it is a weighty consideration that there is not likely to be much cost to the Company if it pursues those claims: given the more or less complete overlap between these potential claims by the Company and Lee’s claims in DC 1193, it seems to me that the Company will for the most part be able to rely on the work that Lee has already done and will do in advancing his claims in DC 1193. To be more specific, it can rely on Lee’s work in proving the existence of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement, IDBOX’s breach of it and Yeoh’s inducement of the breach, and the only work that the Company will have to do on its own is proving the degree of the loss it suffered as distinct from the loss suffered by Lee. I am therefore satisfied that it is _prima facie_ in the interests of the Company to bring an action against IDBOX and Yeoh in connection with the Pre-Incorporation Agreement.

## Whether Lee is acting in good faith

22     What remains is the question of whether Lee is acting in good faith. In answering this question, I must follow _Ang Thiam Swee_ (at \[29\]–\[30\]) and assess whether Lee “honestly and reasonably believes” that the Company has “a good cause of action”, and whether he has any “collateral purpose” or has his judgment “clouded by purely personal considerations” such that it would amount to an “abuse of process” for the Company to bring the action.

23     Mr Singh contends that Lee’s lack of good faith is amply demonstrated by the fact that the first step he took after obtaining and studying the Company’s accounting and other records was to seek relief not for the Company but for himself by way of DC 1193. Lee did not make this application until more than 15 months had passed from the time he commenced DC 1193. Although it is true that Lee’s first thought was his own interests and not those of the Company, and that it has taken a long time for him to make this application, I think nonetheless that Lee “honestly and reasonably believes” that the Company has a “good cause of action” against IDBOX and Yeoh. The simple reason for this is that the Company’s cause of action is the very same cause of action that he has against IDBOX and Yeoh, and there can be no dispute that he honestly and reasonably believes in the strength of his own action. It is then argued that Lee is motivated by “purely personal considerations” and is in effect trying to obtain what Mr Singh describes as “double recovery” for himself. But I do not agree that there is a concern of double recovery here because it seems entirely possible that the Company has suffered its own loss distinct from any suffered by Lee. If indeed IDBOX breached the Pre-Incorporation Agreement by withholding business from the Company that it was obliged to have given, I think it must follow that the Company lost profit that the business would have generated. It is true that any compensation recovered by the Company will benefit Lee indirectly as a shareholder, but it is also true that Yeoh too will benefit, and in fact she stands to benefit to a larger extent because her shareholding is greater. Thus I am not prepared to find that in seeking to bring an action in the Company’s name Lee is so much impelled by collateral personal purposes that it amounts to an abuse of process. I conclude accordingly that Lee is acting in good faith.

## Conclusion and orders

24     Lee is granted leave to bring an action in the Company’s name in respect of IDBOX’s alleged breach of the Pre-Incorporation Agreement and Yeoh’s alleged inducement of that breach. As for the costs of bringing the Company’s action, Lee is pursuing in DC 1193 essentially the same claims that the Company may bring pursuant to my grant of leave in this application. Given this overlap it is difficult at the moment to segregate work that advances the Company’s claims from work that advances Lee’s claims in DC 1193, and so I think Lee should foot the bill for the Company’s action for now while remaining free to seek any order for reimbursement from the Company at the conclusion of the Company’s action.

25     I thank counsel for their thorough and fair submissions, which were of much assistance to me.
