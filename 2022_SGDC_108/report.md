Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Taking additional evidence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9063/2021/01.\]

23 May 2022

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       On 24 November 2021, in Criminal Motion No. 101 of 2021, the High Court had ordered that this case be remitted to the trial judge to record further evidence pursuant to s 392(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68. The further evidence in question was in relation to the testimony of a witness, Md Pavel Talukder Md Jashon Takluder (“Pavel”). The High Court had also further ordered that, after the further evidence had been recorded, the trial judge was to state what effect, if any, the additional evidence has on the trial judge’s earlier verdict.

2       Pavel’s evidence was recorded on 19 January 2022. The prosecution was led by DPP Gregory Gan. Ms Cheryl Ng Hui Ling from M/s Intelleigen Legal LLC conducted the defence. I was the trial judge in the case.

## The trial

3       The Accused had claimed trial to one count carrying on an employment agency without a licence issued by the Commissioner for Employment Agencies. This was an offence under s 6(1) punishable under s 6(4)(a) of the Employment Agencies Act (“EAA”). The offence was committed between July to 28 September 2014 and 14 March to September 2016. The Accused was alleged to have helped 11 Bangladeshi nationals sourced for employment in Singapore. At all material times, he did not hold a licence to carry on as an employment agent.

4       The prosecution’s case was based substantially on the Accused’s admissions in his statement (“Exhibit P42”) to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”). Exhibit P42 has been admitted after I had rejected the Accused’s allegations of threats and oppression by the recorder of Exhibit P42. The main bulk of Exhibit P42 were related to numerous emails that were found in the Accused’s email account in his handphone. These emails showed that the Accused was engaged in employment agency activities, because they contained documents which were connected to applications for employment in Singapore. These documents included, _inter alia_, copies of passports of the various Bangladeshi job applicants, certificates of courses attended by them, and letters of In-Principle Approvals. In Exhibit P42, the Accused had also given an account of the fees that he had charged for his services.

5       At the conclusion of the trial, I had convicted the Accused of the charge and fined him $40,000 in default eight weeks’ imprisonment. The Accused had then appealed against the conviction and sentence. In conjunction with the appeal, the Accused had filed the criminal motion.

## The relevant issue

6       In an attempt to explain away the emails found in his handphone, the Accused had claimed that he had left his handphone with his friend, Pavel, for about one week in 2014. During this period, it was possible that Pavel had used the Accused’s email account in his handphone for Pavel’s own purpose namely, to send and receive these incriminating emails that contained documents relating to applications for work pass.

7       I had rejected the Accused’s defence for two reasons. Firstly, I had noted that the Accused had not disclosed this defence in Exhibit P42, as well as in his two further statements to MOM, when he was given the opportunity to expand, clarify or add to what he had said in Exhibit P42. Secondly, the Accused had had not called Pavel to corroborate his story.

8       The issue before me in this recording of further evidence was whether Pavel’s testimony supported the Accused’s defence that Pavel had used the Accused’s handphone to send and/or receive these incriminating emails.

## The additional evidence

### Pavel’s testimony

9       The testimony given by Pavel in court could be summarised as follows –

> (a)     Sometime in 2014 or 2015, Pavel confirmed that the Accused had passed his new iPhone to Pavel to help him set up an email account and Apple ID. Pavel testified that he managed to set up the email account, but not the Apple ID because a credit card was required.

> (b)     Both of them had gone to get help at a mobile servicing shop nearby. They left the Accused’s iPhone with the proprietor for the Apple ID to be set up because the proprietor informed them that it would take some time to do it.

> (c)     Pavel had then collected the iPhone about one week later. He had collected it because he stayed near to the shop. However, he could not remember if the Accused was with him when he collected the iPhone.

> (d)     After collecting the iPhone, Pavel had handed it over to the Accused. He was not able to recall if he had done so on the same day that he had collected it. Pavel was also unable to recall if he had held onto the iPhone for some time before he had handed it back to the Accused.

> (e)     Pavel could not recall if he had used the Accused iPhone for his own personal use. Pavel could also not recall if he had used the Accused’s email account to receive or sent emails. Pavel testified that at the time, he had his own handphone and email account.

### Analysis of Pavel’s testimony

10     I found that Pavel’s testimony fell far short of corroborating the Accused’s defence. In fact, in the material aspects, his testimony directly contradicted the Accused’s claims. First, the Accused had testified at the trial[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) that he had left his iPhone with Pavel for about a week so that Pavel could help set up the Apple ID and the email account in the iPhone. However, in court, Pavel could only remember that the Accused and he had gone to the mobile servicing shop together and handed the iPhone with the shop proprietor. Pavel could also only remember that he had collected the iPhone one week later. However, he was not able to recall if he had handed the iPhone to the Accused on the same day, or if he had held onto it for a few days before handing it over to the Accused. From these, one could not discount the possibility that Pavel had the iPhone for one week after he had collected it from the shop.

11     What was more pertinent and singular was Pavel’s testimony concerning the incriminating emails found in the Accused’s iPhone. On this point, Pavel had very clear testified that he had no need to use the Accused’s email account to send or receive emails during the relevant period. In fact, he had confirmed that he had not used the Accused’s email account[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). This absolutely contradicted the Accused’s defence.

12     Pavel’s testimony did not change my findings that the Accused’s defence in relation to Pavel and the incriminating emails found in the Accused’s iPhone was not credible. Rather, Pavel’s testimony clearly showed the Accused’s defence to be a fabrication; an attempt by the Accused to try and explain away why these emails were found in his email account.

## Conclusion

13     All considered, the additional evidence which had been recorded did not affect my earlier verdict, which was, that the prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.
