Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Young offenders – Offender pleaded guilty to shop theft, cheating and drug offences – Re-offended pending sentencing – Whether probation or reformative training is the more appropriate sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9805/2020/01.\]

14 October 2020

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused. The Accused had pleaded guilty on 1 April 2020 to three charges of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code, one charge of drug consumption and one charge of possession of controlled drug, offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act and one charge of shop theft under section 380 of the Penal Code.

2       Another 10 charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       As the Accused was 18 years old then, I called for pre-sentence reports to assess her suitability for both reformative training and probation.

4       However, pending the preparation of the reports, the Accused re-offended by committing an offence of drug consumption on 18 May 2020. She pleaded guilty to this offence of drug consumption on 5 August 2020. As this was her second conviction for consumption of a specified drug, she faced a minimum mandatory sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment pursuant to section 33(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

5       The Accused was assessed to be unsuitable for probation but was found fit to undergo reformative training. I sentenced her to reformative training for a period of 12 months.

6       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence of reformative training, filed a notice of appeal against sentence and also applied a stay of the sentence. I granted her bail pending the appeal. However, as at the time of the writing of these grounds of decision, she has not been bailed out.

7       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## The proceeded charges

8       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following 7 charges:

## The Statement of Facts

### The First Conviction

9       The Accused is Wynnus Wee Wei, a 19-year-old female Singaporean (D.O.B: 18 July 2001).

#### Facts pertaining to the 3rd charge under s 380 r/w s 34 Penal Code – DAC 909697/2019

10     At the material time, the Accused was aged 16 years. The co-accused is one Lim Hsu Ern Joshua (“Lim”), an 18-year-old male Singaporean.

11     The complainant is Balaraaman Vijan. At the material time, he was a security supervisor at a Sephora outlet located at ION Orchard, Singapore.

12     On 16 September 2017 at or about 8.54pm, the complainant called ‘999’ to inform that he “detained 1 male and female for shop theft. No violence so far. They are boyfriend and girlfriend”. The incident location was given as Apt Blk 2 Orchard Turn, Ion Orchard, Singapore 238801.

13     On 16 September 2017 at about 7.30pm, the complainant had noticed the Accused and Lim behaving suspiciously inside the Sephora outlet. He observed the Accused taking a lipstick from the store and subsequently leaving the store alone, without paying for the lipstick. Lim tried to leave the store soon after but was detained by the complainant. The Accused returned to the store about 10 minutes later upon realizing that Lim had been detained.

14     Subsequently, a search was conducted on the Accused’s belongings, which revealed the following items from Victoria’s Secret with a total value of S$225 (collectively, “Victoria’s Secret items”):

> a.     One grey and black sports bra valued at S$69

> b.     One black and white panties valued at S$18

> c.     One pink and orange bra valued at S$69

> d.     One orange bra valued at S$69.

15     Investigations revealed that on 16 September 2017 sometime in the afternoon, the Accused and Lim had hatched a plan to steal items from the Victoria’s Secret outlet at Mandarin Gallery, No. 333A Orchard Road, Singapore, for the purpose of selling them.

16     At the said outlet, the Accused and co-accused took the Victoria’s Secret items, which were then in the possession of one Guinto John Nicolas Garcia, an employee at the store, and placed them in the Accused’s bag. They then left the store without paying for the said items.

17     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused together with Lim and in the furtherance of the common intention of them both, did commit theft of the Victoria’s Secret items at Mandarin Gallery, Singapore, which is a building used for the custody of property, and she has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Cap. 224.

#### Facts pertaining to 6th, 7th and 11th charges under s 420 r/w s 109 of the Penal Code – DACs 912071/2019; 912072/2019 & 924954/2019

18     At the material time, the Accused was aged 17 years. The co-accused is Muhammad Hardy Khairy Bin Hashim (“Hardy”), an 18-year-old male Singaporean.

19     The victims are:

> a.     Francyn Kwok Pei Xin (“Kwok”), a 23-year-old female Singaporean. She was a student at the material time.

> b.     Jaime Lim Yingxuan (“Jaime”), a 17-year-old female Singaporean. She was a student at the material time.

> c.     Chia Jae Shin (“Chia”), a 20-year-old male Singaporean. He was a full-time national serviceman at the material time.

20     Between 15 February 2019 and 3 March 2019, a total of 9 police reports were lodged against several Carousell sellers using the monikers “victoriachen”, the “facelessman1818” and “unagimami” (collectively, “the Carousell Accounts”), who had advertised sales of tickets for concerts held by Ed Sheeran and Blackpink. After the victims made payments for the tickets, the sellers had failed to deliver the tickets to the victims as agreed.

21     Investigations revealed that sometime in January 2019, the Accused and Hardy had needed money for their personal expenses. Thus, she and Hardy, who were in a relationship, hatched a plan to set up the Carousell Accounts for the purpose of scamming unwitting buyers into making payment for Ed Sheeran and Blackpink concert tickets, when in truth, they had no such tickets for sale and had no intention of honouring any purchases.

22     On 13 February 2019, Kwok came across a Carousell post made by “victoriachen” for Blackpink concert tickets. She negotiated with the seller and agreed to buy two tickets for a total of S$570. Kwok was directed to make payment via transfer by Paylah1 to mobile phone number XXX, which was used by the Accused. After Kwok made the payment, the Accused and Hardy failed to deliver the concert tickets to Kwok and stopped responding to Kwok on Carousell, even when Kwok pleaded for the refund of her money.

23     On 13 February 2019, Jaime came across a Carousell post made by “victoriachen” for Blackpink concert tickets and contacted the seller by Whatsapp via the mobile phone number XXX. On 14 February 2019, Jaime agreed to purchase four Blackpink concert tickets for a total of S$1,100. The next day, Jaime enlisted her father’s help to make a bank transfer of S$1,100 to the accused’s POSB Savings bank account no. XXX. After Jaime’s father made the payment, the Accused and Hardy failed to deliver the concert tickets to Jaime and stopped responding to Jaime’s messages on Whatsapp.

24     On 12 February 2019, Chia came across an advertisement on Carousell for Blackpink concert tickets made by “victoriachen”. Chia contacted the seller and indicated interest in purchasing 4 tickets, and was quoted a price of S$1,140. Chia agreed to purchase the tickets for the said price and paid a deposit of S$400 via Paylah to mobile phone number XXX on the same day. The next day, Chia was directed to make payment of the remainder of S$740 via Paylah to the same mobile number. After Chia made the payments, the Accused and Hardy failed to deliver the concert tickets to Chia as promised and stopped responding to Chia’s messages on Carousell when Chia enquired about the delivery of the tickets.

25     In total, the Accused and Hardy cheated a total of 9 victims out of a total sum of S$4,505. They had shared the money amongst themselves and used it for their personal expenses. To date, no restitution has been made.

26     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused did engage in a conspiracy with Hardy to cheat Kwok, Jaime, and Chia, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of those things, on 3 different occasions, the Accused and/or Hardy did deceive Kwok, Jaime and Chia into believing they had Blackpink concert tickets for sale, a fact which they knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced the Kwok, Jaime and Chia to make payments for the said tickets. The Accused has thereby committed 3 offences under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code, Cap. 224.

#### Facts pertaining to 5th charge under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA – DAC 911764/2019

27     At the material time, the Accused was aged 17 years. On 6 March 2019 at about 6.20pm, officers from the Singapore Police Force arrested the Accused at Blk 320 Balestier Road #XXX Crescent Building, Singapore 329924. A search was conducted and the following exhibits, amongst others, were seized:

> a.     5 ziplock packets containing crystalline substance (“WY-1A”)

> b.     1 ziplock packet containing crystalline substance (“WY-2”)

> c.     1 improvised smoking utensil with tube attached, and 2 glass pipes (“WY-3”)

28     Following her arrest, the Accused was brought back to Tanglin Police Division where she provided two bottles of her urine samples which were sealed she provided two bottles of her urine samples which were sealed in her presence and thereafter sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 7 March 2019. Following the analysis, the HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (“MDA”) stating that on analysis, they were found to contain methamphetamine.

29     Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The Accused had knowingly consumed methamphetamine in the morning of her arrest, by smoking it. She did so by placing the methamphetamine into the improvised smoking utensil in “WY-3”, putting water in the tube, lighting the glass pipe, and then inhaling the fumes. She further admitted to have been consuming methamphetamine for about a year prior to her arrest.

30     The Accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume a specified drug, and she has thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts pertaining to 8th charge under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(4) of the MDA – DAC-912160/2020

31     The exhibit marked “WY-1A” was sealed in a tamper proof bag and sent to the HSA for analysis on 8 March 2019. On 15 April 2019, HSA issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA stating that the exhibit marked “WY-1A” was found to be five packets containing not less than 2.25 grams of crystalline substance, which was pulverized and homogenized into a powdery substance, and that the powdery substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 1.51 grams of methamphetamine.

32     Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

33     At the material time, the exhibit marked “WY-1A” was in the possession of the Accused. The Accused also admitted to knowing that “WY-1A” contained methamphetamine.

34     The Accused was not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess methamphetamine. She has thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

### The second conviction

#### Facts pertaining to charge under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(1) of thea MDA – DAC 912060/2020

35     At the material time the Accused was aged 18 years. On 18 May 2020 at about 4.55pm, the Accused was arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau officers at 4 Jalan Bangsawan, Singapore 457792, along with one Marc Xavier Shen Lulla (“Marc”), inside a room at the said location. Marc was the friend of the Accused. The following items were seized from the said room:

> a.     One white pouch containing one ziplock containing two pink packets of crystalline substances

> b.     One ziplock containing two ziplock of crystalline substances and one ziplock containing seven blue pills

> c.     Two pink ziplock containing crystalline substances

> d.     One digital weighing scale

> e.     One ziplock containing numerous ziplock bags

> f.     Two glass bongs in bubble wrap

> g.     One glass bong

> h.     One bubble wrap containing three glass pipes

> i.     Five slabs containing 19 blue pills

> j.     Four slabs containing 16 red pills.

36     Following her arrest, the Accused was brought back to Central Police Division where she provided two bottles of her urine samples which were sealed in her presence.

37     The said urine samples were sent to the HSA for analysis on 19 May 2020. Following the analysis, the HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA stating that on analysis, the urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine.

38     Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The Accused had knowingly consumed methamphetamine in the afternoon of 18 May 2020, by smoking the methamphetamine using an improvised drug utensil.

39     The Accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume a specified drug, and she has thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

40     Further, prior to the commission of the said offence, the Accused was on 1 April 2020 in Court 19C of the District Court, vide DAC-911764-2019, convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, methamphetamine, under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, which conviction has not been set aside to date, and she shall on conviction be punished under section 33(4) of the MDA.

## Antecedents

41     The Accused has no previous convictions during the time of the first conviction. However, on her second conviction, the details of her first conviction was duly read out and admitted by the Accused.

## Prosecution’s submission on sentence

42     The Prosecution submitted that probation was not appropriate, relying on the assessment done by the Investigating Probation Officer (“IPO”) as set out in the Probation Report.

43     The Prosecution submitted that the reformative training would be more suitable as it struck the right balance between rehabilitation and deterrence. The Prosecution referred to paragraphs 63 and 64 of _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“ _Boaz Koh_”) and submitted that the facts of the present case fell squarely within these principles, which was that there was a need “for a rigorous and structured environment for the \[Accused’s\] rehabilitation” and that the Accused should not be “placed in the position where \[she\] is able to simply pick and choose the terms on which \[she\] would like to be rehabilitated”.

44     The Prosecution thus submitted that the most appropriate sentence taking into account the age of the Accused and the need to balance both the objective of rehabilitation and the need for deterrence would be reformative training.

## Mitigation

45     The Defence Counsel in the written mitigation plea submitted that the Accused should be placed on probation due to her young age, the presence of family support and her propensity to reform. It was submitted in the alternative, for reformative training for a period of 6 months.

46     The Accused was first charged in court on 8 March 2019. It was asserted that after the Accused was released from remand sometime in May 2019, she has, together with the support of her family sought medical help. A list of medical appointments which she had attended at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) was attached in the mitigation plea. The Defence Counsel cited this fact in support of submission that the Accused had shown strong propensity to reform. This is in addition to other constructive actions that she has taken after being released from remand such as pursuing her music interest and attempting a Family Group Conference with Beyond Social Service Centre even though the Family Group Conference did not eventually materialise.

47     The Defence Counsel also highlighted the fact that the Accused had been attending urine tests since her release on bail and has been testing negative, thus showing that she is capable of steering clear from re-offending behaviour.

48     This last point by the Defence Counsel, whilst true at the date of the written mitigation plea on 31 March 2020, was rendered invalid by the Accused subsequently re-offending with another offence of drug consumption on 18 May 2020.

49     The Defence Counsel finally made a last-minute attempt to appeal for probation by asking for a supplementary probation report to be prepared to consider whether probation can be recommended if a condition of hostel stay is included. He submitted that hostel stay may not have been fully considered by the IPO. She further asserted that the Accused had stated her willingness to stay in a hostel and abide by all the conditions.

50     In response, the IPO duly rebutted this submission of a hostel stay not being fully considered in her assessment. She categorically confirmed during the sentencing hearing that hostel stay was in fact fully considered and not just mentioned in passing. She had nonetheless found her unsuitable for probation given the risk factors which have been highlighted in the probation report. She also explained that the hostel has a fairly open environment and is a voluntary residence. There will be periods of home leave where the Accused would not be under close supervision. What was clear was that even during the social investigations stage and whilst on court bail and despite her instruction to steer clear of trouble, the Accused in reoffending in May 2020 showed that she continued to show a lack of remorse and ownership over her conduct. I agree with the IPO that there was no need to prepare a supplementary Probation Report for the reasons given by her.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### Sentencing Principle for Young Offenders -2 stages of inquiry

51     The sentencing principle for young offenders below the age of 21 has been well established, which is that rehabilitation would generally be the dominant consideration. As stated by Yong CJ in _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ \[1998\] 3 SLR (R) 439 at \[21\], young offenders “are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law abiding adults are better.” The law takes a presumptive view that rehabilitation is the primary sentencing consideration when sentencing youthful offenders – see _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_A Karthik_“) _at_ \[33\].

52     The sentencing court would have to approach the sentencing of a young offender in a 2-step inquiry:

> (i)     the first stage is to identify and prioritize the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence; and

> (ii)     the second stage is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that is placed on the relevant ones – see _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> at \[77-78\] and _Boaz Koh_ at \[28\].

#### The first stage- is rehabilitation still the dominant consideration?

53     At the first stage of the inquiry, on the present facts, I found that rehabilitation still remains the dominant sentencing consideration. The nature of the offences is not so serious as to rule out rehabilitation as the primary sentencing principle. Most of the offences would be considered as relatively non-serious such as theft and cheating. The most serious offence committed by the Accused would be the second offence of drug consumption which would attract a minimum mandatory sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment. This offence whilst serious was not so heinous that it would displace the presumptive view that rehabilitation ought to remain the primary sentencing consideration. As pointed out by the Defence Counsel in mitigation plea, there have been more serious offences committed by young offenders such as drug trafficking where rehabilitation was still found to be the dominant sentencing consideration.

54     On this issue, both the Prosecution and Defence are in agreement that at the first stage of the inquiry, rehabilitation still retains its primacy as the dominant sentencing principle as they had submitted for a sentence of reformative training and probation respectively.

#### The second stage – is probation or reformative training the more appropriate sentence?

55     Having determined that primary sentencing principle should still be rehabilitation, I then moved onto the second stage of the inquiry. At this stage, the issue in contention is which of the two regimes, probation or reformative training, would be the more appropriate sentence. It was held at \[67\] of _A Karthik_ that, at this second stage of the framework,

> “the court must select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation: _Boaz Koh_ at \[35\]; see also \[33\] above. In contrast, where there is a need for both deterrence and rehabilitation, reformative training may be the most suitable sentence, given that it offers the court a useful middle ground between sending the offender to prison and meeting the desire to rehabilitate a young offender: _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]–\[39\] and _Al-Ansari_ at \[57\]–\[58\].”

56     The Accused was assessed to be unsuitable for probation.

57     The narrative in both the Probation and Reformative Training Reports painted a disturbing picture of a troubled youth who led an unbridled lifestyle and continued to do so without caring for the consequences of her actions.

58     I considered the two following factors as militating against an order of probation and instead clearly pointing towards a need for a more structured and confined regime in order for any real prospect of rehabilitation to take place:

#### i.   Poor and conflictual relationship with her parents and parents’ inability to control and guide her behaviour

59     The Accused admitted that she did not spend time with her parents, often quarrelled with her mother and “can’t be bothered with them”[^1]. The inability of the parents to control her movement is evidenced by the fact that they had reported that the Accused frequently stayed out late until about 3:00am to spend time with peers from 2016 to 2018 against their approval. She only returned home by 9:00pm after her arrest in March 2019[^2].

60     Furthermore, the Accused had led quite an irresponsible life, dropping out of school before her N level examinations and staying out frequently. Two periods where she had stayed away from home for a significant duration were noted. First was in 2018, when after a conflict at home, she stayed out with her then boyfriend, one Joshua from 16 July to 16 August. Then from December 2018 to March 2019 she stayed with her new boyfriend and co-Accused in the cheating offences, Hardy, for about 2 weeks every month[^3]. This was also the time when she committed the cheating offences in order to service their daily expenses and to purchase drugs. The Accused reported that she started this habit of staying out because she wanted to escape from the tension in her home caused by the conflicts she had with her parents[^4].

61     The parents’ inability to effectively supervise her behaviour was not through lack of trying. According to the Institute of Mental Health report dated 12 May 2020, the Accused first visited the IMH Addiction Clinic on 9 January 2019 accompanied by her parents. However, she was reported to be uninterested in treatment and not keen to stop using “ICE”. She was not regular with her treatment. Her last visit was on 29 July 2019 and she completely disengaged after this last visit. The IPO reported that her parents advised and encouraged the Accused to continue treatment but to no avail[^5].

62     One final example of such failure on the part of the parents to supervise her behaviour was in relation to the Accused’s failure to turn up in court on the day when it was first scheduled for her to plead guilty to the charges of the first conviction. On that day, the 31st of March 2020, the Defence Counsel informed the Court that the Accused was at home and her mother could not get her to come to court and asked for an adjournment. I gave further time till the afternoon for her to attend court. When again she failed to turn up, I gave her a final chance to turn up the next day, which she finally did. The Accused clearly showed that she had no qualms about disobeying a court order on attendance despite knowing that there will be serious consequences and her mother’s pleas simply fell on deaf ears.

#### ii.   Failure to mend her ways despite previous intervention, repeated arrests and remands

63     The Accused failed to mend her ways despite previous arrests and remand experience. She was first arrested in 2017 for the shop theft offence and placed on Guidance Programme in 2018. Unfortunately, the Guidance Programme case worker reported that the Accused “displayed a wilful and nonchalant attitude from the onset, was not participative during sessions, had commitment issues and was unresponsive towards attempts to engage her.”[^6] The Accused was eventually breached from the Programme in November 2018. Evidently, she did not manage to internalise the benefits of the Programme as she went on to commit a spree of cheating offences later in early 2019, just over 2 months upon being terminated from the Programme.

64     What is disturbing is that in the most recent offending episode, the fact that she was remanded twice in prison did not have a salutary effect on her. When she was first charged in court on 8 March 2019, she was only bailed out on 4 May 2019. She spent almost 2 months in remand. Then after she had pleaded guilty in April 2020, she was again remanded for one week for the preparation of the Reformative Training Report. Despite these periods of remand, she did not pull up her socks even during the short period of pre-sentence assessment. It was reported that she continued to associate with friends who were into drugs and just after a month from being released, she went on to consume methamphetamine again on 18 May 2020 despite knowing that she has yet to be sentenced for the offences in her first conviction. Her candid admission to the IPO that she did not think of the consequences of her action[^7] reveals the root of her problem. She still has not fully committed herself to change and did not care about the long term impact of her decisions.

65     This latest re-offending revealed a deep-seated weakness in her ability to control herself and showed that clearly a more controlled and structured regime is much needed for focused rehabilitation. This view was reinforced by the finding in the IMH report that she was not interested in treatment and eventually did not attend her follow up appointments. She was first brought by her parents in January 2019 but showed little interest and was not regular. In the midst of such appointments, she committed the first drug consumption offence in March 2019. Thereafter she completely disengaged after 29 July 2019. She was then caught reoffending in May 2020.

## Conclusion

66     The Accused is clearly, for the reasons given above, not suited for probation, even with an additional condition of hostel residence. I am satisfied that the IPO had duly considered this option and had correctly opined that given the fairly open environment of the hostel residence and taking into account all the risk factors of the Accused and her continued offending behaviour, a closed and structured environment is needed to focus on her rehabilitation.

67     Contrary to the submission of the Defence Counsel that the Accused had shown strong propensity to reform, I found that on the Accused had displayed a very nonchalant attitude towards her own reformation by re-offending despite her numerous arrests and remand experience.

68     In the Reformative Training Report, it was concluded that the Accused presented with needs that require intervention and had recommended her to undergo a level 2 intensity of rehabilitation. Such a level would require a period of 12 months for the interventions to be delivered. I accordingly sentenced the Accused to reformative training for 12 months.
