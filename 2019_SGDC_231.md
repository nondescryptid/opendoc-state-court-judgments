### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

##### The Charge

The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. The charge read:

> _You, are charged that you, on or about 7 October 2015, in Singapore, did abet one Kapil Dev Sharma S/O Kirpa Ram to cheat Bank of India (“BOI”), to wit, you instigated the said Kapil Dev Sharma S/O Kirpa Ram to apply for receivables financing from BOI for Pars Ram Brothers Pte Ltd using invoice LION/700D/TP/15, when you knew the said document to be fraudulent, and by such manner of deception, BOI was dishonestly induced to disburse a sum of US$1,712,000.00 to Lion Overseas Pte Ltd, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224._

2       One other charge under section 420 of the Penal Code, similar to the above particulars but for an amount of US$620,000.00, was taken into consideration for purpose of sentencing.

3       I sentenced the Accused to 26 months’ imprisonment. The Accused is dissatisfied with the sentence.

##### Facts of the Case[^1]

4       The accused person is Kirpa Ram S/O Ishwar Dass (NRIC No.: XXX) (the “Accused”). During the material time, he was a director and shareholder of Pars Ram Brothers Pte Ltd (“PRB”).

5       PRB had trade financing facilities with various banks, including the Bank of India (“BOI”). In this connection, PRB would submit an application for financing along with the necessary documents (which typically include a sales invoice). Once the application is approved, the banks would either disburse the monies directly to the suppliers or to PRB.

6       Sometime in 2015, PRB was facing financial difficulties. In order to alleviate the PRB’s cash flow situation, the Accused instructed one Kapil Dev Sharma S/O Kirpa Ram (“Kapil”) to apply for receivables financing from Bank of India. In this connection, on or about 7 October 2015, the Accused handed the latter an invoice LION/700D/TP/15 purportedly issued by Lion Overseas Pte Ltd, which the Accused knew was fictitious and was not issued by Lion Overseas Pte Ltd, for the said purpose.

7       Kapil thereafter submitted the application for financing to BOI using invoice LION/700D/TP/15, which was dishonestly induced to approved the application and disburse a sum of US$1,712,000 to Lion Overseas Pte Ltd. The Accused subsequently requested Lion Overseas Pte Ltd to transfer the US$1,712,000 to PRB, which it did so. Thereafter, PRB used the moneys to settle other outstanding debts owed by PRB.

8       The Accused has thereby abetted Kapil to cheat BOI by instigating Kapil to apply for receivables financing from BOI for PRB using invoice LION/700D/TP/15 which the Accused knew to be fraudulent. As such, the Accused has committed an offence under Section 420 r/w 109 of the Penal Code (DAC 929773/2018).

##### Punishment Prescribed under section 420, Penal Code

9       The offence of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code carries an imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and the offender shall also be liable to a fine.

##### Reasons for the Sentence Imposed

10     The case of _Tan Thiam Wee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 141</span>, submitted by the Prosecution, was highly instructive. This was a factoring fraud case. The facts in _Tan Thiam Wee_ were similar to the present case. In _Tan_, the appellant submitted false invoices to obtain cash advances from a bank. A total of 176 invoices was submitted over a period of slightly more than a year and the bank disbursed the sum of about $2.6 million. The losses suffered by the bank after the scheme unravelled amounted to $634,075.52. On appeal by the offender, the High Court reduced the offender’s original global sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment to one of 30 months’ imprisonment instead.

11     The table below, adapted from Prosecution’s table[^2], draws up a comparison between _Tan Thiam Wee_ and the case at hand:

12     I took guidance from the sentence imposed by the High Court in _Tan_’s case. Several mitigating factors in _Tan_’s case, were also present in this case. Like _Tan_, the Accused was a first offender and he had pleaded guilty. He had committed these offences in a bid to save the company; it was not for personal greed. The Accused did not derive direct personal gain.

13     Like _Tan_, one of the key aggravating features was that the offence involved a deception of a financial institution. There was not only direct monetary loss to the financial institution, this undermined public confidence in the financial industry. Increased compliance costs may be borne by the community as a whole since additional safeguards would have to be taken[^3]. In this regard, I was particularly mindful that the loss caused to the bank in this case was substantial and significantly higher than _Tan_ (about five times more than the loss caused in _Tan’s_ case).

14     I was in general agreement with the Prosecution that a slightly higher sentence than what was imposed in Tan’s case was warranted, at first look. However, in deciding that a term of 26 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for this Accused, I took into consideration these following factors:

> a)     The total loss to the bank was caused by two acts of cheating on two separate occasions, once on 25 August 2015 and the other, on 7 October 2015. In _Tan_, the offences were committed over a long period of time (6 September 2007 to 22 October 2008) and involved the use of 176 invoices encapsulated in 176 charges;

> b)     The severe ill health of the Accused. In mitigation, Defence highlighted multiple medical problems the Accused had[^4]. This included: severe obstructive sleep apnoea, musculoskeletal chest pain with chest pain on exertion, bipolar anxiety depressive disorder associated with panic attacks and claustrophobia, diabetes mellitus, to name a few.

15     Whilst the medical problems of the Accused were sufficiently serious to feature in the court’s consideration of proportionality of a custodial term to the gravity of the offence, they did not constitute grounds for the court to exercise judicial mercy[^5]. Judicial mercy was an “_exceptional jurisdiction that is to be invoked carefully and only sparingly_” in exceptional circumstances[^6]. There was none in this case.

16     Taking into account all the relevant facts and features in this case, including the quantum of loss involved, the culpability of the Accused and giving an appropriate discount in light of his ill health, I was of the view that the sentence of 26 months imprisonment was appropriate. Both Prosecution and the Defence were confident that the Accused and his medical conditions could be adequately managed when he was in prison[^7].

##### Conclusion

17     In the interest of the Accused, his relevant medical reports were annexed to the Warrant of Commitment to be handed to the Prisons, along with his medication and a letter prepared by Defence Counsel, containing a list of the medication that had to be taken by the Accused on a daily basis. At the mention, the DPP also helpfully offered to have the Investigating Officer of the case alert the Prisons of the Accused’s medical conditions so that they may do a full medical assessment of the Accused when he was brought in.

18     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
