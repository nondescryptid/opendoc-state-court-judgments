### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to the following charge:

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I did find the charge against the Accused had been made out. However, the Accused was acquitted on the ground that she had exercised reasonable care to ensure that her employees did not offer sexual services during the course of their employment.

3       The Prosecution is appealing against the said order of acquittal.

## Case for the Prosecution

4       The case for the Prosecution relied mainly on the evidence of Sean Teo (PW1) for the predicate offence. The Prosecution called a few police officers to support the contention that the Accused had failed to exercise reasonable care. No one from the massage establishment industry was called to give evidence regarding the practice adopted in the industry to safeguard against the offer of sexual services by the employees.

## The Undisputed Facts

5       It was not in dispute that the Accused was a category 1 licensee of an establishment for massage described as OK Wellness Spa located at 1019 Upper Serangoon Road. See exhibit P4. The standard conditions for category 1 licence were as stated in exhibit P5.

6       The Accused had 3 employees at the said establishment. They were Li Jingru (“DW3”), Chu Pui Kyui (“DW6”) and He Ai Jiao. On 4 July 2019, the employees were working at the said establishment. The Accused arrived at the establishment after 1.25pm.

## Credibility of Li Jingru (DW3)

7       DW 3 alleged that she did not offer any sexual services to PW1. With respect, I rejected this allegation. I did not find DW3 to be a truthful witness. First, it was her testimony that the additional $45 was for her to exert less force during the massage and to extend the duration of the massage. However, the Accused’s cautioned statement (P10) stated that the additional $45 was for an additional service of massaging with essential oils. Clearly this statement must have originated from DW3 as exhibit P10 states: “In fact, she wanted to offer the customer some oil massage treatment package…”. The additional $45 was also not stated in her contemporaneous statement exhibit D4 (the typewritten statement is exhibit D5).

8       I also found that this aspect of DW3’s testimony was illogical as it did not make sense for a customer to pay more for extra duration of less exertion of force during the massage. There were therefore internal and external inconsistencies on this material issue.

9       Hence, DW3 did not come across to me as a reliable witness. On the other hand, the fact that DW3 was found to have lied on a matter, it did not mean that her credibility had been affected as a whole. See _Ng Kwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 281</span> at \[15\].

## Submissions by the Defence

10     The defence submitted that it would be a grave injustice to convict the Accused based on the uncorroborated word of police officer Sean Teo Kailiang (PW1). Firstly, counsel questioned the lack of corroborative objective evidence. He contended that the “officers involved are highly experienced in decoy operations in relation to massage parlours”. Yet they never thought of using a recording device to obtain evidence.

11     Counsel also questioned the reliability of the prosecution witnesses, in particular the evidence of PW1 (Sean Teo).

## Credibility and Evidence of PW1

12     With respect, I see no reason why the words of an experienced officer who did not use a recording device cannot be believed. On the contrary, I found PW1 to be a credible and truthful witness.

13     PW1 testified that on 4 July 2019, he was deployed as a decoy officer to conduct a raid on OK Wellness Spa. He entered OK Wellness Spa at about 1.25pm and was attended to by DW3. He paid $45 for a full body massage at the counter and after payment, entered Room 3. He took a shower and thereafter wore only a pair of disposable underwear. About 15 minutes after DW3 had commenced her massage, she asked PW1 to turn over, pointed to his groin and asked him in Mandarin whether he wanted her to make him feel good for an additional $45. PW1 declined and signalled for the raiding party to arrive and they did.

14     In my view, PW1’s evidence was unusually convincing. These were my reasons.

15     Firstly, there was no motive or reason for PW1 to fabricate evidence against the Accused. I noted that PW1 had been in the Police Force for 20 years and had been conducting vice operation for about 10 years. It was not disputed that the Accused was not able to indicate any motive for PW1 to lie in court. PW1 was also a stranger to the Accused and DW3

16     I also observed his demeanour when he gave evidence. In my view, he was forthright in giving evidence.

17     Next, I found PW1’s evidence to be internally and externally consistent. Counsel submitted that the prosecution witnesses maintained that the room in question was dimly lit which he contended was inconsistent by reference to the photographs taken at the scene. See exhibit P3, in particular, photographs 7 and 8. I noted that the photographs showed there was light in the room. In my view, based on the photographs, it was too speculative to conclude whether it was or was not dimly lit. It was common knowledge that how photographs were taken and the use of the brightness feature of the camera can have an effect on the pictures to be taken. Moreover, what amounted to dim or bright could also be subjective. In any event, this issue was not put to the witnesses. I therefore rejected this submission made by counsel.

18     Counsel highlighted that there was inaccurate information regarding the presence of oil by reference to P3-7 and P3-8 and the oral evidence of PW1 that “the masseuse…. wasn’t holding on to any oil bottle”. With respect, I found no inconsistency. PW1 did not say there was no oil bottle. He clearly stated the masseuse was not holding on to any oil bottle. In fact, the presence of the oil bottle could be an indication to support the Prosecution’s theory that masturbation was offered. It also demolished the Defence’s contention that no paraphernalia for the provision of sexual services was found. It could also be used to facilitate the massage.

19     With respect, I did not find there was omission of material details as suggested by the defence. See \[44\] to \[47\] of the closing submissions by the defence. In my view, it was not logical to conclude that DW3 would not offer any sexual services to PW1 because he did not want to be seen in a state of undress. I think it was more consistent with the integrity of PW1. It showed that he did not go all the way to entrap DW3. He behaved in a way expected of a gentleman. The omission of this detail would not affect the reliability of the PW1.

20     The defence contended that there was a possibility that PW1 might have misunderstood or misinterpreted the interaction at the material time. In this respect, reference was made to the NE, day 1 page 11 lines 18-21 and page 12, lines 9 to 18 which contained the evidence of PW1 that DW3 said to him “ Do you want me to make you feel good?” and the exact words in Mandarin “Ni yao wo rang ni su fu ma?” which the court interpreter translated it into English “ Do you want me to make you feel comfortable?’ With respect, I did not see any significant difference in these 2 phrases. In any event, it had to be understood in the context of having a massage in the massage establishment. PW1 also added that when DW3 uttered those words she also pointed to his groin area. Clearly in this context, there was an unequivocal offer to provide sexual services by DW3 to PW1. Moreover, based on his years of experience as a decoy officer and his ability to understand and speak Mandarin, PW1 could not have misunderstood or misinterpreted the offer. Accordingly, I rejected the submission that there was a possibility that PW1 had misinterpreted his interaction with DW3.

21     Next, counsel submitted that it did not make sense that DW3 would commit the predicate act within a few minutes after she had begun massaging PW1. With respect, I disagreed. I found there was no logical reason why DW3 could not make the offer to provide sexual service to PW1. In fact, I believe PW1’s evidence that DW3 did in fact offer to masturbate PW1 by saying in Mandarin which was translated by the court interpreter to mean “ Do you want me to make you feel comfortable” and at the same time pointing to PW1’s groin area.[^1]

22     Counsel contended that no necessary paraphernalia such as condoms, lubricants for the provision of sexual services were seized. Hence, there was a serious doubt that sexual services were offered. With respect, I disagreed. Clearly there were lubricant in the form of oil bottle found in the premises.

23     With respect, I also held that it was pure speculation to say that because of the lack of pillow and that the bed had a face-hole therefore PW1 would not be able to see DW3 pointing to his groin. This was not even put to PW1 during the cross-examination. In fact, PW1 said that when he turned over, the masseuse pointed to his groin area.

24     The other point highlighted by counsel was the evidence of PW1 that DW3 offered sexual service for $45 instead of $50 was “highly suspect as she would have to obtain change from the counter and would risk getting caught by her supervisors and /or boss”. I rejected this submission as there was no evidence that PW1 did not have $45 with him or that he only had $50 notes without small notes. Moreover, there was no evidence that DW3 would need to go to the counter to obtain a change if a customer had given her a $50 note for a service that cost $45.

25     In the final analysis, I rejected the submission that there were material inconsistencies in the Prosecution’s case. With respect, I did not agree that the lack of any form of audio recording to corroborate PW1’s evidence meant that the Prosecution had failed to discharge their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I believed the evidence given by PW1 and I found it to be unusually convincing.

## My Finding

26     In the circumstances, I found Li Jingru (DW3) did offer to provide sexual service to PW1 Sgt Sean Teo in the course of her employment at OK Wellness Spa.

## Defence of Reasonable Care

27     Although the offence in question was one of strict liability, the Prosecution rightly highlighted at \[9\] of the written submissions that the “accused has a defence if they can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused exercised reasonable care to ensure that her employees did not offer sexual services during the course of their employment”.

28     The Prosecution accepted that regular checks conducted by the licensee and/or supervisee during employees’ massages to see if sexual services were provided would indicate that the accused exercised reasonable care.[^2]

29     The Prosecution contended that regular checks were not conducted by the Accused, her supervisors and/or her ‘secret shoppers’ during the massages to ensure sexual services were not provided by the employees.

30     PW3 (Francis Phua) testified that the measures and practices done in other massage establishments to ensure sexual services were not provided included daily briefings, random checks during massage, and checks on the employees’ personal belongings for condoms or lubricants. PW5 (Mohamad Isa bin Haroon) also said about the same measures.[^3] PW2’s (Ng Cheng Hwee) evidence on this aspect was also similar. The licencing conditions also expressly included daily briefings, no locking device for door of massage room and the lighting in the room to be sufficiently bright.

31     PW2 and PW3 were also members of the raiding party that was involved in the decoy operation against the Accused. PW5 was the investigation officer of this case.

32     PW4 (Woon Jian Hong), the police photographer, admitted that photo 6 of P3 showed part of the glass panel on the door was frosted but the top part of the glass panel was clear. PW3 claimed that from the outside of room 3 with the door shut, he was unable to see what was happening inside.[^4] On the other hand, the photographs taken by PW4 indicated there was clear portions in the glass panel of the door and the light within was sufficiently bright enough for one to see inside the room. See photographs 6, 7 and 8 of P3. Looking at the photographs tendered and having heard the evidence; I was of the view that one can observe the activity inside the room by standing close to the glass panel. In fact, PW1 testified that there was a small frosted glass in the centre of the door and “there are little slits where people can look through”.[^5] It was also the undisputed evidence of the Accused that this design of the glass panel to the massage room was allowed for massage parlour under category one. What were required by the licensing conditions were, among other requirements, that there must be a clear view of the room when the door was open, and the room was sufficiently bright for the licensee or supervisor to be able to observe that action of the masseuse. See exhibit P5. I found there was no evidence to show that the rooms were obstructed such that there was no clear view of the room when the door was open.

## Measures taken by the Accused

33     It was not disputed that the employment contract of DW3 did provide that sexual services should not be provided. See exhibit P11.

34     I found that there was a notice (exhibit D3) located behind the front counter of the premises stating that sexual services were prohibited. This maybe the reason why PW4 did not see it. But the notice was visible to the employees. This was confirmed by Li Jingru (DW3). Her evidence was corroborated by Chu Pui Kyui (DW6).

35     I accepted the evidence of the defence witnesses that briefings to the staff not to provide sexual services were conducted.[^6] See also exhibit D5, a contemporaneous statement recorded on 4 July 2019. The briefings were not only done by the Accused but also by Chu Pui Kyui. In fact, DW3 confirmed that on the day in question, Chu Pui Kyui did brief her not to provide sexual services. See also exhibit P9 which was admitted as part of the Prosecution’s case.

36     There were also chat messages to the staff containing reminders not to provide sexual services and local news report regarding police conducting enforcement operations against massage establishments for the provision of sexual services. In particular on 22 May 2019 there was a chat reminder that “our store is a proper store that declines all illegal transactions”. See exhibit D9-T – message on 22 May 2019 at 5:57pm. Chu Pui Kyui also confirmed that the messages were a reminder not to provide sexual services.[^7] On 23 May 2019, a chat message was sent by the Accused to remind her staff to comply with the licencing rules.

37     In the circumstances, I found that the Accused did utilise the messaging platform to remind the staff to abide by the rules and not to provide sexual services.

38     The Defence also contended that there were checks done by the Accused and her supervisors while employees were conducting massages. The Accused testified that she would be present daily to supervise the staff. This was corroborated by DW3. If the Accused was not around then her staff (He Ai Jiao and Chu Pui Kyui) will conduct the checks.[^8] I believed that there were such checks done to ensure no sexual services were provided given the consistency in the defence evidence that checks were conducted at the premises to ensure no sexual services were provided.[^9] See also exhibit P9.

39     I noted that the Prosecution contended that the massage room was too dim to be visible through the glass panel in the door for proper checks to be done. However, exhibit P3-7 seemed to indicate that visibility was good as one can easily see the far wall. P3-6 would also suggest visibility was good. It was also stated in exhibit P9 that the light in the room cannot be dimmed. I therefore rejected the Prosecution’s contention. I was of the view that the room may be dim but yet sufficiently bright to see the activity inside.

40     The Accused had a rigorous staff selection criterion and a process of firing problematic staff. DW3 remembered that when she was recruited by the Accused, she was told expressly that the centre was strictly a traditional massage centre and that she was never to offer sexual services. The credibility of a traditional massage centre was also fortified by the Accused’s encouragement to her staff to keep learning and attend training at Chung Hwa Hospital to learn more skills. In fact, one of her staff (Chu Pui Kyui) was studying to improve her massage skills at the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. See exhibits D7-T and D8-T. In my view, such measures taken by the Accused were indicators of her efforts to provide traditional massage rather than permitting the conduct of sexual services.

41     There was also evidence that the Accused did engage her friend Xu Bo (DW2) to act as “secret shopper” to check on her staff regarding service quality and inappropriate activity. Xu Bo confirmed that he did so several times and whenever a new staff was engaged. The evidence of having her friend to check on her staff was also consistent with her statement in exhibit P9.

42     I also noted that when asked by the Prosecution about proof that these checks were conducted, DW2 answered that there was, and it was in the form of his communication with the Accused.[^10] It was unfortunate that the Prosecution did not allow counsel to produce such evidence after the close of the case for the defence given the fact that at the material time the Accused was conducting her defence in person.

43     DW2 did not deny that he had known the Accused for several years and did not have to pay for the massages when he undertook the assignments. Nevertheless, I believed in his evidence as I observed his demeanour in court and found that he was forthright in giving his evidence.[^11] He was very confident that there was evidence of his engagement by the Accused but unfortunately perhaps because of lack of legal advice at the material time, such evidence was not produced in court. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the Prosecution did not allow the Defence Counsel to admit it after the Accused had already given her defence. But I noted that exhibit P9 did indicate that the Accused did ask a friend to conduct check. I also did not notice any material inconsistency in DW2’s evidence.

44     In the circumstances, I found that DW2 was a truthful witness and accepted his evidence. That being the case, it would therefore not be necessary to allow the Accused to be recalled to give evidence of the screenshots of the WeChat dialogue between DW2 and the Accused to further strengthen the evidence of DW2.

45     I noted that the Accused did not conduct daily checks on her employees’ personal belongings to determine whether they had in their possession any sexual paraphernalia. According to the Prosecution witnesses, this was one of the measures of ensuring no sexual services were provided by the masseuse. If this factor was indeed a very crucial factor, it would have been prescribed as a condition in the licence. But this was not a prescribed condition. Hence, I did not think that the failure to do so amounted to the failure to take reasonable care.

## Conclusion

46     I was of the view that in determining whether or not the Accused had discharged her burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that she exercised reasonable care to ensure that her employees did not offer sexual services during the course of their employment, must be determined holistically and taking into account the measures she had taken to ensure no sexual services were provided. What was required of the Accused was the exercise of reasonable care. With this in mind, considering the measures adopted by the Accused to prevent the provision of sexual services, in my judgment, the Accused did exercise reasonable care. I found that she had gone to the extent of engaging her friend to be the “mystery shopper” to check on the quality and appropriateness of the service provided by the masseuses at her massage establishment. She even encouraged her staff to attend courses to upgrade their massage skills. The fact that no personal checks were done on the personal belongings of the staff, in my view, did not detract from the fact that that Accused did adopt other measures to ensure no provision of sexual services was provided at her massage establishment.

47     I also noted that the Accused had consistently maintained in her defence that she had taken measures to ensure no sexual services were offered at her massage establishment.

48     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Accused had discharged her burden of proving reasonable care, on a balance of probabilities. Accordingly, the Accused was found not guilty and acquitted.
