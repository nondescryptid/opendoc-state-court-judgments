## Antecedents

4       The Accused was untraced.

## Submissions on Sentence

5       Relying on the decision of the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“BDB”_) and other sentencing precedents, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 16 to 18 months’ imprisonment and 6 to 12 strokes of the cane. But I will not address the issue of caning as there was no appeal by the Prosecution against my decision for not imposing any caning.

6       A compensation order of $885.71 being the victim’s medical fees was also sought by the Prosecution which the Defence did not dispute and accepted liability. Hence, I will also not address the question of compensation in my grounds of decision.

7       The Defence contended that the appropriate sentence should be 7 months’ imprisonment with no caning. In support of this contention the Defence relied on the Accused’s mitigation plea and sentencing precedents, particularly_, Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“Low Song Chye”)_ and the case of _Arumugam Selvaraj v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 881</span> (“Arumugam”)_.

## Sentencing Considerations

8       Given the nature and circumstances of the case, I was of the view that the main sentencing considerations must be deterrence and retribution.

9       Next, I noted that the punishment prescribed for the offence committed was a mandatory imprisonment term up to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning. Clearly the offence committed by the Accused was a serious offence.

10     Next, I applied the sentencing approach (a 2-step process) in _BDB_ as this is a case involving an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under Section 325 of the Penal Code. In this respect, having regard to the nature and seriousness of the injuries caused, with respect, I disagreed with the Prosecution that the indicative starting point for sentencing should be 13 to 15 months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that it should be 12 to 13 months’ imprisonment. With respect, I also rejected the submission by the Accused that the indicative starting point in the present case ought to be 6 months’ imprisonment.

11     In my view, the indicative starting sentencing range of 12 to 13 months’ imprisonment was in line with the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution. I noted that the cases cited by the Prosecution showed a range of sentences ranging from 6 months’ imprisonment to 3.5 years’ imprisonment. The wide range is understandable as the sentence to be imposed for Section 325 of the Penal Code is extremely fact and injury specific. I was also mindful that the facts of the present case were not the same as the sentencing precedents cited by both parties. But it served as a good guide and ultimately the indicative sentence must be based on the facts of the present case.

12     I noted that the victim in the present case suffered bruises over his right eye and nasal bridge, a mildly displaced fracture of the nasal bone, a minimally displaced right inferior posterior orbital wall fracture, and an undisplaced fracture of the left anterior 8th rib. These were injuries occurred mainly at the vulnerable parts of the body, namely, the nose, eye, and ribs. In short, the victim suffered multiple injuries including mildly displaced fractures. The injuries were managed conservatively and there was no evidence that the injuries sustained were of a permanent nature. The victim was hospitalized and was given a 6-day hospitalization MC.

13     The injuries suffered in the present case was quite similar to the case of _PP v Pettijohn William Samuel <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 290</span> (“Pettijohn”)_ cited by the Prosecution. In that case, the victim also sustained multiple facial fractures (mildly displaced fractures of the left orbital floor and anterior and lateral maxillary walls with small haemoantrum and a left zygomatic arch fracture), underwent surgery and suffered permanent impairment of his vision (peripheral diplopia). 18 months’ imprisonment was considered to be the suitable starting point. See _Pettijohn_ at \[130\]. The offender in that case claimed trial and ultimately, he was sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment. The sentence was affirmed by the High Court. I was mindful that the multiple injuries and fractures in the present case (see \[12\] above) were not as serious and were managed without surgery. There was no permanent disability or impairment. The victim in the present case, was given hospitalization leave from 20 February 2020 to 25 February 2020. In the circumstances, I held that the starting indicative sentence be scaled down from the sentence meted out in _Pettijohn_, to 12 to 13 months’ imprisonment.

14     While the case of _Low Song Chye_ was highly instructive, it must be noted that the sentencing range in each band was based on the old penalty of up to 2 years’ imprisonment for an offence punishable under Section 323 Penal Code. From 1 January 2020, the maximum imprisonment term has been raised to 3 years’ imprisonment. Accordingly, in my view the sentencing range for each of the sentencing bands in _Low Song Chye_ has to be recalibrated upwards correspondingly by a factor of 1.5 times.

15     The Defence submitted that the present case was within band 2 of the _Low Seng Chye’s_ sentencing framework and contended that the indicative starting point should be 6 months’ imprisonment. As indicated above at \[14\], in view of the enhanced penalty, the maximum sentence for band 2 should be 9 months’ imprisonment and not 6 months’ imprisonment.

16     The Defence also relied heavily on the case of _Arumugam_ to support its contention for a 6 months’ starting point for sentence. The High Court in _Arumugam_ held at \[13\] that for a fracture of a finger accompanied by extensive bruises, the start point was 6 months’ imprisonment. The final sentence was increased to 7 months’ imprisonment on account of the aggravating factors. In my view, _Arumugan_ can be distinguished. In that case, the most distinctive factors were that it involved a single undisplaced fracture of the middle finger and severe bruising to the face. See _PP v Arumugam Selvaraj (2019) SGDC 13_ at \[64\]. In the present case, it involved multiple fractures including a mildly displaced fracture of the nasal bone, undisplaced fracture of a rib and a minimally displaced right inferior posterior orbital wall fracture. There were also bruises over the face. In my view, the nature and severity of the injuries suffered by the victim in the present case, were far worse than that in _Arumugan_. I, therefore, rejected the contention that the starting sentence should be 6 months’ imprisonment. As mentioned above, I was of the view that the starting indicative sentence should be 12 to 13 months’ imprisonment. It was substantially below the sentence imposed in _PP v P Rajenthirun <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 95</span> (“Rajenthirun”)_ which was more aggravating in terms of the circumstances of the case. In _Rajenthirun_, the offender kicked and used a metal pole to hit the victim. The victim sustained multiple fractures related to the right bony orbit/partially imaged maxillary sinus. There was no indication that the injuries suffered were of a permanent nature. The victim was given medical leave for eight days. The offender had a violence related antecedent. He pleaded guilty to a charge under Section 325 Penal Code and 2 drug related charges. He was jailed for 2 years for the charge under Section 325 of the Penal Code. The court held at \[20\] that the range for the type and severity of the injuries suffered by the victim would be 18 months’ imprisonment to 24 months’ imprisonment. The sentence was affirmed by the High Court.

17     Having identified the indicative starting sentence, I proceeded to consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability which entailed a holistic assessment of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors[^1].

18     The Accused claimed that he attacked the victim as he did not like the victim’s tone and because of his personal matters. See \[10\] of SOF. In my view, there was no justification at all to attack the victim because of these reasons. I noted that the Accused had repeatedly punched and choked the helpless victim while in the confine of his taxi. It was a relentless attack and almost entirely one-sided attack other than a brief struggle by the victim and a bite on the Accused’s hand to break free from the Accused’s chokehold. The Accused’s culpability was further heightened by the aggravating factors below.

19     The aggravating factors identified by the Court of Appeal in _BDB_ (at \[62\]) included the extent of deliberation or premeditation, the manner and duration of the attack and the victim’s vulnerability. In the present case, the attack was clearly premeditated. This can be inferred from the facts of the case, namely, the attack happened at 5am, the Accused first asked the victim to take him to the casino at Marina Bay Sands in his taxi and after having travelled for a distance, the Accused asked the victim to change course claiming that he had forgotten something from his home. The taxi then stopped at a bus stop near 427 Hougang Avenue 6 Singapore and immediately the Accused started to strangle the victim from the rear passenger seat. There was a struggle and the Accused then alighted from the taxi and opened the driver’s passenger door. Instead of leaving, he resumed to attack the victim again. The Accused then fled to Malaysia. He was a Malaysian national.

20     The fact that the Accused had fled to Malaysia soon after the offence was also an aggravating factor as it indicated his intention to avoid detection and arrest. He was arrested in October 2021, more than 1.5 years after the commission of the offence. I rejected the bare allegation that soon after the offence, he had to return urgently to Penang as his sister had been hospitalized.

21     I noted that the Accused had deliberately attacked the victim’s face which was a vulnerable spot, thereby exacerbating the gravity of the assault and constituting yet another aggravating factor. In fact, the Accused had punched the victim on his face about 4 times.

22     It was not disputed that the victim was a taxi driver, and the Accused was his passenger. At the material time, the victim was about 54 years old. It is certainly more aggravating that the attack had taken place at night which was the highest risk driving period for taxi drivers[^2].

23     I was mindful of the exhortation of VK Rajah JA ( as he then was) when His Honour was hearing the appeal of a case involving a charge under section 323 of the Penal Code that “ in such a sustained and brutish assault on a public transport worker by an intoxicated offender would ordinarily require a lengthier custodial sentence of around six months to a year. In appropriate cases, the courts should not shy away from imposing even more draconian sentences. A clear and unmistakable signal must be sent out that no such attacks will be tolerated[^3].” In the present case, there was no evidence that the Accused was intoxicated. In the circumstances and in light of the aggravating factors stated above, I adjusted the indicative sentence upwards to 14 months’ imprisonment. Next, I proceeded to determine the mitigating factors.

24     The mitigating factors identified by the Court of Appeal in _BDB_ (at \[71\]) were the offender’s mental condition, the offender’s genuine remorse; and the offender’s personal financial or social problems (with the court citing at \[75\] that this would rarely, if ever, have mitigating value). In the present case, I accorded due weight to the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty which indicated his remorsefulness. But I did not think that the Accused’s personal circumstances highlighted in the mitigating plea was so exceptional as to warrant any mitigating value.

25     I noted that the Accused was untraced. It is trite that this is a neutral factor[^4].

26     In the circumstances, I adjusted downwards the sentence to 13 months’ imprisonment to take into account the Accused’s guilty plea.

## Conclusion

27     I was of the view that a sentence of 13 months’ imprisonment was necessary to give weight to the needs of deterrence and retribution. It is without doubt that a deterrent sentence is necessary to protect taxi drivers especially those who chose to ply in the night when public trains and buses were not operating. “Public transport workers have every right to work in a safe and secure environment and are vulnerable to criminal violence. A deterrent sentence is warranted: _Wong Hoi Len v PP <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span>_ at \[11\] and \[18\].” [^5]

28     It was not clear why the Prosecution has chosen not to proceed against the Accused for the offence of attempted robbery with hurt as the victim did mention that it was a case of robbery in the medical report filed in court. In any event, I like to stress that I did not consider as a sentencing consideration the fact the Accused could be charged for attempted robbery with hurt.

29     The Accused is currently serving his sentence which was backdated to 22 Oct 2021.
