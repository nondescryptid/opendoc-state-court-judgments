Employment Law – Employee’s duties

Damages – Rules in awarding – Proof of actual damage

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 39/2020.\]

3 March 2021

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for breach of the non-competition and confidentiality clauses in her contract of employment. I allowed the plaintiff’s claim for an injunction against the defendant.

2       However, in relation to the plaintiff’s claim for damages, I found that the plaintiff had failed to prove the losses that it was claiming against the defendant, save for the sum of $162. The plaintiff has appealed against my decision. There is no appeal by the defendant.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff is in the business of manufacture and sale of chemicals and lubricants.

4       Under a Letter of Appointment dated 28 September 2015 (“the Employment Contract”), the plaintiff employed the defendant as a Customer Service Executive.

5       The pertinent provisions of the Employment Contract are as follows:

> (a)     Under clause 14b of the Employment Contract (“the Confidentiality Clause”), the defendant shall not reveal to any person, firm or corporation any confidential information, including information relating to the customers of the plaintiff.[^1]

> (b)     Under clause 19b of the Employment Contract (“the Non-Competition Clause”), the defendant will not for a period of one year following termination of her employment with the plaintiff:

>> (i)       Be employed by any business, similar to the plaintiff’s business.

>> (ii)       Solicit any of the plaintiff’s customers.[^2]

6       The defendant’s scope of work involved the promotion, marketing, sale and delivery of the plaintiff’s products to its customers. To carry out her work, the defendant had access to confidential information on the plaintiff’s customers, including:

> (a)     the customers’ identities,

> (b)     contact information,

> (c)     the products purchased, and

> (d)     the price and quantity of the products purchased.

### Defendant’s threat to disclose the plaintiff’s customer list

7       On 8 May 2017, the defendant resigned, after working with the plaintiff for less than two years. The defendant threatened to disclose the plaintiff’s customer list and leads to the plaintiff’s competitors, if she was not paid one month’s salary and allowed to stop work immediately, without serving her notice period of one month.

8       The plaintiff’s director, Fay Lee Lian, confronted the defendant for making this threat. Fay Lee Lian’s evidence was that the defendant confirmed that she had made the threat.[^3] As the defendant chose not to call any evidence at the trial, the aforesaid evidence of the defendant’s threat was not disputed.

9       The defendant served her notice period of one month and stopped coming to work from 8 June 2017 onwards.

### Defendant’s solicitation of the plaintiff’s customers

10     After the defendant left the plaintiff’s employment, Fay Lee Lian engaged Integrity Investigation Services to conduct video surveillance on the defendant. The surveillance was carried out on 17 and 18 July 2017. The surveillance showed that the defendant had approached eight of the plaintiff’s customers.

11     Five of the aforesaid eight customers were serviced by the defendant exclusively, during her employment with the plaintiff, namely:

> (a)     Dawn Engineering Works Pte Ltd.[^4]

> (b)     DTP Auto Servicing Pte Ltd.[^5]

> (c)     Sia & Yeo Heavy Equipment Pte Ltd.[^6]

> (d)     Auto Recovery Hub Pte Ltd.[^7]

> (e)     Carewell Auto Service.[^8]

12     Thereafter, the plaintiff’s Esther Chua and Ho Choon Ni, approached another eight of the plaintiff’s customers and ascertained that the defendant had solicited business from them.[^9] However, only Esther Chua, who had approached one customer, Peng Auto Care, gave evidence for the trial. Ho Choon Ni, who had approached seven customers, left the plaintiff in December 2018,[^10] and did not give evidence.

13     The plaintiff ascertained that the defendant had taken up employment with Chuan Teng Petroleum Pte Ltd (“Chuan Teng”) and CT International Pte Ltd, who are competitors of the plaintiff, selling similar products in the same industries. The defendant used the alias “Tina” or “Jasmine” when she contacted the plaintiff’s customers.

### Plaintiff’s action against the defendant

14     The plaintiff commenced the action herein against the defendant, seeking an injunction to restrain the defendant from disclosing the plaintiff’s confidential information. In the original statement of claim, an injunction was sought to restrain the defendant from breaching the Non-Competition Clause as well. However, in the latest amendment to the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the plaintiff is no longer pursuing an injunction in relation to the Non-Competition Clause, which has already expired.[^11]

15     The plaintiff also claims damages against the defendant, based on the plaintiff’s loss of sales in relation to 136 customers, for the period from 1 May 2017 to 31 March 2019.[^12] The later part of this period from 8 June 2018 onwards, is after the one year Non-Competition Clause had expired.

16     Only one of the plaintiff’s customers, Ng Terng Yong Jonathan (“Jonathan Ng”), the General Manager of Travel GSH Pte Ltd (“Travel GSH”), gave evidence for the trial. The other customers of the plaintiff did not give evidence.

17     At the trial, the defendant elected not to cross-examine Esther Chua and Jonathan Ng. The defendant further elected not to call any evidence.

## Issues

18     The key issues at the trial, were:

> (a)     Whether the defendant had made use of the plaintiff’s confidential information, in breach of the Confidentiality Clause in the Employment Contract.

> (b)     Whether the plaintiff was able to prove that the defendant’s breach of the Employment Contract, had caused the plaintiff’s loss.

## Breach of the Confidentiality Clause

19     The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for breach of the Non-Competition Clause and Confidentiality Clause in her contract of employment.

20     The defendant elected not to call any evidence.

21     In _Ma Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 106</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[32\]:

> … where a defendant elects not to call any evidence … there is simply no contrary evidence from the defendant for the court to consider. The court is only left with the evidence of the plaintiff and if, on a _prima facie_ basis, the evidence satisfies all the ingredients or essential elements of the cause of action, judgment will be entered against the defendant.

22     I found that the plaintiff had adduced evidence of the defendant’s breach of the Non-Competition Clause and Confidentiality Clause in her contract of employment as follows:

> (a)     At a meeting on 8 May 2017, the defendant had threatened that if her demands were not agreed to by the plaintiff, she would give away the plaintiff’s customer list and leads to the plaintiff’s competitors.[^13]

> (b)     The defendant was filmed visiting eight of the plaintiff’s customers on 17 and 18 July 2017,[^14] while she was still bound by the Non-Competition Clause.

23     As the defendant elected not to call any evidence, the aforesaid evidence from the plaintiff was not rebutted by the defendant.

24     The defendant has submitted that the customer information was public knowledge as anyone could have visited the customers and obtain the information.[^15] In _Centre for Creative Leadership (CCL) Pte Ltd v Byrne Roger Peter and others_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 193</span> at \[84\], it was held that:

> Information can be recognised as confidential or amount to a trade secret even if it is a result of the employer’s effort on materials available to the public “\[by\] the fact that the maker … has used his brains and thus produced a result which can only be produced by somebody who goes through the process” …

25     In the premises, the list of customers containing their names, their contact particulars and the products they used that had been compiled by the plaintiff, is confidential as it is the collation of the plaintiff’s work carried out over the years to obtain and put together such information.

26     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I found that the plaintiff has proven its case that the defendant has acted in breach of the Confidentiality Clause and the Non-Competition Clause.

27     I note that the injunction sought by the plaintiff in their Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) seeks to cover both Confidential Information and trade connections. The injunction should only be limited to Confidential Information, as the general reference to trade connections may cover information that is not confidential. Accordingly, the injunction granted is as follows:

> An injunction to restrain the defendant from revealing to any person, firm or corporation any of the Confidential Information of the plaintiff, which came to the defendant’s knowledge during her employment, and shall keep with complete secrecy all Confidential Information entrusted to her and shall not use or attempt to use any such information in any manner whatsoever which may injure or cause loss either directly or indirectly to the plaintiff, its clients and/or its business or which may be likely so to do.

## Whether the plaintiff proved its loss

28     As for the plaintiff’s claim for damages, the plaintiff claims that it has lost sales to 136 customers serviced by the defendant exclusively, as a result of the defendant’s breach of the Employment Contract.[^16] These 136 customers are listed in Annexure A of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3).[^17] In its Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) at \[9\], the plaintiff claims a difference in sales amounting to $625,062.10, but in prayer (2) of its claims, the plaintiff states that its claim for damages is capped at the sum of $250,000.[^18]

29     A fundamental difficulty with the plaintiff’s claim based on the difference in sales, is that it fails to take into consideration the cost of sales. This was pointed out to the defendant’s director, Fay Lee Lian, in cross-examination, who then claimed that the plaintiff’s profit margin was 30%.[^19]

30     In its Closing Submissions, the plaintiff submitted an alternative claim for $137,286.90,[^20] taking into consideration:

> (a)     Fay Lee Lian’s evidence in cross-examination that the plaintiff’s profit margin was 30%.[^21]

> (b)     An allowance for a gradual decrease in the effect of the defendant’s breaches, after the Non-Competition Clause had expired.[^22]

31     In _Tan Kok Yong Steve v Itochu Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 85</span>, the High Court held (at \[116\]), that:

> Without actual evidence to show that it was the Plaintiff’s breach that had directly led to the Defendant’s customers taking their business elsewhere and hence the drop in business, I could not attribute the loss suffered by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.

32     In the present case, there is no evidence that the 136 customers claimed by the plaintiff had purchased products from the defendant or her new employer, except for:

> (a)     the evidence from Esther Chua in relation to Peng Auto Care,

> (b)     the evidence from Jonathan Ng in relation to Travel GSH, and

> (c)     an invoice obtained from Seah Kwang Seng Motor Services.

33     However, the evidence from Esther Chua in this respect is hearsay, as her evidence is based on what she was told by Ah Peng from Peng Auto Care.[^23] Ah Peng did not give evidence at the trial.

34     None of the plaintiff’s customers gave evidence for the trial, except Jonathan Ng from Travel GSH. Furthermore, except for the aforesaid invoice from Seah Kwang Seng Motor Services, there was no documentary evidence showing that any of the 136 customers that were the subject of the plaintiff’s claim, had purchased products from the defendant or her new employer.

35     The plaintiff’s evidence of its loss is therefore deficient in that:

> (a)     There is a lack of evidence from the plaintiff’s customers.

> (b)     There is a lack of documentary evidence that the plaintiff’s customers had purchased products from the defendant or her new employer.

### Lack of evidence from the plaintiff’s customers

36     Jonathan Ng from Travel GSH, is the only customer of the plaintiff who gave evidence for the trial. Jonathan Ng’s evidence was that the defendant had visited him at Travel GSH’s office, introduced herself as “Tina”, offered to provide Travel GSH with a quotation for lubricants from CT International Pte Ltd and sent him an email quotation on the same day.[^24] However, a quotation does not necessarily mean that a sale subsequently took place.

37     No evidence was given by Jonathan Ng that Travel GSH had gone on to purchase any products from the defendant or CT International Pte Ltd. Considering that Travel GSH is one of the 136 customers that the plaintiff claims that it had lost sales as a result of the defendant’s breaches,[^25] it is remarkable that the plaintiff had not obtained such evidence from Jonathan Ng, who had given an affidavit of evidence-in-chief in support of the plaintiff’s case and was clearly prepared to give evidence for the plaintiff in its claim.

38     That Jonathan Ng did not give such evidence is even more astonishing, taking into consideration that he was the only customer who gave evidence in support of the plaintiff’s case. One would have thought that the plaintiff would have done everything possible to ensure that the evidence in Jonathan Ng’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief was complete. In cross-examination, the only explanation that was given by the defendant’s director, Fay Lee Lian, for this omission, was that “it was irrelevant”[^26] and she “didn’t \[want\] to irritate \[Jonathan Ng\]”.[^27] This explanation is unconvincing. I am of the view that it is more likely that the plaintiff was either lacking in its preparation for the trial or the evidence was not in favour of the plaintiff.

39     Fay Lee Lian further claimed that Travel GSH may not have bought from the defendant’s new employer because “maybe he got ample stock, he still got stock.”[^28] This shows that Travel GSH as well as the other customers of the plaintiff, may have not purchased from the plaintiff because they had sufficient stock or other reasons, rather than because the defendant had taken these customers to her new employer.

40     In the circumstances, the video evidence that the defendant had approached eight of the plaintiff’s customers does not necessarily mean that these customers had purchased from the defendant instead of the plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff’s statement of claim supports this position. Of the eight customers which the defendant was filmed approaching, only three of them, namely Auto Recovery Hub Pte Ltd, Carewell Auto Service and Dawn Engineering Works Pte Ltd, are amongst the 136 customers claimed by the plaintiff.[^29] The other five customers are not claimed by the plaintiff.[^30]

41     The plaintiff has referred to the Court of Appeal decision in _MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd v Fish & Co Restaurants Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 150</span> (“_MFM_”), in support of its claim for loss of sales based on 136 customers serviced exclusively by the defendant. In _MFM_, there was evidence of the trend in sales over three years, that enabled the difference between the actual and predicted gross sales to be computed (at \[68\]). In the present case, the plaintiff has simply compared the sales for only one year from May 2016 to April 2017, prior to the defendant’s resignation in May 2017, to the period thereafter, from May 2017 to March 2019.[^31]

42     I am of the view that _MFM_ may be distinguished as follows:

> (a)     There was expert evidence supporting the claim for loss of profits in _MFM_. In the present case, there is no such expert evidence.

> (b)     In the present case, the plaintiff relies on only one year of sales prior to the defendant leaving its employment, whereas in _MFM_, evidence was adduced showing the trend in sales over a few years.

> (c)     The present case involves a list of the plaintiff’s customers and whether the defendant had taken these customers from the plaintiff to her new employer, whereas in _MFM_, the claim did not involve specific customers.

43     The plaintiff has referred to the following extract from the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd_ \[2008\] 2 SLR (R) 623 at \[28\] that:

> The law, however, does not demand that the plaintiff prove with complete certainty the exact amount of damage that he has suffered.

44     However, the Court of Appeal further held at \[31\] that:

> … a plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for damages without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it has suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover damages. On the other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level best to prove its loss _and_ the evidence is cogent, the court should allow it to recover the damages claimed.

> \[Emphasis original\]

45     I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has attempted its level best to prove its loss in this case. Jonathan Ng from Travel GSH was the only customer of the plaintiff who gave evidence for the trial. It was open to the plaintiff to have either approached the other 136 customers to give evidence that they had purchased products from the defendant or her new employer, or subpoena the defendant’s new employer for evidence on which of these customers had been taken away by the defendant to her new employer. Although it may not be possible to obtain evidence from all 136 customers, at the very least, one would expect the plaintiff to have obtained evidence from a reasonable sample size of customers.

46     The plaintiff has not done so. Although the plaintiff’s former employee, Ho Choon Ni had approached seven of the plaintiff’s customers and took notes of her visit, Ho Choon Ni did not give evidence and none of the customers that she approached gave evidence. Only one customer, Jonathan Ng from Travel GSH, gave evidence to support the plaintiff’s case and his evidence did not show that Travel GSH had purchased products from the defendant or her new employer.

### Lack of documentary evidence

47     No documentary evidence was obtained from the customers claimed by the plaintiff, showing that they had purchased products from the defendant or her new employer, except for one invoice. This was an invoice for $540 obtained from Seah Kwang Seng Motor Services dated 29 August 2017, for lubricants purchased from Chuan Teng Petroleum Pte Ltd, with the salesperson named as Tina, the defendant.[^32] Although there are four other invoices obtained by the plaintiff,[^33] these relate to lubricants sold to Sia & Yeo Heavy Equipment Pte Ltd, which is not one of the 136 customers claimed by the plaintiff.[^34]

48     Accordingly, I am only prepared to award damages based on the loss arising from the sale to Seah Kwang Seng Motor Services evidenced by that one invoice for $540. In terms of the profit margin, I accept the plaintiff’s evidence of 30% profit margin, in the absence of any evidence from the defendant disputing this. Although there are no supporting documents produced by the plaintiff in support of this profit margin, there is nothing inherently unbelievable about the plaintiff’s evidence in this respect and there is no evidence from the defendant to dispute this.

49     In the premises, I awarded loss of profits based on the aforesaid invoice dated 29 August 2017 for the sum of $540 showing that Seah Kwang Seng Motor Services had purchased lubricants from Chuan Teng Petroleum Pte Ltd, with the salesperson named as Tina, the defendant.[^35] Based on a profit margin of 30%, the only loss that the plaintiff has successfully proven is $162 ($540 x 30%).

## Conclusion

50     In conclusion, in relation to the plaintiff’s claim for damages, judgment was entered for the sum of $162, together with interest at 5.33% per annum from the date of writ to the date of judgment.

51     In summary, the plaintiff succeeded in its claim for an injunction against the defendant and for damages in the sum of $162, together with interest.

52     After I delivered my judgment, counsel for the defendant disclosed that an Offer to Settle was made on 29 March 2018. As parties agreed that the Offer to Settle was more favourable than the judgment and that the bulk of the work done was after the Offer to Settle was served, I awarded costs in favour of the defendant.
