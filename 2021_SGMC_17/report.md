Civil Procedure – Setting aside of default judgment

Legal Profession – Bill for professional fees

26 March 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Teo Wei Ling:

## Introduction

1       The present action was commenced by the plaintiff, Ravindran Associates LLP (“RAL”) against the defendant, Sun Electric Pte Ltd (“SEPL”), for the recovery of legal costs amounting to a sum of $53,148.08. SEPL failed to enter an appearance and RAL obtained a judgment in default of appearance on 10 September 2020 (“Default Judgment”).

2       On 20 November 2020, SEPL filed the present application to set aside the Default Judgment (“Application”). Having considered the evidence and arguments, I am not satisfied that the matters raised by SEPL are sufficient to set aside the Default Judgment and I dismiss the Application. My reasons follow.

## Background

3       RAL represented SEPL in two patent infringement suits in the High Court, _viz_, Suit No. 1229 of 2016 and Suit No. 190 of 2018 (“the High Court Suits”). Between November 2019 and February 2020, RAL issued eight invoices (“the Invoices”) to SEPL, for professional fees for work done in the High Court Suits, including defending SEPL against two security for costs applications (“the SFC Applications”).

4       According to the affidavit filed on behalf of RAL dated 14 January 2021, RAL sent repeated reminders to SEPL to make payment of the Invoices but SEPL failed to make any payment. RAL eventually applied to discharge itself from continuing to act for SEPL in the High Court Suits.

5       After its discharge, RAL sent a letter of claim to SEPL on 1 July 2020 to demand payment of the Invoices. As no payment was made, RAL commenced the present action on 20 August 2020 to recover the amount of $53,148.08, being the total sum of the Invoices. On 31 August 2020, RAL served the writ on SEPL by leaving it at SEPL’s registered office.

6       No appearance was entered by SEPL, and on 10 September 2020, RAL obtained judgment in default of appearance for the sum of $53,148.08 (i.e. the Default Judgment). RAL sent a letter to SEPL’s registered address, which SEPL received on or about 25 September 2020, demanding payment pursuant to the Default Judgment. The next day, on 26 September 2020, SEPL filed a Notice of Appointment of solicitors. SEPL subsequently filed this Application to set aside the Default Judgment some 2 months later.

## SEPL’s contentions

7       In the affidavits filed by SEPL’s director, Mr Matthew Peloso (“Mr Peloso”), SEPL contended that the Default Judgment should be set aside because there are 5 triable issues, which I outline here:

> (a)     First, RAL had charged for work done before its appointment.

> (b)     Second, the Invoices were excessive.

> (c)     Third, before SEPL signed the warrant to act appointing RAL, SEPL was given to understand by RAL that the costs of defending the SFC Applications would not exceed $15,000.

> (d)     Fourth, SEPL wants RAL’s Invoices to be taxed. SEPL also asserted that RAL did not previously inform it of its right to apply for taxation.

> (e)     Finally, SEPL has a counterclaim for sums paid to RAL in excess of an alleged fee cap agreement, and for costs that SEPL will have to incur to engage new lawyers for the High Court Suits.

## Relevant legal principles

8       The law relating to the setting aside of default judgments was clarified in the seminal decision of the Court of Appeal in _Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 907</span> (“_Mercurine_”). In assessing whether a regular default judgment should be set aside, the appropriate test is whether a defendant can establish a _prima facie_ defence in the sense of showing that there were triable or arguable issues (_Mercurine_ at \[60\], citing _Evans v Bartlam_ <span class="citation">\[1937\] AC 473</span>). A triable issue exists where there are “merits to \[the defence\] which the Court should pay heed” (_Evans v Bartlam_ at 489).

9       The test is not stricter than that for obtaining leave to defend in a summary judgment application under Order 14 of the Rules of Court, even though the two applications are not perfect mirror images of each other (_Mercurine_ at \[60\]). In the context of an Order 14 application, a triable issue has been described by the High Court in _Wayne Burt Commodities Pte Ltd v Singapore DSS Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 70</span> (at \[7\]) as “not one which is either (a) inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents, or (b) inherently improbable in itself”.

10     However, this does not mean that any assertion in an affidavit will suffice to raise a triable issue. The defendant bears the burden of providing sufficient, although not necessarily conclusive evidence to anchor his putative defence, in order to persuade the court that the setting aside application is not merely one to delay or deny the execution of the judgment already obtained (_Hayate Investment Co Ltd v ManagementPlus (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHCR 3</span> (“_Hayate_”) at \[8\]).

11     At the end of the day, a setting aside application involves a balancing exercise in which the question of whether there is a defence on the merits is the dominant feature to be weighed against the applicant’s explanation both for the default and any delay, as well as against prejudice to the other party (_Mercurine_ at \[65\], citing _Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 673</span> at \[42\]–\[43\]).

## Were there triable issues?

### Taxation is the exclusive judicial recourse to challenge a solicitor’s bill

12     The main thrust of SEPL’s contentions and alleged triable issues was that SEPL disputed the quantum of legal fees billed in the Invoices.

13     Before delving into the merits of the triable issues raised by SEPL, I first address the question whether SEPL can even challenge the quantum of the Invoices when it has not applied for or obtained an order for taxation under section 122 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, Rev. Ed. 2009) (“LPA”) within the statutory time limit of 12 months from when the Invoices were issued.

14     On this point, RAL submitted that SEPL’s challenge of the quantum of the Invoices does not raise any triable issue because the only way to contest the quantum of the Invoices is pursuant to taxation under section 122 of the LPA, citing as authority the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Koh Kim Teck v Shook Lin & Bok LLP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 118</span> (at \[69\]) (“_Koh Kim Teck (CA)_”). RAL further submitted that as more than 12 months have passed since the Invoices were issued, SEPL is precluded from challenging the amounts claimed in the Invoices.

15     I find _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_ persuasive, and agree with RAL’s submission that taxation is the exclusive judicial recourse available to SEPL to challenge the quantum of RAL’s fees. In _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_, a law firm served a statutory demand (“SD”) for unpaid invoices on its former client. The Court of Appeal had to consider whether the former client could set aside the SD and challenge the lawyer’s bill notwithstanding his omission to seek taxation within the 1-year time limit under section 122 of the LPA. The Court of Appeal made clear that “taxation is the only judicial avenue for recourse available to the appellant to challenge the quantum of the respondent’s fees”, and there is “no twin track” to challenge a lawyer’s charges either by seeking taxation or by the common law right to defend. In the circumstances, the Court of Appeal held in _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_ that “as the appellant ha\[d\] not obtained an order for taxation, he \[wa\]s precluded from challenging the amount in the SD” (at \[69\]).

16     SEPL’s counsel sought to distinguish _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_ by arguing that the appellant in _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_ had sought an order for taxation to challenge the quantum of legal fees and did not appeal against the judge’s dismissal of his application for taxation out of time, whereas in this case, SEPL did not know about its right to taxation until its current solicitors were appointed. However, crucially, SEPL has not taken the position that it cannot or is not able to apply for taxation. Instead, during the hearing before me, counsel for SEPL candidly submitted that the reason why SEPL had not applied for taxation yet is because this Application is still pending, and there was “_no point_” in applying for taxation unless the Default Judgment was successfully set aside. I disagree with this submission. The Court of Appeal has made clear in _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_ that “\[t\]he common law right to defend is qualified by s 122 of the LPA”. Further, as Coomaraswamy J held in _Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 722</span> (“_Kosui_”) (at \[57\]), only taxation can yield for a client a refund or remission of overcharged fees. Therefore, insofar as SEPL intends to defend RAL’s claim for payment of the untaxed Invoices by challenging the quantum of the Invoices or legal fees payable to RAL, those are objections that should properly be raised in taxation proceedings.

17     Following the decision of _Koh Kim Teck (CA)_ and _Kosui_, since SEPL has not obtained an order for taxation, I find that it is precluded from challenging the amount claimed in the Default Judgment.

### The merits of SEPL’s defence

18     I now turn to examine the merits of the 5 triable issues alleged by SEPL.

19     First, while Mr Peloso alleged on affidavit that RAL had charged for work done before its appointment, SEPL did not pursue this point in submissions or at the hearing. In any event, this allegation was clearly inconsistent with the Invoices, which were dated in 2019 and 2020 after RAL’s appointment in 2015, and this does not raise any triable issue.

20     Second, SEPL submitted that the Invoices were excessive because although the issues in the two SFC Applications were largely similar and the party-and-party costs for the two SFC Applications had been fixed at $20,000 collectively, RAL had charged SEPL $19,946 for one of the SFC Applications and $19,701 for the other. In my view, issuing a fee bill for a sum larger than the amount of party-and-party costs obtained does not necessarily suggest that the bill is excessive, and is not uncommon. In any event, as abovementioned, any challenge as to the quantum of the Invoices should be brought in taxation, and since SEPL has not done so, it is precluded from challenging the amount of the Invoices. Allowing SEPL to defend against the Default Judgment by challenging the amount of the Invoices would amount to a backdoor attempt to tax the Invoices. For these reasons, SEPL’s claim that the Invoices were excessive raises no triable issue.

21     Third, Mr Peloso claimed that before he signed the appointment letter and warrant to act appointing RAL in the High Court Suits, he “was given to understand by Mr Ravindran of \[RAL\] that the costs of defending the \[SFC Applications\] would not exceed $15,000”, and Mr Ravindran (the managing partner of RAL) assured him that SEPL would prevail in defending the SFC Applications, “\[h\]ence, \[SEPL\] appointed \[RAL\]”. However, these contentions fail for the simple reason that the SFC Applications were filed in 2019, long after SEPL appointed RAL in 2015. As RAL submitted, it was “impossible” for RAL’s Mr Ravindran to make the alleged representation and assurance leading to RAL’s appointment, given that the SFC Applications were not in existence in 2015. Even if I find that RAL made the alleged representation and assurance in relation to the costs of defending the SFC Applications, this issue again goes towards SEPL’s challenge of the quantum of the Invoices. Any challenge as to the quantum of the Invoices should be brought in taxation rather than as a defence against the Default Judgment, and no triable issue is raised.

22     Fourth, SEPL asserted that RAL did not inform SEPL of its right to apply for taxation when a dispute on RAL’s Invoices previously arose, and argued that it wants RAL’s Invoices to be taxed. In this regard, SEPL and RAL took conflicting positions as to whether SEPL raised a dispute on the Invoices to RAL prior to filing the Application, and whether there was a need for RAL to inform SEPL of its right to have the Invoices taxed. However, without going into parties’ detailed submissions, I find that SEPL’s assertions do not raise any triable issues because SEPL is still able to apply for taxation of the Invoices now. On its own case, SEPL’s submitted that it can still apply for taxation out of time due to special circumstances, notwithstanding the expiry of the 12- month limitation period.

23     Finally, SEPL submitted that it has a counterclaim against RAL for amounts allegedly paid in excess of a fee cap agreement. SEPL also alleged that it has a claim for costs that SEPL will have to incur to engage new lawyers to represent it in the High Court Suits. SEPL and RAL have differing positions as to the scope of the fee agreement, and how much SEPL had paid to RAL under the said fee agreement. SEPL claims it paid RAL at least $412,249.65, which was $62,249.65 more than the alleged fee cap of $350,000, whereas RAL claims only at least $178,000 were paid under the fee cap. Regardless, SEPL’s counterclaim for monies paid in excess of the alleged fee cap agreement is, at its essence, a challenge to the quantum of RAL’s legal fees, which should properly be brought in taxation proceedings rather than as a defence against the Default Judgment, and I find that no triable issue is raised. As for SEPL’s claim for costs to engage new lawyers in the High Court Suits due to RAL’s discharge, this claim is in effect a counterclaim against RAL for damages rather than a defence against RAL’s claim for payment of the Invoices. In this regard, a counterclaim is not synonymous with a defence, and therefore SEPL’s arguments in this respect are untenable.

24     For the reasons above, I am not satisfied that SEPL has raised any genuine triable issues.

## Conclusion

25     For the foregoing reasons, the Application is dismissed. I will hear parties on the issue of costs, unless otherwise agreed.
