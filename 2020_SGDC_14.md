### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The accused person, Ong Han Seng (“Ong”) pleaded guilty to one charge under s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4)(b) of the Massage Establishment Act 2017 (Act 45 of 2017)(“MEA 2017”). The charge (DCN 900043/18) alleged that Ong had carried on the business of providing massage services in an establishment for massage without a licence issued under the MEA 2017. The establishment was also not exempted under s 32 of the MEA 2017.

2       The accused person Choo Kon Ying (“Choo”) pleaded guilty to one charge under s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4)(a) of the MEA 2017. The charge (MCN 902143/18) alleged that Choo had carried on the business of providing massage services in an establishment for massage without a licence issued under the MEA 2017. The establishment was also not exempted under s 32 of the MEA 2017.

3       Ong and Choo were husband and wife.

## THE FACTS

4       Both Ong and Choo were in charge of operating the premises at ‘Monte Spa’, located at No. 181 Kitchener Road #06-11, Parkroyal Hotel. Ong was the director of the Spa. Choo managed its daily operations which included operating as the cashier, overseeing its accounts and logistics and employing the staff ie masseuses.

5       On 3 May 18, at about 4.55 pm, a party of police officers conducted a check at the premises of ‘Monte Spa’. During the check, the officers found a male customer with a female masseuse in a partitioned room (Room No. 2) at the spa. He was receiving a body massage from the masseuse.

6       Prior to the checks conducted by the police, the male customer had arrived at the Spa. Choo who was manning the counter had greeted him. She had shown him photographs of three masseuses and asked him to choose one. He was offered a 40-minute body massage for S$50. After the customer had made payment, he was led into the room. The female masseuse had then entered the room, took off her pants and whilst wearing her panties, had climbed on top of the customer and massaged him for about five minutes before the party of police officers arrived. It was further revealed that during the customer’s prior visits, the same masseuse had offered and provided him with masturbation services and topless massages for S$80-S$100.

7       Ong and Choo was not issued with any valid massage establishment licence to provide massage services. As the massage was not done in full public view, ‘Monte Spa’ was not exempted under the Massage Establishments (Exemption) Order 2018.

8       Before the commission of this offence, Ong had been convicted on 29 Jun 16 for an offence under s 9(a) of the Massage Establishment Act (Cap 173)(“MEA 2013”). He was therefore liable to the enhanced punishment under s 5(4)(b) of the MEA 2017.

9       Choo has a previous conviction on 23 Sep 10 for an offence under s 9(d) of the MEA 2013. She was not liable for the enhanced punishment.

## DPP’S SENTENCING SUBMISSION

10     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment for Ong, and at least two months for Choo.

## The legislative intent behind MEA 2017

11     The DPP set out the legislative history of the MEA 2017. It repealed and re-enacted the MEA 2013. The date of commencement was 1 March 2018. The most significant changes in the MEA 2017 was the prescribed punishments for the offence of carrying on the business of providing massage services without a licence were enhanced. Under the repealed s 9(a) of the MEA 2013, the maximum punishment was a fine of S$1000. Under MEA 2017, the punishment was increased to a fine not exceeding S$10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding two years or both, for a first offender (s 5(4)(a) MEA 2017), and a fine not exceeding S$20,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years or both, for a second or repeat offender (s 5(4)(b) MEA 2017).

12     The legislative intent behind the significant inflation in the punishments were clear, which was to take strong action and deter offenders, especially those who repeatedly use unlicensed establishments as a front for vice activities. The DPP cited excerpts from the Parliamentary debates evidencing this intention –

> “The Massage Establishments Act regulates massage establishments, by licensing the operators and imposing conditions on their activities. The aim is to prevent massage establishments from being used for _vice activities_, or causing law and order problems.

> MHA has reviewed the massage establishment regulatory regime to ensure that it remains effective in the changing landscape. Under the enhanced regime, we will take tougher action against unlicensed massage establishments.

> There is a clear case for action. Between 2013 and 2016, there was a 40% increase in the number of unlicensed massage establishments detected by the Police.

> Many of these were not in fact massage establishments but _fronts for vice activities_, the proverbial “wolf in sheep’s clothing”…”[^1]

> (Emphasis added by DPP)

> “Today, the penalty for unlicensed massage establishment operations is a maximum fine of $1,000. This is _grossly insufficient_ compared to the profits that unlicensed massage establishments can make, especially by engaging in _vice activities_.

> Clause 5 of the Bill increases the penalty for operating unlicensed massage establishments _to a maximum fine of $10,000 or two years’ imprisonment or both_.

> For repeat offenders, the punishment will increase to a maximum fine of $20,000 or five years’ imprisonment or both.

> The significantly higher fines and the inclusion of imprisonment as a punishment will be a _stronger deterrent_.

> If the unlicensed massage establishment also engages in vice activities, the operator can be liable for additional vice-related offences under the Women’s Charter. The enhanced penalties will ensure that unlicensed massage establishment operators face _serious consequences upon conviction_.”[^2]

> (Emphasis added by DPP)

## Prosecution’s proposed sentencing band framework

13     As the MEA 2017 was a new legislation, and to adequately address Parliament’s intention, the DPP proposed that the court adopted a sentencing band approach when sentencing offenders for offences punishable under 5(4)(a) and s 5(4)(b). The sentencing band proposed would apply to plead guilty cases, and with the necessary adjustments to be made for claim trial cases.

14     The proposed sentencing bands for ss 5(4)(a) and (b) of the MEA 2017 is reproduced below –

15     The DPP explained that the phrase “vice activity” in Tables 1 and 2 included offering or providing sexual services; engaging in any indecent act; or being dressed in an indecent manner, such that it may reasonably be inferred that sexual services would be offered/provided or an indecent act would be engaged in.

16     The DPP highlighted that the sentencing ranges in the two tables have been calibrated to cover the full sentencing spectrum prescribed by Parliament. The custodial threshold should be crossed in egregious cases where vice activity is detected at the premises despite the offender having been previously convicted for a vice-related offence. This is necessary to address both specific and general deterrence.

## The methodology

17     The DPP then explained the methodology of applying the proposed sentencing bands. The first step was to identify which band the offence fell into. In determining this, the court should have regard to two things, (i) whether vice activity was detected at the premises which the offender would have been aware of if he had exercised reasonable care and diligence, and (ii) whether the offender had previously been convicted for vice-related offences.

18     The second step was to determine where the sentence should fall within that sentencing band. In doing this, the court must have regard to the presence of any culpability-increasing factors. The DPP then listed out the culpability-increasing factors that should increase the sentence from the starting point of the relevant sentencing band -

> (a)     Actual knowledge of vice activity detected at the premises. This would include wilful blindness.

> (b)     Massage establishment located in or near residential premises. This was because of potential dis-amenities occasioned to residents.

> (c)     Actual dis-amenities caused to residents.

> (d)     Any other non-vice related but relevant antecedents, for example, convictions for other specified offences under the Schedule to the MEA 2017.

> (e)     Other charges under the MEA 2017 or the Massage Establishment Rules 2018 that were taken into consideration.

> (f)     Larger scale and/or higher level of sophistication of operations.

> (g)     Long duration for which massage establishment was operating without a licence.

> (h)     Evidence of syndicate involvement.

19     The Court might take into account any mitigating factors. For the present case, the learned DPP submitted that no further discount should be given for the guilty plea as the sentencing bands were premised on a guilty plea situation.

## Application of framework to present case

20     In relation to Ong, the DPP submitted that his case fell into sentencing band 3 of Table 2 for the following reasons –

> (i)     He has a relatively recent previous conviction in 2016 for operating an unlicensed massage establishment. For this offence, the establishment had also provided sexual services to its customers.

> (ii)     For the present offence, there was vice activity detected at the premises. Despite his previous conviction, he had not exercise due diligence or taken reasonable care to prevent this. Instead, he had left the day-to-day operation of the premises to Choo. He only visited the premise once a month.

21     The starting point for band 3 was four months’ imprisonment. However, the DPP submitted that an uplift was warranted in light of the following culpability-enhancing factors –

> (i)     The premises was located in a hotel, and close to popular public amenities such as the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple and Citi Square Mall which were about 250 metres away.

> (ii)     The premises had operated without a licence for about two years, since October 2016.

> (iii)     The relatively short lapse of time between Ong’s previous conviction and his present offence.

22     In relation to Choo, the DPP also submitted that her case fell into sentencing band 3 in Table 1, for the following reasons –

> (i)     She has an antecedent for a vice-related offence in 2010 ie for operating a massage establishment that provided sexual services, in breach of its licensing condition.

> (ii)     Vice activity was detected in the present offence. She was involved in the daily management of the Spa and its staff. Yet she did not take steps to ensure that sexual services were not provided, despite her previous transgression with the law.

> (iii)     Condoms were found in the staff room, inviting the inference that sexual activity was not uncommon in the Spa. She was patently negligent in allowing the Spa to be used as a front for vice activity.

23     The starting point for band 3 was at least 2 months’ imprisonment. The DPP submitted that an uplift was warranted given the presence of the culpability-enhancing factors as set out in \[21(i)\] and \[21(ii)\] above.

## PLEA IN MITIGATION

24     In his mitigation, Counsel highlighted that Monte Spa was established in October 2016 to provide beauty services. Ong then arranged with the Parkroyal Hotel to provide spa services for hotel club members at Monte Spa from October 2017. Choo was primarily a homemaker. She was only involved in the operations side of things at the Spa. She was not involved in the decision-making process. She was not aware that condoms were kept in the staff room.

25     Counsel pointed out that Monte Spa was not intended to be a massage establishment. He disputed the suggestion that it was a front for vice activity. In the present case, the customer had made the request for massage services and the other services directly with the masseuse. Both the accused persons were not involved in the offer and provision of vice activity at Monte Spa.

26     Monte Spa had provided massage services for about seven months until the notice under s 28 of the MEA 2017 led to the early termination of its lease. This has resulted in financial loss that exceeded the profit or benefit obtained.

27     Counsel also submitted that no actual or potential disturbance or disruption was caused. As such, the proximity to a temple became irrelevant. There was no syndicate involvement. The duration of operation was not long. It was a small operation and was not sophisticated in nature.

28     Counsel made some criticisms of the prosecution’s proposed sentencing bands. These were –

> (i)     The sentencing framework should operate on the basis of a claim trial situation so that a discount could be applied for plead guilty cases. The approach adopted by the prosecution could be perceived as penalising offenders who claim trial.

> (ii)     There was a glaring gap between bands 2 and 3 in both tables for cases that might cross the custodial threshold, but did not warrant the two-month or four-month imprisonment sentences.

> (iii)     The framework hinged on the presence of vice activity or vice-related antecedents. There was however inadequate consideration given to whether the offender was actually aware or was involved with the vice activity.

> (iv)     The framework did not adequately consider profit/benefit from the massage services or vice activity. In the absence of such evidence, it should not be assumed that there was profit/benefit thereby warranting a custodial sentence.

29     Counsel pointed out that in relation to Ong, he was fined $800 in 2016 for the same offence under the repealed Act. To mete out a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the present offence would constitute a wholly disproportionate enhancement of sentence. Similarly, for Choo, the proposed sentence of two months’ imprisonment would be crushing given that she was fined $500 for an offence of a similar nature in 2010. He submitted that a fine, up to the maximum prescribed for both accused persons, would constitute an effective deterrence given that the maximum fine amount prescribed had been enhanced by more than 20 times.

## THE SENTENCE

30     During sentencing, I delivered a short oral remarks which was reproduced in full below –

> “Both accused persons have been convicted on offences under MEA 2017. The MEA 2017 showed significant enhancement in the punishment provisions. The fines were upped 10 times for first offenders, and 20 times for repeat offenders. Unlike the repealed MEA 2013, there is now also provisions for imprisonment - up to two years for first offenders and five years for repeat offenders.

> 2    The enhanced punishment provisions is targeted at unlicensed massage establishments, and in particular those massage establishments that engages in vice activities. This is in view of the lucrative nature of the business, and more significantly, the marked increase in the number of unlicensed massage establishments (ie 40% between 2013 and 2016), and the fact that many of these unlicensed massage establishments were fronts for vice activities.

> 3    On that note, I am of the view that deterrence is the dominant sentence consideration, and in particular, specific deterrence, because Ong is a repeat offender, and Choo, though a first offender vis-à-vis the MEA 2017 offence, has a previous conviction in relation to a MEA 2013 offence that involved vice activity.

> 4    In evaluating the seriousness of the offences, I would have regard to the harm-culpability matrix. Harm is a measure of the injury caused to society by the criminal act. Culpability is the degree of relative blameworthiness of the accused persons ie the extent and manner of their involvement in the criminal act: _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> at \[41\].

> 5    In this case, I adopted the sentencing matrix framework in _Ng Kean Meng Terrence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span>. This framework assesses the seriousness of the offence by reference to all the offence-specific factors - which go to the offender’s culpability and the harm caused - rather than just the principal factual elements.

> 6    I assessed Ong’s culpability as medium. Ong was negligent in that he did not exercise reasonable care and diligence to ensure that there was no vice activity going on in the massage establishment. This negligence is more egregious in light of his similar previous conviction. Other than performing perfunctory visits to the massage establishment once a month, he left the operation and management of the massage establishment entirely to Choo. I assessed Choo’s culpability as medium-high. She was involved in the day-to-day business operations and management of the massage establishment. Yet she allowed the vice activities to go on right under her nose. Given her antecedent in 2010 for breaching the licensing conditions of her massage establishment where sexual service was provided, she was grossly negligent in not ensuring that sexual activities were not provided in the present case.

> 7    As for harm, I assessed it to be medium for both. There were vice activities involving body massage and masturbation. Although the massage establishment was near a place of worship, it was located in a hotel in a commercial area, and not in a residential estate. There is no evidence that the sexual activities have caused law and order problems in the area. There is also no evidence that the massage establishment was primarily used as a front for vice activities. On the duration in which the massage establishment was in business, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I accepted the defence’s submission that the massage establishment has only been in operation for seven months, and not since 2016 as alleged by the prosecution.

> 8    In determining the indicative sentencing range, I take guidance from the sentencing band framework proposed by the prosecution as well as the framework laid down for s 148 Women’s Charter offences: _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span>. These Women’s Charter offences are analogous to the MEA 2017 offences before me.

> 9    On account of the offence-specific factors, the public interest viz the actual or potential harm that can be done to society, and the high incidence of these offences, the custody threshold is crossed. I generally agree with the indicative sentencing range proposed by the prosecution.

> 10    On the offender-specific mitigating factors, their plea of guilty is noted, although the weight attached to it is reduced on account of the clear evidence against them. There is no other significant offender-specific mitigating factor. The fact that the accused persons have suffered financial loss because of the early termination of the lease because of this case is neutral at best.

> 11    On the offender-specific aggravating factors, Ong is a repeat offender, while Choo has a similar antecedent. For Ong, the previous conviction was a very recent one in 2016. Choo’s antecedent was in 2010.

> 12    Two cases involving repeat offenders under the MEA 2017 were cited. In _PP v Tan Jee Seng_ (DCN 900008/19), the accused person was convicted on two MEA 2017 charges, one of which involved vice activity. He had seven previous convictions, one of which had involved vice activity. He was sentenced to 13 weeks’ imprisonment for the charge involving vice activity. His case is more egregious as he was convicted on two charges, and has numerous similar previous convictions. In _PP v Nguyen Thi Thoa_ (MAC 909209/19), the accused person was convicted on one charge and was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. She had one similar conviction involving vice activity in 2017. Nguyen’s case is more closely aligned to the case before me.

> 13    All considered, I sentence Ong to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. As for Choo, I sentence her to two weeks’ imprisonment.”

31     As I had stated in my oral remarks (at \[8\]), I used the proposed sentencing band framework as a guide. I would agree that both Ong and Choo fell into band 3. And I would agree in principle that the custody threshold would have been crossed at band 3. However, I disagreed with the starting points proposed by the DPP. I agreed with the observations of DC that there seemed to be an inordinate jump from fines in band 2 to imprisonment in band 3 of two months for s 5(4)(a) and four months for s 5(4)(b). I would think that the starting point for band 3 should theoretically start from one day’s imprisonment upwards. I have to determine where within this sentencing range the present cases lie.

32     In dealing with this question, I had drawn a comparison with the sentencing framework for the offence of managing a brothel under s 148(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) set out in the case of _PP v Poh Boon Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> (“_Poh Boon Kiat_”) at \[78\] of the judgment. This was because the s 148(1) offence was the closest in analogy to offences under MEA 2017 in the present cases where vice activity were detected. The significant difference was that for a s 148(1) offence, the offender was guilty of the offence of managing a brothel so long as he knew that the establishment was being used as one or if he allowed the continued use of the establishment as a brothel. There must be actual knowledge. In the present cases, the two accused persons had been negligent in not ensuring that vice activity did not take place.

33     The prescribed punishment for the s 148(1) offence was a fine not exceeding $3000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both. _Poh Boon Kiat_ involved charges under ss 140, 146 and 148(1) of the Women’s Charter. In the appeal, the learned Chief Justice found the accused person’s culpability to be moderate and the harm to be low-moderate. The indicative range for this level of culpability and harm was a fine of $3000 up to nine months’ imprisonment, with the starting point at three months’ imprisonment. The Chief Justice applied the sentencing framework, and concluded that the appropriate sentence for the s 148(1) offence should be four months’ imprisonment. However, given the unique circumstances of the case, the learned Chief Justice invoked the principle of prospective ruling, and imposed a sentence of two months’ imprisonment instead.

34     Using the four months’ imprisonment sentence in _Poh Boon Kiat_ as a rough guide, and taking into account the sentence imposed in _Nyugen Thi Thao_ (at \[12\] of my oral remarks), I was of the view that the sentences of 10 weeks’ imprisonment for Ong, and two weeks’ imprisonment for Choo, were appropriate.

35     Both the defence and prosecution have filed appeals against the sentences. Ong and Choo are on bail pending appeal.
