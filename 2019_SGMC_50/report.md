\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9061/2019/01.\]

27 August 2019

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

Mr Goh Boon Hong (Goh) and Mr Teo Kye Hwee, Tony (Teo) pleaded guilty to two charges respectively of making a statement which was false in a material particular to the Controller of Work Passes when they falsely declared the monthly salary to be paid to one Mr Arulsamy Andrewstalin (Arulsamy) and Mr Savari Muthu Titus Arun Prasadh (Savari) in connection with an application for an S-Pass for Arulsamy and Savari. I sentenced Goh and Teo to pay a fine of $15,000 per charge. Both Goh and Teo have paid their fines. The Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentences imposed on both Goh and Teo and has appealed.

2       As the cases against Goh and Teo are very closely connected, this Grounds of Decision will deal with my reasons for imposing the sentences against Goh and Teo respectively. I would also note that Goh and Teo were sentenced before the decision in _Chiew Kok Chai v Public Prosecutor[^1]_ was made. As such, this decision was made without the benefit of Justice Aedit Abdullah’s grounds of decision in _Chiew Kok Chai._

## PROCEEDED CHARGES

## THE FACTS

5       In January 2014, an employment agent, Pandiselve d/o Parianani Rajo (Pandiselve) was engaged by Te Deum Engineering Pte Ltd (Te Deum) to source for workers. Goh informed that Te Deum did not have sufficient quota for work permit holders and that the company could not afford to employ S-Pass holders. Pandiselve then recommended Arulsamy and Savari to Goh and suggested that the company apply for S-Passes for the two workers and subsequently finalise the salaries with them. Goh informed the Teo of the plan to apply for S-Passes for Arulsamy and Savari with a declared salary of $2,400 but that they would only be paid $1,300. Teo agreed to the plan and Goh directed Pandiselve to apply for S-Passes.

6       When they arrived in Singapore in February 2914, Goh then informed Arulsamy and Savari that the company would apply for S-Passes for them but that their monthly salary would be $1,350 and that the excess amount that they were paid had to be returned to the company. Arulsamy and Savari agreed with the arrangement.

7       On 6th February, Teo, a director of Te Deum and in his capacity as an officer of Te Deum, consented to the company making two statements that were false in a material particular to the Controller of Work Passes in the applications for S-Passes made on behalf of Arulsamy and Savari. The company declared that the fixed monthly salary to be paid to both Arulsamy and Savari would be $2,400 when Teo knew that the actual salary to be paid would be lower. Teo authorised Te Deum’s sales manager, Jessica Chia Siew Yean (Jessica) to sign the forms declaring that the fixed monthly salary would be $2,400.

8       As a result of the false statements, S-Passes were issued to Arulsamy and Savari. It is a key criterion for the granting of an S-Pass that the applicants meet the minimum salary requirement and, as such, the declared salary was a material consideration used by the Work Pass Division (WPD) of MOM in determining whether to grant a work pass.

9       Over a period from February 2014 to December 2015, Arulsamy and Savari were paid the salary declared as part of the S-Pass application but, in conforming with the arrangement they had with Goh, would repay $1,050 per month to the Te Deum. Te Deum had since made full restitution of the underpayment to Arulsamy and Savari

## CHARGE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENTENCING

10     Goh and Teo admitted to and consented to having another three charges respectively taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These were charges for offences under section 22(1)(d) EFMA. Two charges related to further false statements in connection with Arulsamy and one charge related to a further false statement in connection with Savari.

## ANTECEDENTS

11     Neither Goh nor Teo had any previous convictions.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION

12     The Prosecuting Officer, Ms Shanti Priya (Ms Priya), sought a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment per charge for both Goh and Teo and submitted that I should run both sentences consecutively for a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

13     Ms Priya submitted that in past cases involving offences under section 22(1)(d) EFMA of making false statements, of the type in this case, the State Courts had imposed fines between $7,500 and $9,000. Ms Priya submitted that the practice of imposing fines was inadequate in view of Parliament’s clearly stated intention that a firm stance should be taken against employers who commit offences under the EFMA. She submitted that the custodial threshold for such offences would be crossed if the application for the work pass “_would not have been granted but for the falsehood_”.

14     Ms Priya referred to the case of _Abu Sayeed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor[^2]_ to support her submission that a custodial sentence should be the norm for false declaration cases under section 22(1)(d) EFMA as the offences were similar in nature to offences under section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act. She pointed out that in _Chowdhury_, Chief Justice Yong Pung How had found that in determining the culpability of an accused the Court should have regard to: (i) the materiality of the false representation; (ii) the nature and extent of the deception; (iii) the consequences of the deception; and (iv) the accused’s personal mitigating factors. Generally, custodial sentences would be the starting point, for offences under 57(1)(k), where the false statement was material.

15     Ms Priya submitted that a custodial sentence was also warranted as there was appreciable harm caused to the integrity of the workpass framework in that there was investigative expenditure used to uncover and address offences such as those in the present case. She also stated that there was a degree of financial exploitation of Arulsamy and Savari, as both of them only became aware that they would receive a lower salary after they had arrived in Singapore and had no choice but to acquiesce.

16     Ms Priya then proposed that the Court adopt a sentencing framework based on a two-step process involving the assessment of offence-specific and offender-specific factors.

17     I do not intend to dwell on the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework, except to consider the factors that the Prosecution relied upon to ground their submission on sentence, as I was in agreement with the submissions put forward by both Defence Counsels that it was not appropriate for this Court to propose or endorse the Prosecution’s sentencing framework and that this was more properly a task for the High Court.

18     Ms Priya submitted that the false statement made in this case “_relating to the salaries of the two employees were material_” and that if the work actual salaries had been declared the employees would not have been granted the S-Passes. She submitted that the consequences of the deception were that Te Deum had financially benefited from lower costs based on the lower salaries. In addition, Te Deum had benefited in that it was able to employ workers despite not having the requisite work permit quota by falsely declaring that the Arulsamy and Savari would be working in jobs that would require S-Pass holders.

19     Ms Priya suggested that there was planning on Teo’s part as he had made the decision on behalf of Te Deum knowing full well that the workers would not be paid the declared salary and that he had authorised another employee, Jessica, to falsely declare their salaries. Ms Priya submitted that the offences had been maintained for a prolonged period of two years. Finally, she submitted that Goh and Teo had made detection of the offences more difficult as they had credited the actual declared salary of $2,400 to Arulsamy’s and Savari’s bank accounts and then subsequently clawed back the excess that was paid to them.

20     With regard to offence-specific factors, Ms Priya submitted that the TIC charges were an aggravating factor and that Goh’s and Teo’s cooperation with the authorities, the fact that full restitution had been made, their respective plea of guilty and that they were untraced were mitigating factors.

21     Finally, Ms Priya submitted statistics to show that whilst the number of section 22(1)(d) offences were generally declining from 2015 to 2017, there had been a steady increase in false declaration of salary cases over the same period.

## MITIGATION

## A.   Goh Boon Hong

22     Goh’s Defence Counsel, Mr Calvin Liang (“Mr Liang”), submitted that Goh should be sentenced to a fine.

23     Mr Liang submitted that it was not appropriate for a Court of First Instance to clarify or establish a sentencing framework. He referred to the case of _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor[^3]_, where the Court of Appeal held at \[67\]:

> “Relatedly, since the court establishing a new sentencing framework will likely be an appellate court, the doctrine of prospective overruling will likewise most likely arise for consideration by an appellate court. This is consistent with the exceptionality of the doctrine and our decision in Hue An Li … that the discretion to prospectively overrule lies with “\[o\]ur appellate courts (that is, our High Court sitting in its appellate capacity and our Court of Appeal)” … It would probably be a rare case where a first instance court, whether the High Court sitting in its original criminal jurisdiction or the a State Court, has to calibrate a sentencing framework for the first time and must therefore consider the prospectivity of the framework laid down. **Such a situation should be generally avoided**” \[**Emphasis mine**\]

24     Mr Liang submitted that the rational for this was because the calibration of a sentencing framework would inevitably require a consideration of whether the framework should apply prospectively. He further stated that the Prosecution, in their own submissions, had acknowledged that the sentencing norm for these offences had, until recently, been fines.

25     On the basis of the decision in _Adri Anton Kalangie_, and as I have stated above, I was fully in agreement with Mr Liang’s submission on this point. I did not think that it was appropriate for me to either endorse the Prosecution’s sentencing framework or establish a sentencing framework, especially in light of the existing sentencing practice which had been to generally impose non-custodial sentences for offences under section 22(1)(d) that involved the false declaration of a worker’s salary.

26     Mr Liang submitted that a custodial sentence would be disproportionate and crushing when the Court considered the role Goh’s culpability and the mitigating factors. Mr Liang stated that Goh was a merely loyal employee who had been working for Teo. He stated that Goh was not the directing mind behind this scheme and had instead taken instructions from Te Deum’s management. Goh had not personally profit from the offence. Mr Liang also submitted that Goh was the sole provider for his family and that a heavy fine would be more than a slap on the wrist for him.

27     Mr Liang also addressed recent cases involving offences under section 22(1)(d) that had been decided in the State Courts, and where custodial sentences had been imposed, and distinguished these cases from the present case. He submitted that Goh’s culpability was far lower than the accused in _Chiew Kok Chai_ because in that case there was real exploitation of the foreign workers as their salaries were unpaid, the accused had deliberately committed the offences in order to circumvent MOM’s freezing of the company’s foreign manpower quota, he had deliberately employed the worker’s despite the knowledge that the company was facing financial difficulties and would be unable to pay the salaries. Finally, the accused in _Chiew Kok Chai_ was the directing mind behind the scheme.

28     Referring to the other precedent cases, Mr Liang submitted that these could be distinguished from the present case because the accused in those precedents had personally benefited from the offence and/or engaged in vice activities and/or were directors of the employer company.

29     Mr Liang also submitted that Te Deum was facing existential challenges to it business as a result of the slowdown in the construction sector and a labour crunch. I do not intend to dwell on this submission in any great detail as I did not accept that these were mitigating factors that would provide any justification for commission of the offence.

30     Mr Liang also specifically took exception with the Prosecution’s reliance on the materiality of the falsehood as the threshold factor in determining whether a custodial sentence was warranted. Mr Liang pointed out that the materiality of the false statement was an element of the charge. This would lead to a situation where all offences under section 22(1)(d) would merit a custodial sentence as a starting point and that there would be no room for the imposition of a fine.

31     Mr Liang cautioned the Court against relying on sentencing precedents for offences under section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act, section 182 of the Penal Code and section 39(1) of the Passports Act as these offences had different policy objectives.

32     Finally, Mr Liang submitted that there was no exploitation of the workers and that full restitution of the clawed back salary had been paid to both workers.

## B.   Teo Kye Hwee Tony

33     Counsel for Teo Ms Marina Chin (Ms Chin) submitted that the sentencing norm for offences under section 22(1)(d) EFMA involving false salary declarations was a fine and she submitted a table showing that the State Courts had consistently imposed fines for these offences.

34     Ms Chin distinguished the present case from _Public Prosecutor v Nallusamy Narayanan_ which she stated was the only, reported case, where the Court had imposed a custodial sentence. _Nallusamy_ involved five companies 25 workers and multiple false declarations of salaries. The Court had found that the number of affected victims was an aggravating factor. Further the Court had held that the accused in _Nallusamy_ had threatened the foreign workers with cancellation of their work passes and repatriation to their home countries if they refused to accept a lower salary. This was clear exploitation of the workers. Ms Chin submitted that in the present case involved only two workers and there was no suggestion of threats or deceit used against the two workers.

35     Ms Chin also distinguished the facts in _Chiew Kok Chai_ from the present case. In that case it was found that the accused faced three section 22(1)(d) charges with another two being taken into consideration for sentencing. The accused also faced additional charges under section 5(1) and 22A(1)(b) EFMA for failure to pay workers’ salaries and for deducting sums from the salaries as a condition of their continued employment. In that case the accused was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. The Court had also found that the accused had deliberately committed the offences in order to circumvent MOM’s freezing of his company’s foreign manpower quota and that he had employed the workers knowing that there would be issues with paying their salaries as his company was already facing financial difficulties. The Court found, on the facts, that a fine would not have a deterrent effect and imposed a custodial sentence.

36     Similar to the submissions on behalf of Goh, Ms Chin submitted that it was erroneous for the Prosecution to rely on the sentencing norms for offences under other statutes, in particular the Immigration Act, Penal Code, Passports Act and Medical Registration Act, to ground their submission for a new sentencing framework for offences.

37     Ms Chin submitted that it would also be wrong in principle for the Court to adopt a new sentencing framework imposing a custodial sentence as the norm. She submitted that whilst deterrence may be the primary sentencing consideration, a deterrent sentence did not need to always take the form of a custodial sentence. Ms Chin echoed Mr Liang’s submission that relying on the materiality of the falsehood as a threshold requirement to determine whether the custodial threshold had been crossed was similarly wrong in principle as the materiality of the falsehood was an element of the charge for an offence under section 22(1)(d) EFMA.

38     Finally, Ms Chin submitted that there were considerable mitigating factors that would warrant a non-custodial sentence. First, full restitution had been made to Arulsamy and Savari. Second, Teo did not reap any personal financial benefit from the false declarations. Third, Teo had cooperated fully with the investigation and had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity. Fourth, Teo was not the mastermind of the deception. Instead, Ms Chin submitted that Te Deum relied heavily on Pandiselve for advice on hiring foreign workers. Fifth, Ms Chin submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any deceit or threat involved in the payment of monies to either of the workers and that both were treated well as employees. Finally, Ms Chin submitted that Teo had an otherwise clean record.

## PRECEDENTS

39     The Prosecution and the Defence submitted various recent precedent cases under section 22(1)(b) EFMA:

> a.     In _Public Prosecutor v Kadarmeeran Nabishabegum[^4]_, the accused had abetted one Vijayakumar Ramesh to make a false statement that she would be working for Vijaykumar as a foreign domestic worker (FDW) when she had not such intent. Instead she worked as a freelance FDW and also engaged in vice activities for about a month. She was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment. I found that the accused’s culpability in _Kadarmeeran_ was greater than either Goh’s or Teo’s culpability because the accused had abetted in the false statement for a financial benefit and during that time had engaged in vice activities.

> b.     In _Public Prosecutor v Vijayakumar Ramesh[^5]_, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge stating that Kadarmeeran would be working for him as a FDW when he had no intention to employ her as such. He was sentenced to five weeks’ imprisonment. I found that the accused’s culpability in _Vijayakumar_ was greater than either Goh’s or Teo’s culpability because as a consequence of his false statement Kadarmeeran was able to engage in vice activities.

> c.     In _Public Prosecutor v Natarajan Adhilakshmi[^6]_, the accused pleaded guilty to falsely declaring she was working as an FDW for another person. Instead she engaged in vice activities over a period of seven months. She was sentenced to seven weeks’ imprisonment. I found that the accused’s culpability was greater than either Goh’s or Teo’s because she had engaged in vice activities.

> d.     In _Public Prosecutor v Rajendran Manimekalai[^7]_, the accused pleaded guilty to falsely declaring that she was working as an FDW and instead was engaged in vice activities over a period of four months. She was sentence to seven weeks’ imprisonment. I found that the accused’s culpability was greater than either Goh’s or Teo’s because she had engaged in vice activities.

> e.     In _Public Prosecutor v Li Fei[^8]_, the accused in his capacity as a director consented to the his company falsely declaring that one Wei Xiuzheng would be working as a construction worker for his company. Wei Xiuzheng did not work for the accused’s company and instead worked for the accused’s friend and subsequently as an illegal self-employed foreigner. The period of illegal employment was for approximately five months. The accused was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. I found that the accused’s culpability in this case was greater than either Goh’s or Teo’s because the accused had assisted his friend to obtain foreign employees when his friend was unable to apply for new foreign employees. In addition, the accused’s actions led to the Wei working as an illegal self-employed foreigner after he ceased working for the accused’s friend.

> f.     In _Public Prosecutor v Zheng Detao[^9]_, the accused in his capacity as a director consented to the company falsely declaring that a foreign employee would be working for the company as a Performing Artiste when there was no such intention. Instead the foreign employee was engaged in vice activities. The accused did not benefit monetarily from the offence. The accused was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. I also found that the accused’s culpability in this case was greater than either Goh’s or Teo’s because as a result of his false statement the foreign employee was able to engage in vice activities.

## DECISION

## A.    Legislative Objectives

40     The EFMA was amended and came into force on 9th November 2012. Under the pre-amendment EFMA the maximum punishment for an offence under section 22(1)(d) was a fine not exceeding $15,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both. With the amendment, the maximum fine was increased to $20,000 and the maximum imprisonment was doubled to two years.

41     During the Second Reading of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Amendment) Bill, the Acting Minister for Manpower, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, set out the rationale for the amendments:

> _“_      _Employers in Singapore are by and large responsible, but there are some who seek to profit by circumventing our work pass framework._ **_As we further tighten the policies on the hiring and retention of foreign manpower, we can expect errant employers to try harder to get round the rules_** _…_ **_For example, we have found that some declaring higher salaries than they are actually paying their foreign workers…_**

> **_Singaporeans ultimately suffer when employers_** _fail to pay the true costs of hiring foreign manpower or_ **_hiring foreign manpower that they are not entitled to_** _._ **_Local workers will lose out in employment opportunities. Honest employers who play by the rules are also unfairly disadvantaged…_**

> _Sir, the proposed amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act will enhance the Government’s ability to ensure the integrity of our work pass framework. Recognising that EFMA contraventions range widely from administrative infringements to criminal offences, these amendments will introduce a calibrated and appropriate response to different types of contraventions._ **_In totality, the changes will allow my Ministry to step up enforcement actions against errant employers_** _, errant foreign workers and syndicates more expeditiously and effectively_, **_thereby enhancing deterrence against EFMA contraventions, which ultimately hurts Singaporeans_**_._

> **_To further enhance deterrence, we will increase maximum penalties for EFMA contraventions. The penalties have been benchmarked against contraventions of similar nature in the Immigration Act and Penal Code_** _…_

> _Sir, as mentioned, this Bill is meant to go after errant employers, and most employers are fair and responsible. It ultimately bolsters our efforts in creating sustainable and inclusive growth in Singapore and ensuring that Singaporeans remain the core of our workforce._ **_It will do so by ensuring employers pay the true costs of hiring foreign workers and creating a level playing field for law-abiding employers…_** \[**Emphasis mine**\]

42     I found that the offences committed by Goh and Teo were specifically the sort of offences targeted by errant employers to get round MOM’s tight policies with regard to the hiring of foreign manpower. Te Deum did not have quota to employ work permit holders and could not afform to pay foreign workers the minimum salary for S-Pass holder and, in order to get round this requirement, Goh agreed to Pandiselve’s plan to engage the workers as S-Pass holders but subsequently pay them less that the minimum for S-Pass holders.

43     By the amendments Parliament intended to check efforts by errant employers from employing unqualified foreigners because this had the effect, first, of depriving Singaporeans or a deserving foreigner of employment opportunities. These rules exist to ensure that there are fair employment opportunities for Singaporeans and foreigners. Second, Parliament had recognised that the vast majority of employers in Singapore play by the rules and that unless a strong message was sent to errant employers, like Goh and Teo, honest employers would be severely disadvantaged by such accused persons as they would bear possibly higher costs of employing Singaporeans or qualified foreigners.

44     Thus, on the legislative objects behind the amendment to the EFMA, I found that the primary sentencing consideration for these offences was general deterrence.

45     It was also stated that the new penalties had been benchmarked with contraventions of a similar nature under the Immigration Act and Penal Code. Thus, I found, that guidance could be sought from the sentences meted out for offences of making false representations under section 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act and offences of making false statements to public servants in the exercise of their duties under section 182 of the Penal Code.

46     However, I also found that the ends of general deterrence could be met by the imposition of higher fines that the benchmark fines that had been previously imposed for section 22(1)(d) offences.

## B.    Sentence

47     The Prosecution had, in a number of earlier cases that I heard, submitted that the current sentencing norm to impose fines in the region of $7,500 to $9,000 for offences under section 22(1)(b) EFMA was inadequate to give full effect to Parliament’s intent when the penalties for the offence were raised in 2012. I was fully in agreement with the Prosecution’s position that the sentences for section 22(1)(d) offences were too lenient and that there was a need to utilise the full sentencing spectrum for the offences. As a result, I had accepted their submissions in a number of earlier cases and I imposed custodial sentences in these cases, including most of the cases referred to under the heading Precedents above. However, I found that this did not preclude the possibility of imposing non-custodial sentences in appropriate cases.

#### I.    The threshold for the imposition of a custodial threshold

48     The Prosecution variously described the custodial threshold as being crossed if the false statement was material. I found that this submission was untenable. I agreed with the Defence submission that the materiality of the false statement was an element of the charge. If the false statement was not material, then it would not be an offence under section 22(1)(b) EFMA, thus the inevitable result of using the materiality of the false statement as the threshold requirement to impose a custodial sentence for section 22(1)(d) offences would be that all offences under section 22(1)(d) would attract a custodial sentence as the starting sentence.

#### II.    Assessing Goh’s and Teo’s culpability and the harm caused, actual or potential.

49     Whilst I agreed with both Defence Counsel’s submission that I should not endorse or establish a sentencing framework, I found that this did not preclude me from considering the offence-specific and the offender-specific factors raised by the Ms Priya in determining the relevant sentence.

#### a.    Materiality of the falsehood

50     As stated above, materiality of the false statement was an element of the charge and, as such, I found that it would be inappropriate to use the materiality of the charge as a factor to determine culpability. However, there should be a consideration of whether the false statement would have resulted in a different result compared to the true state of affairs. By this I meant applying a “_but for_” test, i.e. in work pass cases where the application for a work pass would not have been granted but for the false statement then the gravity of the false statement would be higher.

51     Conversely an applicant for a work pass, who perhaps holds the requisite educational qualification for the particular pass being applied for, may make a false statement that he/she possess a higher educational qualification in the hopes of ensuring that he will secure the pass. Whilst this would still be a material falsehood, as the appropriate educational qualifications are a prerequisite for certain work passes, the applicant would not have been disqualified from obtaining the pass had he/she submitted the actual educational qualification. I found that in this situation the culpability would be far lower.

52     In the present case, I found that the false statement made by the company that was abetted to by Goh and consented to by Teo would carry a higher degree of culpability because but for the false statement Arulsamy and Savari would not have been able to work for Te Deum as Te Deum did not have the requisite quota to apply for and be granted work permits. I agreed with Ms Priya’s submission in this case that but for the false statement Arulsamy and Savari would not have been granted the work passes. I also found that it was a further aggravating factor that the actual salaries paid to Arulsamy, $1,350, and to Savari, $1,400, were significantly below the minimum salary, of $2,200, for S-Passes.

53     I would note that with regard to this factor the relative culpabilities vis-à-vis Goh and Teo were not the same. I found that Goh’s culpability was higher as, in his Statement of Facts, he acknowledged that he was aware that Te Deum did not have quota for work permits and he informed Pandiselve of this fact. He informed Teo about Pandiselve’s suggestion to apply for S-Passes but subsequently pay the workers a far lower pay. However, there is no indication in Teo’s Statement of Facts that he was personally aware that Te Deum did not have a quota for work permits. As such I found Teo’s culpability, with regards to this factor, was lower than Goh’s.

#### b.    Consequences of the deception

54     I agreed with Ms Priya’s submission that there were tangible benefits that accrued to Te Deum as a result of the offence. Te Deum saved approximately $24,000 per year for the two years that the offence was in operation. This is a considerable sum of money, especially given the fact that Te Deum appeared to be going through financial woes, as was stated, and admitted by, Goh in his Statement of Facts when he acknowledged that Te Deum could not afford to employ S-Pass holders. Te Deum also obtained the benefit of the labour of two employees that it would not have otherwise been entitled to. I found that as were tangible benefits to the company as a result of the false statement, this would increase Goh’s and Teo’s culpability.

55     I also found that there was no personal financial benefit that accrued to either Goh or Teo, in that the sums clawed back from Arulsamy and Savari were not paid directly to either accused. Had either accused pocketed the money that was clawed back from the workers, and personally benefited from the offences, then their culpability would be correspondingly increased and I would have considered imprisonment as an appropriate sentence.

56     However, I did not agree that the underpayment to Arulsamy and Savari amounted to exploitation of the two workers by Goh, Teo or Te Deum. Goh admitted that Arulsamy and Savari were informed that although their declared salary was $2,400 they would be paid less and would have to pay back the balance to Te Deum every month, there was nothing in the Statement of Facts, for either Goh or Teo, that suggested that Arulsamy and Savari had accepted the employment opportunity with Te Deum on the assumption that they would be paid the full salary of $2,400. There was no suggestion in the Statement of Facts that once Arulsamy and Savari were informed about the scheme they were given an ultimatum that they should accept the scheme or that they would not be able to work in Singapore.

57     It was apparent from the mitigation on behalf of both Goh and Teo that Arulsamy and Savari were treated well by the company. It was unchallenged that they were paid bonuses, for overtime work, given accommodation allowances, angpows during festive occasions and that their medical fees were paid for. I found that they were treated as any foreign worker would expect to be treated by their employers.

58     There was also no suggestion that either Arulsamy or Savari were doing the work that would be expected of S-Pass holders but at a far reduced wage. There is also no suggestion that either worker was left to fend for himself as a self-employed foreigner or sent to work for another company. Neither Arulsamy nor Savari used their time in Singapore to commit other offences.

59     For the reasons above I found that Goh’s and Teo’s culpability was lower than the culpability of the accused persons in the precedent cases above. Based on the sentencing norms at the time this case was decided (i.e. pre-_Chiew Kok Chai_) I did not think that their respective culpabilities warranted the imposition of a custodial sentence.

#### c.    Extent of the deception and Goh’s and Teo’s role in the offence

60     I have dealt with Goh’s and Teo’s roles in the commission of the offence above and their relative culpability based on the roles that they played. Ms Priya submitted that there was planning in this case as Goh realising that Te Deum did not have work permit quota agreed with Pandiselve’s suggestion to apply for S-Passes and then Goh informed Teo of the plan and Teo consented to the scheme.

61     In order to commit offences of this nature there would have to be a baseline of planning by the offenders. Realising that a business does not have the requisite quota for a type of work pass and then attempting to game the system by applying for a higher level pass without intending to pay the workers the declared salary would amount to this baseline of planning. However, it was clear in this case that there was no additional sophisticated planning or attempt to disguise the offence. For instance, if the accused persons had forged additional documents, perhaps educational qualifications, to justify the application for a particular pass then this would be an aggravating factor displaying a higher degree of planning. I found that this was absent in the present case.

#### d.    Duration and Difficulty of Detection

62     I found that the duration that the falsehood was maintained and the benefit that Te Deum obtained was over two years. I found that this was a lengthy period and it would justify an increase in the sentence to be meted out to both Goh and Teo. I also agreed with Ms Priya’s submission that these offences are naturally difficult to detect especially in the current situation where the workers are paid the full declared salary and then required to return the balance in cash. Again, I found that the difficulty in detection inherent in all these cases would justify a stiffer sentence than the sentences that had been imposed in the past.

#### e.    Offender specific factors

63     I agreed that it was an aggravating factor that there were additional charges had been taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing against both Goh and Teo. However, I noted that the number of TIC charges was not unduly high and, more importantly, the TIC charges did not involve other workers. Therefore, in the present case the deception by Goh and Teo only extended to two workers. Whilst this would have the effect of increasing the sentences to be imposed on Goh and Teo, I found that it did not, in itself, justify the imposition of a custodial sentence.

64     In mitigation, I accepted that both Goh and Teo had demonstrated remorse for their actions and had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity. There was nothing to suggest that either accused person was obstructive during the investigations and, as such, they should both be credited with being cooperative with MOM. I also accept that both accused persons are untraced. Finally, I found that it was a significant mitigating factor that full restitution had been made to both Arulsamy and Savari. This would justify a significant discount in the sentence to be imposed on Goh and Teo.

65     I found that whilst Goh’s culpability, with regards to his role in implementing the scheme, was higher than Teo’s culpability, I nonetheless found that their culpabilities were similar as Goh’s higher culpability for this factor was balanced against Teo’s higher culpability as he was a director of Te Deum, and therefore stood to possibly gain more out of the company doing well as compared to Goh.

66     I did not place much weight on the fact that there would be financial and personal hardships suffered by Goh and Teo as a result of the conviction. The hardships that they would suffer were not so exceptional as to warrant a discount in the sentence. In addition, I found that the financial hardship that Te Deum was undergoing was irrelevant as a consideration in the sentences to be imposed on either Goh or Teo.

#### III.    Prevalence of the offences

67     I noted that Ms Priya had submitted that whilst the number of section 22(1)(d) EFMA cases were generally falling from 2015 to 2017, there had been a gradual increase in the number of cases involving false declarations of salary. Whilst I found that there was an I did not find the increase was so significant.

#### IV.    Sentence

68     I found that the both Goh’s and Teo’s culpability was not as great at the culpability of the accused persons in the precedent cases, or the accused persons in _Chiew Kok Chai_ or _Nallasamy_, for that matter. Therefore, I found that the sentences to be imposed on Goh and Teo should not be at the same or greater than the sentences imposed on the accused persons in the precedent case. In particular, I found that the culpability of the accused person in _Zheng Detao_ was greater than Goh’s and Teo’s culpability and, as such, the sentences to be imposed against Goh and Teo should be lower than the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Zheng Detao._

69     I was in agreement with the Prosecution that there had to be shift towards more deterrent sentences as the sentencing norm, of fines in the regions of $7,500 to $9,000, was inadequate, however, in the present case the need for a more deterrent sentence did not, in my opinion, require the imposition of a custodial sentence.

70     Taking into account the offender-specific factors stated above, and Goh’s and Teo’s relative culpability, the aggravating and mitigating factors and the need for general deterrence I found that the appropriate sentence was a fine of $15,000 for each of the proceeded charges against the accused persons. Each accused person was sentenced to pay a fine of $30,000.
