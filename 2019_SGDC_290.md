31 December 2019

### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       It was supposed to be a night of merry-making and enjoyment to celebrate the well-known _Oktoberfest Festival_ at the Swiss Club of Singapore. Things got out of hand and a deadly single punch was thrown resulting in multiple facial fractures for the victim. This case is a stark reminder that racist remarks and intoxicated persons are likely to be a volatile and dangerous mix and will inevitably have dire consequences for all involved.

## Background

2       The accused, a 29 year-old male USA citizen on the date of the incident, was a Teacher at a local international school. He was charged with committing grievous hurt by punching the victim on the left side of his face and causing multiple facial fractures. The accused was represented by Counsel and had claimed trial to the charge. At the conclusion of the trial, he was found guilty and convicted and sentenced to 20 months imprisonment. He has now appealed against both his conviction and sentence. At the time of writing these grounds of decision, he is on bail pending appeal.

## The Proceeded Charge

3       The accused claimed trial to the single charge as set out below -

> _DAC-912816-2018_

> _You_,

> _are charged that you, on 24 September 2017, at or about 1.32am, somewhere along 36 Swiss Club Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Arora Neil Kant, to wit, by punching, the said Arora Neil Kant on the left side of his face, causing the said Arora Neil Kant to suffer the following injuries:_

>> _a_)     _mildly displaced fractures of the left orbital floor and anterior and lateral maxillary walls with small haemoantrum; and_

>> _b_)     _a left zygomatic arch fracture_,

> _and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## The Undisputed Evidence

4       There was undisputed evidence before the Court. This incontrovertible evidence was in sum obtained from the Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit ASOF 1).

### The Agreed Statement of Facts (ASOF1)

5       The ASOF 1 comprised the following annexed exhibits –

> (i)     ASOF 1 – A – the FIR of 24 Sep 2017 at made 01:33:54

> (ii)     ASOF 1 – B - the Medical Report dated 23 Oct 2017 of Dr Michelle Ho (Associate Consultant) from Tan Tock Seng Hospital

> (iii)     ASOF 1 – C – the accused’s Long Statement recorded on 10 Jan 2018 at 1725 by IO Muhammad Ashraf

> (iv)     ASOF 1 – D – the accused’s cautioned statement recorded on 21 March 2018 at 1600 by IO Muhammad Ashraf

6       Between the parties, much of the events of the night is not disputed. The general narrative was as follows. On 24 September 2017, at about 1am, Neil and the accused, together with their respective companions, left the Swiss Club (“the Club”) separately at the end of an Oktoberfest event. While at the taxi stand outside the Club, a verbal dispute arose between the accused’s party and Neil’s party. After security guards intervened, both parties left the taxi stand. A while later, they crossed paths again along the road outside the Club. It was during this second encounter that Neil was punched by the accused.

7       Here, it is important to bear in mind that it is not disputed at all that the accused had punched Neil.[^1] The nature and extent of Neil’s injuries are also not disputed. As stated in the medical report prepared by Dr Michelle Ho of Tan Tock Seng Hospital,[^2] Neil was hospitalised for six days and suffered, inter alia:

> mildly displaced fractures of left orbital floor and anterior and lateral maxillary walls with small haemoantrum; and

> left zygomatic arch fracture.

8       Two statements of the accused were admitted by consent, with no dispute as to their voluntariness.[^3]

## The Prosecution’s Case

### Prosecution Case

9       The Prosecution’s version of the events of that night as testified by its witnesses was contained in its detailed closing submissions.[^4] For ease of reference, I have reproduced and summarised their case as below.

10     The narrative recounted by the Prosecution’s witnesses was as follows. Neil Arora the victim, PW3 Arora Reema, PW2 Patel Kanak and PW4 Patel Priya (collectively, “the victim’s party”) attended the Oktoberfest event at the Club together. Towards the end of the event, the accused was seen engaging in drunk merriment inside the Club, drinking beer directly from the beer towers.[^5]

11     After the Oktoberfest event ended, the victim’s party exited the Club and proceeded to the taxi stand, which was very crowded. The accused was also at the taxi stand with his friend, David Rive (DW3).

12     Whilst in the taxi queue, Neil and Kanak overheard the accused making remarks toward an unrelated Indian man,[^6] to the effect of “Don’t touch me you Indian … you may be allowed to queue like that in your country but you can’t … like that here”.[^7]

13     Sensing that the racist remarks were uncalled for, Neil and Kanak came to the aid of the unrelated Indian man and chided the accused for making racist remarks.[^8]A verbal dispute ensued between both sides, with Reema and Priya standing in between them.[^9] Eventually, security guards intervened and separated both groups.[^10] The security guards removed the accused and David from the area.[^11]

14     The victim’s party left the taxi stand as they decided to book an Uber taxi using Priya’s phone. Since the road leading to the Club was congested, they walked down towards the main road to board the Uber taxi. While walking down, they saw the accused and David approaching them. All of a sudden, Kanak fell to the ground.[^12] Seeing this, Neil surmised that Kanak had been pushed by either the accused or David.[^13]

15     Afraid that the accused might push or hit someone else, Neil used both his hands to hold on to the bottom of the accused’s rolled-up sleeves, just below the accused’s elbow. This was to prevent the accused from hurting anyone else.[^14] However, the accused managed to break free of Neil’s grip. Almost instantly, Neil felt a blow to the left side of his head, from the temple down to the cheek area.[^15] Kanak, who was sitting up by this point, saw the accused’s arm pull back and then lunge forward to hit Neil with a clenched fist on the left side of Neil’s cheek or eye area.[^16]Neil lost consciousness,[^17] and the accused immediately fled.

16     Neil had also testified that as a result of his injuries, he had undergone surgery to reconstruct his eye socket using titanium plates and has lost sensation in his face from underneath his nose up to his cheekbone.[^18]He also suffers from peripheral double vision and occasional flashbacks of the assault.[^19] At the time of the trial – that is, about one and a half years after the assault – he was still attending follow-up consultations.[^20]

## Close of Prosecution Case

17     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, Defence Counsel did not make any submission of no case to answer. Given the evidence before the court, I found that there was prima facie evidence to support the key elements of the charge at this stage of the trial. Accordingly, I called on the accused to give his defence to the said charge. The accused elected to give evidence from the witness stand.

## The Defence Case

18     Besides the accused, the Defence also called 3 other witnesses.

19     The narrative provided by the Defence based on the evidence of its witnesses was as follows.

20     The Defence version was that at the taxi stand, David remarked, “Settle down, this isn’t India”.[^21] Neil and Kanak accused David of racism, and an intense argument arose.[^22] The accused joined in, until security guards intervened to separate the accused and David from Neil and Kanak. Immediately thereafter, the accused claimed that he felt a fist strike him on the face.[^23] According to David, Kanak had swung around the security guards and punched the accused.[^24]

21     The accused and David then left the taxi stand and walked down the hill towards the main road. David then decided to go back up the hill to look for Courtney. While going up the hill, he crossed paths again with the victim’s party. David said to them, “have a good night”, but he claimed that the victim’s party hurled insults at him again.[^25] The accused from down the hill, heard David yelling and ran up the hill as fast as he could.[^26] He then put his hands out in front of him and told the victim’s party to “just go home”.[^27] At this point, Neil grabbed hold of the accused’s left sleeve. The accused could not release himself.[^28] After telling Neil twice to “let go”, the accused “struck out” with his arm at Neil’s body.[^29]

## Issues

22     As in all cases, the Prosecution and the Defence had different versions of what actually happened at about 1.30 AM along Swiss Club Road in the early hours of 24 September 2017, just outside the Swiss Club of Singapore. There was divergence also on the inferences to be drawn from the objective facts that were proved in court of the acts that took place on that fateful day. It was therefore a case of the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses against the words of the accused essentially in this case – as the accused had denied that he intended or had actual knowledge that he would cause grievous hurt to the victim Neil when he punched him in the face. Under these circumstances, it is incumbent on the Court to evaluate whether the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence is more credible than that of the accused and his witnesses. The Court also has to look for internal and external consistencies and inconsistencies in the respective evidence.

23     Here, I do not propose to go into the entire evidence given by all the Prosecution witnesses. Nor do I propose to deal with all the arguments raised by the Defence – but only the key areas.

### Key issues before the Court

24     Let me therefore deal with the following 6 key areas of this case.

> (i)     The undisputed fact of the accused having punched Neil

> (ii)     The legal issue of _mens rea_ in a charge under s. 325 of the Penal Code.

> (iii)     The accused’s main defence of trying to free himself.

> (iv)     Credibility of the witnesses

> (v)     The admissions of the accused and also his statements made to the Police.

> (vi)     The issues of the right of private defence and the existence of grave and sudden provocation

## Findings and decision of the Court

### (I)   The undisputed fact of the accused having punched Neil

25     It was undisputed that the accused had punched the victim Neil. This is the actus reus of the offence. His friend Kanak had seen the accused’s arm pull back and then lunge forward to hit Neil with a clenched fist on the left side of Neil’s cheek or eye area, ie on his face and not on any other part of Neil’s body.

26     In his s. 22 CPC statement recorded on 10 January 2018, the accused stated that he swung his right arm and hit Neil with a clenched fist. Further, in his s. 23 CPC cautioned statement the accused admitted that he had “struck” Neil.

27     In his oral testimony in court, the accused also stated that he lunged with his right arm at the victim.[^30]

28     In the present case, it is clear that the Defence is not saying that there was no bodily contact between the accused and the victim. The Defence is arguing that there was no intention by the accused to cause grievous hurt to the victim as he was only trying to free his sleeves from the grip of the victim. The reason for his attempt to flee from the grip of the victim Neil was that the accused was trying to get away from the victim and also because he was scared. The accused also stated that he took this action solely for his safety and protection of himself. It was with this concern that he struck out at the victim Neil.[^31]

29     In view of the above, it is undisputed that the accused had punched the victim Neil once[^32] on the left side of his face.

### (II)   The legal issue – the accused intended to cause grievous hurt

30     The pivotal legal issue is did the accused intend or have actual knowledge that he would cause grievous hurt to the victim Neil when he punched him in the face. Both Parties referred to the well-known High Court decision in _Koh Jing Kwang v PP <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 7</span>_. It was decided in that case that the mens rea requirement in s. 325 of the Penal Code required that the Prosecution needed to show that when the accused delivered his punch, did he intend or know that it was likely to cause the victim some form of grievous hurt. In _Koh Jing Kwang v PP_, See J had also stated that when the accused delivered his punch did he intend or have actual knowledge that he would cause grievous hurt to the victim? In other words, the mens rea element of s. 325 is not satisfied merely because a punch was thrown to the face. More is needed to be shown by the Prosecution.

31     I turn to a more recent case. In the case of _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 449</span>_, Sundaresh Menon CJ had highlighted that actual knowledge can be inferred from the objective acts and circumstances of the offence. It was open to the court to undertake this enquiry by a consideration of the objective circumstances and with reference to what a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known. _Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP_ was a case involving grievous hurt. Sundaresh Menon CJ was of the view that if it was shown that a reasonable person in the accused’s position, having regard to all the facts and circumstances before him, would have known that grievous hurt was likely to result from his acts, then in order for the accused to deny actual knowledge, he would have to prove or explain how and why he did not in fact have such knowledge as the reasonable person would have had (at \[41\] to \[44\]):

> _“41 It is also clear that s 322 requires subjective knowledge in contrast to the third state of mind mentioned at \[37(c)\] above, ie, having reason to believe that one’s actions are likely to result in a particular consequence, which speaks to objective knowledge. As I have noted at \[38\] above, this is not reflected at all in s 322._ **_The inquiry in this context is purely objective_** _and may, in my view, be seen as analogous to the state of mind that applies in the context of doing something negligently._ **_In such a case, the actor neither intends nor knows that a particular type of consequence will ensue but, objectively, there were reasons that could have caused a reasonable person to have anticipated that._** _This state of mind equates to the mental element of negligence in s 338 but has no place in s 322._

> _42_      _Thus, the mental element required for an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt is that the accused actually intended grievous hurt to result from his actions or knew that it was likely that grievous hurt would so result._ **_The inquiry is as to the accused person’s subjective state of mind_** _. However, there is an important distinction between the specific mental element required by the law for an offence to be made out, which has been discussed in the preceding paragraphs, and the way in which the relevant mental element may be proved by the Prosecution or found by the court._ **_The law may require that the accused possess certain subjective states of mind for the purposes of an offence, but that does not mean that the accused’s intention and knowledge cannot be judged and inferred from his objective conduct and all the surrounding circumstances_** _. Barring a personal admission by the accused, this will often be the only way to ascertain his state of mind. As the Court of Appeal held in Tan Joo Cheng v PP <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 219</span> at \[12\], intention (and to my mind, knowledge as well) is “pre-eminently a matter for inference”. The same point was made by V K Rajah JA in Lee Chez Kee at \[254\]:_

>> _Very often, it will not be the case that the accused states that he had a particular state of knowledge. The existence of a state of knowledge is therefore to be carefully inferred from the surrounding evidence. This is not to say that the courts should ‘objectivise’ subjective knowledge with what they think the accused ought to have known; what this simply requires is for a careful evaluation of the evidence to disclose what the accused actually knew but had not stated explicitly. Indeed, this is the entire nature of circumstantial evidence._

> _43_      _The need to infer intention and knowledge from the objective facts is also well explained in Sri Hari Singh Gour, Penal Law of India vol 3 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Revised Ed, 2011) (“Gour”) at pp 3215–3216, in a passage also accepted and quoted by the court in Koh Jing Kwang (at \[36\]). Commenting on s 322 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (Act No 45 of 1860) (India) (“the IPC”) which is for all purposes in the same terms as s 322 of the PC, Gour writes:_

>> _… But there must be evidence that what the accused had intended or known to be likely was not only hurt, but grievous hurt. But how is such intention or knowledge to be proved? This difficulty was suggested to the Law Commissioners who said: ‘The Judge is not to trouble himself with seeking for direct proof of what the offender thought was likely to happen_, **_but is to infer it from the nature of his act, taking him to have intended grievous hurt, or at least to have contemplated grievous hurt as likely to occur, when he did what everybody knows is likely to cause grievous hurt_**, _and the more certainly drawing this conclusion where there is evidence of previous enmity against the party who has suffered. …’_

> _…_

>> _This is, of course, the only way in which intention and knowledge can be proved. Overt act and declarations, the amount of violence used, the nature of the weapon selected for that purpose, the part of the body, vital or otherwise, where the wound was inflicted, the effect produced are, indeed, some of the most essential facts from which the Judge or jury may infer an intention. It cannot be judged from any isolated fact, but must be judged from all together. For, suppose a person strikes a blow with moderate violence, which would not cause death of an ordinary subject, but which owing to the latent disease in him caused his death, the criminality of the act could not obviously be judged by the fatal result, but only by the nature of the act, namely, the severity of the blow. … \[emphasis added\]_

> _44_      _It is thus open to, and often useful for, the court to undertake the inquiry into the accused’s actual knowledge by a consideration of the objective circumstances and with reference to what a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known. As explained in Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 257</span>, in relation to the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), the reasonable person’s perspective is “one of the evidential tools for the court to assess the accused’s subjective state of mind” (at \[59\]). I consider that the same principles apply in the context of s 322._ **_Practically speaking, therefore, if it is shown that a reasonable person in the accused’s position, having regard to all the facts and circumstances before him, would have known that grievous hurt was likely to result from his acts, then in order for the accused to deny actual knowledge, he would have to prove or explain how and why he did not in fact have such knowledge as the reasonable person would have had.”_**

(Emphasis added)

32     I proceed now to apply the legal principles established from the above two cases. To be fair to the accused, the Prosecution’s case is based on intention and not actual knowledge. As stated by Menon CJ in Muhammad Khalis Bin Ramlee v PP, the principle of law is that a court can infer actual knowledge or intention from the circumstances of the offence and the objective facts and conduct of the accused. In this regard, I note the following –

> (a)      **The accused had inflicted a forceful punch on the face of Neil.** It was not a gentle caress or even a mere slap or push to the face – it was a forceful punch. This is easily and objectively inferred from the extent of the injuries suffered by Neil – which were multiple facial fractures that required reconstructive surgery to be performed on his eye socket. It has left him with permanent peripheral double vision and numbness in the face. All this as a result of just a single punch. Even his friend David had testified that he heard a “_a thump… a solid thump_” when the accused hit Neil. Further, the witness PW3 Priya had also testified that she saw Neil’s eyes glazed as he collapsed to the ground. Indeed, if it was not a forceful punch, Neil would not even have collapsed to the ground.

> (b)      **The accused had aimed at a vulnerable part of Neil’s body.** Neil and the accused were very close to each other. It is not credible for the accused to suggest that he was unaware that he would be punching the face of the accused in these circumstances of close proximity. During cross-examination, the accused had even stated that he could have aimed at a different place if his intention was merely to get Neil to release his sleeves.[^33]

> (c)      **The accused had pulled back his arm before thrusting it forward.** This was the clear evidence of Kanak. Here, I observe that if the intention of the accused was only to free himself, this benign purpose was achieved when the accused managed to free his dominant right hand from the hold of Neil and had pulled it back and out of the grip of Neil. His right arm now being free, there was no need for any further self-help action by the accused. On the contrary, it was now open to the accused to even use his freed right hand to help prise away his left hand sleeve from Neil’s grasp. He could also have called out for help, shouted again at Neil to stop or even just walk away as he had already achieved his avowed purpose of trying to free his right hand. He did not engage in any of these safe actions. From a posture of self-help by pulling back and freeing his right hand, the accused now lunged forward and punched Neil on the left side of his face. From self-help, his posture was now that of an attack on Neil’s face with a clenched fist punch.

33     Based on the above objective conduct of the accused and the surrounding circumstances, I infer and find that the accused had intended to cause grievous hurt to the victim Neil.

### (III)   The accused’s main defence of trying to free himself.

34     Notwithstanding my finding above and for completeness, I pause here to deal with the accused’s main defence that he had punched Neil only because he was trying to free himself. I find the accused’s defence that he was only trying to free himself to be disingenuous and not credible at all. The short answer is that there are many other reasonable – and sensible ways – to free oneself in such a situation. The accused could have pulled his left arm away, he could have simply pushed Neil away with his freed right hand, use his freed right hand to slap Neil on his arm or shoulder or even just shouted for “Help”. But instead, the action of the accused was to throw a forceful punch to the face of Neil with his freed right hand. Given the multiple, sensible and reasonable other ways by which the accused could have freed himself from the grasp of Neil, I reject the Defence argument that the only way for the accused to free himself was to lunge at Neil and inflict a forceful punch that knocked him to the ground and caused multiple facial fractures. Such an argument is at best misconceived or at worst, it completely ignores the objective facts surrounding the lunging punch with a clenched fist[^34]and serious multiple facial fractures[^35] inflicted by the accused’s forceful punch on the victim’s vulnerable face.

35     Here, it bears highlighting the difference between the facts in the case of _Koh Jing Kwang v PP_ and the facts of the present case. In _Koh Jing Kwang v PP_, the appellant had punched the victim in the _face_, causing him to stumble, fall and then knock his head on the ground. It was the impact of the victim’s head on the ground that caused the _skull_ fracture in question. Significantly, the medical evidence showed little mention of any bruising or injuries to the face from the solitary punch. Under these circumstances, See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) specifically made a finding that intention or knowledge _could not_ be attributed to the appellant for the entire ensuing chain of events. See JC further added that it also could not be said that the appellant intended or knew that other forms of grievous hurt were likely to result as the medical evidence did not suggest a _forceful_ punch. In contrast, the facts of the present could not be more starkly different. The victim Neil had suffered multiple facial fractures that were a direct consequence and entirely attributable to the accused’s single but forceful punch to his face. Neil did not suffer any other blow or fall to the ground and a resulting skull fracture as in the case of _Koh Jing Kwang v PP_. Moreover, unlike in _Koh Jing Kwang v PP_, where it was a punch to the _face_ but a _skull_ fracture had resulted from the ground impact, the present case involved a punch to the _face_ but with resulting multiple _facial_ fractures for the victim Neil.

36     A pertinent aspect of this case is that having observed both the accused and Neil in court, I had paid careful attention to their respective physical attributes. It was immediately apparent to me that by any yardstick, the accused was the taller, bigger and heavier person. The accused himself testified that he was 1.82 metres in height and weighed about 110 kilos. During his oral testimony, he had candidly stated that he had previously worked as a bouncer in the USA and had later worked as a firefighter. It is therefore entirely probable and believable that the accused in view of his bigger and stronger build, was more than capable of freeing his dominant right hand from Neil’s grasp at the sleeves and inflicting a clenched fist forceful punch on the face of Neil. Further, by doing so, he was not merely trying to free his hand but he had clearly intended to inflict grievous hurt upon the face of Neil.

37     Certainly, it cannot therefore be said to be a reasonable action on the part of the accused to try and free himself. I therefore reject this argument canvassed by the Defence as one that is completely unmeritorious.

## (IV)   Credibility of witnesses

38     I have observed both the Prosecution and Defence witnesses carefully when they gave their evidence in court, and in particular their overall demeanour.

39     The Defence not surprisingly had sought to discredit the testimony of the key Prosecution witnesses – the victim Neil and his friend Kanak. The Defence had submitted that Neil’s evidence was hesitant and that Kanak’s evidence was internally inconsistent. In my view, these assertions of the Defence were not borne out upon careful scrutiny of their respective evidence. Even if there were inconsistencies, these were minor discrepancies and not material inconsistencies or contradictions.

40     Let me consider some aspects of the testimony of these 2 key Prosecution witnesses to bear out my assessment above.

41     The Defence had submitted that Neil was “hesitant” in giving his answers and used words like “_I don’t think that’s correct_” and “_I don’t believe so.”_[^36] Such an assertion may be valid if these answers are taken out of context. However, a careful examination of Neil’s answers reveals quite the contrary. During earlier EIC, Neil came across as a person who gave simple and straightforward answers. He did not embellish his evidence. He did not come across as someone who was in a hurry to pin liability on the accused. In fact, I formed the distinct impression that he was “gentlemanly” in his account of the events of that early morning encounter on 24 Sep 2017 outside the Swiss Club. The Defence assertion of the alleged hesitancy of Neil’s replies is based mainly on a small part of the cross-examination that was highlighted in the table at paragraph 41 of the Defence Closing Submissions. For better understanding, the actual and complete exchange in cross-examination[^37] in context is as follows –

>   
| 

“Q

 | 

Okay. Now, my instructions are these, my instructions are, you were holding on to just his left sleeve, do you agree with that or disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I believe I was holding to both sleeves**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Could it be that you were first holding on to both sleeves and he was able to break one hand free?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I don’t remember that. Is it possible, **it’s possible but tha---that’s not how I remember it.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Because you agree that your memory was a bit fuzzy that evening, that’s what you said.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**After the blow.”**

 |

  
  

42     Considering this exchange in its proper context does not in in my view, reveal any hesitancy on the part of Neil. On the contrary, he was clear that he held on to both sleeves of the accused. Neil had also given a demonstration in court of how he had held on to both sleeves of the accused.[^38] In response to Counsel’s questions, Neil first answered by stating that he “believed” that he was holding on to _both_ sleeves. In a second follow-up response, he candidly stated that it was “possible” in response to the question whether it could be that he was first holding on to both sleeves and he was then able to break one hand free. With respect, this is an illogical question from Counsel. If the accused had not broken free his right hand from Neil’s earlier holding of both sleeves, the accused would not be in a position to punch him with his dominant right hand a mere seconds later. In any case, I note that Neil was quick to add “but that’s _not_ how I remember it.” Indeed, as Neil was firm and unshaken on this point, Counsel had to quickly suggest that his memory was “fuzzy” in a bid to discredit this key evidence of Neil. Here, I note that Neil was again unshaken and held firm to say that this was only “**after** the blow.” In my view, there was nothing hesitant or uncertain in these clear and unequivocal responses by Neil. If nothing else, it was an emphatic indication by Neil that he was sure as to what had actually happened during the second encounter as opposed to indulging in a mere hypothetical exercise as suggested by Counsel.

43     Having scrutinized this particular exchange put forward by Counsel as evidence of Neil’s unreliability as a witness and also having observed Neil carefully in court, I was left in no doubt as to his credibility and also the veracity of his evidence. He came across as a person who gave simple and straightforward answers. Neither was he seeking to embellish his evidence. He certainly did not come across as someone who was in a hurry to pin liability on the accused.

44     At the same time, while a trial judge should observe and assess a witness’s demeanour and behaviour on the witness stand, I am equally mindful that the Court of Appeal in _Sandz Solutions Strategic and Others v Worldwide Assets Limited_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 27</span> (“_Sandz Solutions Strategic_”) at \[46\] had cautioned that such observations should seldom be the sole basis on which the court determines the credibility of a witness and the veracity of his evidence.

45     As for the evidence of Kanak, the Defence sought to impugn his testimony by alleging that Kanak’s evidence was “internally inconsistent” and “fell apart.”[^39] There was only one clear example given by the Defence to support this argument. As such, this argument needs to be likewise examined carefully.

46     With respect, it is somewhat difficult to follow the argument put forward by Counsel to justify its position that Kanak’s evidence was “internally inconsistent” and “fell apart.”[^40] The Defence seems to imply that Kanak had mistaken or confused David’s actions with that of the accused during the two different encounters that night. In my view, this is patently a misplaced argument. It is quite irrelevant as to whether Kanak had slipped or been pushed or whether it was the accused who had pushed him. In fact, Counsel himself states that the only evidence that Kanak was able to “_vividly d_escribe” was the moment Neil held onto the accused’s sleeves when he was knocked down.[^41] I entirely agree with Counsel that indeed this was “_the moment_” in the sense that this was the key legal issue - did the accused intend to cause grievous hurt to Neil when he punched him with his clenched right hand? Put in perspective, the accused himself does not deny that his sleeves had been held by Neil. The accused also did not deny that he had punched Neil on his face. And in my view, even if there were some minor discrepancies or hesitancy on the part of Kanak in other non-material areas, insofar as the key legal issue was concerned, Kanaks’s evidence was clear, credible and consistent. I therefore accepted his evidence on this key legal issue wholly and without any reservation whatsoever.

47     In another attempt to discredit these 2 key Prosecution witnesses, the Defence argued that both Neil and Kanak had been “reticent” in their account of events, “conspicuously omitting” to mention facts not so favourable to them. The example given to support this argument was that they had failed to mention their involvement in the earlier verbal dispute.[^42] For similar reasons as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this is again irrelevant to the key legal issue – did the accused intend to cause grievous hurt to Neil? As stated above, the accused did not deny that his sleeves had been held by Neil. The accused also did not deny that he had punched Neil on his face. I therefore reject the Defence argument that Neil and Kanak were reticent. If there was any reticence, this was only in relation to matters that were not germane to the key issues before the court.

48     I pause here to observe that given the frailties of human recollection, there will likely be discrepancies and inconsistencies in any witness’ testimony. As such, the court must recognise and give reasonable allowance for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. I am therefore mindful of the danger of over-reliance on the recollection of witnesses in the witness stand. It is unquestionable that a witness should not be judged to be less credible merely because of gaps in his memory, particularly where a significant period of time has passed since the occurrence of the event in question. In the final analysis, the trial judge has to consider the _totality_ of the evidence in determining the veracity, reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.

49     Guided by the above principles, I have as indicated above, considered very carefully the evidence of all the witnesses who had testified in court. On the whole, I found the Prosecution witnesses to be the more credible witnesses. In particular, I find that the victim Neil had given his testimony in a clear, cogent and compelling manner. Nor did he go out his way to embellish his evidence. I was satisfied that he was a witness of truth. As for his friend PW2 Kanak, I also find him to be a credible witness. At the same time as he had been pushed to the floor himself before the accused had punched Neil, Kanak was candid enough to admit that the accused did not hit him and that he also did not see who had pushed him onto the road.[^43]

50     As for the defence witnesses who testified for the accused, DW2 Nicole Marie Dissinger, the wife of the accused did confirm that the accused had told her when he returned home, that he had swung his arm at the person who was holding him. At the same time, she testified that the 3 of them – the accused, David and Courtney- had all discussed the incident together before coming to court. As for DW4 Courtney Belva, she was the girlfriend of the accused. In sum, her evidence was not helpful as she had not witnessed the incident at the taxi queue at all.

51     There were exhibits tendered by the Defence. I note that D1 was a series of exchanges between DW3 Rive David Michael on 24 Sep 2017 between 0158 and 0244 hours. This was after the punching incident between the accused and Neil. However, I did note that in D1, the accused had told David that he had twice told “him” to let me go and “then **I made him let go**.” D2 was a series of exchanges between DW4 Courtney Belva and DW2 David on 24 Sep 2017 between 0047 and 0130 hours. However, these exchanges only concerned the location of Courtney prior to the arrival of the taxi. It did not provide any relevant evidence as regards the key legal issue of whether the accused had intended to cause grievous hurt to the victim Neil when he punched him on his face. I therefore gave only little weight to the D2 Whatsapp messages tendered as a Defence exhibit.

## (V)   The admissions of the accused and his statements made to the Police.

52     In his s. 22 CPC statement recorded on 10 January 2018, the accused admitted that he swung his right arm and hit Neil with a clenched fist.[^44] Further, in his cautioned statement recorded under s. 23 of the CPC, the accused admitted that he had “struck” Neil.[^45]

53     I turn now to the testimony of the Accused given in court. What was the Accused’s story during the trial? Essentially it was one of bare denial and that he did not intend to cause grievous hurt to Neil, but had merely wanted to free himself. To be clear, I did not find him to be a credible witness at all. He struck me as not being forthright in giving his evidence and even appeared as somewhat evasive at times. An example of his unconvincing testimony is given below when the DPP questioned the accused on his stance of putting up his hands[^46] as he ran up the hill to help David –

>   
| 

“Q

 | 

I’m---

 |
| 

A

 | 

I---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

suggesting to you that that’s not a submissive action.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**I disagree with you.**

 |
| 

v

 | 

And I’m putting it to you, that if you were really afraid for ‘Dave’s’ safety, you would have done what I said, to just grab ‘Dave’ and go off. And that would have been the end of the matter.

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Instead, _you went to confront the victim’s group._

 |
| 

A

 | 

**N---no.** As I---as I arrived, as I first saw either of them, um, one of them was in---was---was yelling at ‘Dave’ and coming towards ‘Dave’. Um, I---I walked between them, and---and put my hands up to stop them and said, “Just go home.” And I was grabbed.”

 |

  
  

54     The accused was also given to embellishing his evidence and prone to exaggeration. The following exchange during cross-examination bears this out in a glaring way –

>   
| 

“Q

 | 

_You are saying that_ _he could have thrown you onto the ground?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_The---yes, absolutely._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Okay._ _Oh, 100kg of you, 1.8-metre-tall man of your built onto the floor?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Uh, it---it was wet, it was raining. There was grass to the side. I believe you heard Mr. Kanak earlier say that he slipped in the grass. Um_, **_he absolutely could have thrown me to the ground. I could have tripped_**_;_ **_I could have fallen_**_._ **_He could have pulled me_**_;_ **_he could have pushed me_**_. Absolutely. Holding on to me does not mean that he couldn’t have caused me any harm.”_

 |

  
  

55     The answers given by the accused in the above exchange veer between the illogical, the irrational and being simply ludicrous. Neil had only held onto the accused’s sleeves so that the accused would not proceed to hurt anyone as the accused had come running up the hill and soon after, Kanak was already on the ground. It was therefore illogical to suggest that Neil would throw the accused to the ground, when he had merely adopted a defensive posture as opposed to an attacking stance. Further, to say that he could slipped on the grass is the accused being irrational. While to suggest that Neil could have pushed all 100 kilos of the accused is ludicrous, as both Neil’s hands were already holding onto both shirt sleeves of the accused.

56     As such, I did not find the accused to be a credible witness. He was prone to embellishing his evidence and much of his evidence was essentially self-serving, without that ring of truth.

## (VI)   The issues of the right of private defence and the existence of grave and sudden provocation

57     The Defence had submitted that the accused was exercising his right of private defence when he punched Neil as Neil had “forcefully gripped the accused’s sleeve.”[^47]

58     I should state at the outset, that both on the facts and on the law, the accused was _not_ entitled to claim a right of private defence. Nor do the facts show that this was a case of grave and sudden provocation by either the victim Neil or anyone else. I will explain below.

59     The Prosecution had made detailed submissions on whether the accused was entitled to claim a right of private defence and whether there was grave and sudden provocation on the part of Neil. For ease of reference, I summarise and reproduce below their submissions on these 2 issues.

60     On the issue of a right of private defence for the accused, section 97 (a) of the Penal Code states as follows -

> **Right of private defence of the body and of property**

> **97**.    Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend —

>> (_a_)    his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; …

This right is subject to s 99(4), which provides as follows:

> **Extent to which the right may be exercised**

> (4)    The right of private in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.

61     I note that the accused claims that he acted in self-defence when he punched Neil because Neil had held onto _one_ of his sleeves and he was unable to break free.

62     The Prosecution submitted that there was simply no basis for private defence. There was no objective reason for the accused to apprehend that an offence was being, or would be, committed against his body. It was also submitted that even if a right of private defence had arisen, the accused blatantly exceeded its boundary by inflicting significant unnecessary harm on Neil.

## A.   The right of private defence does not arise

63     The Prosecution referred to the case of _Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 306</span>, where the Court of Appeal held that two preconditions must be satisfied before the right of private defence arises in respect of the accused’s own body (at \[39\] read with \[46(a)\]):

> (a)     The person purporting to exercise the right of private defence must have been the subject of an offence affecting the human body or must reasonably apprehend the commission of such an offence; and

> (b)     That person must have attempted to seek help from the relevant public authorities if there was a reasonable opportunity for him to do so.

## (i)   The accused was not punched forcefully at the taxi stand

64     In their submissions, the Prosecution referred to the events at the taxi stand as the accused had stated in his testimony that the alleged punch to his face at the taxi stand greatly coloured his perception of his second encounter with the victim’s party and contributed to his subjective apprehension of danger. The accused had also claimed that immediately after the security guards separated him and David from Neil and Kanak at the taxi stand, he felt a fist strike him on the face around his right eye, causing him to stumble backwards.[^48]

65     Here, I also note that it was asserted by the accused that this alleged punch apparently caused the accused to be greatly shaken and to perceive the victim’s party as a threat to his and David’s safety. He testified that after leaving the taxi stand, he was still feeling shocked that he had been punched.[^49] He also claimed that while he was waiting downhill for David, he was feeling “very scared at that point because \[he\] had been hit in the face”, and therefore “wanted to make sure \[he\] had a line of sight” to David.[^50]

66     The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s account was susceptible to challenge on many fronts. It was submitted that both sides were aggressive during the verbal dispute. The accused and David were not passive and blameless as they portrayed themselves to be, but had actively retorted to defend themselves.[^51] David had in fact testified that the accused was “quite a lot louder than \[him\]”.[^52] According to the victim Neil, the accused had even “pushed \[him\] in the shoulder” during the argument.[^53]

67     I have noted that the Prosecution witnesses had all testified that the security guards had removed the _accused and David_ from the premises,[^54] whereas Neil’s party was allowed to remain where they were. In my view, this suggests that the accused and David were adjudged to be the source of trouble by the security officers. Further, PW4 Reema and PW3 Priya both recalled one of the security guards saying to them that the accused and David had been “_causing trouble all night and that a lot of people had complained about them that evening_”.[^55]

68     It was further submitted by the Prosecution that even if it were accepted that the accused felt some impact on his face, the Defence has grossly exaggerated the amount of force used and its effect on the accused. In EIC, the accused and David attempted to play up the forcefulness of the alleged punch. According to the accused, the punch was so strong that it caused him to “stumble\[\] backwards”.[^56] It also cast a shadow over him for the rest of the night as he repeatedly recalled “just want\[ing\] to go home”.[^57] According to David, the punch was delivered by a “\[swing\] around the security guard … with a lot of force”, leaving a “big bump on \[the accused’s\] forehead”. He added that “it really connected with Sam … he stood back, you know, in shock.”[^58]

69     The Prosecution submitted that these were wild allegations that were not substantiated by the objective facts. I agreed with this submission for the same reasons as set out below.

70     The Prosecution had referred to the objective facts pertaining to the accused’s injury. It was submitted that during cross-examination, the accused had conceded that he sustained only redness and swelling, and “did not feel any pain beyond just the swelling”.[^59] He “believe\[d\] that the injury was most likely superficial”[^60] and agreed that he did not require medical attention.[^61] In fact, he likened the injury to that sustained through a casual fall or bump:[^62]

> “ _I’ve had plenty of swelling from, um, falling and bumping my arm, and I’ve had bruising before that hasn’t resulted in any, uh, significant injury.”_

71     Further, as the accused said in his statement dated 10 January 2018, his injury was “\[n\]othing serious”.[^63]

72     In view of the above, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no basis for the Defence’s claim that the alleged “punch”, if any, was a forceful one.

73     The Prosecution further submitted that the objective facts pertaining to the accused’s immediate reaction also show that the Defence’s account is overstated. When David asked if he was alright, the accused replied, “I’m fine.”[^64] In David’s words, the incident was minor enough for the accused to “shrug it off”.[^65] Rather than pain or fear, David perceived that the accused was “really _surprised_ … more than anything”.[^66] This suggests that the accused was merely shocked at the _abruptness_ of the impact, which says nothing about the degree and type of force used.

74     In the light of this, the Prosecution submitted that the Defence’s account of the alleged punch should be rejected. Additionally, David’s evidence that the punch was accompanied by a “strong sound” should also be rejected.[^67] This detail only emerged during cross-examination, after the Prosecution suggested that the punch thrown by the accused at Neil was much more forceful because David had heard a “solid thump” when it impacted Neil.[^68] The Prosecution submitted that David had engaged in a belated attempt to equalise both uses of force as having the same intensity.

75     I agreed with the Prosecution. In my view, this was an afterthought by David and also not consistent with the objective evidence of the “nothing serious” injury suffered by the accused. Accordingly, I rejected the Defence’s characterisation and account of the alleged punch.

## (ii)   The accused was not punched by Neil or Kanak at the Taxi stand

76     Continuing with the Defence argument on the right of private defence based on the alleged punch suffered by the accused, I note that the accused himself testified that he did not see who had allegedly hit him.[^69] In stark contrast, David, however, claimed to be “100% certain” that Kanak had punched the accused.[^70]

77     The Prosecution submitted that David’s uncorroborated claim is however contradicted by all the Prosecution witnesses and the objective circumstances. It was submitted that none of the Prosecution witnesses saw the accused being hit on the face.[^71] It was their consistent evidence that the dispute at the taxi stand was only verbal and not physical,[^72] and that the two sides were separated after the security guards intervened.[^73]

78     In any case, I note that the Defence did not put to Kanak that he had punched the accused at the taxi stand. Rather, Counsel had actually put to Neil that “someone in the crowd hit the accused.”[^74] It was not the Defence case that Kanak had hit the accused. Instead, the Defence now asserts in their written submissions that it was this punch that caused the accused to reasonably apprehend that force would be used against him or David later on.[^75] In my view, this is a significant fact in issue and the failure to put it to Kanak offends the rule in _Browne v Dunn._ The Defence is thus taken to have accepted Kanak’s testimony that it was merely a “verbal confrontation”.[^76]

79     Furthermore, according to the accused and David, the punch occurred only after security guards had stepped in between both sides.[^77] As the accused later told David in a Whatsapp message, “there were 2 security guards between him and me” at this point.[^78] Kanak likewise recalled two security guards coming in to separate the two groups.[^79] This would mean that whoever threw the punch would have had to reach over across two security guards to hit the accused in the face. In my view, such an obvious assault in front of 2 security officers is hard to believe or accept for its sheer audacity. It is also equally difficult to believe that Kanak would have the effrontery to assault the accused in full view of the security guards and thereby risk himself also being arrested by Police for carrying out an assault.

80     I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that there is no basis or even any available evidence before the court to conclude and find that Kanak or Neil had earlier assaulted the accused at the taxi stand. This being the case, it follows that there was nothing about the earlier events at the taxi stand that could reasonably have led the accused to fear for his or David’s safety. Moreover, I am also mindful that some 10 minutes or so had elapsed between the incident at the taxi stand and the second incident on the hill.[^80] In my view, any fear the accused could possibly have felt would have long dissipated in those intervening 10 minutes. Again therefore, there was nothing about the earlier events at the taxi stand that could _reasonabl_y have led the accused to fear for his or David’s safety and thereby justify his later punching of the victim.

## (iii)   The accused was not justified in applying the force that he had unleashed upon Neil’s face

81     The Defence had made much of “_what had happened through the night_” in their written submissions. It was further submitted that the “_victim and his friend had an aggressive bent._” The Defence even went on further to submit that “_the accused was justified in applying the force that he did.”_[^81]

82     In view of the above Defence submission, the events of the night require some enhanced scrutiny. In this regard, the account of the Defence given earlier through the accused and David, regarding the events immediately preceding the punch thrown at the victim, was as follows. While waiting at the road junction downhill from the Swiss Club,[^82] the accused saw David surrounded by the victim’s party about halfway back up the hill. He heard David yell, “get away from me” and immediately ran up the hill with his arms outstretched in front of him, shouting at the victim’s party to “_just go home_”. At this point, Neil grabbed on to the accused’s left shirt sleeve. The accused shouted “let go” more than once, and tried multiple times to pull his arm away to no avail. He then punched Neil on his face to release himself from Neil’s grip.

83     The Prosecution submitted that nothing in this account gives rise to a right of self-defence. It was submitted that first, insofar as the accused claims to have come to David’s aid, the evidence in totality shows that David was not in danger from anyone in the victim’s party. Even David’s own evidence was that the victim’s party was issuing only verbal insults at him as they crossed paths.[^83] The victim’s party made no physical contact with David. Further, David was actually the aggressor who had “shoved \[Kanak\] to the side”[^84] and, in his own words, “_pushed \[Kanak\] over into the mud_”.[^85] This push caused Kanak to fall backwards and onto the ground.[^86]

84     The Prosecution further submitted that Neil had good reason to restrain the accused by his sleeves out of fear for his and his companions’ safety. Just as Neil noticed the accused near them, he saw that Kanak had fallen to the ground.[^87] It was a reasonable assumption by Neil that Kanak had been pushed. Furthermore, the accused had _charged_ towards the victim’s party from some distance at a high speed, with his arms outstretched in front of him. As the accused himself explained in EIC :[^88]

> “I _ran as fast__as I could_ to get up to where he was at. Um, I ran up the hill and, as I said, _it would’ve been 50 or 60 metres_ … when I arrived at the scene … I immediately _put my hands out in front of me_ and my palms out towards the gentlemen …”

> (Emphasis added)

85     I note at this juncture, that the accused had demonstrated this gesture in court by standing up and raising both arms to around or above shoulder level, perpendicular to his body, with his palms facing out.[^89] David likewise recalled the accused “sprinting” towards the victim’s party whilst “shouting”:[^90]

> … the next thing I remember was Sam _sprinting_ up the road. … \[H\]e _sprinted out_ and he was---he was _shouting as he was coming up_ … \[emphasis added\]

> (Emphasis added)

86     The above account by both the accused and David is significant.

87     I pause here to observe that even the Prosecution witness PW3 Patel Priya, had testified that she saw the accused “_running across in towards_” Neil.[^91]

88     I agree with the above submissions of the Prosecution. At the same time, as I have mentioned in an earlier part of this judgment at paragraph \[36\], I had observed very closely both the accused and Neil in court, including their physique, mannerisms, body size and build. I find that although both Neil and the accused were about the same height, I was of the firm view that given the accused’s large build and size, it would have been an intimidating and fearsome sight to see him approaching swiftly from a distance and coming up the hill and shouting at the same time. Under these daunting circumstances, it would have been reasonable for Neil to fear for his own safety and even his friends and thereby cause him to restrain the accused by the sleeves when the accused put his arms out in front of him. Further, when considered objectively, the accused’s behaviour and gestures were neither passive nor submissive as he eagerly claimed in court. From the evidence, I also note that no one in the victim’s party had heard his plea for them to “go home”.[^92] Even David could not make out what “loud noises” the accused was yelling as he sprinted up.[^93] As is well known, mere words are always neutral in and of themselves. However, it is the tone of voice, non-verbal gestures and the overall background of the exchange that can make a significant difference as to how the same words are perceived by the listener. In my view, contrary to what was suggested by the accused, depending on the tone in which the words “go home” were uttered, these words can be threatening and not docile or submissive.

89     Be that as it may, I was in total agreement with the Prosecution that Neil’s grip on the accused’s sleeves cannot by any stretch of the imagination, constitute an offence against the accused’s body. Neither can Neil’s grip provide a valid reason for the accused to apprehend that Neil would commit an offence against the accused’s body. To assert otherwise, is to be engaging in the fanciful. Firstly, it is undisputed that Neil was holding onto the _sleeves_ of the accused and _not his arms._ Secondly, it is also undisputed that Neil was holding onto the sleeve material by the bottom, just below the accused’s elbow.[^94] For better context, what was actually disputed was (i) whether Neil held one or both sleeves of the accused; and (ii) the amount of force used by Neil to restrain the accused.

90     The Prosecution had also submitted that Neil’s evidence was that he held onto _both_ sleeves of the accused. This was also corroborated by Kanak.[^95] To my mind, this also accords with common sense because Neil’s only intention was to prevent the accused from pushing or hitting anyone else.[^96] Further, it would have been futile for Neil to have held only _one_ sleeve and left the accused’s other arm free to cause harm to others. In my view, there is also no valid reason or purpose for Neil to lie about having held onto both, and not one, sleeve. Accordingly, I accept Neil’s recollection over that of the accused.

91     I also note from the evidence of Neil that he had applied only enough pressure to restrain the accused from pushing or hitting anyone. Neil had clarified that he held the shirt sleeves of the accused firmly but did not apply any downward force:[^97]

> Q    When you were holding on to the sleeves, can you tell us how you were holding on to it? … \[H\]ow much pressure did you apply when you were holding on to it?

> A    Well, just enough to prevent the accused from pushing o---or hitting anyone.

> Q    Was there any downward motion or---or were you actually pulling downwards?

> A    I don’t believe so.

92     As such, I took the view, having considered the totality of the evidence, and also having considered very carefully the demeanour of both the victim Neil and the accused, that Neil’s evidence was more credible and to be preferred over the accused’s claim that Neil restrained him with such force that he could not break himself free.[^98] I also noted Kanak’s testimony that he had witnessed the accused succeeding in pulling his right arm away from Neil with a backward motion _even before he hit Neil._[^99] This is a significant and crucial piece of evidence that was not challenged by the Defence. Further, Neil also gave clear evidence that it was as he felt the accused’s hand breaking free that he felt an immediate blow to his head.[^100] In other words, the blow was almost instantaneous and without any interval after the accused managed to free his right hand sleeve from the grip of Neil. Furthermore, the accused had succeeded in freeing himself _on his attempt_, as Neil had maintained under cross-examination:[^101]

> Q    Okay. And he tried to break your grip on him, correct?

> A    That’s correct.

> Q    And he was u---u---first unable to do so, correct?

> A    I don’t think that’s correct.

93     In this regard, I pause to note that as explained at paragraph \[36 \] earlier, the account given by Neil and Kanak is consistent with the accused’s physique and likely strength when compared to Neil.

94     The Prosecution also submitted that considering that Neil was merely restraining the accused by the sleeves with both hands, the accused’s apprehension of danger to his body was not reasonable. Neil had made no contact with any part of the accused’s body.

95     I agreed with the Prosecution submission. In my view, Neil was being careful to ensure that there was _no skin on skin_ contact. His action of holding the accused’s sleeves firmly, with no downward motion, showed that he was not on the offensive. It was in my estimation, an entirely precautionary posture to prevent the accused from hitting out at or pushing anyone from the victim’s group. Furthermore, since his own hands were ‘restrained’ by his own act of holding onto the shirt sleeves of the accused, it was not possible at all for Neil in my view, to have struck at any part of the accused’s body with his hands.

96     Finally, I need to make mention of what was a clear attempt in my view of the accused trying to paint himself as a weak and helpless victim to gain the sympathy of the court. He claimed that when he “realised that \[he\] couldn’t break \[him\]self free … that’s when \[he\] began to fear for what \[Neil\] was going to do to \[him\]”. He further claimed that Neil could do much damage with both his sleeves held:[^102]

> _“He absolutely would have been able to hurt me further. He could have thrown me to the ground with both of those. Um, he could have pulled on me. He could have thrown me to the side. … \[H\]e absolutely could have thrown me to the ground. I could have tripped; I could have fallen. He could have pulled me; he could have pushed me. Absolutely.”_

97     As I have mentioned in an earlier part of this judgment when examining the credibility of the accused at paragraph \[36\], I find these assertions of the accused as feeble as they are fanciful. These fearful speculations of the accused are both irrational and totally implausible when one consider the relative build and size of both Neil and the accused. Further, it is unbelievable that Neil, being at the same height, if not shorter and clearly of much smaller build than the accused, could have thrown judo-like the accused onto the ground. As mentioned earlier, both Neil’s hands were self-restrained since he was defensively holding onto the shirt sleeves of the accused. For the accused to even put forward such a tepid suggestion that he could have been hurt or thrown to the ground by Neil is to my mind, a clear indication of his propensity to fanciful exaggeration. More importantly, it reinforced my assessment that he was unworthy of credit.

98     In view of the above considerations, I find that there was no basis in law or on the facts for the accused to put forward a valid claim that he had acted in self-defence when he forcefully punched Neil on the face.

## (iv)   The accused did not attempt to seek help from the relevant public authorities when there was a reasonable opportunity for him to do so

99     Finally, as based on _Tan Chor Jin v PP_, it had also to be shown that the accused did not attempt to seek help from the relevant public authorities when there was a reasonable opportunity for him to do so.

100    In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that the accused had claimed that there was no one else in the area at that time. It was submitted that the accused could have gone back to the taxi stand outside the Swiss Club where there were plenty of people and several security guards.[^103] The accused was still within the vicinity of the taxi stand at the material time.

101    Here, I note that it was put to the accused by the DPP during cross-examination, that he could have just run away from Neil.[^104]I further note also that based on the accused’s own testimony, Neil had only held onto the sleeve of his non-dominant left arm.[^105]From the evidence, it was clear also that the accused’s friend, David, was also in close proximity to the accused.[^106]In my view, it was eminently reasonable for the accused to have enlisted the assistance of David. This is something the accused himself conceded.[^107]Considering also the specific context, Neil was merely holding onto the accused’s sleeves. This was certainly not an attacking or even a pre-attack posture. He did not carry out any other overt acts or threats of any kind. He also did not make any gestures or preparatory steps to attack the accused. In such benign circumstances, there was every reasonable opportunity for the accused to attempt to seek help from public authorities and to dis-engage from the emerging situation. He however did not make any such attempt but instead took matters into his own hands.

102    Under the above circumstances, the accused’s failure to make any attempt to seek help from the relevant public authorities when there was every reasonable opportunity for him to do so, also precludes him from relying on the right of private defence to justify his assault on Neil.

## B.   Even if the right of private defence arose, the accused inflicted more harm than was necessary

103    It is undisputed that the victim had suffered serious injuries in the nature of multiple _facial fractures_ that were directly attributable to the single punch he had inflicted on the face of the victim Neil. The Defence submitted that the “_accused was justified in applying the force that he did._”[^108] The Prosecution however submitted that even if it were accepted that the accused had a right to self-defence, he had exceeded that right by inflicting more harm than was necessary to defend himself.

104    On this issue, I note that it was submitted by the Prosecution that all that was necessary to free the accused’s left sleeve was to push Neil’s hand away, push Neil on the chest or right shoulder, pull the accused’s own left arm away, or simply walk away. I note that in his oral testimony, the accused had even accepted that he could have done some of these acts.[^109] In my view, it certainly would have been far more easier and natural for the accused to have done these actions if he truly _only_ wanted to free himself. As put to the accused by the DPP, the chest or shoulder had a larger surface area than the face.[^110] I find that the fact that the accused’s punch landed squarely on Neil’s face, at the eye region, is a clear indication that the accused intended both to hit the facial region and also to inflict grievous hurt. This single punch caused multiple facial fractures. It cannot be disputed that these were serious injuries arising as a result of a demonstrable intention to cause grievous hurt.

105    I am mindful that it is common ground between the Prosecution and the Defence that the accused had his right arm free just before he threw a forceful punch at Neil’s face. I further noted that both Neil and Kanak had testified in oral evidence that the accused had managed to break free just before he released his punch onto the face of Neil. In fact, the accused’s own evidence was that his right arm was never restrained at this crucial and penultimate moment. This is vital to appreciate. It becomes immediately apparent therefore that the accused had unrestrained and full freedom of motion of his dominant right arm. At this critical point, he could have decided upon breaking free, to try and forcefully walk away or even use his freed right hand to prise free his left hand from Neil’s grasp. He did not do so. In fact, the accused did not avail himself of any of the safer and non-violent options as mentioned at paragraph \[104\] above. Instead, he made a conscious choice and deliberately chose to act in a manner that would cause more harm than was necessary to free himself.

106    Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation to conclude that it was wholly disproportionate for the accused to have thrown a forceful punch at Neil’s face that caused Neil to suffer multiple facial fractures requiring several surgical operations and the insertion of titanium plates in reconstructive surgery.

107    In view of the above, I agreed with the Prosecution submission that the accused’s claim of private defence is wholly without merit and should be rejected.

## Grave and sudden provocation

108    I turn next to deal with the argument of the Defence that there was grave and sudden provocation by the victim. Accordingly, the Defence submitted that the s. 325 charge should be reduced to a charge under s. 323 of the Penal Code.[^111]

109    The Prosecution submitted in reply that the arguments rejecting the claim by the accused to a right of private defence applied equally to the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation.

110    With respect, I found this argument by the Defence to be totally without merit. For the reasons already mentioned at paragraphs \[63\] – \[107\], none of the benign actions of Neil, especially his precautionary and preventive posture of holding onto the shirt sleeves of the accused to prevent the accused from causing harm, the lack of skin to skin bodily contact and the vastly superior size and build of the accused could be reasonably construed as grave, let alone sudden, provocation. I accordingly also reject the Defence argument of grave and sudden provocation.

## Conclusion

### Accused found guilty and convicted

111    In the round, I did not believe the accused’s defence which was lacking in credibility and illogical at times, especially when viewed against the totality of all the evidence adduced in court. His bare denial of intention to cause grievous hurt to Neil was unconvincing, especially when viewed against all the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses and even his own Statements to the Police and his oral testimony in court.

112    In the final analysis of all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Prosecution’s evidence was credible and that a conviction based on its evidence could not be said to be unsafe. In sum, the defence had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in my mind as to the guilt of the accused. In conclusion, I find that the Prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

113    The accused is accordingly found guilty and convicted of the s. 325 Penal Code charge against him.

## Antecedents

114    The accused is untraced and a first offender.

## Submissions by Prosecution

115    The Prosecution submitted that there were aggravating factors in this case. Based on sentencing precedents, the Prosecution submitted for 21 months imprisonment to be imposed on the accused.

## Mitigation

116    The Defence submitted that the accused was a first offender. He was a Teacher at a local international school. Testimonials of his good character were also tendered. The Defence asked for a sentence of no more than 6 months imprisonment.

## Prescribed Punishment

117    The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 325 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for life, or for a term which may extend to 10 years, and liability to fine or caning.

## Sentencing approach under S 325 of the Penal Code

118    I note that in the Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at p 266, it is stated that while the facts and circumstances of each s 325 offence vary considerably, and each case must be evaluated on its own facts, there are some general factors that courts should take into account in sentencing for this offence:

> … In general, the factors that would dominate sentence are the degree of deliberation; the extent and duration of the attack; the nature of the injury; and the use of a weapon (the dangerousness of it). The obvious aggravating factors would be premeditation, a lengthy application of violence, group assault, significant injuries, permanence of injuries, the use of a weapon, a young or otherwise vulnerable victim, abuse of position, and previous convictions ...

119    These factors were endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span>_.

120    The Court of Appeal (“CA”) in BDB at \[55\] had laid down a two-step sentencing approach for cases involving a charge under s 325 of the Penal Code. The CA held that the primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence and retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted.

121    The two-step process is as follows:

> (a)     First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

> (b)     Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

122    The Court of Appeal went on to set out a two-step sentencing approach for offences under s 325 of the Penal Code (BDB at \[55\]):

> (a)     First, an indicative starting point is derived based on the seriousness of the injury, which is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence considering that a more severe sentencing range is prescribe precisely because _grievous_ hurt has been caused (at \[56\]). The seriousness of the injury is assessed along a spectrum, having regard to considerations such as the nature and permanence of the injury. The starting points for two kinds of injury were laid down (at \[56\]):

>> i.       where death is caused, the indicative starting point is around eight years;

>> ii.       where multiple fractures of the type and gravity as in the sixth charge in _BDB_ (_ie_, fractures to the left elbow, left calf and right 8th to 11th ribs) is caused, the indicative starting point is around three years and six months.

> (b)     Second, the indicative starting point should be adjusted upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

123    The Prosecution also referred to the recent High Court decision of _Low Song Chye v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“Low Song Chye”)_. Here, See J applied a similar two-step framework to offences under s 323 of the Penal Code. In respect of the first step, See J considered the wide spectrum of hurt encapsulated in the relatively circumscribed sentencing range for s 323 (at paragraph \[76\]). See J then laid down sentencing bands (for plead-guilty cases) based on 3 categories of harm:

> (a)     Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions;

> (b)     Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function; and

> (c)     Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures.

124    The Prosecution also submitted that offences under s 325 of the Penal Code by definition involve grievous hurt that constitutes at least moderate harm as classified in _PP v Low Song Chye_. It was further submitted that the approach in _PP v Low Song Chye_ was relevant to show that degrees of harm may be evaluated using factors such as the permanence of the injury, the degree of medical intervention, and the length of the hospitalisation or medical leave. I agreed with the Prosecution that _PP v Low Song Chye_ was useful in this regard.

125    As for the Defence, it was submitted initially that 3-4 months imprisonment would suffice. During oral submissions, Counsel clarified that having heard from the Prosecution, his new staring point based on the decision in _PP v Arumugam_ would be 7-8 months imprisonment.[^112] In that case, the victim had suffered an injury of a right middle finger fracture. When the court queried whether this single finger fracture injury was the same seriousness as the injuries suffered by the victim Neil, Counsel initially took the position that the injuries were of the same level of seriousness. Later, after realizing that the victim had suffered _multiple_ facial fractures, Counsel then conceded that Neil’s injuries were more serious.

126    The Prosecution also noted during oral submissions that the Court of Appeal in _PP v BDB_ did not provide guidance on the starting points for other types of grievous hurt, apart from death and multiple fractures of the sort in the sixth charge therein. However, it was submitted that a review of relevant precedents[^113] indicated that the starting point where a single nasal bone fracture and associated minor injuries are caused is at least six months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution further submitted that in _Rehana Perveen v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 248</span>_, the court stated (at \[69\]) that “\[t\]he sentencing norm for a case under Section 325 of the Penal Code wherein a simple fracture is caused is an imprisonment term of 6 months”. I noted however that in that case, the injury involved was a fracture to the little finger.

127    Considering the facts of the present case, there was not one but multiple fractures caused. A further distinguishing feature was that the fractures were orbital fractures, and not just a nasal bone fracture or a finger fracture. Additionally, there was permanent impairment of vision. In my view, the starting point should therefore be higher than six months’ imprisonment.

128    The Prosecution also referred to the recent case of _PP v P Rajenthirun <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 95</span>_. Here the victim had suffered a laceration over the forehead; laceration over bilateral eyebrows; laceration over the lip; tenderness over the left chest wall and multiple fractures related to the right bony orbit/partially imaged maximally sinus. The District Court considered that the sentencing range for the type and severity of the injuries suffered by the victim in that case would be between 18 and 24 months’ imprisonment. The sentence imposed in that case was upheld on appeal (Magistrate’s Appeal 9110 of 2018).

129    Having referred to the above precedents, the Prosecution submitted that Neil’s injuries are of a similar type and severity to the injuries of the victim in _PP v Rajenthirun_ as Neil had also suffered multiple fractures to the left orbital floor and maxillary walls and a left zygomatic arch fracture. Further, Neil’s injuries had resulted in permanent impairment to Neil’s peripheral vision. Therefore, a similar sentencing range of 18 to 24 months’ imprisonment should apply.

130    I agreed with the above submissions of the Prosecution. All considered, I was of the view that a suitable starting point would be at least 18 months’ imprisonment.

131    To further assist the court, the Prosecution had also provided a table of relevant precedents and further submissions on the appropriate sentence to be imposed having regard to the seriousness of the injuries suffered by Neil. I found the precedents and the accompanying submissions[^114]very persuasive and have accordingly set it out in full as follows –

> **“Relevant Precedents**

> _24_.     _The Prosecution submits that the sentence of_ **_at least 21 months’ imprisonment_** _is wholly in line with the precedents. While the precedents must each be evaluated on their own facts, it is relevant to consider the cases in the following table to ensure that the sentence meted out is proportionate along the scale of s 325 offences._

> _25_.     _The severity of Neil’s injuries is most on par with those of the victims in P Rajenthirun (S/No 2) and Tay Fook Yuan (S/No 3). While certain aggravating factors, such as the offender’s use of a metal pole and violent antecedents in P Rajenthirun and multiple victims in Tay Fook Yuan, do not apply here, there were mitigating circumstances in those cases. The offender in P Rajenthirun had pleaded guilty to his offence and the offender in Tay Fook Yuan had made voluntary partial compensation. Additionally, the present case features other aggravating factors, such as the Accused’s voluntary intoxication, that were absent on the facts of both P Rajenthirun and Tay Fook Yuan. Moreover, Neil suffered permanent impairment to his vision while the victims in P Rajenthirun and Tay Fook Yuan do not appear to have sustained injuries of a permanent nature. On balance, the Prosecution submits that a sentence of at least 21 months’ imprisonment would be entirely fair in the present case._

> _26_.     _Finally, in Win Thu Ya (S/No 2), an attack that inflicted the victim with four facial fractures merited a starting point of three years’ imprisonment, which was reduced to 30 months’ imprisonment on account of the significant remorse shown by the offender. Adjusting downwards for Neil’s multiple fractures at a single site on his face, but considering his lasting peripheral double vision and the lack of mitigating factors, a sentence of 21 months’ imprisonment would be proportionate to the gravity of the offence._

> 27.     _Taking all the facts in the round, the Prosecution urges this Honourable Court to sentence the Accused to_ **_at least 21 months’ imprisonment_** _.”_

## Sentence imposed by Court

#### Sentencing considerations

132    I note that the victim Neil had been playing the role of a Good Samaritan. Racist remarks had been uttered earlier at the taxi stand outside the Swiss Club. The feuding parties had been separated by the security guards. Now a mere minutes later, he had just seen his friend Kanak being pushed to the ground. He saw the earlier feuding group in front of him. He felt scared. He then held onto the sleeves of the accused to prevent him causing any harm. It was then that he was punched by the accused and fell to the ground. After being felled by the accused’s punch, Neil had drifted in and out of consciousness. He has since undergone surgery to reconstruct his eye socket, in the process of which, titanium plates were inserted. Neil has also had to go for follow-up appointments once a month initially, and once every three months, one and a half years after the incident. Till today and for the rest of his life, Neil suffers from an impairment of his vision – peripheral diplopia. Based on the nature of the injuries he has suffered, I am of the view that the harm inflicted by the accused is in the serious category.

133    I turn now to the culpability of the accused and the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors.

134    Apart from the fact that the accused was a first offender, there were hardly any mitigating factors in this case.

135    The accused had claimed trial. He is therefore not entitled to any sentencing discount that might otherwise have been granted in view of a timely plea of guilt that would have evidenced his remorse or which would have saved on the costs of a trial. This was recently stated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> at \[73\]_.

136    Even in mitigation, there was no expression of remorse as the accused attempted to lay the blame on the victim. I find that the accused was far from contrite for his actions and for his role in the assault.

137    As for culpability of the accused, I can accept that there was no premeditation and no use of weapons but the absence of these factors were neutral, not mitigating. On the contrary, there were several aggravating factors in this case. The accused was intoxicated, the attack was unprovoked and a forceful punch had been inflicted on a vulnerable part of the body causing multiple facial fractures.

#### Issue of Compensation

138    The Prosecution informed the court that most of the accused’s medical expenses were covered by insurance. Therefore, the Prosecution asked the court to consider making a compensation order for the out of pocket medical expenses incurred by the victim. The Defence on their part, did not object to pay these medical expenses of the victim.

139    Having regard to the above factors and all the surrounding circumstances, the accused is sentenced to a term of 20 months’ imprisonment for the s. 325 Penal Code charge on which he has been found guilty and convicted. I also made a compensation order of $1,000, in default one (1) week's imprisonment.

140    The accused is presently on bail pending appeal. I have ordered a stay of execution on the sentence of imprisonment imposed and the order of compensation.
