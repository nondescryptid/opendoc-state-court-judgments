Contract – Breach

13 April 2021

### District Judge Lynette Yap:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff and the defendant were shareholders of two companies known as Sheenway Exhibition & Projects Pte Ltd (“SE&P”) and Sheenway Exhibition Pte Ltd. The present suit concerned only SE&P where the plaintiff was the minority shareholder holding 40% of the shares in SE&P and the defendant was the majority shareholder holding 60% of the shares in SE&P.

2       Differences arose between the parties and on 5 March 2013, they entered into an agreement which was written in Chinese (“the Settlement Agreement”)[^1].

3       The plaintiff commenced this suit against the defendant on 5 January 2018, alleging that the defendant had breached various terms of the Settlement Agreement. This was a bifurcated trial with only the issue of liability before the court. The issue of damages would be assessed in the event of the defendant’s breach.

## The plaintiff’s case

4       On 1 March 2013, an accountant appointed by the defendant, one Ms Trina Lim from Trina Lim & Co, assessed that the total assets of SE&P were $585,550.50, which included accounts receivables at $538,573.50. The total liabilities of SE&P were assessed at $205,381.65[^2].

5       On 5 March 2013, both parties signed the Settlement Agreement, which provided, _inter alia_, that “From 5 March 2013, both parties may not, in the name of (SE&P) obtain materials from the company’s material suppliers or accept any job”; “From 1 March 2013, the company will cease all operations except for the collection of outstanding debts, after which it will permanently cease all operations. The company will be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred before 1 March 2013” and that “In the event of violation of any terms listed in this agreement, the party who breaches the agreement shall be responsible for all losses incurred by the other party.”

6       On 5 March 2013, the same day the Settlement Agreement was signed, both the plaintiff and the defendant also appended their signatures to a one-page document which listed various companies from which receivables to SE&P were due. The total amount of receivables was tabulated at $531,933.20[^3]. The plaintiff explained in her AEIC that parties had agreed to revise the total receivables of SE&P from $538,573.50, as determined by Ms Trina Lim on 1 March 2013, to $531,933.20. Another one-page document with some small adjustments to the figure was also exhibited by the plaintiff which stated that the total amount of receivables was further revised to $532,184.70 on 11 March 2013[^4].

7       Based on the pleaded cases of the plaintiff and the defendant, the following issues were undisputed:

> (a)     “the defendant, as the director of the 2 companies, would see to it that both companies would be ceasing all activities and operations and to collect the receivables due to the companies, which amounts were annexed to the Settlement Agreement and which were signed off by the plaintiff and the defendant on 5 March 2013”[^5];

> (b)     “if any of the terms are violated, the party who breached the agreement shall be responsible for all losses incurred by the other party”[^6]; and

> (c)     “after the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff was no longer privy to the activities of the 2 companies and the defendant was tasked with collecting the monies and to thereafter close down the 2 companies and the monies distributed amongst the shareholders, of which the plaintiff was holding 40% of the shares compared to the defendant’s 60% in SE&P”[^7].

8       The plaintiff claimed that on or about 26 April 2017, she discovered that SE&P was “struck off” on 10 January 2017[^8]. The plaintiff then discovered from copies of the Director’s Reports and accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports of SE&P for the years 2012 to 2018 provided by the defendant that there were unexplained expenses and outgoing payments which suggested that after the Settlement Agreement was entered into, business activities had continued in SE&P. The plaintiff further discovered that the defendant’s daughter, Ms Mai Shuhui had been appointed a director of SE&P on 1 July 2015 and the defendant had transferred one share in SE&P to her.

9       The plaintiff asserted that due to the defendant’s breach of the Settlement Agreement in carrying on business operations at SE&P after 5 March 2013, the company’s liabilities increased from $457,458 as at 31 August 2013 (when business operations should already have ceased for at least 5 months) to $713,318 as at 31 August 2016[^9]. The plaintiff brought this claim against the defendant for breaching the Settlement Agreement in allowing SE&P to continue operating after 5 March 2013 and for failing to divide the collected receivables in shares proportionate to the parties’ respective shareholdings in SE&P.

## The defendant’s case

10     The defendant did not deny that on 5 March 2013, he had signed the Settlement Agreement and the one-page document which listed various companies from which receivables to SE&P were due.

11     The defendant denied that he was in breach of the Settlement Agreement. He contended that the plaintiff had no direct evidence that SE&P had continued business activities after 5 March 2013. He further contended that it was not an express term of the Settlement Agreement that the collected receivables were to be divided without first taking into account SE&P’s debts and expenses.

12     The defendant asserted that necessary expenses had been incurred to collect the receivables due to SE&P and that these expenses included engaging solicitors to act against customers who refused to pay. He further contended that his daughter, Ms Mai Shuhui was appointed as a director of SE&P to handle the administrative matters of SE&P, which included dealing with SE&P’s company secretary Alfa Business Solutions and engaging solicitors to take legal action against customers who refused to pay, as the defendant was not literate in English. He stated that both he and his daughter received reasonable sums for their work done in collecting SE&P’s receivables and managing SE&P’s various matters.

13     The defendant denied that SE&P had been “struck off” on 10 January 2017. He expressly pleaded in his Defence that on 1 December 2017, his solicitors had informed the plaintiff’s solicitors that the Annual Report of SE&P as at 31 August 2017 was being prepared and there would be an Annual General Meeting of SE&P in February or March 2018[^10].

## The issues for determination

14     At the commencement of the trial, parties stated that the agreed issues for the court’s determination were as follows:

> (a)     Whether the defendant had acted in breach of the Settlement Agreement by allowing SE&P to continue operating;

> (b)     Whether the defendant had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to divide the collected receivables in shares proportionate to the parties’ respective shareholdings in SE&P.

15     Both parties testified for themselves and the plaintiff called Mr Wong Loke Liang Kelvin, (“Mr Wong”) a Chartered Accountant, to testify as an expert witness. The defendant did not call his daughter or any other witnesses to testify.

## Whether the defendant had breached the Settlement Agreement by allowing SE&P to continue operating

16     The plaintiff alleged that contrary to parties’ intentions to cease all activities other than the collection of debts after 5 March 2013, SE&P continued its business activities. The plaintiff relied on the information stated in the Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports for the years 2012 to 2018, as well as the evidence of Mr Wong.

17     The defendant denied that SE&P continued its business activities after the Settlement Agreement was signed on 5 March 2013. The defendant contended that the plaintiff did not have any direct evidence that SE&P had continued business activities after 5 March 2013 and Mr Wong’s opinion and the Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports “falls within the realm of circumstantial evidence” with limited evidentiary value[^11]. The defendant contended that Mr Wong’s evidence was problematic and that the Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports were limited and did not give the full picture[^12].

### Expert evidence from Mr Wong

18     Mr Wong testified that he had reviewed the Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports for the years 2012 to 2018, as well as the Settlement Agreement entered between the parties. He opined that from the Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports, the defendant had kept SE&P operational after 5 March 2013.

19     The defendant’s contention with regards to the evidence of Mr Wong, was that his evidence was inadmissible as it was not in compliance with the requirements of an expert’s evidence under O 40A r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322). He highlighted various deficiencies including the argument that Mr Wong’s evidence was not in a written report exhibited in an affidavit but given in the affidavit itself and that Mr Wong had not included a statement that he understood that in giving a report, his duties were to the Court and that he would comply with that duty.

20     The legal position with regards to non-compliance with O 40A r 3 is clear. The Court of Appeal in _Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 308</span> stated at \[173\]:

> Non-compliance, at best goes to weight and does not automatically render the evidence in admissible. Second, O 2 r 1(2) makes it clear that the court may give such order dealing with the proceedings generally “as it thinks fit” notwithstanding an instance of non-compliance with the Rules of Court. Lastly, the court also has inherent powers, as recognised under O 92 r 4, to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Rules of Court…

21     Therefore, while Mr Wong did not comply with O 40A r 3, this did not render his evidence inadmissible, and at best went towards weight.

22     Mr Wong’s conclusion that SE&P had continued business operations after March 2013 was essentially premised on three bases:

> (a)     SE&P’s trade receivables should only have reduced with the passage of time after 5 March 2013, as a company which had ceased business operations could not incur fresh receivables;

> (b)     Increased payables to the director, in the form of loans from the director to the company, should not have been incurred by a company that had ceased business operations and no longer required working capital;

> (c)     Expenses such as commissions, employee benefits and lease rentals should not have been incurred by a company that had ceased business operations.

23     With regards to Mr Wong’s evidence, I am guided by the principles laid down by the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Anita Damu v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 825</span> at \[36\] as follows:

> To my mind, the true ambit of the ultimate issue rule in the modern context is not that an expert is prohibited from expressing an opinion on the ultimate issue, but that the judge must discharge his responsibility as the adjudicator to rule on the ultimate issue. In doing so, he must not simply adopt the expert’s opinion on that issue without satisfying himself that this is the correct outcome. Thus, even where an expert has expressed an opinion on how she thinks the ultimate issue is to be resolved the court must nonetheless, in the words of the Court of Appeal in (_Eu Lim Hoklai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 167</span>) at \[44\], “resort to the usual methods it employs in all other cases which do not require expert evidence: that is \[by\] sifting, weighing and evaluating the objective facts within their circumstantial matrix and context in order to arrive at a final finding of fact”.

24     Therefore, in the present case, Mr Wong’s evidence in so far as it purports to opine on the ultimate issue of whether SE&P had continued operating will not be prohibited, but this Court will not simply adopt his opinion on that issue and will employ the usual methods of sifting, weighing and evaluating all the evidence to arrive at a final finding of fact.

### Director’s Reports and Financial Statements in the Annual Reports

25     The evidence showed that the defendant himself had signed the Director’s Reports for the years 2012 to 2014 and his daughter had signed the Director’s Reports for the years 2015 to 2018. It was stated clearly above the defendant’s signature in the Director’s Reports for the years 2012 to 2014 that in the defendant’s opinion, the “financial statements… are drawn up so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company…”. The defendant’s daughter had also signed the Director’s Reports for the years 2015 to 2018 which had stated that in her opinion, the “unaudited financial statements of the Company… are drawn up so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company…”.

26     Further, during cross-examination, the defendant confirmed that he agreed with these Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports and he himself had submitted these reports as evidence for the trial[^13]. This admission was not pursued by the defendant’s counsel in re-examination. I will also add that despite the defendant’s allegations he had to engage a new accountant one Eric Tay to re-do SE&P’s accounts to correct the alleged inaccuracies, the defendant did not adduce these restated accounts into evidence[^14]. The defendant’s counsel later confirmed that her position was that these restated accounts were not relevant to the current proceedings[^15]. I therefore find that the Director’s Reports and the accompanying financial statements in the Annual Reports form a reasonable basis for assessing if SE&P had continued business activities after the relevant date.

### The increase in SE&P’s trade receivables

27     The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2014 showed that there was an increase in the trade receivables from $118,589 in 2013 to $301,226 in 2014[^16]. When the defendant was offered the opportunity to explain during cross-examination, he was unable to provide any explanation and asserted that he could not read accounts[^17]. I accept the plaintiff’s submissions that the increase in trade receivables suggested that SE&P had continued operating. In the absence of a reasonable explanation from the defendant, I found it difficult to accept why the trade receivables would have increased if SE&P was no longer operational as there would have been no new business activity.

### The defendant’s loans to SE&P

28     The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2013 showed that the defendant’s loans to SE&P increased from $141,950 in 2012 to $450,878 in 2013[^18]. This amounted to an increase of $308,928.

29     The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2014 showed that the defendant’s loans to SE&P increased further to $712,905[^19]. This amounted to an increase of $262,027.

30     The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2015 showed that the defendant’s loans to SE&P increased even further to $715,190[^20]. This amounted to an increase of $2,285.

31     The defendant denied that he had extended these loans to SE&P. Despite his certification in the Director’s Reports that the accounts provided a full and fair view of SE&P’s state of affairs, he sought to explain that the records of these loans were merely for “accounting purposes”. He stated in paragraph 37 of his AEIC that:

> In 2014, Alfa informed me that they would be unable to meet the requisite deadlines for the filing of annual returns without reconciling the accounts. I thus accepted Alfa’s suggestions to reflect the discrepancies as an amount payable to myself, as a director, and to adjust the trade receivables in the unaudited accounts so as to accurately reflect the sums owed by each debtor. As a result of these adjustments, SE&P’s non-trade payables to a director appeared to rise from $450,878 to $712,905 in 2014. For the same reason, SE&P’s trade receivables appeared to rise from $118,589 to $301,226 in 2014. These adjustments were made purely for accounting purposes.”

32     The defendant’s explanations were puzzling. I also note that the defendant did not call anyone from SE&P’s company secretary Alfa Business Solutions to testify that they had made this suggestion to him. His reason for adjusting the accounts to create an allegedly fictitious payable to himself, was purportedly to reconcile the accounts with trade receivables owed by SE&P’s debtors. I could not see why this was necessary or helpful. In any event, the allegedly fictitious increase in the payables to the defendant did not match the increase in receivables, and the defendant offered no explanation for this.

33     On balance, I accepted the plaintiff’s submissions that the evidence pointed towards the fact that loans had been made by the defendant to SE&P, which in turn suggested that SE&P was still conducting business activities after 5 March 2013 that needed working capital.

### Appointment of defendant’s daughter as sole director of SE&P

34     The defendant was replaced as the sole director of SE&P by his daughter Ms Mai Shuhui on 1 July 2015 and one share of SE&P was transferred by the defendant to his daughter[^21]. The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2015 showed that $9,360 was paid to Ms Mai Shuhui as director’s remuneration, despite there not being any director’s remuneration in the previous year[^22].

35     The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2016 showed that “employee benefits expense” comprised “director’s remuneration” at $32,760, “salaries, wages and bonuses” at $30,000 and “contribution to defined contributions plans” at $2,700[^23].

36     When the defendant was specifically asked to explain what “employee benefits expense” was during cross-examination, he stated that he did not know what it was[^24].

> Q:    And what is this “employee benefits expense” amounting to $63,462?

> A:    Now, I really don’t know what this is because I can’t tell based on the face of it. It has been so long. It…it didn’t say what it is also. Probably, you might be able to see it from the ledger.

37     When the defendant was pressed specifically on whether he had been paying salaries to employees of the company, he did not deny this, and instead continued to be evasive in answering the question.

> Q:    I’m only asking you what this “employee benefits expense”, it seems to suggest that you are paying employees of the company. Isn’t it, Mr Mai?

> A:    Well, it’s difficult to answer because there’s too many figures and too much…but if you ask me to answer this all of a sudden, then it’s difficult for me to answer. But if I can show you the company ledger, then I will be able to…to explain.

38     I accepted the plaintiff’s submissions that the records of monies paid as director’s remuneration in 2015 and “employee benefits expense” in 2016 and the defendant’s evasive responses during cross-examination, were indicators that SE&P was operational and needed to incur employee expenses.

### Commissions and operating lease rental incurred by SE&P

39     The Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2016 showed that a “commission” expense of $69,625 was incurred by SE&P. It also showed that an “operating lease rental” of $4,800 was incurred by SE&P[^25].

40     I accepted the plaintiff’s submissions that these expenses suggested that SE&P was in operation. While the defendant contended that the “commission” had been incurred as a result of engaging debt collectors to collect the receivables, he did not produce any payment vouchers or receipts to show that debt collectors had indeed been engaged[^26].

41     More importantly, it was difficult to accept the defendant’s allegations that “commission” referred to monies expended to engage debt collectors because the amount of receivables collected between the year ending 2015 and the year ending 2016 was $80,865[^27] and the alleged cost of engaging debt collectors amounting to $69,625[^28] was disproportionate, and inconsistent with the defendant’s own evidence that he typically paid 25 or 30% of the recovered amounts when he engaged debt collectors[^29]. Taken together with the other evidence before the court discussed above, as well as the “operating lease rental” expense incurred by SE&P, it was more likely that the “commission” was related to SE&P’s business expenses, and that SE&P had continued business activities after 5 March 2013.

### Increase in net liabilities of SE&P

42     The Annual Report showed that SE&P’s liabilities had increased from $457,458 as at 31 August 2013[^30] (when business operations should already have ceased for at least 5 months) to $713,318 as at 31 August 2016[^31]. This did not support the defendant’s contention that SE&P had ceased operations. A company that was no longer running business activities should not have incurred these additional liabilities and the defendant did not adduce any evidence to explain why these liabilities were incurred.

### Burden of proof

43     The defendant contended that the plaintiff had failed to discharge her burden of proof. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff did not produce any evidence from suppliers or customers to show that SE&P had continued operating after 5 March 2013. The defendant further submitted that, because the plaintiff had sole access to SE&P’s email account and hardcopy documents, and had also taken over SE&P’s workers and the lease of the premises where SE&P had operated, the defendant was not in a position to continue SE&P’s business activities after 5 March 2013[^32].

44     I did not accept the defendant’s submissions. The mere fact that the plaintiff was in control of SE&P’s then prevailing email account, documents, workers and premises, did not preclude the defendant from continuing SE&P’s activities with fresh email accounts, premises, documents and workers.

45     With regards to the plaintiff’s access to SE&P’s email account, I find that this fact was neither here nor there. It was entirely possible for SE&P to continue business activities without this email account since business activities could be conducted without an email account or a new email account could easily be created. Likewise, business activities could be conducted after SE&P had moved out of the premises it was then leasing on 5 March 2013. In fact, the Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2016 showed that an “operating lease rental” of $4,800 had been incurred by SE&P[^33], implying that SE&P had rented new premises. In a similar vein, new employees could be hired by SE&P after 5 March 2013 and the Annual Report for the year ending 31 August 2016 did in fact reveal “employee benefits expense” comprising “director’s remuneration” at $32,760, “salaries, wages and bonuses” at $30,000 and “contribution to defined contributions plans” at $2,700[^34].

46     With regards to the defendant’s submissions that SE&P’s hardcopy documents had been left with the plaintiff on 5 March 2013, I note that it is not in dispute that by 6 January 2014, the plaintiff had handed over to the defendant all SE&P’s documents and parties signed an memorandum to acknowledge this[^35]. Even assuming that the defendant did not have soft copies and needed these hardcopy documents for SE&P to conduct business activities, by 6 January 2014 at the latest, the defendant would have had in his possession all the documents he needed for SE&P to conduct business activities. I further note that it was also not disputed that the defendant was the only party with control over SE&P’s bank account since the day of SE&P’s incorporation[^36].

47     A company’s Directors’ Reports and financial statements in its Annual Reports are objective records of the activities of that company. As explained in substantial detail above, SE&P’s Director’s Reports and financial statements in the Annual Reports indicated that business activities had continued after 5 March 2013 and the defendant was unable to provide any reasonable explanation for what was on the face of the financial statements.

48     On a totality of all the evidence before the court, I found that the plaintiff has satisfactorily discharged her burden of proof in showing that, on a balance of probabilities, the defendant had allowed SE&P’s to conduct business activities after 5 March 2013, in breach of the Settlement Agreement.

49     In the light of my findings above, the plaintiff is entitled to interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed for the loss occasioned as a result of the defendant’s breach by allowing SE&P to continue operating after 5 March 2013. I will now consider the remaining issue before the court.

## Whether the defendant had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to divide the collected receivables in shares proportionate to the parties’ respective shareholding in SE&P

50     The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to divide the collected receivables in shares proportionate to the parties’ respective shareholding in SE&P.

51     The plaintiff claimed that on or about 26 April 2017, she discovered that SE&P was “struck off” on 10 January 2017. The defendant denied that SE&P had been “struck off” on 10 January 2017. He expressly pleaded in his Defence that on 1 December 2017, his solicitors had informed the plaintiff’s solicitors that the annual report of SE&P as at 31 August 2017 was being prepared and there would be an AGM of SE&P in February or March 2018[^37].

52     There was no evidence before the court that SE&P had been struck off from ACRA’s Register or that it had been wound up. The plaintiff admitted in cross-examination that she did not conduct any checks to verify whether SE&P was still in existence[^38]. In addition, the plaintiff’s counsel confirmed in court that the plaintiff’s case was not based on the striking off or the winding up of SE&P and that the defendant could keep the company for all intents and purposes[^39].

53     On the other hand, the evidence before the court showed that SE&P had not been struck off in 2017 as alleged by the plaintiff. The Annual Report for the year ended 31 August 2018 had been submitted into evidence by the defendant. The defendant’s evidence during cross-examination was that he was still trying to resolve SE&P’s outstanding debts and expenses, namely Alfa’s fees, legal fees, ACRA related expenses, GST, fees to restate the accounts and potential tax related penalties[^40]. This was not disputed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s own closing submissions acknowledged that some of the receivables may still be outstanding to date[^41].

54     In the defendant’s closing submissions, he submitted that there was no express term in the Settlement Agreement that the collected receivables were to be divided without first taking into account SE&P’s debts and expenses. I accepted the defendant’s submissions. A company is a separate legal entity, distinct from its shareholders. Any division of the company’s assets, including its collected receivables, to its shareholders can only be made after all its liabilities are settled. Since the evidence showed that SE&P was still in existence with outstanding receivables, debts and expenses, the issue of whether the defendant has breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to divide the collected receivables in shares proportionate to the parties’ respective shareholdings in SE&P simply has not arisen.

## Conclusion

55     For the reasons I have explained, I was satisfied that the plaintiff had proven that the defendant had breached the Settlement Agreement by allowing SE&P to continue operating after 5 March 2013 and will enter interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff against the defendants, with damages to be assessed, and interest, costs and disbursements reserved.
