Damages – Assessment

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DC/RA 43 of 2021.\]

8 November 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

## Brief Facts

1       On 17 Dec 2010, the plaintiff (“P”), a male navy serviceman, was injured in an accident. Both P and the defendant (“D”) were riding motorcycles. P was riding on the extreme left lane when D came from P’s right side and attempted to turn left at a junction ahead of both of them. This resulted in P colliding into D’s left side, falling off, and suffering injuries.[^1] P was 41 years old at the time of the accident.

2       P commenced proceedings in April 2011 and interlocutory judgment (“IJ”) was entered for 100% of damages to be assessed. At the Assessment of Damages (“AD”) hearing before Deputy Registrar Chua Wei Yuan, a total of 5 witnesses testified including the plaintiff.

3       The Deputy Registrar awarded the plaintiff the following damages:

4       Both the plaintiff and defendant filed appeals against the DR’s decision.

5       At the hearing of the Registrar’s Appeal before me, I awarded P an additional $746.35 in respect of the future medication expenses. Apart from this change, I agreed with the methodology the Deputy Registrar adopted to calculate the awards as well as the sums awarded. Therefore, I dismissed the rest of P’s appeal as well as D’s appeal.

6       The plaintiff has appealed against my decision. At the time of preparing this judgment, the defendant has not filed an appeal.

7       I will deal with P’s appeal in the following order:

> (a)     Part I: General Damages for pain and suffering:

#### P’s position

8       P is only appealing against the award for Osteoarthritis[^3] (“OA”) and asking for a separate award of $10,000 for :

> (a)     OA to the left foot; as well as for

> (b)     the risk (or near certainty) of post-traumatic OA to the left ankle.

9       The DR did not make a separate award for OA but he stated that the $48,000 award for pain and suffering arising from the foot and ankle injuries included an uplift of $3,000 for OA[^4],

#### Decision on whether there should be an award for OA

10     After reviewing the medical evidence, the DR made the following findings on OA:

> (a)     P has suffered post-traumatic OA of the left foot and this was serious enough to require surgery.[^5]

> (b)     It was more likely than not that the arthritis will progress to the hindfoot where the ankle is.[^6] Nevertheless, the DR did not accept that the risk of OA was nearly 100%[^7] and therefore made an award for _potential_ OA.

11     P did not have any issues with the first finding but took objection to the DR’s second finding. P noted that Dr Kannan’s reported dated 15 November 2016[^8] stated that “the probability of development of further midfoot or ankle osteoarthritis is almost 100%.”

12     I found that the DR had carefully considered the evidence including Dr Kannan’s and Dr Chang’s opinion regarding this issue:

> (a)     Dr Kannan’s opinion of a 100% probability was not shared by the other Doctors.

> (b)     Dr Chang had pointed out the 2019 examination showed that P’s ankle joint remained pristine nearly 2.5 years after the accident which suggests that arthritis to the ankle had not set in yet.

> (c)     P cited the case of _Rahman Lutfar_ where there was an award of $13,000 for the increased risk of osteoarthritis to the left knee and ankle. The case did not assist P as the plaintiff in _Rahman Lufar_ suffered an above-knee amputation and would therefore have to rely solely on his remaining (and already injured) leg. This increased the likelihood that it would degenerate faster. On the other hand, P still has use of his right leg[^9].

#### Decision on the quantum of the award for OA

13     Therefore, I was of the view that the DR was correct that there should be an award for OA of the left foot and for the risk of post-traumatic OA to the left ankle, whether as an uplift to a global award or as a separate award. The issue is therefore the appropriate quantum of the award.

14     The DR provided his reasons for giving a $3,000 uplift to the global award for pain and suffering in relation to the foot and ankle injuries at \[48\]:

> The risk of osteoarthritis has sometimes been the subject of a separate award. In principle, it could fairly be considered a distinct loss for which a separate award may be provided. However, I find it inappropriate in this case to make a separate award because the 5th, 6th and 7th surgeries which P underwent were highlighted as sequelae of P’s foot injury but were, in fact, consequences of osteoarthritis to P’s foot (more specifically, the TN/CN joints). The medical evidence on the foot injury and osteoarthritis is intertwined, such that it seems to me that making a separate award would risk double compensation far more than it would clarify my reasoning.

15     I agreed with the DR’s global award of $48,000 for pain and suffering caused by the foot and ankle injuries (including foot OA and potential ankle OA) and I dismissed P’s appeal.

16     As D has pointed out, P had only suffered a single fracture of the navicular bone and that the Guidelines indicate an award for “serious” foot injury in the range of $15,000 to $25,000. Nevertheless, the DR had correctly appreciated the complexity of the injury and the pain and suffering experienced by P. Therefore, I agreed that the DR’s $48,000 award, which was significantly higher than the indicative range for a serious foot injury, was appropriate and compensated P for the injuries to his left leg and foot, including his foot OA and the risk that he may develop ankle OA.

### Dysthymia

17     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $9,000 for dysthymia.

18     P was diagnosed with dysthymia in 2014 by Dr Leslie Lim, a psychiatrist from the Singapore General Hospital. P was also referred to Mr Kevin Beck, a principal psychologist from the same hospital. Their reports were not challenged by the defence.

#### P’s submission

19     P submitted that P’s dysthymia fell between the moderately severe to severe range. P submitted that the DR:

> (a)     Failed to place sufficient weight on the unchallenged evidence of Dr Leslie Lim of SGH, the psychiatric expert and the plaintiff’s treating doctor since he was diagnosed in 2014.

> (b)     Failed to place sufficient weight on P’s continued symptoms over the past 5 years and the need for future psychiatric treatment

> (c)     Placed too much weight on P’s functionality at work.

#### D’s submission

20     D submitted that dysthymia is a mild form of depression and referred to the following definition in Webster’s online dictionary:

> a mood disorder characterized by chronic mildly depressed or irritable mood often accompanied by other symptoms (such as eating and sleeping disturbances, fatigue, and poor self-esteem)

> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dysthymia

21     D also noted that his psychiatric condition was not a “significant hindrance at work” given that P completed an important Navy safety project called “Lock Out Tag Out” and he was promoted to Warrant Officer in 2017.

22     Therefore, D’s position was that the award should be $3,000 which is in the “minor” and “moderate” range of the Guidelines.

#### Decision on award for Dysthymia

23     I agreed with the DR’s finding that P’s Dysthymia was “not minor” and that it fell within the moderate range. In arriving at my decision, I find myself in agreement with the factors highlighted by the DR :

> (a)     P’s condition was chronic. He had been suffering from dysthymia for 5 years despite regular follow-up treatment. P also entertained fleeting suicidal thoughts in 2014-2015. His relationship with his wife and children were also affected. Therefore, this was not a “minor” condition.

> (b)     On the other hand, while the condition was chronic, Dysthymia was by definition, a milder form of depression in contrast to more severe forms of depression such as a major depressive disorder.

> (c)     Nevertheless, P’s condition could be successfully managed through treatment. Dr Lim’s report stated that ongoing psychiatric treatment would ensure proper sleep and maintain his mood in a euthymic state and to keep the symptoms of his illness at bay.[^10]

> (d)     P’s functionality at work appears to support Dr Lim’s observation that treatment would be effective as P was still able carry out the tasks required of him in his new post-accident appointment in the Navy. P was able to successfully complete a significant safety project and was promoted to ME3-1 in 2017.

> (e)     P had 17 psychotherapy sessions from 2015 to 2019, starting with 5 in 2015 and tapering down to 2 in 2019. The decreased frequency of sessions suggested that P’s condition was improving[^11] or that it could be successfully managed without needing as many sessions.

24     P submitted that the correct approach to assessing the severity of P’s condition can be found in _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span> where Judicial Commissioner Kannan Ramesh stated at \[79\]:

> … In my view, a more broad-brushed and holistic application of the factors and categories \[of the Guidelines\] is appropriate with any attempt to pigeonhole studiously avoided. Assessing the impact of psychiatric illness on an individual cannot be measured with exactitude given the nature of the illness and the assessment that is being undertaken. The court is, in substance, assessing the impact of the manifestations of the illness on the life and relationships of an individual.

25     After carefully reviewing the evidence, I found that there was insufficient evidence to support P’s submission that P’s dysthymia was a severe psychiatric illness and that an award of $25,000 was justified. In coming to this finding, I took note of P’s relationships at home as well as his functionality at work.

26     All other things being equal, an award for major depressive disorder should be higher than an award for dysthymia since the former is a more serious condition than the latter. The DR highlighted the following 2 cases:

> (a)     In _Rahman Lutfar v Scanpile Constructors Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 41</span>, the plaintiff in that case suffered from a major depressive episode with moderate severity and was awarded $20,000.[^12]

> (b)     In _Ng Lay Peng v Gain City Engineering & Consultancy Pte Ltd (Ng Peng Boon, third party) (AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd, intervener)_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 184</span>, Andrew Ang SJ awarded $12,000.00 for major depressive disorder.

27     I agreed with the DR that award for psychiatric injuries in the present case should be lower than the awards in the two cases above. I found the award of $9,000 to be appropriate and noted that it was at the starting point of the “Moderately Severe” range in the Guidelines.

### CRPS

28     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $15,000 for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).

29     At the AD hearing, both medical experts agreed that the plaintiff has chronic pain as a result of the injury to his left foot. However, there was disagreement as to whether the plaintiff was suffering from CRPS or Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS).

30     The DR, after considering the evidence of the medical experts, agreed with Dr George’s diagnosis that P was suffering from Type 1 CRPS, given that P displayed at least 3 symptoms and 2 signs of the criteria used to diagnose CRPS (i.e. the Budapest criteria).

31     Next, the DR found P’s CRPS to be “mild but approaching moderate” and the award of $15,000 was near the starting point of the moderate range. However, he conceded that it was a difficult decision given the challenge of assessing the pain that would be attributable to what can be expected from the injury and its treatment, and pain that goes beyond that.[^13]

32     These are my findings on the award for CRPS:

> (a)     I agreed that P has shown that he was suffering from Type 1 CRPS.

> (b)     There was insufficient evidence to show that the severity of CRPS depends on how many of the diagnostic criteria are satisfied. If the DR had made a link between the two, as P has asserted in his submissions, the DR would have been incorrect in doing so.

> (c)     I found that the DR had taken into account the CRPS (and RSD) awards in previous cases. The DR had correctly assessed the severity of P’s CRPS to be less severe than the conditions described in the previous cases:

>> (i)       P’s CRPS was less severe than that the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) [^14]suffered by the plaintiff in _Mei Yue Lan Margaret v Raffles City (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 740</span> (HC) (“_Margaret Mei_”). The plaintiff in _Margaret Mei_ had to undergo some 6 procedures _relating to the nervous system_ in an attempt to alleviate the excruciating residual pain.[^15] However, a global award was made in _Margaret Mei_ and therefore the Court did not indicate which band of the guidelines the RSD award fell into.

>> (ii)       P’s CRPS was less severe than the CRPS suffered by the plaintiff in _Khek Ching Ching v SBS Transit Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 220</span>. The DR had come to this conclusion after considering the medical evidence on CRPS in _Khek Ching Ching[^16]_ and contrasting this with P’s CRPS which relates to general significant pain in his foot and redness and warmth when the pain is intense.[^17]

>> (iii)       In _Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (CA) (“_Pamela Mykytowych_”), the plaintiff was awarded $30,000 for the pain and suffering and loss of amenities which she suffered as a result of her Type I CRPS. The court found the CRPS to be of a moderate level. The DR noted that P’s injury was more serious than the injury suffered by the plaintiff in _Pamela Mykytowych._ Nevertheless, the plaintiff’s CRPS in _Pamela Mykytowych_ deteriorated to the extent that she was partly reliant on a wheelchair. The DR noted that P’s overall condition appeared to be less debilitating on the whole and therefore, the award should be considerably lower.[^18] P is also not claiming for loss of amenities, unlike the plaintiff in _Pamela Mykytowych_.

33     During the hearing of the appeal, P referred the Court to the recent case of _Mohinani Jairaj Shewaram v Tan Hock Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 74</span>. The DR did not have the benefit of this judgment at the AD hearing. The plaintiff in _Mohinani Jairaj Shewaram_ suffered from Type I CRPS. The Court considered at \[23\] the medical evidence of the CRPS which caused persistent left foot, ankle, and leg pain and it was likely that the plaintiff will continue to have residual pain and moderate physical impairment for the rest of his life. The Court also noted at \[29(b)\] that there was some evidence that the plaintiff needed to use a walking stick. The Court found that the CRPS fell within the moderate range and made an award of $20,000.

34     While _Mohinani Jairaj Shewaram_ was not binding on this Court, I noted that the nature and severity of the CRPS was similar to the present case.

35     Nevertheless, after careful consideration of all the above factors, I did not adjust the CRPS award for the following reasons:

> (a)     As the DR conceded in his GD, the CRPS award caused some difficulty. The Court, in making a CRPS award, is indirectly making a finding as to which aspects of P’s pain are directly attributable to the physical injury and its treatment, and which aspects are part of CRPS.

> (b)     While there is usually sufficient evidence available for the Court to assess whether the CRPS is mild, moderate, or severe, it is more difficult to state exactly at which point of the scale P’s CRPS lies.

> (c)     In the present case, I agreed with the DR’s assessment that the CRPS was moderate.

> (d)     In assessing the CRPS award, I noted that at the end of the day, the Plaintiff suffered, and continues to suffer pain and the Court should ensure that he receives compensation for that.

> (e)     There was evidence that P suffered pain that appeared to be greater than one would normally expect from a single fracture. The DR had taken this into account in the award of general damages for the leg injury. I agreed broadly with the DR that factors that he had taken into account to assess the severity of the leg injury should be excluded from the assessment of the severity of the CRPS. To do otherwise may lead to double-counting. For example:

>> (i)       The DR noted that P suffers from severe chronic post-traumatic and post-surgical neuropathic bone pain and considered this in the award for the leg injury.[^19] The DR then observed that if he were to regard this pain entirely as part of CRPS, this would lead to a ‘double-counting.’

## Part II: Future Medical Expenses

### Approach to calculating Future Medical Expenses

#### P’s submissions

36     P submitted that calculations for future losses should be on the basis that P will have 31 years of natural life remaining and this was adopted by the DR.

37     Next, P submitted that the approach to calculating future medical expenses would be to use a multiplier of 15 years and multiply this by the expected cost without any discounting. As P was expected to remain in the Navy for the first 10 years, the multiplicand would be reduced for this period to take into account the Navy’s co-payment of the expenses. As for the remaining 5 years, the multiplicand would be undiscounted.

38     Therefore, P disagreed with the DR’s approach of applying the discounting method as explained in _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> (CA) with the discount rate set at 4.25% based on the decision in _Christian Joachim Pollmann v Ye Xianrong_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 77</span>.

#### Decision on approach

39     I agreed with the DR’s adoption of the discounting method. The present case is unusual in that for the first 10 years, P will only need to pay 15% of the actual cost of his medical expenses. After 10 years, it will rise to 100% for the rest of his life. The use of the discounting method allows the DR to calculate with more precision, the impact of the Navy’s 85% subsidy on P’s expenses and the fact that P’s medical expenses will rise substantially after the subsidy is removed.

40     I would add that the discounting method did not necessarily lead to P receiving a lower amount of damages than P’s proposal to use a multiplier of 15 years. . Instead, it appears that the DR’s decision to award a lower amount than that claimed by P was due to a differing assessment of the cost and frequency of the medical treatment.

## Ankle joint debridement surgery

41     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s decision not to make an award for ankle joint debridement surgery.

42     P asked to be awarded $9,000 as the cost of future ankle joint debridement surgery. This surgery would be needed to relieve any pain caused by the onset of ankle osteoarthritis.

43     I agreed with the DR’s analysis that it has not been shown on a balance of probabilities that such surgery would be required:

> (a)     The DR had carefully considered the evidence of Dr Kannan and Dr Chang and concluded that there was a risk that P would develop ankle osteoarthritis.

> (b)     The DR noted that even if there was a risk that P would develop ankle osteoarthritis, this did not necessarily mean that: it would be severe enough to require ankle joint debridement surgery. In come to this finding, the DR noted that :

>> (i)       Dr Kannan stated that “typically surgery is \[a\] last resort.”[^20]

>> (ii)       It was not a given that this surgery would be recommended for someone of P’s age given that it was said to be a surgery to restore function in younger active patients.[^21]

>> (iii)       Dr Chang testified that increased stress to the ankle joint was unlikely to result in ankle osteoarthritis that was severe enough to need surgery because radiologically the ankle joint was pristine.[^22]

### Physiotherapy to left lower limb

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.34%"> <col width="33.32%"> <col width="33.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Physiotherapy to left lower limb</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P’s submission</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">D’s submission</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s award</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$7,800</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$468</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,212.32</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

44     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $2,213.32 for future physiotherapy expenses.

45     P claims for lifelong physiotherapy sessions once per month at a cost of $100 per session. The two issues in contention were:

> (a)     The frequency of physiotherapy.

> (b)     The cost of physiotherapy.

46     I agreed with the DR that P had significantly overstated his case in terms of the frequency of physiotherapy for the reasons stated in the DR’s GD at \[148\]-\[157\]. In particular, there was insufficient evidence on the record to explain why there was little evidence that he had attended physiotherapy after 2016 even though:

> (a)     He had attended other medical appointments.

> (b)     He was at certain points of time, on long medical leave, which he could have utilised to go for physiotherapy.

47     In relation to the cost of physiotherapy, D submitted that the cost of physiotherapy was $20 based on certain receipts that P had submitted. On the other hand, P submitted that the cost of a session was $150. I find that the DR was entitled, based on the receipts before him, to conclude that physiotherapy was not a homogenous exercise and that some of the sessions which were described as physiotherapy sessions were “review” sessions which cost less. This was taken into account in the DR’s award.

### Medical Consultation

48     I agreed with the DR’s assessment of the frequency of consultation required and I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $2,253.80 for future medical consultations.

49     It was not disputed that P would need follow-up medical consultations. P’s evidence that each consultation cost $150 was unchallenged. The main issue was therefore the frequency of the consultations. I agreed with the DR’s calculation and his view that there was insufficient evidence to show that P had to pre-emptively (i.e. even though he did not have any symptoms) attend consultations with the same regularity for the rest of his life.

### Cartilage supplements/painkillers and medication

50     It was not disputed that P would require some form of long-term medication or injections. Dr Kannan stated that it would be needed for his entire life while Dr George indicated that it would be needed indefinitely.

51     The main dispute appears to be the expected cost of the medication. P’s position appears to be based on Dr Kannan’s view that P’s medication would cost $325 a month. However, the DR noted that this was not borne out by the medical receipts and that in the 2 most recent years, where P was receiving injections regularly, P’s medical bills only averaged $508 per year. The DR noted in the preceding years, the average bill was even lower at $368 per year.

52     Therefore, I agreed with the DR’s decision to award P the costs of future medication at a round sum of $500 per year as that reflected P’s most recent expenses on medication and I noted that this was higher than the average bill in the preceding years However, I disagreed with the DR’s decision to gradually diminish the cost of medication to $370 by the end of P’s natural life on the basis that this amount reflected the amount of his earlier medication expenses. As the DR had pointed out, the Doctors had indicated that P would require medication either indefinitely or for his entire life and there was no evidence that the need for medication would diminish as P grows older.

53     I was of the view that P should be awarded the costs of future medication at the round sum of $500 per year for the rest of his life without any diminution of the amount. Therefore, I awarded P **$5,122.48** for future medication expenses. The revised Annex C (“Cost of Medication”) is attached to this judgment.

### Pain Management Therapy

54     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $799.11 for pain management therapy.

55     The DR found that P was entitled to the costs of lifelong pain management therapy on the basis that P is expected to have lifelong pain as a result of the accident. However, the DR disagreed with Dr Kannan’s estimate of $225 per session and noted that this was expressed to be subject to the pain physician’s estimate.

56     The DR further noted that P was charged $39 (after government subsidies) for his 2 most recent consultations with Dr George and used this figure as the basis for calculating the award.

57     I agreed that the DR was entitled to do so as:

> (a)     P did not provide any explanation why the price of pain management therapy would increase so sharply.

> (b)     There was insufficient evidence to show that the pain management therapy P should receive was something over and above the follow-ups that Dr George was providing.

### Psychiatric Treatment

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.34%"> <col width="33.32%"> <col width="33.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Psychiatric Treatment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">P’s submission</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">D’s submission</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DR’s award</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$6,420</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">No award</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

58     The DR did not allow the claim for psychiatric treatment on the ground that it was not claimed in the opening statement. I agreed with the DR and dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s decision not to award the expenses of future psychiatric treatment.

59     If future psychiatric treatment were to be allowed, I agreed with the DR’s assessment that P should be the cost of treatment for 7.5 years. This period represents the mid-point of Professor Lim’s report dated 6/9/2019 where he estimated that P would need treatment for the next 5-10 years.[^23]

60     Given that this treatment would take place during the period when P is expected to remain in the Navy, P would only need to pay 15% of the cost. Therefore, I agreed with the DR’s calculation that if the claim had been allowed, the amount awarded would have been $607.21.

61     P is appealing against the DR’s award for pre-AD loss of income as well as loss of earning capacity. P is not appealing against the award for loss of shipboard earnings.

62     I dismissed P’s appeal against the DR’s award of $8,717.06 for pre-AD loss of income and $43,948.30 for loss of earning capacity.

### Summary of Evidence relating to P’s income

63     Before dealing with the large gap between P’s submission and the DR’s award, it would be helpful to review the evidence concerning P’s income.

> (a)     At the time of the accident, P was a regular Navy serviceman and Military Expert holding the rank of ME2-2. His gross salary was $4,165/month.

> (b)     After the accident, P’s gross salary increased as he received an annual salary increment.

> (c)     P was promoted to the next higher rank of ME3-1 in 2017 and his gross salary increased to $4,855/month.

> (d)     In respect of P’s promotion prospects, the Navy stated in a letter that promotions were based on an individual performance and current estimated potential. Promotions were not based on a comparison with his colleagues in the same cohort or influenced by the downgrade to his Physical Employment Status (PES).[^24]

> (e)     P’s performance in the 2 years after the accident (2011-2012) remained in the same band as that in the 2 years before the accident (2009-2010). P was in the bottom 5th\-20th percentile of ranked servicemen, which was equivalent to a “low C”[^25].

> (f)     While the Navy did not disclose P’s performance after 2012, the DR had sufficient basis to infer that P’s performance did not slip:

>> (i)       P was paid a performance bonus for every year except for 2019 (which was a year when he was on extensive medical leave). By P’s own evidence, if he had slipped from a “low C” performance to the next lower performance band, he would not have been eligible for a performance bonus.[^26]

>> (ii)       P was selected for a warrant officer course and subsequently promoted in July 2017.

### Pre-AD loss of income

#### P’s Submissions

64     P’s main submission for pre-AD loss of income is on the basis that P would have received his promotion earlier if it were not for his accident injuries. P submits that:

> (a)     P’s last promotion was in 2008, 2 years before the accident.

> (b)     P was only promoted in 2017, 7 years after the accident.

> (c)     After the accident, P continued to receive a performance bonus which in fact increased year-on-year except for 2019.

> (d)     P would have been selected to undergo an upgrading course in 2011/2012 if not for the accident and thereafter he would have been promoted like his peers in Jan 2012.

> (e)     P’s ability to demonstrate good and consistent performance was affected as he had to take extended medical leave.

65     Therefore, P claims the difference between his ME3 and ME2-2 salaries for the period of 67 months between January 2012 (the date he expected to be promoted) and July 2017 (the date he was actually promoted).

#### Decision

66     I agreed with the DR that P’s extended medical leave for protracted periods meant that P lost substantial opportunities to display his performance and potential compared to his colleagues, and that this would have placed him at a disadvantage each time his suitability for promotion was assessed.

67     However, I find that P has not shown that he would have been promoted in January 2012 but for the accident. There was considerable difficulty in quantifying P’s loss:

> (a)     There was no evidence that he would have been promoted in 2012. P’s commanding officer for 2011-2017 was called as a witness but there was no evidence led that P was due for a promotion in 2012.

> (b)     The fact that his peers were promoted in 2012 did not amount to evidence that P would have been promoted in 2012. His performance in the 2 years immediately before the accident put him in the bottom 5th\-20th percentile of ranked serviceman. There was also no evidence that the peers P referred to were in the same performance band or that they had the same CEP.

> (c)     Furthermore, the evidence from the Navy was that P’s performance did not slip after the accident and P continued to receive a performance bonus which increased year-on-year except for 2019.[^27]

68     Nevertheless, I agreed with the DR that it would be unfair to award P nothing at all simply because P did not lead sufficient evidence to show when he would have been promoted. In respect of the amount awarded, I agreed with the DR’s decision to award $8,717.06 on the basis that his promotion was delayed by a year.

#### P’s Submissions

69     In _Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[40\] that an award for loss of earning capacity (“LEC”), as opposed to an award for loss of earnings, is generally made in the following cases:

> (a)     Where, at the time of trial, the plaintiff is in employment and has suffered no loss of earnings, but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some time in the future, and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well paid job; or

> (b)     Where there is no available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to properly calculate future earnings, for example, young children who have no earnings on which to base an assessment for loss of future earnings.

70     P submits that he falls within category (a) and that he should be awarded $150,000 for LEC as there was overwhelming evidence that P may be thrown into the open labour market in the near future where he would be at a disadvantage when compared to other job seekers. In relation to the amount of damages for LEC, P highlighted the case of _Mukhtiar Singh v Balwyndarjeet Singh_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 694</span>:

> (a)     The plaintiff was a 21 year old technician with the Air Force at the time of the accident. He suffered severe injury to his right upper limb.

> (b)     Due to the upper limb injury which included an injury to his right thumb, he was no longer able to perform his duties as an aircraft technician which required him to manipulate tools to loosen or tighten nuts and screws.

> (c)     While the plaintiff remained employed by the Air Force, Judicial Commissioner MPH Rubin, in awarding the plaintiff $70,000 for LEC and a further $4,000 for loss of opportunities to be posted overseas, stated at \[51\]:

>> I  am mindful that there is a real risk that the vicissitudes of time will, at some point during the long working life of the plaintiff, necessitate the plaintiff leaving the RSAF and finding another employer. In such an eventuality since his handicap is permanent, he will have difficulty finding a job that would pay him as well as if he could have the complete use of his right hand. His qualification as an aircraft technician cannot now be put to good use. Consequently any future employment he might find in the event of his contract not being renewed after 1997, is not likely to pay him as well as if he could use that skill as well as his hand. Allowance will also have to be made for the effect of his injury upon his chances of promotion in the RSAF. 

#### D’s Submission

71     D, however, submitted[^28] that P should be awarded only $10,000.00 in LEC, considering that he is not at substantial risk of losing his employment before he reaches 60 years old, and that his competitive disadvantage thereafter (at least that attributable to the accident) is essentially not significant because his age would have prevented him from taking on jobs that place physical demands on him.

#### Decision

72     I agree that this is an appropriate case for an award of LEC. Even though P has returned to work without any immediate loss of earnings, there is a risk of a future disadvantage in getting another job if he loses the present job. He may also be disadvantaged relative to his peers in the Navy. An award for LEC may take into account:

> (a)     The possibility that he may suffer a pay-cut in the future on account of his disability: _Teo Seng Kiat v Goh Hwa Teck_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR 333</span> at \[10\].

> (b)     The loss of opportunity for advancement: _Lim Yuen Li Eugene v Singapore Shuttle Bus Service Pte Ltd and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 189</span> at\[43\].

73     In assessing LEC, I took into account the following:

> (a)     P was expected to remain with the Navy until he is 60 years old.

> (b)     While in the Navy, his injury would place him at a disadvantage compared to his peers in competing for performance related salary increments and possibly a further promotion.

> (c)     On the basis that he could work till 67, he would have to find alternative employment after leaving the Navy at age 60.

> (d)     His future employer was unlikely to be as accommodating as the Navy and that his future employment may also be affected by his need to receive regular medical treatment including another surgery.

74     In respect of LEC from the age of 50 to 60, I proceeded on the basis that it was more likely than not that P would remain with the Navy. While his disability would have affected his ability to compete with his peers, there were some difficulties in quantifying this, especially given the Navy’s position that P’s performance did not drop in the two years after the accident, and the inference from P being paid a performance bonus that his performance did not drop in the following years.

75     The DR approached this by finding that since P’s 2017 promotion was delayed by at least a year, this meant that he would be one annual salary increment behind someone who was promoted in 2016. Since P’s 2017 salary increment was $150, this salary gap would represent as the starting point, his LEC between age 50-60. Over and above this, the DR applied an increase of $15/month per year to reflect the increasing gap expected between P and his able-bodied colleagues.

76     I had some difficulty with this calculation as it appeared to assume that an able-bodied serviceman with P’s current estimated potential and performance[^29] would continue to have regular performance based salary increases right up to retirement age. There did not appear to be any evidence from the Navy that this was the case. The possibility that salaries reach a ‘plateau’ as a serviceman nears retirement (with the result that salary gaps narrow rather than increase) did not appear to have been taken into account.

77     At age 60, he would have to retire from the Navy and would have to look for another job till the end of his working life at age 67. I agreed with the DR that his disability would place him at a disadvantage in the job market. The DR noted that P would have difficulty performing the role of a security guard or security supervisor, to the extent that he is required to be on his feet.

78     In the circumstances, I would have been minded to make a lump sum award for LEC which reflected (i) P’s LEC from age 50 to 60 when he was expected to remain in the Navy and (ii) P’s LEC from age 60 to 67 after he retired from the Navy and would be required to find another job.

79     All things considered, I felt that DR’s LEC award of $43,948.30 was extremely fair amount. If I were to make an award on a lump sum basis, it would have been for a similar amount. Therefore, I dismissed P’s appeal against the LEC award.

## Conclusion and costs

80     To recap, I allowed P’s appeal against the award for future medication expenses and dismissed P’s appeal in respect of the other awards. I also dismissed D’s cross-appeal.

81     As a result of the appeal, the amount awarded to P was increased from $214,030.08 to $214,776.43. In the circumstances, I felt that it was appropriate to make no order as to the costs of this appeal.
