Criminal Law – Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Criminal breach of trust by public servant

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9809/2020/01.\]

22 September 2020

### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 26-year-old male Chinese, Singapore citizen, pleaded guilty to a charge under section 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”), for dishonestly misappropriating $300 (in Singapore currency) which was entrusted to him in his capacity as a public servant. The Accused was a police officer in the employment of the Singapore Police Force, holding the rank of Sergeant 2, at the time of the offence.

2       The Accused was represented.

3       After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation and address on sentence presented by the Defence, I sentenced the Accused to three months’ imprisonment. The Accused began serving his sentence on 1 September 2020.

4       The Prosecution was dissatisfied with the sentence and filed an appeal against it on 2 September 2020. It also applied for a stay of execution of the sentence on the same day, and the Accused was released on bail.

5       I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The Pertinent facts

6       The pertinent portions of the Statement of Facts, which the Accused admitted to without qualification, are set out below.

7       On 5 August 2019, at about 3.00pm, Mdm Seow Poh Ling (“Mdm Seow”) was in the vicinity of Novena Church when she found a handbag lying unattended at the bus stop in front of the Church. As Mdm Seow was unable to ascertain the location of the owner of the handbag, she brought the handbag to Whampoa Neighbourhood Police Post (“the NPP”) to make a police report.

8       Mdm Seow arrived at the NPP at about 6.23pm. The Accused was on duty at the counter at that time, and Mdm Seow informed him that she had found a handbag. She further informed him that the handbag contained a significant amount of money, and she wished to make a police report. Mdm Seow requested that the items in the handbag be documented “in view of the number and importance of the items”. The accused then informed Mdm Seow that he would lodge the police report on her behalf and that there was no necessity for itemisation. Mdm Seow then entrusted the handbag containing, _inter alia_, six pieces of $50 notes in Singapore currency, and left the NPP thereafter.

9       Following Mdm Seow’s departure, at the counter, the Accused removed the cash from the wallet which was in the handbag. He then proceeded to separate the Indonesian Rupiah from the Singapore currency (comprising six pieces of $50 notes (“the Notes”)), placing the Indonesian Rupiah on the left side of the counter and the Notes on the right. Thereafter, the Accused picked up the Notes, leaned forward and put the Notes in the pocket on the right side of his trousers. The Accused’s actions were caught by the CCTV in the NPP, even though the Accused had leaned forward to conceal the Notes from the view of the CCTV.

10     On the same day at 7.16pm, the Accused filed a Found Property Report for the handbag. However, he did not record the presence of the Notes in the handbag. He then brought the Notes home and kept them in his wardrobe.

11     At 7.45pm, Miss Felicia Monica (“Miss Felicia”) lodged a police report at Toa Payoh Neighbourhood Police Centre, reporting that she had lost her handbag earlier in the day. She further informed the police that the handbag contained, _inter alia_, her Indonesian passport and the Notes. Miss Felicia was an 18-year-old tourist from Indonesia and had just arrived in Singapore that day.

12     The next day, on 6 August 2019, Miss Felicia called the Found and Unclaimed Property Office and was informed that her handbag had been found. She made her way to Kampong Java Neighbourhood Police Centre (“Kampong Java NPC”), where her handbag was, and collected it. Upon checking through the contents, she discovered that the Notes were missing from her wallet. Miss Felicia left Singapore on 7 August 2019.

13     On 29 August 2019, the Accused brought the Notes to Kampong Java NPC and returned them to Deputy Superintendent of Police Ng Eng Seng (“DSP Ng”).

## The sentence

14     An offence under section 409 of the Penal Code is punishable with a term of imprisonment which may extend to 20 years. In addition, the offender shall be liable to fine.

### Antecedents

15     The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence

16     The Prosecution submitted for a term of imprisonment of at least four and a half months. The Prosecution referred to the cases of _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 165</span>, _PP v Hemavathy d/o Gunasekaran_ (DAC-932331-2018, unreported) and _PP v Norazly bin Joihani_[^1] <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 13</span> and submitted that the starting point where a police officer is convicted of an offence under section 409 of the Penal Code “appears to be a sentence of four months’ imprisonment”. This starting point is applicable for an offender who claims trial and where the property misappropriated is less than $1,000[^2].

17     In addition to the above cases, the Prosecution highlighted the cases of _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_ (DAC-935823-2019, unreported) and _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_ (DAC-006605-2012, unreported) and submitted that “the sentencing precedents indicate that imprisonment terms of between two months and seven months have been imposed on police officers who committed criminal breach of trust of property valued at less than $1,000 under section 409 of the Penal Code”[^3].

18     Applying the above precedents to the present case, the Prosecution argued that a term of imprisonment of at least four and a half months was appropriate in view of the following aggravating factors[^4]:

> (i)     the Accused’s deception of Mdm Seow;

> (ii)     the Accused had brought disrepute to the integrity of the Singapore Police Force as Miss Felicia was an Indonesian;

> (iii)     the Accused’s attempt to avoid detection by leaning forward and blocking the CCTV when he pocketed the Notes.

19     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that little weight should be placed on the Accused’s plea of guilt and the fact that he returned the Notes to DSP Ng[^5].

### The mitigation plea

20     The Defence submitted for a sentence of not more than five weeks’ imprisonment. In its submissions, the Defence highlighted, _inter alia_, the following:

> (i)     the Accused was untraced[^6], was remorseful[^7] and had cooperated with the authorities[^8];

> (ii)     the Accused’s background, his family circumstances[^9] and his previous good character[^10]; and

> (iii)     there was a delay in prosecution[^11].

21     The Defence also cited the case of _PP v Jeganathan Ramasamy_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 40</span> to support its position that a sentence of not more than five weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate[^12].

### Decision on sentence

#### Accused was a police officer when he committed the offence

22     The fact that the Accused was a police officer and not just any other public servant at the time of the offence was significant. As a police officer, the Accused was expected to safeguard the public interest and be committed to prevent, deter and detect crime. Instead, the Accused abused his position and took the money, betraying the trust that he was supposed to safeguard. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence which sends a deterrent signal should be imposed.

23     The Defence relied on the case of _PP v Jeganathan Ramasamy_[^13] and pointed out that the offender had been given a term of imprisonment of ten weeks, after having been convicted on two charges under section 409 of the Penal Code. At the material time, the offender was the director of the Technology Department of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“the SCDF”). He was alleged to have dishonestly misappropriated two Apple iPad 2 devices, which were entrusted to him in his capacity as director of the Technology Department of the SCDF, by converting them to his own use. One of the devices was given to his daughter, and the other device was sold to his colleague for a sum of $200. The offender was acquitted on appeal.

24     I found the case cited by the Defence to be materially different from the present case. While the offender held a senior position in the SCDF, he did not betray the very trust that he was duty bound to uphold. As observed by Chan Sek Keong CJ in _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_[^14] at \[17\], “law enforcement officers who have abused their position and have breached their public trust should be punished more severely than ordinary offenders is justifiable on retributive and deterrent considerations”. In the circumstances, I did not place much weight on the case cited by the Defence.

25     The case precedents cited by the Prosecution were more relevant as they involved police officers who had committed similar offences in the course of their duty. In the cases cited by the Prosecution, the offenders were sentenced to imprisonment terms of between two months and seven months[^15].

#### Precedents for criminal breach of trust cases involving police officers

26     In submitting for a sentence of four and a half months’ imprisonment term against the Accused, the Prosecution cited the following five cases:

> _PP v Norazly bin Joihani_ [^16]

> \[Pleaded guilty\]

> The offender was a 33-year-old Investigation Officer attached to Bedok Police Division Headquarters (“Bedok Police HQ”) at the time of the offence. Sometime in October 2009, the offender withdrew $50 from the Case Property Store of Bedok Police HQ and was entrusted to return the $50 to the rightful owner. However, instead of returning the $50 to the rightful owner, the offender dishonestly misappropriated the amount and was charged under section 409 of the Penal Code. This amount together with $2,664 which the offender had obtained through cheating was used by the offender to pay his bills. The offender committed a total of 59 charges over a period of about two years.

> On 27 November 2014, the offender, who was untraced, pleaded guilty to the charge and 13 other charges under sections 420, 465 and 468 of the Penal Code, and section 41(2) of the Police Force Act (Cap 235, 2006 Rev Ed). The offender consented to 46 other charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing and made restitution on the same day he pleaded guilty to the charges. The total amount involved in the sections 409 and 420 charges was $2,714. The offender was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for the section 409 charge.

> _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_ [^17]

> \[Pleaded guilty\]

> The offender was a 24-year-old Ground Response Force Officer attached to Pasir Ris Neighbourhood Police Centre (“Pasir Ris NPC”) at the time of the offence. Sometime in November 2019, one Balakrishna s/o Kandasamy (“Balakrishna”) brought a wallet to Pasir Ris NPC. The wallet was found at a hawker centre. Balakrishna, who ran a drink stall at the hawker centre, knew that the wallet belonged to one of his customers. However, as he was unable to get hold of her, he decided to hand the wallet over to the police.

> The offender, who was on duty that day, took over the wallet from Balakrishna and told him that he could leave. The offender saw that the wallet contained cash of $180 and decided to dishonestly misappropriate the cash. The offender did not lodge a report to document the receipt of the wallet. He then contacted the owner of the wallet and informed her that her wallet had been found. When the owner arrived, she found the cash missing and asked the offender about it. The offender lied to her and told her that her wallet was found by the roadside.

> Subsequently, the owner ran into Balakrishna at the hawker centre and discovered that her money was in the wallet when it was handed over to the offender, and the offender’s dishonest act was exposed. Further investigations revealed that the offender had taken moneys from wallets which were found and handed over to him on two previous occasions. In all, the offender dishonestly misappropriated a total of about $207 over a period of about 5 months.

> The offender was untraced and pleaded guilty to a charge under section 408 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

> _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony[^18]_

> \[Pleaded guilty\]

> The offender was a 25-year-old Police Sergeant at the time of the offence. On 17 May 2011, the offender was performing desk duty at Kampong Glam NPP when a Prada wallet was handed over to him by one Khor Wai Chen (“Khor”). Khor lodged a police report (NP322) in relation to the wallet but left the police post without getting a copy of it. The offender placed the wallet on the table next to a computer and subsequently transferred it into a drawer. On the same day, the offender placed the wallet in his pocket before leaving the police post. He then took the cash (amounting to $35), a NETS cash card and an EZ-link card from the wallet, before throwing away the other items in the wallet, including the owner’s Identity Card, credit cards and membership cards. After throwing away the items in the wallet, the offender spent a portion of the cash.

> Sometime in June 2011, Khor returned to the police post to request for a copy of the report. Investigations revealed that the offender did not document the receipt of the wallet. When confronted by his superior, the offender denied receiving the wallet from Khor, and it was only through a subsequent viewing of the CCTV footage that the offender’s ruse was uncovered.

> The offender was untraced and pleaded guilty to a charge under section 406[^19] of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.

> _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_ [^20]

> \[Claimed trial\]

> The offender was a 22-year-old police officer attached to the Found and Unclaimed Property Office (“FUPO”) at the time of the offence. On 21 September 2010, the offender was tasked to collect lost-and-found properties at Clementi Police Division Headquarters and bring these properties back to FUPO. Amongst the items that the offender collected that day was a polymer bag containing cash exceeding $800. The offender dishonestly misappropriated the cash and used part of the money to pay for his car policy premium. On 8 October 2010, a claimant turned up at FUPO to claim a portion of the cash, and it was discovered that the cash was missing. A search party, which included the offender, was mobilised to find the missing polymer bag but to no avail. The offender also did not respond to a call by the FUPO management to own up. Pursuant to investigations, the offender was arrested and charged under section 409 of the Penal Code for committing criminal breach of trust of $893.75.

> The offender, who was untraced, claimed trial to the charge and was convicted at the end of an 18-day trial. Upon his conviction, the offender made restitution and was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment by the trail judge. On appeal, his sentence was enhanced to six months’ imprisonment.

> _PP v Hemavathy d/o Gunasekaran_ [^21]

> \[Claimed trial\]

> The offender was a 36-year-old Police Sergeant attached to the Marina Bay Neighbourhood Police Centre at the time of the offence. Sometime in November 2016, the offender was entrusted with two iPad Mini Retina devices for the purpose of carrying out her official duties as a police officer. The devices were valued at a total of about $936. Subsequently, the offender brought the devices to a shop and pawned them for a total of $300. The offender failed to redeem the devices and eventually the shop sold the devices to buyers in March and April 2017.

> The offender, who was untraced, claimed trial to the charge and was convicted at the end of a 4-day trial. The offender did not make any restitution and was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment.

27     I next considered the Defence’s mitigation plea and the sentencing factors raised by the Prosecution.

#### The mitigating factors raised by the Defence

28     I did not agree with the Defence that there was a delay in prosecution. The Accused was produced in court within nine months of his being confronted and his return of the Notes to DSP Ng. As for the Accused’s family circumstances, while I have some sympathy for his mother’s medical condition, the law is well established that, other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (_Ong Ker Seng v PP_ \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 406 at \[30\] and _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[31\]).

29     In relation to the Accused’s plea of guilt, I agreed with the Prosecution that it should not carry overriding weight, as the Accused’s actions were caught on the CCTV. However, I accorded some weight to it as a potentially troublesome trial, given that Miss Felicia was an Indonesian residing in Indonesia, was averted as a result of the Accused’s plea. Consequently, Miss Felicia did not have to travel to Singapore in these uncertain times to testify against the Accused in court, nor was it necessary to have special arrangements made for her to testify via live video from Indonesia, under section 28 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020. Mdm Seow was, likewise, not inconvenienced.

30     I accepted that the Accused was remorseful and had cooperated fully with the authorities. This is in stark contrast with the offenders in _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_, _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_, _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_ and _PP v Hemavathy d/o Gunasekran_. Notably, the offenders _in PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_ and _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_ had lied when confronted by the victim and the supervising officer, respectively. As for the offenders in _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_ and _PP v Hemavathy d/o Gunasekran_, they had both claimed trial and Chan Sek Keong CJ commented at \[19\] of _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad[^22]_ that the offender’s “lack of remorse was quite patent”.

31     I also gave considerable weight to the fact that the Accused was a first-time offender and that he had served the police force well in the two years that he was there. He is most likely to have lost his livelihood as a police officer, and would have to live with the stigma of an imprisonment term for the rest of his life.

32     I further accepted that the Accused had acted on impulse and it did not seem apparent from the sequence of events captured on the CCTV[^23] that there was premeditation on the part of the Accused when he committed the offence. The Defence’s description of the sequence of events was not challenged by the Prosecution. From the Statement of Facts, the time between Mdm Seow’s handing over of the handbag to the Accused and the Accused’s commission of the offence was a mere 13 minutes. Out of these 13 minutes, the Accused spent another three minutes with an unknown individual and the cleaner. The offenders in the five cases cited by the Prosecution had spent their ill-gotten gains. In the case of _PP v Hemavathy d/o Gunasekaran_, the offender pawned the two devices which were entrusted to her, and failed to make any restitution. In the present case, the Accused did not spend the Notes at all, and had returned them.

#### The sentencing factors raised by the Prosecution

33     The Prosecution submitted that it was aggravating that the Accused had deceived Mdm Seow when he “persisted in telling \[Mdm Seow\] that he would lodge the police report on her behalf and there was no need for itemisation”. I agreed that if the Accused had indeed used deception on Mdm Seow in order to facilitate the commission of the offence, this could be considered as an aggravating factor. However, in the present case, the Accused did in fact lodge a Found Property Report at 7.16pm. It was not clear from the Statement of Facts if the Accused had detailed the other items in the handbag in the Found Property Report. It was also not clear from the Statement of Facts the effect of the Accused’s representation on Mdm Seow. There was, therefore, insufficient details for me to conclude that the Accused’s representation to Mdm Seow was a strong aggravating factor.

34     The Prosecution further submitted that the Accused’s offence was aggravated by the fact that Miss Felicia was an Indonesian tourist, and that the Accused had therefore brought “the integrity of the Singapore Police Force into greater disrepute”. I agreed with the Prosecution that the fact that the Accused was a police officer, and had dishonestly misappropriated the very property that he was supposed to safeguard, called for greater sanction. This is clear from the cases of _PP v Amir Hamzah bin Mohammad_ at \[17\] and _PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[3\]. However, I did not think that the Accused’s offence was aggravated by the mere fact that the victim was a tourist. The integrity of the Singapore Police Force is equally important to the people in Singapore, as it is to tourists.

35     The Accused’s actions would have been aggravating if he had targeted the Notes because he knew that the owner was a tourist, and had taken from a tourist to decrease his chances of being exposed as the owner’s presence in Singapore was transient. There was no evidence before me that this was the case.

36     The third aggravating factor raised by the Prosecution was that the Accused had attempted to avoid detection by leaning forward and blocking the CCTV. I was not persuaded by this argument – what the Accused did was part and parcel of the crime. It would have been an aggravating factor if the Accused had taken steps to conceal his crime, for example, by not lodging a Found Property Report or by throwing away the handbag. It would also have been aggravating if he had lied to DSP Ng upon being confronted.

37     In its “final analysis”, the Prosecution submitted that “based on the cardinal proportionality principle”, the sentence in the present case should be higher than the two months imposed in _PP v Norazly bin Joihani[^24]_. I agreed with the Prosecution that, in general, the higher the amount misappropriated, the higher the sentence. However, the value involved in an offence should not be the sole determinant of the sentence to be meted out. In _PP v Norazly bin Joihani_, the Accused had a total of 59 charges against him for offences committed over a period of about two years. While he was untraced, he could hardly be considered a first-time offender: _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[46\] to \[48\] and _Chen Weixiong Jerrick v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR 334</span> at \[15\] and \[17\]. In the present case, the Accused was untraced and had committed the offence when he took the Notes, on impulse, within about 13 minutes after the handbag was handed over to him.

38     For completeness, I also considered the Prosecution’s argument that the “starting point of four months’ imprisonment” was consistent with the sentence of three months’ imprisonment imposed on the offender in _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_ for “a less serious charge under section 408 of the Penal Code”, and the sentence of four months’ imprisonment meted out on the offender in _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_[^25] which the Prosecution had mistaken to be a case under section 409 of the Penal Code[^26]. The charge in the case of _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_ was in fact one under section 406 of the Penal Code.

39     While I agreed with the Prosecution that the provision under which an offender is charged is generally indicative of the gravity of the offence, this should not be the only consideration in determining a fair and appropriate sentence to be meted out on the Accused. The facts in the present case were not more serious than those in _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_ and _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_, which I have set out in paragraph 26 above. I was of the view that the offenders’ behaviour in the two cases were more egregious than the Accused’s. I have also discussed the facts of the cases[^27] cited by the Prosecution in Annex A of its Submissions of Sentence, as the facts were important in helping us understand, to an extent, the culpability of the offenders in those cases.

40     In _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_, prior to the incident leading to his arrest, the offender had committed criminal breach of trust on two other occasions. In addition, the offender had lied to the owner. His misdeeds only came to light when Balakrishnan happened to speak to the owner about her lost wallet.

41     In _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_, the offender had failed to make any documentation of the receipt of the wallet (which was valued at $400), and had thrown away the owner’s Identity Card, driving license, all her credit cards and membership cards thereby obliterating any information which might lead to the identification of the owner. He kept the cash, NETS cash card and EZ-link card, presumably for his own use. When confronted by his superior a month later, he lied to his superior and denied receiving the wallet.

42     I recognised that it was the Prosecution’s prerogative to prefer the present charge against the Accused. However, I was not informed why the present charge was preferred when the factual scenario in the present case was similar to those in _PP v Isaac Lim Jun Cheng_ and _PP v Wu Zhihao Anthony_. Therefore, while I was mindful that the charge against the Accused carried a higher penalty than in those cases, it was also important not to lose sight of the broader principles of fairness and equality. I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was fair and appropriate given the circumstances.

## Conclusion

43     In my view, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment would adequately reflect the culpability of the Accused and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.
