\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9292/2019/01.\]

29 November 2019

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## A.   Introduction

1       The Accused, a 42 year old male Indian national and a Singapore Permanent Resident, had claimed trial to the following charges:-

1ST CHARGE – DAC 932397-2017

> You … are charged that you, 31 March 2017, at about 1.44 p.m., in the vicinity of No. 80 Syed Alwi Road Singapore 207659, did use criminal force to one Chee Jun Kiat Kenny, being a public servant, to wit, an authorised officer appointed by the National Environment Agency to carry out enforcement duties, in the execution of his duty as such public servant, by pushing him three times on his chest, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2 ND CHARGE – DAC 932938-2017

> You… are charged that you, 31 March 2017, at about 1.44 p.m., in the vicinity of No. 80 Syed Alwi Road Singapore 207659, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Chee Jun Kiat Kenny, being a public servant, _to wit_, an authorised officer appointed by the National Environment Agency to carry out enforcement duties, in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, by choking his neck with your right hand, causing him to be unable to breathe, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## B.   Punishment Prescribed by Law

2       For DAC 932397-2017, the punishment prescribed under section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both.

3       For DAC 932398-2017, the punishment prescribed under section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishment.

4       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of both the charges on 12 September 2019 and I adjourned the matter to 4 November 2019 for the Prosecution to prepare their submission on sentencing and for the Defence to prepare their mitigation plea as well as their sentencing positions.

5       On 4 November 2019, the Accused who was represented by Mr Amarjit Singh s/o Hari Singh discharged Mr Amarjit Singh s/o Hari Singh and he appointed Mr Vinit Chhabra to act for him in place of Mr Amarjit Singh s/o Hari Singh. Mr Vinit Chhabra also made an application under section 283 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) to recall the Accused to introduce the following documents:

> a.     A Changi Hospital A&E Discharge Summary dated 2 April 2017 signed by Dr Lawrie Faraz Azam, pursuant to treatment that the Accused had sought after release from police custody. This document was uploaded in ICMS by the Accused’s previous solicitors on 10 December 2018 but was not admitted as a Defence exhibit;

> b.     A medical report from Changi General Hospital dated 27 September 2019;

> c.     A police report made by the Accused dated 23 September 2019; and

> d.     Photographs of the Accused’s injured wrist that he had taken with his own mobile phone on the day of the incident.

6       Mr Vinit Chhabra also sought leave to call for the appropriate medical professional/doctor from Changi General Hospital to give evidence on the Accused’s treatment at Changi General Hospital immediately after his release from police custody.

7       The Prosecution had objected to the application on the basis that I had convicted the Accused and they are of the view that the Court is functus.

8       Section 283 of the CPC reads as follows:

> 283 - (1)    A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the prosecution or the defence, **at the close of the case of the defence, or at the end of any proceeding under this Code**, summon a person as a witness or examine a person in attendance as a witness, whether or not summoned, or recall and re-examine a person already examined.

> (2)    The court must summon and examine or recall and re-examine such a person if it thinks his evidence is essential to making a just decision in the case.

> (3)    The exercise by a court of its power under subsection (1) is not a ground for appeal, or for revision, unless the appellant, or the applicant, as the case may be, shows that the examination has led to a failure of justice.

9       Section 283 of the CPC clearly states any application must be made at the close of the case of the defence, or at the end of any proceeding under this Code and the purpose of summoning a witness or recalling of a witness is to help the court make a just decision in the case. I am of the view that the discretion to recall or summons a witness should be exercised sparingly and it should only be exercised if it is necessary for the just decision of the case.

10     In this case, the purpose of the Accused wanting to call the new evidence is to help back up his case against conviction. I am of the view that section 283 of the CPC can no longer be applied in this case as I had already made my decision and had convicted the Accused earlier. To allow the Defence’s application would mean that I would to need retract my conviction and reconsider all the evidence including the new evidence and make a new ruling. I do not think that I am allowed to do this under the CPC. I am also of the view that this is unfair to the Prosecution as this is also tantamount to giving the Defence a second bite of the cherry.

11     In this regard, I am also guided by the remarks of Aedit Abdullah J in _Soh Tian Khoon Raymond v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 76</span> at \[13\] where the learned Judge commented:

> “That being sad, I would strongly discourage criminal motions from being filed where there are pending matters at first instance unless very strong countervailing reasons are present. In the event of an issue of this nature arises in the future, it would generally be best for matters to be determined by the first instance court. **Any evidential shortcomings should generally be addressed as part of the appeal process instead; if the need for additional evidence is then made out, the appellate court can be persuaded to remit the matter to the trial court or to allow the calling of new evidence on appeal, as the case may be**.” (emphasis mine)

12     I also adjourned sentencing to 15 November 2019 after hearing the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea. On 15 November 2019, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.1497187364777%"> <col width="31.6745997403721%"> <col width="54.1756815231501%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 932397-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment (concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 932398-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 weeks’ imprisonment (concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

13     The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision has filed his Notice of Appeal against conviction and sentence. Accordingly, I set out my reasons for both the conviction and sentence.

## C.   The Prosecution’s Case

14     The Prosecution had called a total of 4 witnesses to give evidence in support of their case against the Accused:

> (a)     The NEA officer, Chee Jun Kiat Kenny (“PW1”), the victim;

> (b)     Jumaslan Bin Awe (“PW2”), a witness;

> (c)     Ariventhiran Sunthara Raj (“PW3”), a witness; and

> (d)     ASP Ho Wee Jie (“PW4”), the Investigation Officer.

15     The Prosecution’s case against the Accused is as follows[^1]:-

> a.     At the material time, PW1 was an auxiliary Police officer assigned to the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) to enforce anti-littering and anti-smoking laws. PW1 was appointed as an authorised officer by the director of the Environment Public Health Operations Department and empowered by NEA to, among other things, issues summons to those who commit littering and/or smoking offences.

> b.     On 31 March 2017, PW1 was on duty when he saw the Accused throwing a cigarette butt into the drain outside No 81 Syed Alwi Road (“the restaurant”). PW1 then approached the Accused and identified himself as an NEA officer. PW1 also informed the Accused of the offence which he had committed and requested for the accused’s particulars. In response, the Accused told PW1 that he wanted to retrieve his bag that was inside the restaurant.

> c.     When the Accused came out of the restaurant, PW1 approached the Accused again. Despite the multiple verbal commands given by PW1 to the Accused for his particulars and to stop, the Accused ignored PW1 and walked away. PW1 then stood in front of the Accused and placed his left palm in front of the Accused to stop him from going off.

> d.     However, the Accused continued walking and this caused PW1’s palm to come into contact with the Accused’s chest. The Accused then told PW1 that he was not allowed to touch the Accused and that if PW1 touched him again, he would “lose his cool”.

> e.     The Accused then continued walking and pushed PW1, who was standing in front of him, 3 times on the chest with both hands and tried to walk away. This is the basis of DAC 932937-2017.

> f.     PW1 then grabbed onto the Accused’s left wrist and told the Accused that he was going to call for the police. The Accused then tried to forcefully remove PW1’s grip from his left wrist. As a result of the struggle, the Accused sustained a cut of his left wrist.

> g.     After telling the Accused that he would call for the police, PW1 released his grip on the Accused. The Accused then proceeded to sit on a chair at No 80 Syed Alwi Road and told PW1 that he will wait for the police to arrive. However, before PW1 could call for the police, the Accused tried to walk away again. When PW1 saw the Accused trying to walk away, PW1 stood in front of the Accused to prevent him from leaving. The Accused then proceeded to choke PW1 on his neck. This formed the basis of DAC 932398-2017. PW2 then came to PW1’s assistance, separating the Accused from the victim. PW1 proceeded to call for the police thereafter.

## D.   The Defence’s Case[^2]

16     The Defence had called a total of 2 witnesses to give evidence on behalf of the Accused:

> (a)     Kappagantula Srikanth (“DW1”), the Accused; and

> (b)     Jenny Johnsons Pandarakalam (“DW2”), a witness;

17     The Accused is denying that he had pushed PW1 on the chest 3 times and choking the PW1[^3].

18     The Defence’s version of what had happened on 31 March 2017 can be summarised as follows[^4]:-

> a.     The Accused accepted that there were 2 encounters between PW1 and the Accused on 31 March 2017. The 1st encounter was when PW1 caught the Accused for littering. During this encounter, the Accused confirmed that PW1 did identify himself as a NEA officer and had informed the Accused of his offence. PW1 then proceeded to ask the Accused for his particulars. In response, the Accused told PW1 that he would need to return to the restaurant to retrieve his identification papers which was in his bag in the restaurant.

> b.     The 2nd encounter took place after the Accused had left the restaurant. When the Accused left the restaurant with his ex-colleague Jenny Johnsons Pandarakalam (“DW2”) who was having lunch with him, he did not see PW1 around and he thought that PW1 had given him a chance.

> c.     However, as he was about to head in the direction of the MRT station, PW1 shouted and ran towards him and asked for his ID. The Accused had hoped that PW1 would give him a chance and let him off and he went on to ask PW1 the reason why he needed the Accused’s ID and for proof that he had littered.

> d.     However, PW1 insisted that the Accused produced his ID. The Accused then apologised for littering and requested PW1 to give him a chance.

> e.     However, PW1 got agitated and he grabbed the Accused left wrist and demanded for his ID. PW1’s grip caused pain to the Accused’s wrist. The Accused then requested PW1 to let go of his hand. At the same time, the Accused was trying to remove PW1’s grip on his left wrist with his right hand. PW1 then proceeded to press his left forearm against the Accused left neck with great pressure and force causing the Accused to suffer immense pain in his neck area to the point that he was unable to speak.

> f.     After this, PW2 stepped in to separate PW1 from the Accused who then realised that he had suffered a cut on his wrist and he was bleeding from his wound.

> g.     The Accused’s position is that PW1 had used unnecessary force to commit violent acts against the Accused and the Accused had never pushed or choked PW1.

> h.     The Accused had also called DW2 to give evidence on his behalf as DW2 had witnessed the alleged incident on the material day and her evidence corroborated the Accused’s account of the incident.

## E.   Assessment of the Evidence

## a.   The Victim’s (PW1’s) Account

19     PW1 is an auxiliary police officer with Certis Cisco. He was assigned to NEA to do enforcement on anti-littering and anti-smoking[^5]. On 31 March 2017, PW1 was patrolling with PW2 and PW3 and they were all in plainclothes[^6]. PW1 and PW3 are auxiliary police officers and they are authorised by NEA to request for particulars from offenders and to issue summons. PW2 is an enforcement officer[^7].

20     PW1 was about 3 to 5 metres away from the Accused and he had seen the Accused smoking outside the restaurant at 81 Syed Alwi Road. The Accused then proceeded to throw the cigarette butt into the drain[^8]. PW1 them walked towards the Accused and identified himself as a NEA officer by showing his authority card to the Accused. PW1 then informed the Accused of his offence and requested for his particulars[^9].

21     The Accused informed PW1 that he wanted to retrieve his bag at the restaurant and walked away from PW1 and he went into the restaurant without waiting for a response from PW1[^10]. PW1 then stood outside the restaurant and observed the Accused retrieving his bag and going to the counter to make payment[^11].

22     After this, PW1 saw PW3 having issue with another offender and he decided to walk towards PW3 who was about 4 metres away[^12]. PW1 then saw the Accused coming out of the restaurant and he walked back to the Accused to ask for his particulars. However, the Accused ignored him and he just walked off. PW1 gave multiple verbal commands to the Accused for his particulars and to stop but the Accused did not comply with his commands. PW1 then stood in front of the Accused and he placed his left palm in front of the Accused and asked him to stop[^13].

23     However, the Accused continued to walk and he walked into PW1’s palm resulting in PW1’s palm coming into contact with the Accused’s chest. The Accused then told PW1 that he is not allowed to touch the Accused and if he were to touch the Accused again, the Accused will lose his cool[^14]. The Accused then continued to walk off and PW1 stood in front of the Accused to stop him from leaving[^15]. The Accused then pushed PW1 on his chest using both his hands 3 continuous times[^16].

24     After pushing PW1, the Accused tried to walk away and PW1 grabbed the Accused’s left wrist to prevent him from walking away. PW1 also told the Accused that he was going to call the police[^17].

25     The Accused then forcefully tried to release PW1’s grip by using his left hand to remove PW1’s hand. PW1 then told the Accused that he was going to call the police and PW1 released his grip on the Accused[^18]. At this point, the Accused told PW1 that he will wait for the police to come and he went to 80 Syed Alwi Road and sat on a chair[^19]. PW1 then proceeded to call the police but he was not able to get through to the police[^20].

26     PW1 also testified that the Accused had sustained an injury to his left wrist when he tried to release PW1’s grip forcefully. When the Accused tried to release PW1’s grip forcefully using his right hand, PW1’s finger nail accidentally made cut at the Accused’s wrist[^21].

27     However, after sitting down for about 5 seconds, the Accused again stood up and tried to walk off again. PW1 again stood in front of the Accused to prevent him from leaving and he told the Accused “I thought you told me you wanted to wait for the police to arrive”[^22]. The Accused then used his right hand to grab PW1’s neck and choked him. The Accused grabbed PW1’s neck using his thumb and 4 fingers. The area between the Accused’s thumb and fingers came into contact with PW1’s Adam apple. The Accused hit PW1’s Adam apple and he tightened his grip[^23]. PW1 then used his right hand and placed it over the Accused’s shoulder to try and pin him down to release his grip on PW1[^24]. PW1 also testified that when the Accused hit his Adam apple, he felt pain and he was unable to breathe[^25].

28     After this, PW2 came over to separate the 2 of them. PW1 then proceeded to call the police[^26]. In PW1’s telephone call to the police, PW1 informed the police that “I am from NEA and I have an offender who tried to choke me on my neck. Ambulance not required”[^27].

## b.   PW2’s Evidence

29     PW2 gave evidence that he was working as an enforcement officer on the day in question and PW1 was his partner during the enforcement duties[^28]. PW2 also confirmed that there was another colleague PW3 who was with them on that day[^29].

30     According to PW2, he was patrolling with PW1 and he was about 10 metres in front of PW1. At that time, PW2 was observing one offender while PW1 was observing another offender. However, in less than 2 to 3 minutes, PW2 saw PW1 struggling and he ran over to the scene[^30]. When he reached the scene, PW2 saw the Accused choking PW1 using his right hand[^31]. PW2 noted that PW1 was standing near to one of the Indian restaurants when the choking happened[^32]. PW2 saw the Accused’s right hand in front of PW1’s neck and PW1 right hand was wrapped around the Accused’s shoulder[^33]. PW2 then separated the 2 of them[^34].

31     PW2 also observed PW1 trying to pull off the Accused’s hand by trying to get hold of the Accused’s wrist which was on his neck[^35]. PW2 also noted that PW1 was looking stunned and his face was in a bit of a panic[^36].

32     PW2 also observed the Accused and the Accused’s face “looked angry” and PW2 decided to calm the Accused down after separating the 2 of them[^37]. PW2 tried to calm the Accused by talking to him and telling him “to relax and to have some patience”[^38]. PW2 also noticed that there was a lady who was with the Accused when the incident happened but he did not speak to the lady[^39].

33     After PW2 had separated both the parties, PW2 told PW1 to leave[^40] and he also saw PW1 calling the police[^41]. PW2 also spoke to the Accused and the Accused admitted to PW2 that he had littered[^42]. PW2 also asked the Accused for his particulars[^43]. When the police arrived, PW2 handed the Accused over to the police and he saw the police handcuffing the Accused[^44].

34     Other than his oral evidence, PW2 also drew a plan to show the positions of the parties during the incident[^45]. PW2 explained that at the time of the choking incident, PW2 was standing ahead of PW1 and facing PW1 while PW3 was behind PW1 and facing PW1’s back. PW2 also gave a demonstration in court of what happened between PW1 and the Accused and how the Accused had choked PW1[^46].

35     In cross-examination, PW2 also said that he did not see or notice PW1 using the top of his left hand to press against the left side of the Accused’s neck when he was separating the 2 of them[^47]. PW2 also said that he could not remember the Accused telling him or asking him why PW1 had used force on the Accused[^48].

36     During cross-examination, the Defence Counsel had suggested to PW2 that the Accused was not looking angry but his appearance was one of shock and tense. PW2 did not agree with the Defence Counsel’s suggestion[^49].

## c.   PW3’s Evidence

37     On the day in question, PW3 was an auxiliary police officer with Certis Cisco and he was deployed to work on anti-littering and smoking patrol with PW1 and PW2[^50].

38     On that day, PW3 was issuing a summons to an offender when his offender told him that his officer behind was being choked by an offender. PW3 turned back and saw PW1 being choked by the Accused. PW3 also saw PW1 struggling and trying to grab the Accused by placing his right hand over the Accused’s shoulder[^51]. PW3 also saw PW2 going towards PW1 and separating PW1 from the Accused[^52].

39     PW3 also drew a sketch plan of the parties’ positions[^53] and he also gave demonstration in court of how the Accused had choked PW1 and how PW1 was trying to grab at the Accused[^54].

40     PW3 then quickly issued the summons to his offender and he went up to PW1. When he arrived at the scene, PW2 had separated PW1 and the Accused and PW2 talking to the Accused[^55]. PW3 then went up to PW1 and asked PW1 what had happened. PW1 told PW3 that the Accused had committed a littering offence and he had refused to give PW1 his particulars and he had also asked PW1 “who are you to ask for my particulars”[^56]. While PW3 was with PW1, PW3 also saw PW1 activating the police[^57].

41     PW3 also noted that there were some marks at PW1’s neck and the marks were on both sides of PW1’s neck[^58].

42     After PW2 spoke to the Accused, PW3 also tried to talk to the Accused. PW3 identified himself as a NEA officer and he tried to explain to the Accused the offence he had committed and he asked for the Accused’s particulars. But the Accused refused to give PW3 his particulars and he asked PW3 “who are you to ask for my particulars”[^59]. PW3 also said that he was not aware that the Accused had given his particulars to PW2 as he did not see that happen[^60].

43     PW3 also noted that the Accused had a female friend with him and she was standing in front of the restaurant and about 2 to 3 steps away from the Accused when PW1 was being choked[^61].

## d.   PW4’s Evidence

44     PW4 was the investigating officer who was in charge of this case and he was the police officer who had recorded the Accused’s statement after he was arrested by the police. The Prosecution had tendered the Accused’s statement as part of their case and the Accused’s statement was marked as Exhibit P14[^62].

45     PW4 also gave evidence in court that it is standard police operating procedure that an arrested person will be asked if he has any injuries or require any specific medication and if the Accused had informed the officers of any medical condition or injuries, he would be referred to a doctor so that the doctor can certify that the Accused is fit for detention[^63].

46     PW4 could not remember if the Accused had informed him that he was not feeling well when he was taking the Accused’s statement. However, PW4 did say that if the Accused was unwell at the time his statement was being recorded, PW4 would have activated the doctor to take a look at the Accused[^64].

47     PW4 did remember the Accused informing him that he was very nervous as this was the first time he was dealing with the police[^65]. PW4 also remembered the Accused showing him his wrist and injury and informing him that the injury was caused by PW1. The Accused had described his injury as very serious with blood oozing out of his wrist[^66]. PW4 also observed that the injury was a very minor injury[^67]. According to PW4, the injury was an abrasion with a minor tear in the skin with little blood[^68] and it was “the type that would result in a needle prick type of blood loss”[^69].

48     PW4 also did not remember the Accused asking for food during the interview as the Accused would have been given food, water and medical attention before the start of his interview with the Accused[^70].

## e.   The Accused’s (DW1’s) Evidence

49     The Accused had given evidence that on the day in question, he was having lunch with DW2 at the restaurant when he had to step out of the restaurant to answer a telephone call[^71]. The Accused was standing outside the restaurant when he was taking the telephone call and he was also smoking at the same time[^72]. When the Accused finished his telephone call, he threw his cigarette butt into a small drainage[^73].

50     The Accused then made his way back into the restaurant and he was stopped by PW1[^74]. PW1 identified himself as a NEA officer and informed the Accused that he had committed an offence of littering and requested for his IC[^75].

51     The Accused informed PW1 that he did not have his IC with him and it was in his purse which was in his bag in the restaurant. The Accused then apologised for littering[^76]. The Accused also informed PW1 that he will need to retrieve his bag in order to give PW1 his IC[^77]. PW1 then told the Accused to go and get his IC and he informed the Accused that he will be waiting for the Accused[^78].

52     The Accused then went back into the restaurant, paid the bill and left the restaurant with DW2[^79]. When the Accused left the restaurant, he did not see PW1. The Accused stood outside the restaurant and looked around to look for PW1 but he could not find him. The Accused thought that PW1 had given him a chance and he then turned left to walk towards the MRT station[^80].

53     As the Accused was walking away, he heard someone shouting very loudly “Hey where are you going”. The Accused turned and he saw PW1 running towards him[^81]. PW1 was running towards the Accused at a fast pace and PW1 was very firm and serious and he shouted “Hey you, where are you going? Given me your IC”[^82].

54     The Accused answered PW1 “I am not going anywhere. I was looking for you. I did not see you. That is why I turned to my left”. But PW1 just said in a raised voice “Give me your IC”[^83].

55     The Accused then asked PW1 “What is my offence, why should I give you my IC to you?”[^84]. All these while, DW2 was standing beside the Accused[^85]. PW1 then displayed his badge and replied “You littered and it is an offence, Can you please give me your IC”[^86]. The Accused then put his laptop bag down and told PW1 “I am sorry for littering, can you give me a chance?”[^87]. However, PW1 proceeded to raise his voice and he told the Accused “Just give me your IC”. The Accused also noted that PW1 was very serious looking and he was sharp and firm and he was very angry[^88].

56     The Accused then asked PW1 “Do you have any proof that I littered?”[^89]. The Accused said that he told PW1 this because he wanted to take a chance as he thought that if PW1 has no proof, he may let the Accused go[^90]. PW1 replied “I see you littering, just give me your IC”[^91]. PW1 was very serious and angry when he said those words to the Accused[^92]. The Accused then lowered his voice and said to PW1 “I understand that I littered, but do you have any proof”[^93]. The Accused also demonstrated in court the gesture that he made with his hands (ie raising his hands) when he said those words to PW1[^94].

57     When the Accused raised his hands and asked for proof, PW1 got really upset and angry[^95] and PW1 suddenly reached out and grabbed the Accused’s left wrist. The manner which PW1 held onto the Accused was reflected in the Defence’s exhibit D1E[^96]. PW1 then proceeded to push the Accused’s hand down and causing the Accused to suffer pain in his hand[^97].

58     PW1 then said to the Accused “just give me your IC” while holding to the Accused’s left wrist[^98]. The Accused then told PW1 to “leave my hand”[^99]. The Accused said that he was pleading with PW1 because his hand was in pain[^100]. The Accused then used his right hand to try and pull off PW1’s hand[^101]. But PW1 did not let go of the Accused’s wrist and he repeated “give me your IC” in a very serious tone[^102]. The Accused then requested PW1 to “let me speak to my friend (“DW2”)”. But PW1 just repeated “Give me your IC”[^103]. As the Accused was in pain, he shouted at PW1 “leave my hand”[^104]. PW1 then took his left hand and he pushed it against the Accused’s neck to push him back[^105]. When PW1 did that, the pain in the Accused’s neck was very severe as he was suffering from spondylitis[^106].

59     The Accused tried to use his right hand to push out the PW1’s left hand from his neck. He did this for a total of 3 times, but to no avail[^107]. Each time the Accused tried to push PW1’s hand away from his neck, PW1 would tighten his grip on the Accused’s hand and kept pressing back against his neck[^108]. The Accused also said that when PW1 tightened his grip on the Accused’s left hand and the Accused felt pain, the Accused will use his right hand to try and release PW1’s grip on the Accused’s hand. But when PW1 applied force to his neck, the Accused will take his right hand off PW1’s wrist to try and remove PW1’s hand from his neck[^109]. DW2 also told PW1 to “_leave him_” 2 to 3 times[^110]. Then PW2 then came over and separated the parties. PW2 told PW1 to leave the Accused and PW1 then let go of the Accused’s wrist[^111].

60     PW2 also spoke to the Accused and the Accused told PW2 “I never disagreed I litter” but he just asked PW1 “Do you have any proof”[^112]. The Accused also said he did not know that PW2 was a NEA officer when he separated the parties[^113] and he had said those words to PW2 because he had stopped the fight and “that was the first thing that came out of his mouth”[^114]. After this PW2 identified himself as a NEA officer and asked for the Accused’s IC[^115].

61     When PW1 released the Accused’s wrist, the Accused saw that his wrist of bleeding and he took a photo of the injury as evidence of the same. This photograph was tendered by the Defence as exhibit D3. The Accused also said that he got the injury on the wrist because of the multiple grips by PW1[^116].The Accused said that PW1’s nail had cut the Accused’s skin causing blood to come out[^117].

62     The Accused saw that there was a lot of blood from his injury and he showed his cut to both PW2 and DW2[^118]. He also asked PW2 “Why do you need to apply so much force when someone just ask for proof. I would have given my IC. I just ask where is the proof, is this level of force really required?”[^119].

63     The Accused also testified that at that time, his blood pressure was low and he felt giddy and he requested PW2 to sit down and he went to sit down at the row of chairs which can be seen in photo D4[^120]. The Accused then cleaned his wound and DW2 went off to buy plaster and orange juice for him[^121]. When DW2 came back, she helped to apply the plaster on his wound and she also bought him an orange juice which he drank[^122].

64     The Accused also saw PW1 making a telephone call after he was separated from the Accused[^123]. When PW1 was making the call, PW2 came over and told the Accused “Police is coming, just relax and be cool. You should always give IC when NEA officer asks”[^124]. At this time, the Accused was sitting at the row of chairs as seen in exhibit D4. The Accused then told PW2 “I agreed I littered but I don’t know why all these happened”[^125]. The Accused also asked PW2 if he could smoke and PW2 told him to smoke near a bin[^126]. The Accused also said that DW2 also spoke to PW2 but he did not know what they spoke about[^127].

65     As for PW3, the Accused said that he did not see him around and PW3 only arrived when the police arrived which is about 20 minutes after the incident[^128]. The Accused also said that when the police arrived, they did ask him if he had thrown the cigarette butt and he said he did not.

66     The Accused also testified that it is not physically possible for him to choke PW1 because he is unable to reach PW1’s neck due to the difference in height[^129].

## f.   DW2’s Evidence

67     DW2 and the Accused are ex-colleagues. DW2 had known the Accused since 2012. On the day in question, DW2 had gone to Mustafa Centre to buy something and she had met the Accused outside Mustafa Centre and they had decided to have lunch together at the restaurant[^130].

68     During lunch, DW2 recalled that the Accused had gone out of the restaurant for about 5 to 10 minutes[^131]. When the Accused returned to the restaurant, DW2 had finished her lunch. The Accused then settled the bill and both of them left the restaurant[^132].

69     When they came out of the restaurant, DW2 was 2 to 3 steps behind the Accused. They then turned left to go towards Farrer Park MRT[^133]. DW2 then heard a cry “Hey you, where are you going?”[^134]. DW2 turned and saw PW1 rushing towards them[^135]. DW2 also said that the cry from PW1 was very loud and on a scale it is about 8 out of 10 and it was loud enough to shock DW2[^136]. DW2 also said that when PW1 approached them, he did not identify himself as a NEA officer[^137].

70     PW1 then said “Where are you going. You littered. You need to give me your IC”[^138]. DW2 also said that PW1 was very stern and firm and he was very demanding and he looked very angry[^139]. DW2 also said that PW1 was much taller than the Accused and the Accused’s height was only to PW1’s chin[^140]. The Accused then asked PW1 “Why do you need my IC?”[^141] and PW1 replied “You littered, you need to give me your IC”[^142]. The Accused then told PW1 “I understand that I littered but do you have any proof?”[^143]. PW1 then caught the Accused’s left hand and he said “Sir, just give me your IC”[^144]. DW2 also demonstrated in court on how PW1 had grabbed the Accused’s left hand[^145].

71     After PW1 grabbed the Accused’s left hand, the Accused told PW1 “Just leave my hand, let me speak to my friend”[^146] but PW1 was very firm and he said “No, just give me your IC”[^147]. This was repeated for 5 to 6 times[^148]. The Accused also tried to use his right hand to release PW1’s grip and he tried to pull out PW1’s hand[^149] 2 to 3 times[^150]. After this, PW1 used his left hand to push against the Accused’s neck and the Accused tried to push off PW1’s hand 2 to 3 times[^151].

72     DW2 also observed that when PW1’s left hand was pressing against the Accused’s neck, the Accused’s facial expression looked like he was “almost crying”[^152]. DW2 then told PW1 “Just leave him, we are not going anywhere, please leave him”[^153]. But PW1 did not pay any attention. After about 2 minutes, PW2 came running towards them and he told PW1 “Just leave him”[^154]. PW2 also told the Accused “Just give me your IC”[^155]. After this, PW1 let go of both the Accused’s hand and neck[^156]. When PW1 let go of the Accused’s hand, DW2 saw blood oozing out of the Accused’s hand[^157]. DW2 then went off to a shop to buy a plaster and orange juice and she applied the plaster for the Accused and the Accused drank the orange juice[^158].

73     DW2 also testified that she did not speak to PW2 but she heard PW2 tell the Accused that “you should give IC when NEA officer ask for IC”[^159]. The Accused then asked PW2 if he could sit down and PW2 agreed. PW2 also told the Accused that “police is coming”[^160].

74     DW2 also said that the police came about 20 minutes later. And while waiting for the police, the Accused and DW2 sat at some chairs and the Accused asked PW2 if he could smoke and PW2 said he could but he told the Accused to throw the cigarette butt in the right place[^161].

75     When the police came, one of the officers asked the Accused if he had littered and the Accused denied that he had littered and he told the officer that he did not litter[^162].

## g.   My findings of the facts

76      For DAC 932397-2017, the Accused is charged that he, on 31 March 2017, at about 1.44 pm, in the vicinity of 80 Syed Alwi Road Singapore, had used criminal force on PW1, who is an authorised officer appointed by NEA to carry out enforcement duties, in the execution of his duty as such public servant, by pushing PW1 3 times on his chest and the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

77     Section 353 of the Penal Code states:

> **“353**.    Whoever assaults or used criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with the intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both.”

78      For DAC 932398-2017, the Accused is charged that he , on 31 March 2017, at about 1.44 pm, in the vicinity of 80 Syed Alwi Road Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to PW1, being a public servant, to wit, an authorised officer appointed by NEA to carry out enforcement duties, in the discharge of his duty as public servant, by choking PW1’s neck with his right hand, causing him unable to breathe and the Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

79     Section 332 of the Penal Code states:

> **“332**.    Whoever voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, or with the intent to prevent or deter that person or any other public servant from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by that person in the lawful discharge of his duty as a public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishment.”

80     For both DAC 932397-2017 and DAC 932398-2017, it is not disputed that PW1 was a public servant who was carrying out his duty at the material time.

81     In the present case, there is a dispute of facts as to whether the Accused did push PW1 3 times on his chest and choked PW1’s neck. The Prosecution’s case is that the Accused did commit the same acts and the Defence’s position is that the Accused did not do both the acts as alleged. The question here is which version I should accept.

82     Having considered the evidence of all the witnesses, I am prepared to accept the Prosecution’s position that the Accused did push PW1 3 times on his chest and also choked PW1’s neck.

## Credibility of witnesses

83     I am in agreement with the Prosecution as to the position of the law relating to credibility of witnesses. In _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> (_“Farida Begam”_), Yong Pung How CJ at \[9\] had stated:

> “9    A judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

>> (a)    His demeanour.

>> (b)    The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence.

>> (c)    The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).”

## PW1 is a credible witness

84     In the present case, I am of the view that PW1 is a credible and reliable witness. He answered all the questions that was put before him with clarity and with proper explanations and his evidence is consistent and was not shaken by the Defence’s cross-examination. I also agree and accept the Prosecution’s submission that PW1 had provided coherent and logical explanations for all his actions/behaviour and the accused’s conduct at each stage if their interaction and that his evidence bears a ring of truth[^163].

85     In the present case, PW1 had said that he did not see a doctor after the assault by the Accused[^164]. The Defence has submitted that PW1’s evidence cannot be believed because it is unbelievable that PW1 did not seek any medical attention after being pushed 3 times in the chest and being choked with a considerable amount of force that caused his Adam Apple to remain numb for 2 days[^165]. I am of the view that this point is neither here or there and this cannot lead to the conclusion that PW1 is not telling the truth.

## PW1’s evidence is corroborated by the evidence of PW2 and PW3

86     PW1’s evidence is also corroborated by PW2 and PW3’s evidence. I also note the following :-

> i.     All 3 witnesses gave very similar accounts of their respective positions and the sequence of events which had taken place on the day in question.

> ii.     PW2 and PW3 had testified in court that they saw the Accused choking PW1 and PW3 also saw marks on PW1 after the choking incident.

> iii.     PW2 and PW3 also gave demonstrations in court on how the Accused had choked PW1 and how PW1 tried to get the Accused to release the choke by placing his hand over the Accused’s shoulder to push the Accused’s down. The demonstration by PW2 and PW3 are consistent with PW1’s explanation as to how he was choked by the Accused and how he had tried to get out of the choke.

> iv.     PW2 and PW3’s account of what had taken place were materially consistent with PW1’s account.

> v.     PW2 had given evidence that he saw “PW1 was looking stunned and his face was in a bit of a panic[^166]”. This clearly ties in and is consistent with PW1’s evidence that when the Accused hit his Adam apple, he felt pain and he was unable to breathe.

> vi.     PW2 had also observed the Accused looking angry after the choking incident. This is also consistent with PW1’s evidence as to the series of event which had taken place on that day. PW1 had said that he had said that when he tried to stop the Accused from walking away by standing in front of the Accused and placing his palm in front of the Accused when the Accused first came out of the restaurant, the Accused had continued to walk into PW1’s palm and had warned PW1 that he would lose his cool if PW1 touched him again. This was when the Accused responded by pushing PW1 3 times in his chest. So when PW1 did grab the Accused’s wrist later on to prevent the Accused from leaving, the Accused did lose his cool and went on to choke PW1.

> vii.     PW2 and PW3 are independent witnesses who have nothing to gain from this exercise. There is no reason for them to want to make false allegations or to lie against the Accused just to get him into trouble. I also find PW2 and PW3 very clear in their evidence in court and I am of the view that they are very reliable witnesses.

> viii.     I also note PW3’s evidence in court is further backed up by the fact that the offender whom he was issuing the summons had pointed out to PW3 that PW1 was being choked by the Accused which led PW3 turning around to witness the incident.

87     Given the above, I would disagree with the Defence’s submission that it is possible that PW2 and PW3 did not witness the choking incident and that their evidence should be disregarded by this Court[^167].

88     As for the incident of pushing PW1 on his chest, although the Prosecution did not provide any other witnesses or evidence to corroborate PW1’s story, I am inclined to believe PW1’s version of what had happened between the parties. As mentioned in paragraph 84 above, I am of the view that PW1 is a credible and reliable witness who had answer all the questions that was put before him with clarity and with proper explanations and his evidence is consistent and was not shaken by the Defence’s cross-examination. I also accept the Prosecution’s submission that while PW2 and PW3 did not see the pushing incident, it does not mean that the pushes did not happened. Both PW2 and PW3 had testified that they did not witness the pushing. I agree with the Prosecution that this demonstrates that PW2 and PW3 are disinterested and honest witnesses who had testified as to what they had seen and perceived on that day and that they did not collude with PW1 in order to support his account of the events.

89     I do note that both the Accused and DW2 had given evidence to say that both the pushing incident and the choking incident did not take place. However, I am not prepared to accept the Defence’s version of what had happened on that day. I will give my reasons for rejecting the Accused’s and DW2’s evidence later on in my judgment.

## Accused’s evidence

90     I note the Accused has not been consistent in his evidence in this case.

## There is material discrepancy between Accused’s evidence in court, exhibit P11 and exhibit P14

91     I note that there are material discrepancies between the Accused’s evidence in court and his statements to PW4 in exhibits P11 and P14. This can be seen in the following:

> i.     The Accused, in his examination in chief, had said that when PW1 first caught him littering when he went out of the restaurant to take a smoke, the Accused had apologised for littering and he had informed PW1 that he needed to retrieve his IC from his bag which was in the restaurant to give PW1 his IC. However, when the Accused left the restaurant, he did not see PW1 and he thought that PW1 had given him a chance and he decided to walk towards the MRT station. And the Accused was walking away, he heard someone shouting very loudly “Hey where are you going” and he turned and PW1 running towards him. PW1 then demanded for the Accused’s IC. The Accused then asked PW1 “What is my offence, why should I give you my IC to you?”. PW1 then replied “You littered and it is an offence, Can you please give me your IC”. The Accused then put his laptop bag down and told PW1 “I am sorry for littering, can you give me a chance?”. However, PW1 proceeded to raise his voice and he told the Accused “Just give me your IC”.

> ii.     However, in his cautioned statement which was recorded by PW4 on 7 September 2017 and tendered by the Prosecution as exhibit P11, the Accused said that he had “come out for smoking and littered. When the NEA officer approached me, I said I will settle the bill and come out. After I settled the bill, the NEA officer stopped me and asked for my IC when I denied smoking[^168]”.

> iii.     It is clear that the series of events in exhibit P11 and the Accused’s evidence in Court are very different. In exhibit P11, the Accused said he told PW1 at the first meeting that “I will settle the bill and come out”. However, in Court, the Accused had said “I told PW1 I will go and take my IC from my purse and the wallet and I will come out and pass it to you”.

> iv.     When questioned by the learned DPP on this discrepancy, the Accused admitted that there was a difference in his evidence in exhibit P11 and in court. This is because when PW4 was reading the 2 charges to him in exhibit P11, he became quite tense and he was shivering and he wrote down the wrong answer in exhibit P11. The truth is that he did not say “I will settle the bill and come out” to PW1[^169].

> v.     Another material difference in the Accused’s evidence is that in exhibit P11, the Accused had denied committing the offence of littering. However, in court, the Accused had said that he had admitted to PW1 and had apologised to PW1 for littering even before he had gone back to restaurant to retrieve his bag.

> vi.     When questioned by the learned DPP on this discrepancy, the Accused admitted that what was recorded in exhibit P11 was “not the truth”[^170] and the reason why he said that in exhibit P11 was because he was shocked, intense and he was shivering and crying[^171].

> vii.     The Accused also gave evidence in Court that he saw blood on his hand only after PW2 had separated him from PW1. However, in exhibit P11, the Accused had said that “the officer (“PW1”) hold my hand tightly and it was bleeding”. When asked by the DPP as to why there was such a discrepancy, the Accused said that he had written wrongly in exhibit P11 because he was tense and his blood pressure was low and “things were just flowing out of my brain”.[^172]

> viii.     PW4 had also recorded the Accused’s statement on 1 April 2017. This statement was tendered by the Prosecution as exhibit P14. In exhibit P14, the Accused had said: “I went out of the restaurant and stood along the road to smoke. I finished the call from India and I threw the stub into the drain. After I threw the stub into the drain, an officer came over to me and requested for my ID card. My purse was inside the restaurant, as such I informed the officer. I went into the restaurant to collect my belongings. I collected my item and exited the restaurant from the same door, however, I did not see the officer standing outside the door. He saw me exiting and then he ran towards me. He stopped me and asked me for my ID again. I asked him what was the offence. The officer shouted at me and grabbed my hand.”[^173]

> ix.     I note that the Accused did not mention the fact that he had apologised to PW1 before going back to the restaurant to retrieve his bag and IC in exhibit P14. I also note that there is no mention in exhibit P14 of the Accused saying to PW1 “I am sorry for littering, can you give me a chance?”. So what is recorded in exhibit P14 is materially very different from his evidence in Court.

## The Accused has also given different versions of how PW1 had held onto his hand and how he had tried to remove PW1’s hand

92     When PW1 was being cross-examined by Defence Counsel, the Accused had given a demonstration of how PW1 had held onto his left wrist and this is evidenced by the photograph exhibit D1E[^174] which was tendered by the Defence. Exhibit D1E showed PW1 holding on to the Accused’s left wrist with PW1’s palm resting on top of the Accused’s left wrist with PW1’s right thumb grabbing the left side of the Accused’s wrist and the rest of PW1’s fingers grabbing the right side of the Accused’s wrist.

93     However, in the course of the trial, the Accused had given another demonstration of how PW1 was holding onto his hand in exhibits P13 and the photographs in exhibit P13 showed that PW1’s grip on the Accused’s left wrist was in a different position from that shown in exhibit D1E in that PW1’s palm was holding the bottom part and not the top part of the Accused’s wrist and PW1’s fingers were digging into the top part of the Accused’s wrist instead of the left side of the Accused’s wrist [^175].

## The Accused also gave different accounts of how he had to push PW1’s arm away from his neck

94     I also note the Accused has also given different accounts on how he had tried to push PW1’s hand away from his neck.

95     In examination in chief, the Accused had said that he had used his right hand to push PW1’s left hand away from his neck a total of 3 times. And after each push, PW1 would tighten his grip on the Accused’s hand and apply pressure on his neck and the Accused would then use his right hand to remove PW1’s right hand from his left wrist.

96     However, during cross-examination, the Accused changed his account and said that he did not release his right hand from PW1’s left hand that was pressing against his neck when PW1 was pushing against his neck for 3 times:

>   
| 

**DPP**:

 | 

Mr. Srikanth, listen to my question first. Are you saying now that when this---this thing was happening, when you’re trying to push his left hand away from the side of your neck you at some point in time, actually managed---you actually released you hand, released your grip?

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

I did not---released….I was trying to move towards my left hand, immediately he’s increased the pressure he---increased---his increased the force on my left hand. And he is increasing his force on my neck.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

**DPP**:

 | 

at all times you---when the officer’s hand was---left hand was in your neck area and you’re holding on to the left hand with your right hand--- you did not let go of your grip? On his hand at any point in time?

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

Correct**.**

 |
| 

**…**

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

Her question is the grip on your other hand. Her question is Do you let go at any point of time

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

No. I did not

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

Alright, thank you

 |
| 

**Q:**

 | 

So you did not let go of your right hand at any point of time?

 |
| 

**A:**

 | 

Yes[^176]

 |

  
  

## On the issue of whether the Accused can reach PW1’s neck in order to choke him

97     Other than saying he did not assault PW1, the Accused is also saying that it is not physically possible for him to choke PW1 because of the height difference between the 2 of them and that he is unable to reach PW1’s neck in order to choke him.

98     The Accused had informed PW4 of this when PW4 was recording his statement on 1 April 2017. In exhibit P14, the Accused had informed PW4 that he is 5 feet 7 inches in height and that he “never choke” PW1 because “he is much taller than me”[^177].

99     In court, the Accused had maintain his position and this can be clearly seen when the Defence Counsel was cross-examining PW1 and he had suggested to PW1 that it is not possible for the Accused to choke PW1 because “your neck area is not within the accused’s reach”[^178].

100    However, it is clear from the Notes of Evidence that when the Accused was being cross examined by the DPP, he had vacillated a number of times before finally admitting that he was able to reach PW1’s neck[^179].

101    I also note that during the examination in chief of PW1, Defence Counsel had requested for both PW1 and the Accused to stand side by side in order to compare their height difference and I had approved of the same. When the 2 of them were standing side by side, I had noted that the Accused’s height is just below the ear level of PW1[^180]. Looking at the height difference between PW1 and the Accused, it is clear to me that the Accused is able to reach PW1’s neck with his hands despite the height difference between the 2 of them.

102    Given the above, I would agree with the Prosecution that this inconsistency by the Accused has cast much doubt on his credibility as a witness[^181].

## Accused’s allegation that he was suffering from spondylitis

103    The Accused had claimed that he was suffering from spondylitis and when PW1 pressed his hand against his neck, the Accused had suffered severe pain in his neck due to his medical condition[^182]. However, asked by the learned DPP to produce medical evidence to support his medical condition, the Accused said that he did not have any medical evidence to support his spondylitis as he had been treated and he had been cured of spondylitis[^183]. The Accused also admitted that when he was in the police lockup after his arrest, he did not inform the lockup officer that he was suffering from spondylitis nor did he inform PW4 of this medical condition as it had been treated.[^184] .

104    I also noted that there was no mention of spondylitis by the Accused is his section 23(1) statement in exhibit P14 as well as his statement to PW4 in exhibit P14.

105    Given the Accused’s bare assertion, I am not inclined to believe the Accused’s evidence that he is suffering from spondylitis.

## Accused’s version of events is incredible and illogical

106    The learned DPP had also submitted that the Accused’s account of what happened was inherently incredible and illogical. In her Prosecution’s Closing Submission, the learned DPP had pointed out the following[^185]:

> i.     In addition to being inconsistent, the Accused’s account is also inherently incredible and illogical on two levels. First, it is extremely unlikely that PW1, a NEA officer, would suddenly attack the Accused whilst talking to him by digging his fingernails on the Accused’s left wrist and thereafter using his other hand to press on the Accused’s neck in such an awkward manner.

> ii.     Second, there are also several strange and puzzling aspects of the Accused’s own behaviour in his account that are irrational and contradictory:

>> (a)       In his account, the Accused claimed that he had every intention to hand over his ID over to PW1. He also knew that PW1 was waiting for his ID. However, the Accused was unable to explain (i) why had to settle his bill in the restaurant first and (ii) why he did not hand the ID over to PW1 despite multiple requests for him to do so outside the restaurant.

>> (b)       In his account, the Accused claimed that he felt “suffocated” and “unable to speak” because his neck was “completely blocked by his (referring to PW1)’s hands. However, based on the Accused’s own demonstration, there was only one-sided pressure that was exerted by PW1 on his neck. It is illogical that the Accused would have felt suffocated by a one-sided pressure on his neck.

>> (c)       In his account, the Accused claimed that while PW1 was attacking him, he told PW1 that he wanted to speak to DW2 and asked him to “leave his hand”. However, the Accused could not say what he wanted to speak to DW2 about and why he could not have simply spoken to her when she was only standing “1 foot away”. Further, it is also curious why the Accused could not simply have told PW1 at that point that he would hand his ID over to him in order to stop the alleged attack.

>> (d)       In his account, the Accused claimed that when PW1 pressed onto his neck, he felt an “unbearable” and “horrible” pain. If it were really true that PW1 had pressed onto his neck in such a manner, one would have expected the Accused to have handed over his ID to PW1 (or indicate an intention to do so) immediately. Instead, the Accused (in his own account) reacted by trying to push PW1’s hand away thrice. This is unbelievable.

> iii.     If this Court were to accept the Accused’s account of PW1’s behaviour during the second encounter, it must also necessarily accept the puzzling and inexplicable aspects of the Accused’s own conduct in the same account. Viewed as a whole, the Accused’s account is entirely illogical and plainly contrived. It does not bear a ring of truth and is entirely unpersuasive.

107    I am in full agreement with the Prosecution on their submission. The Accused’s conduct is clearly internally inconsistent with his evidence.

108    I also note that the Accused had informed the police officers who had responded to PW1’s call that he did not commit any littering offence. I find the Accused’s action quite illogical given the fact that his position that he never disagreed littering.

109    Given the above, I am of the view that the Accused is not a truthful and reliable witness and his credibility is in question.

110    Given his performance in court, I would agree with the Prosecution that the Accused is a very shifty witness who would change his evidence in material aspects of his defence when it suited him.

## DW2’s evidence is clearly tailored to match the Accused’s evidence

111    As for DW2’s evidence, the learned DPP had submitted that DW2’s evidence should be treated with much caution for the following reasons[^186]:

> i.     Even though DW2 claimed that she has not spoken or communicated with the Accused since the day of his arrest on 31 March 2017, she had adopted uncannily similar language that were also used by the Accused in his testimony when she gave evidence in court.

> ii.     The learned DPP had also highlighted several examples of the similar languages used by both the Accused and DW2 in Court:-

> iii.     The learned DPP also highlighted the elaborate account which DW2 gave in court which she never gave to the police in her statement (exhibit P18). While DW2 claimed that she did not go into details and provided a summary of what happened to PW4 in exhibit P18, it is highly suspect that she managed to expand and elaborate on her account with the exact same words used by the Accused in court. This is especially since the incident had taken place almost 2 years before DW2 came to testify in court. The learned DPP submitted that DW2’s account in court is unpersuasive and is not the truth.

> iv.     Further, what is even more telling is that DW2 had also changed her position in the same way as the accused. Like the Accused, DW2 had indicated to the Police during investigations that the Accused denied littering to PW1. At the trial, she similarly retracted from this position (like the Accused) and adamantly maintained that the Accused did not deny littering to PW1 and had admitted to it.

112    In view of the above, the learned DPP had submitted that this Court should find DW2 to be a witness that is wholly unworthy of credit and treat her evidence with much caution.

113    Having gone through the evidence, I would agree with the Prosecution that the evidence of the Accused and DW2 are uncannily similar.

114    I also note that DW2’s evidence which was recorded by PW4 in exhibit P18 is materially different from her evidence in court and her evidence in court matches the evidence of the Accused who had also given different evidence in court as compared to his evidence as recorded by PW4.

115    In exhibit P18, DW2 had informed PW4 that when the Accused was approached by PW1 after he had walked out of the restaurant, PW1 had claimed that the Accused had littered and the Accused had denied the same[^198]. However, in her evidence in court, she had said that when PW1 informed the Accused that he had littered and asked for the Accused’s IC, the Accused had admitted to littering and he had told PW1 “I understand that I littered but do you have any proof”[^199]. I note that this change of evidence is similar to the Accused’s evidence in court where he also said the exact same words “I understand that I littered, but do you have any proof”[^200]

116    In exhibit P18, DW2 told PW4 that while walking out of the restaurant, PW1 had identified himself as a NEA officer and he had approached the Accused and had asked for his IC[^201]. However, DW2’s evidence in court was that when PW1 approached them, he did not identify himself and he only showed his ID when the Accused asked[^202]. It is clear that the sequence of events in both the accounts are different. I also note that DW2’s sequence of event in court is similar to that of the Accused where he had given evidence that PW1 had only showed his identification badge only some verbal exchange between the Accused and PW1[^203].

117    I also cannot understand why DW2 had to apologise for the Accused in exhibit P18 for all the trouble that the Accused had caused and ask the authorities to give him another chance when according to DW2, it was PW1 who was the aggressor and the unreasonable party[^204].

118    Given the above, I am of the view that DW2 is not a credible witness. I am agreeable with the Prosecution that DW2 has changed her evidence to tailor the evidence of the Accused and that I should not give much weight to her evidence.

## F.   Conviction

119    Having gone through the evidence, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused accordingly of both the charges.

120    I now turn to address the issue of sentence.

## G.   Antecedent

121    The Accused is untraced for any criminal antecedent.

## H.   Sentence

## a.   Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

122    The Prosecution is seeking a global sentence of at least 4 months’ imprisonment.

123    With regard to the section 332 charge, the Prosecution had relied on the sentencing framework as laid out in the case of _PP vYeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> (“_Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey Yeo_”). The sentencing framework for cases of causing hurt to public officers and public servants who are performing duties akin to police duties is set out in _Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey Yeo_ at \[59\]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.7%"> <col width="40.06%"> <col width="43.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Category</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Circumstances</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Band</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to one year’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability or lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three year’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to seven years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

124    The Prosecution also pointed out that the High Court in _Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey Yeo_ had noted at \[53\] that the concept of “duties akin to police duties” would generally include engagement by a public servant in one or more of the following duties:

> (a)     Maintaining law and order;

> (b)     Preserving public peace;

> (c)     Preventing and detecting crimes;

> (d)     Apprehending offenders;

> (e)     Regulating traffic and processions in public roads and public places;

> (f)     Executing summonses, subpoenas, warrants, commitments and other legal processes issued by the courts and Justices of the Peace;

> (g)     Protecting people from injury or death and public property from damage or loss, whether arising from criminal acts or in any other way;

> (h)     Keeping order in the courts and

> (i)     Escorting and guarding accused persons and prisoners.

125    In the present case, PW1 is a NEA officer tasked to enforce anti-littering and anti-smoking laws and was attempting to issue a summons for an offence of littering when he was violently attacked by the Accused. The framework would therefore apply as PW1 was performing “duties akin to police duties” at the material time.

126    The High Court in _Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ further affirmed the sentencing norm observed in _Zhu Guo Feng_ that “_a custodial sentence was the norm for any assault against a police or law enforcement officer and that the cases established that the usual custodial sentence was around two to nine months’ imprisonment_.” The High Court also observed that offenders can generally expect an **imprisonment term of about three months** where there are no aggravating factors – “Sentences of three months’ imprisonment are often given to first offenders where the assault is relatively minor” (_Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ at \[43\]).

127    The Prosecution had also tendered a table of sentencing precedents and the cases in the table show that sentences of 3 months’ imprisonment have been meted out to offenders who had pleaded guilty to a charge under section 332.

128    The Prosecution also pointed out that on the facts of _Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_, the High Court held at \[76\] that a sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for a 25-year-old offender who had slapped a police officer on his left cheek. The Court also found that the incident occurred out of the public’s view and noted the offender’s genuine remorse and plea of guilt.

129    In the present case, the Prosecution had submitted that a sentence to 4 months’ imprisonment is appropriate for the section 332 charge for the following reasons:

> a.     The Accused had claimed trial and he is not entitled to a plead-guilty discount in the sentence. Further, he had also colluded with DW2 to tailor their evidence at the trial. This shows an utter lack of remorse.

> b.     There are aggravating features in this case:

>> i.       The Accused forcefully attacked PW1 in a vulnerable part of his body, i.e. by choking his neck and causing him to be unable to breathe.

>> ii.       The Accused did so in full view of the public.

>> iii.       The Accused committed the section 332 offence shortly after committing the section 353 offence on the same victim PW1.

130    In relation to the section 353 charge, the Prosecution had submitted that a sentence of at least 4 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate on the facts. The Prosecution had also tendered a table of sentencing precedents in relation to the section 353 charge.

131    And given that the section 353 charge had taken place close in time with the section 332 charge and concerned the same victim, the Prosecution was not asking for the two charges to run consecutively. However, the Prosecution did urged me to give regard to the fact that the Accused had pushed PW1 thrice on the chest before committing the s 332 charge. The Prosecution was of the view that this is an aggravating factor for the purposes of calibrating the sentence for the section 332 charge.

132    In view of the above, the Prosecution had submitted that a global sentence of least 4 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate on the facts.

## b.   Mitigation Plea

133    The Defence has submitted that the Accused is 43 years old. He was convicted after trial for the following 2 charges, ie.![]([2019] SGDC 0257_Image/[2019] SGDC 0257_image1.jpg)

> a.     using criminal force on an NEA officer, punishable under section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224; and

> b.     causing hurt to the said officer, punishable under section 332 Penal Code.

134    Both charges arose from the same single arrest. The Accused has no previous conviction, whether of a similar or any other nature.

135    The Defence also highlighted the following mitigation factors:

> i.     The Accused has a number of medical ailments. He is diabetic and he also suffers from high cholesterol, high blood pressure and hyper thyroid condition.

> ii.     The Accused is at all material times been the sole breadwinner for his young family. The Accused is an engineer by training and has worked in Singapore for the last 17 years. His wife is a homemaker. They have 2 young daughters, aged 11 years and 4 years. His wife also suffers from health issues, related to high cholesterol and a thyroid condition.

> iii.     At all material times, our client has been working as a systems architect (Information Technology) personnel in Singapore. He and his wife arrived in Singapore from India in 2002 and are now Singapore Permanent Residents. Both their children were born here. Because of the present conviction, the Accused has genuine concern that when he has to apply to renew his family's re-entry permit in March 2020, they will encounter problems and the family may have to relocate back to India, despite having made and treated Singapore as their home at all material times.

> iv.     Should they have to leave Singapore, this will entail the children leaving their present home, lives and schools, to go to start life afresh in India. The Accused is also likely to lose his job because of this conviction, as his employers came to know about these proceedings from the press reports after the trial. Even his 11-year-old daughter chanced upon the online news report on this matter. Hence it has become very clear to the Accused that the repercussions of these proceedings on his life have been very far-reaching, which has already been a very great punishment for the Accused to bear.

> v.     The Accused's 73-year-old mother, who suffers from heart problems and visited Singapore recently, underwent the angiogram twice recently. She is still unaware of the present proceedings and the outcome of the same, as the Accused and his siblings, who were earlier not aware of these proceedings but have now learnt of the same, have kept this news from their mother for fear that she will not be able to handle the news of the Accused's conviction and likely sentence about the present proceedings.

> vi.     The Accused also lost his father to cancer recently and is still grieving over the loss of his father.

> vii.     The Accused regrets allowing himself to be placed in his present situation. He wished that on the day in question he had just accepted the fine for throwing the cigarette on the floor, and avoided entering into a conversation with the NEA officer. Had he just accepted the Summons the officer intended to give him, nothing that followed would have happened, and the Accused would not be in his present predicament today.

## c.   Defence Submissions on Sentencing

136    On the issue of sentence, the Defence urged me to have regard to all the above facts and requested that I impose an appropriate fine or a day's jail sentence and a heavy fine.

137    The Defence was also of the view that victim in this case was not a police officer but was instead an NEA officer enforcing littering laws, and if the Court is of the view that a longer custodial sentence would be required, the length of imprisonment should not exceed 1 month in duration.

## d.   Sentence Imposed

## For the section 332 charge

138    For offences under section 332 of the Penal Code, _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) has laid down the sentencing framework for such offences. This sentencing framework is applicable to police officers and public servants who perform “duties akin to police duties”. Tay Yong Kwang JA in delivering the Grounds of Decision of the court in _Jeffrey Yeo_ had stated at \[53\] that:

> _“53_      _…our concept of “duties akin to police duties” would generally include engagement by a public servant in one or more of the following duties:_

>> (a)     _maintaining law and order;_

>> (b)     _preserving public peace;_

>> (c)     _preventing and detecting crimes;_

>> (d)     _apprehending offenders;_

>> (e)     _regulating traffic and processions in public roads and public places;_

>> (f)     _executing summonses, subpoenas, warrants, commitments and other legal processes issued by the courts and Justices of the Peace;_

>> (g)     _protecting people from injury or death and public property from damage or loss, whether arising from criminal acts or in any other way;_

>> (h)     _keeping order in the courts; and_

>> (i)     _escorting and guarding accused persons and prisoners_.”

139    The Defence had submitted that PW1 is merely a NEA officer who is issuing littering fines and he cannot be regarded as “a public servant who was carrying out the duties of a police officer”.

140    I do not agree with the Defence’s submission on this point. The victim PW1 in this case was a NEA officer and he was tasked with anti –littering and anti-smoking duties. His job was to look out for littering and smoking offenders and to issue summons against such offenders. PW1’s duty on the day in question was clearly to identify and detect such offenders and bring them to task. I am of the view that PW1 is clearly performing policing duties or “duties akin to police officers” as defined in _Jeffrey Yeo_ and the sentencing framework in _Jeffrey Yeo_’s case is applicable to the present case.

141    Having considered the facts of this case, I am of the view that this case should fall under Category 1 of the _Jeffrey Yeo_ sentencing framework. Category 1 involve lesser harm and lower culpability. Category 1 encompass section 332 cases where minor injuries and the bodily pain is momentary and where culpability is low. I also note that the sentencing band for Category 1 is “fine or up to one year’s imprisonment”.

142    In _Jeffrey Yeo_, Tay Yong Kwang JA at \[67\] had pointed out for Category 1 cases, the custodial threshold is generally crossed and fines would only be appropriate at the lowest end of the harm-and-culpability spectrum and this sentencing option would generally be available to young offenders or offenders with some mental disorder. In this case, I note that the Accused is neither young nor is he suffering from any form of mental illness.

143    On the issue of benchmark sentences to be imposed for section 332 Penal Code offences, I note that Prosecution’s table of precedents where it can be seen that imprisonment terms of 3 months have been consistently been meted out by our courts for such offences where the offenders have pleaded guilty to such offences where the nature of injuries to the victims are not serious.

144    I also note the commentaries by the editors of the Practitioner’s Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, 3rd Edition, LexisNexis 2013 at page 1116:

> “An attack upon a public servant in the performance of his duties is a serious offence. Public servants must be given adequate protection, and this is reflected in the sentencing for such offences. In general, the offender can expect imprisonment.

> The rationale was stated by the District Court in _Ng Cheng Heng v PP_ (MA 32/93) as follows: ‘Law enforcement agencies like the police have to take on the unpleasant but important task of enforcing the laws of the land in order to maintain social harmony, peace and justice. In the process they often have to come into contact with offenders like the accused. Police and other law enforcement agencies therefore must be protected and any act of violence should not be tolerated or condoned.’ In the English case of _Fletcher_ (1998) 1 Cr App R (S) 7, it was said: ‘Men in the position of these officers, performing a difficult public duty in circumstances where sadly they are only too likely to encounter bad temper and unreasonableness deserve such protection as the courts can give.’

> Sentences of three months’ imprisonment are often given to first offenders where the assault is relatively minor. Higher sentences in the range of six to 12 months’ imprisonment and above can be expected where the assault is serious, where a weapon is used, or where the offender has a prior record of violence. In some cases, caning were also ordered; see _Mani Vannan v PP_ (MA 90/94); _Yim Kwong Meng v PP_ (MA 217/94); _Loh Ping Huang v PP_ (MA 166/2000).”

145    In the present case, I agree with the Prosecution on the following:

> a.     The Accused had claimed trial and he is not entitled to a plead-guilty discount in the sentence.

> b.     There is evidence of collusion with the DW2 to tailor their evidence at trial and this would show a lack of remorse on the part of the Accused.

> c.     There are the following aggravating features in the present case:

>> i.       The Accused had attacked PW1 in a vulnerable part of his body, ie by choking his neck and causing him to be unable to breathe.

>> ii.       The incident took place in a public place

>> ii.       The Accused committed the section 332 offence shortly after committing the section 353 offence on the same victim PW1.

146    Given the above, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the section 332 charge is 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

## For the section 353 charge

147    As regards to the section 353 charge, I note that the usual tariff for section 353 offences involving a public servant is about 3 weeks if the offender pleads guilty to the charge.

148    In this case, given that the Accused has claimed trial to the section 353 charge, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the section 353 charge is 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

149    On the Defence’s submission that the Accused is already sufficiently punished in that he may lose his Singapore Permanent Residence and he risked being terminated from his employment, the Prosecution had drawn my attention to the case of _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> (“_Stansilas_’s case”). In _Stansilas_’s case, CJ Menon had commented at \[110\]:

> “110  The second argument is that an offender should not receive punishment of a certain type or above a certain degree because he will lose his job or face disciplinary proceedings otherwise. The argument is that the imposition of a certain type or degree of punishment will lead to hardship or compromise the offender’s future in some way and that this additional hardship may and indeed should be taken into account by the sentencing court. However, this will not often bring the offender very far. Prof Ashworth accounts for the general lack of persuasiveness of such arguments in the following lucid fashion (_Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ at p 194):

>> Is there any merit in this source of mitigation \[_ie_, the effect of the crime on the offender’s career\]? Once courts begin to adjust sentences for collateral consequences, is this not a step towards the idea of wider social accounting which was rejected above? In many cases one can argue that these collateral consequences are a concomitant of the professional responsibility which the offender undertook, and therefore that they should not lead to a reduction in sentence because the offender surely knew the implications. Moreover, there is a discrimination argument here too. If collateral consequences were accepted as a regular mitigating factor, this would operate in favour of members of the professional classes and against ‘common thieves’ who would either be unemployed or working in jobs where a criminal record is no barrier. It would surely be wrong to support a principle which institutionalized discrimination between employed and unemployed offenders.

> 111    Whichever way one looks at it, I do not regard it as relevant to sentencing. A person who breaches the criminal law can expect to face the consequences that follow under the criminal law. **Whether or not such an offender has already or may as a result suffer other professional or contractual consequences should not be relevant to the sentencing court.** (emphasis mine)

150    The Prosecution had submitted and I agree with the Prosecution that the Accused potential loss of his Singapore Permanent Residence and employment should not be regarded as mitigating factors for the purposes of sentencing.

151    Whilst any detriment to the Accused’s career and his residency in Singapore is regrettable, I am of the view that this is a natural consequence of the Accused’s own actions. In any event, it is also not clear at this point that the Accused’s employment and his residency in Singapore will definitely be affected.

152    Having considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following sentences on the Accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr"><colgroup><col width="13.58%"> <col width="40.04%"> <col width="46.38%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 932397-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 weeks’ imprisonment (concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 932398-2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 weeks’ imprisonment (concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Sentence:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

153    The Accused has applied for and I have granted him a stay pending appeal. He is currently out on bail in the sum of $10,000.
