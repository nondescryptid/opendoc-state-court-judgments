### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

## Introduction

The accused person, male, aged 53 years, a Malaysian national, pleaded guilty to 2 charges under the Customs Act (CA), Chapter 70. The offences were committed on 19 September 2019 at about 8.15am at the Tuas Checkpoint, Singapore, where the accused was concerned in the importation of uncustomed goods, namely assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes, weighing 1,178.169 kilogrammes(kg), on which excise duty of $574,759.08 and Goods and Services Tax (GST) of $42,317.58 was not paid. He had therefore committed 2 offences under section128F of the Customs Act (CA) and punishable under section 128L (4) of the same Act.

2       I sentenced the accused to serve 33 months imprisonment on the duty charge and 3 months imprisonment on the GST charge, and ordered both terms of imprisonment to run concurrently, resulting in a global sentence of 33 months imprisonment. Being dissatisfied, he is now appealing against this sentence.

## The Statement of Facts (SOF)

3       The material portions of the SOF which the accused admitted without qualification is reproduced below.

4       On 9th October 2019, at about 7.45 am, at arrival cargo, Tuas Checkpoint, Singapore, the accused was arrested vide PG20191004/007 for being concerned in importation of uncustomed goods (duty unpaid cigarettes).

#### Facts pertaining to the 1st and 2nd charges (DAC-928580/81-2019)

5       On 19th September 2019, at about 10.40 am, in unit 06-11, 50 Gambas Crescent, Singapore, Customs officers seized one Singapore registered lorry bearing plate number YN411C (V1) for dealing with uncustomed goods (duty unpaid cigarettes). Officers found 6215 cartons x 200 sticks and 394 cartons x 160 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes in the said lorry. The said lorry and cigarettes were seized as case exhibits.

6       Follow up investigations revealed that the seized cigarettes from V1 was smuggled in by a Malaysian prime mover, bearing registration number NCV5550 mounted with trailer bearing Malaysian registration number T/BA1450 (V2), which was driven by the accused into Singapore on 19th September 2019, at about 8.15 a.m via Tuas Checkpoint, Singapore.

7       Further Investigations revealed that the accused was engaged by a male Malaysian Indian known to the accused as ‘Deepan’ to smuggle the said duty unpaid cigarettes into Singapore. The accused was promised RM5000 for each trip that he successfully smuggled cigarettes into Singapore. On the material date of the offence, the seized cigarettes were loaded into V2 by ‘Deepan’s’ workers in Muar, Johor, Malaysia. The accused was further instructed to deliver the seized cigarettes to Benoi Road, Singapore. Acting upon said instructions, the accused drove into Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint with two of ‘Deepan’s’ workers, and headed to Benoi Road. At Benoi Road, the seized cigarettes was transferred to another lorry by a few persons from V2 to V1. He was then paid RM5000 by one of ‘Deepan’s’ workers for the successful importation and delivery of the said cigarettes. He then parted ways with ‘Deepan’s’ workers.

8       The accused knew that the excise duty and the Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) leviable on the seized cigarettes were unpaid at the material time the offences were committed.

9       The excise duty leviable on the seized cigarettes weighing a total of 1,178.169 kilogrammes in the 1st charge is $574,759.08. The GST leviable on the same cigarettes in the 2nd charge, valued at $604,536.79 is $42,317.58.

## The Sentence

10     The accused has been convicted of 2 counts under the Customs Act for offences committed on the 19 of September 2019. The penalty in respect of the first charge in DAC 928580-2019 involving 1,178.169 kg of cigarettes on which duty was not paid would be a fine in the range of $8,621,386.20 to $11,495,181.60 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or to both. Where the GST is concerned for this amount (DAC928581-2019), the penalty is a fine in the range of $634,763.70 to $846,351.60 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or to both.

11     In their written address on sentence, the prosecution, relying on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Pang Shuo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 82</span>_(Pang Shuo)_ submitted for a sentence of 33 months imprisonment for the duty charge and 3 months imprisonment for the GST charge. This, they said, was in line with the table of sentencing precedents where it appeared that for offences involving between 1,000 to 1,400 kg of duty unpaid cigarette, the sentence imposed was in the range of 33 to 34 months imprisonment for the duty charge and 3 months imprisonment for the GST charge. In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused who is a first offender pleaded for leniency. He said he will not repeat his offence and sought the minimum sentence.

12     It is well established that the sentencing ranges for offences involving duty unpaid cigarettes were first outlined by the Chief Justice at \[46\] of _Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span>_._ In this case, the learned Chief Justice at \[27\] and \[35\] identified the quantity of cigarettes as the _key indicator_ of the seriousness of the crime and was the _“primary factor”_ or _“key parameter”_ influencing the length of sentence for a CA offence. The Chief Justice proceeded to consider the relevant factors for such offences and at \[46\], set out a graduated scheme that cross-references the quantity of tobacco with the duration of the imprisonment term that can be expected to be imposed as a starting point. This was as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.52%"> <col width="50.48%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Quantity of Tobacco Products (kg)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range (months)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 – 50</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3-6</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">51-100</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6-12</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">101 – 200</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 – 18</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">201 – 300</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">18 – 24</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">301 – 400</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24 – 30</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">More than 400</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30 – 36</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

13     In the later case of _Pang Shuo_, the High Court, adopting _Yap Ah Lai’s_ approach held that the benchmark sentences as set out in that case for importation are applicable to the sentencing of other offences such as delivery, loading, unloading and storing of duty unpaid tobacco products. The High Court further refined the guidelines for these offences in the form of a graph (Graph 3 at \[49\]). The primary factor to be considered for sentencing remained the quantity of the cigarettes. Based on this graph, the sentence for the accused in respect of the first charge involving 1,178.169 kg would be in the final tier of the table, that is for more than 400 kg the range is between 30-36 months imprisonment. Considering that the amount here of more than 1,000 kg is well beyond the table, and in fact more than double, and hence the maximum sentence of 36 months imprisonment would be in order, a submission of a sentence of 33 months in total was indeed fair and consistent with the table of precedents tendered by the prosecution.

14     Whilst I am mindful of the fact that, despite the presence of sentencing tariffs or benchmarks, the court should be sensitive to the particular facts and circumstances of each case when determining the appropriate sentence, there was nothing exceptional in the present case that would warrant a departure from the sentencing range set out in _Yap Ah Lai_. I have also taken into account the fact that the accused did plead guilty at the first available opportunity, which is a significant mitigating factor.

15     Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to:

16     I ordered both terms of imprisonment to run concurrently, yielding a total sentence of 33 months imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to the 10 October 2019 as he had been in remand since this date.

17     The accused is presently serving his sentence.
