### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Praveen s/o Balan, is a 42-year-old male Singaporean. He pleaded guilty to a total of three charges (“Proceeded Charges”). Another two charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charges”). Following his plea of guilt, a final charge against him was withdrawn and he was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal (“DATA charge”) on that last charge.

2       The Proceeded Charges against him read:

> a)     DAC 940004-2018 (“RTA charge”)

> “You…. charged that you, on 26 November 2018, at about 2.33 a.m., at Lamp Post 86A along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6, Singapore, in the direction towards Bukit Batok West Avenue 6, Singapore, did drive motor car, SJU1892G, when you were under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles, to wit, you were disqualified by a Judge of the State Courts, Singapore, from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 25 years with effect from 15 July 2014 till 14 July 2039 (vide DAC-006348-2014), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 (RTA).

> And further that you, before the commission of the aforesaid offence, had been convicted on four previous occasions of offences under Section 67A(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276, namely:-

>> a)    On 7 January 1999, in Subordinate Court No: 21, you were convicted of an offence of driving a vehicle whilst disqualified by court order under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 vide TAC-19-99;

>> b)    On 23 April 2009, in Subordinate Court No: 21, you were convicted of an offence of driving a vehicle whilst disqualified by court order under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 vide DAC23918/2009;

>> c)    On 12 April 2012, in Subordinate Court No: 21, you were convicted of an offence of driving a vehicle whilst disqualified by court order under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 vide DAC-34610-2011; and

>> d)    On 15 July 2014, in State Court No: 21, you were convicted of an offence of driving a vehicle whilst disqualified by court order under Section 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 vide DAC-006348-2014,

> which all convictions have not been set aside, and you are therefore liable for enhanced punishment under Section 67A(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.”

> b)     DAC 940005-2018 “MVA charge”

> “You…. are charged that you, on 26 November 2018, at about 2.33 a.m., at Lamp Post 86A along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6, Singapore, in the direction towards Bukit Batok West Avenue 6, Singapore, being the driver of motor car SJU1892G, whilst there was not in force in relation to the user of the said vehicle, such a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, Chapter 189 (MVA) and you have thereby contravened Section 3(1)(a) of the Act, which contravention is punishable under Section 3(2) and Section 3(3) of the Act.”

> c)     DAC 900712-2018 (“MDA charge”)

> “You…. are charged that you, on 26 November 2018, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), _to wit_, Methamphetamine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act.”

3       The TIC charges were for the following offences:

> (a)     Taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent under s 96(1) of the RTA which was allegedly committed on the same date, time and place as the proceeded RTA and MVA charges.

> (b)     Possession of a utensil intended to be used in connection with the consumption of a Class A controlled drug under Section 9 MDA punishable under (p/u) section 33(1) MDA which was allegedly committed on the same date, as the proceeded MDA charge.

4       The Prosecution, led by Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Lee Jin Yan (DPP Lee), argued for a global sentence of at least 38 months’ imprisonment and a disqualification order of 30 years (from driving all classes of vehicles). Mr Nevinjit Singh (Mr Singh), counsel for the accused at the time that he pleaded guilty, tendered a written mitigation plea, and also made oral submissions in mitigation. In essence, Mr Singh argued for a global sentence of 32 months’ imprisonment, without specifying the period of disqualification.[^1]

5       Having considered the facts of the case, and the submissions of parties and the precedents tendered, I imposed a global sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment. I also imposed an order of disqualification on the accused against his holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (DQAC) for a period of thirty (30) years with effect from the date of his release. The individual sentences imposed for the Proceeded Charges are as follows:

6       At the request of the accused, his sentence of imprisonment was to begin on 5 February 2020.

7       On 5 February 2020, which was about 4 weeks after the accused had pleaded guilty, and which was also the date that he was supposed to surrender himself to commence serving sentence, the accused turned up in court with a new counsel, Ms Violet Netto. She stated that the accused wanted to file a notice of appeal against his sentence.

8       When Ms Netto was informed that the time for filing of the notice had passed, and that she would need to file a criminal motion in the High Court to seek approval to file a notice of appeal out of time, Ms Netto indicated that she would do so.

9       It appears that a criminal motion was eventually filed by counsel sometime later. On 7 July 2020, the High Court approved the application in Criminal Motion No. 22 of 2020, and the accused was allowed to file a notice of appeal within 7 days of the date of the order. An amended notice of appeal was eventually filed on 14 July 2020.

10     Pursuant to the appeal against sentence that has since been filed, I now set out my reasons for imposing the sentence on the accused.

## Prescribed punishments

12     In respect of charge under s 43(4) of the RTA ,which ordinarily carries a sentence of fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years or to both, the accused was liable, by virtue of s 67A(1) RTA, to enhanced punishment i.e. to punishment not exceeding 3 times the amount of punishment to which he would otherwise have been liable for such a conviction except that where imprisonment is imposed it shall not exceed 10 years.

13     In respect of charge under s 3(1) of the MVA, punishable under s 3(2) of the same Act, the accused was liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both, and by virtue of s 3(3), shall (unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification), be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction.

14     For the drug consumption charge under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA punishable under s 33(1) of the said Act, the prescribed punishment was a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years or a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to both.

## Antecedents

15     The accused has a long list of antecedents, including for previous convictions under the RTA, MVA and MDA, as well as convictions under the Road Traffic Rules (RTR), Customs Act, Goods and Services Act and Films Act. All in all, according to the records from the Criminal Records Office, the accused has 19 previous convictions. In so far as his similar antecedents under the RTA, MVA, MDA, and RTR are concerned, these are summarised below.

17     The Prosecution also asked that the imprisonment sentences for DAC-940004-2018 and DAC-900712-2019 run consecutively, for a global sentence of at least 38 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ DQAC, with the disqualification to commence from the accused’s release from prison.

18     As regards submissions for DAC-940004-2018 i.e. the charge of driving while under disqualification, the Prosecution argued that in respect of the imprisonment term to be imposed, the following factors were relevant:

> (a)     The accused was a 5th\-time offender for such an offence. Thus, in accordance with the principle of escalation, the sentence should be double that imposed for the accused’s s 43(4) p/u s 67A(1) conviction in 2014.

> (b)     The imprisonment sentence sought of 30 months was in line with the sentences set out in the two cases in its sentencing table, namely:

>> (i)        _PP v Lulla Prem Tirth_ (DAC 927986-2015 and ors) (“_Lulla Prem Tirth”_) where the global sentence imposed was 30 months’ and 8 weeks’ imprisonment, DQAC for life, and a fine of $13,000; and

>> (ii)        _PP v Mohamad Esmon Bin Omar_ (DAC 901946-2015 and ors) (“_Mohamad Esmon bin Omar”_) where the global sentence imposed was 30 months’ imprisonment, and DQAC for 30 years, and a fine of $700.

19     In relation to the sentence sought for the drug consumption charge in DAC-900712-2019, the DPP accepted that the accused’s last drug-related antecedent was relatively dated (2000), and argued that a sentence of at least 8 months’ imprisonment was appropriate and in line with the totality principle.

## The Mitigation Plea and the Defence submissions on sentence

20     In his written mitigation plea, counsel for the accused, Mr Singh, emphasised the following:

> (a)     The accused is a divorcee with 2 young school-going children. He is financially responsible for both his children and for the household.

> (b)     As regards the traffic related offences, they were committed by the accused because he “…foolishly believed, at the material time, that he had no other alternative but to take the car out for a drive to attend to some important personal matters”. Specifically, his subordinates had left essential equipment at a worksite at Bukit Batok on or around 25 November 2018. As these equipment were necessary for the accused to attend to another job on the following day, and as the accused was apparently unable to get hold of another person to drive him to the location to retrieve his equipment in the wee hours of the morning, he “foolishly decided that drive his ex-wife's car on his own, given the extreme importance of the equipment, in his own subjective opinion.” Other than this incident, the accused has not driven a vehicle since his release from prison in 2015.

> (c)     In relation to the drug charge, the accused had “consumed drugs as a way from escaping the vicissitudes of daily life after his release from imprisonment in 2015”. He was also undergoing a divorce and a cancer scare. Counsel argued that the accused has fully stopped consuming drugs and “…his escapade with drugs was a fleeting one that ceased upon his arrest”. The accused also vowed not to re-offend.

> (d)     Further, the Defence provided a character reference from his ex-wife, and also sought mercy in sentencing.

21     In his further oral mitigation plea, Mr Singh submitted that a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for the charge of driving whilst under disqualification, and for this sentence to run consecutively with a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment for the drug consumption charge. This would result in a total sentence of 32 months’ imprisonment. Counsel did not submit on the appropriate length of disqualification to be imposed.

## The Court’s decision on Sentence

22     As set out above, I imposed a global sentence 38 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ DQAC (with the period of disqualification to commence from the date of the accused’s release from prison). The sentence for each charge is set out in the table at \[5\] above.

23     As regards the sentences for the MDA and MVA charges:

> (a)     It should be noted that based on the mitigation plea, the Defence had agreed with the Prosecution’s proposed sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment for the MDA charge. This was not surprising since such a sentence was very much in line with the existing sentences imposed for first time drug consumption offenders. Moreover, such a term of imprisonment may even be considered lenient, bearing in mind the accused’s prior dealing with controlled drugs, especially so as he was involved in the more serious offence of drug trafficking.

> (b)     As for the custodial term of 3 months’ imprisonment imposed for the MVA charge, this sentence ran concurrently with the longer sentences imposed (for the RTA and MDA charges) and hence had no effect on the overall sentence that he has to serve. In any event, the same (maximum) imprisonment sentence had been imposed for the accused’s previous similar conviction in 2014. Hence a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for the present MVA charge, with an increase in the DQAC from 25 years to 30 years, was also a sentence that could not have been said to be unexpected.

24     Thus, it would appear that the crux of the accused’s dissatisfaction with the sentence was with the 30 months’ imprisonment term imposed in respect of the RTA charge of driving whilst under disqualification. It was this sentence that made up the major component of the global 38 months imprisonment term that the accused had to serve.

25     Turing to the sentence imposed for this RTA charge, it was quite clear that the accused is a recalcitrant road traffic offender, and one to whom numerous previous terms of imprisonment and disqualification have seemingly had little effect on his behaviour. In this regard:

> (a)     For about 20 years since 1999, the accused has had a total of 15 road traffic related convictions, spanning offences from driving whilst under disqualification, to using/permitting the use of a vehicle without insurance coverage, drink driving, driving without a driving licence, driving beyond the speed limit for his class of vehicles, failing to signal when driving, failing to wear a seat belt, and for taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent (see \[15\] above).

> (b)     The sentences imposed for his previous offences have ranged from a fine of $800 to imprisonment terms of up to 15 months, and also DQAC for 25 years.

> (c)     His current series of road traffic related offences were committed in November 2018, barely 4 years after his last series of convictions, including his 4th similar conviction for driving whilst under disqualification for which he had a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment and 25 years’ disqualification imposed. In fact, the accused was released in 2015, which was barely 3 years before the commission of his most recent road traffic offences.

26     I will now deal with the main arguments put forward by the Prosecution to justify a custodial sentence of at least 30 months’ imprisonment for the charge of driving whilst under disqualification, namely the application of the principle of escalation, and the sentences imposed in precedent cases.

### Principle of escalation in relation to driving whilst under disqualification

27     I agreed with the Prosecution that the principle of escalation had a clear and direct application in the present case, not only because of the antecedent history of the accused as a whole, but more specifically, because of the accused’s repeated commission of the same type of offence of driving whilst under disqualification. His re-offending also occurred despite increasingly harsher penalties that were imposed for the earlier offences.

28     In this regard, as noted by the High Court in _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> (“_Sim Yeow Kee_”) at \[99(a)\]:

> The principle of escalation could justify a _longer_ imprisonment term being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents (see _Tan Kay Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[14\]). This may be especially significant if a subsequent sentence for an offender who has already committed the same sort of offence needs to be escalated in order to specifically deter him from committing further offences of that nature (see _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[43\] and _PP v Ng Bee Ling Lana_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 448</span> at \[13\]).

29     Further, in the recent decision of _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 174</span>, in discussing the principle of escalation, the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had noted at \[62\] that:

> In considering the offender’s antecedents and the index offence, the court is inquiring into whether a cycle of offending exists, and if so, what has been the trend of offending behaviour. An escalation of sentences may be warranted where the offender’s antecedents disclose a “cavalier disregard for the law”: _Tan Kay Beng_ at \[16\]; or as the Malaysian High Court put the point in _Soosainathan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 MLJ 377</span> at 385D, where the offender’s prior criminality “demonstrate\[s\] that the current offence is no passing lapse, but evidence of a real unwillingness … to comply with the law.

30     In the present case, despite the virtual doubling of his imprisonment term with each new conviction for driving whilst under disqualification, the punishment imposed on the accused has, so far, had no noticeable effect. Specifically, it could be seen from his CRO records that:

> (a)     The imprisonment sentence of 15 months, and the 25 years’ disqualification order imposed in 2014 was increased from:

> (b)     An imprisonment sentence of 8 months, and a 16 years’ disqualification order imposed in 2009, which was escalated from:

> (c)     An imprisonment sentence of 4 months, and a 8 years’ disqualification order imposed in 2009, which was in turn increased from:

> (d)     The original imprisonment sentence of 1 month, and a 36 months’ disqualification order imposed on him in 1999.

31     The accused’s persistent pattern of re-offending was most starkly demonstrated in the case of his most recent offence in 2018, which occurred barely three years of his release from prison, after having served an imprisonment term of 15 months imposed in 2014 for the same type of offence. His records clearly showed him to have a “cavalier disregard for the law”.

32     Further, the previous lengths of imprisonment terms imposed, which had gradually increased and which, in the case of the last two convictions in 2014 and 2009, amounted to a virtual doubling of the custodial terms (from 8 months’ imprisonment in 2009 to 15 months’ imprisonment in 2014) had all proven ineffective and insufficient as deterrence, and been inadequate to prevent a repeat of the same errant behaviour on the part of the accused. Thus, in line with the principle of escalation, an appropriate increase in the sentence must be imposed to “specifically deter him from committing further offences of that nature” (see \[28\] and \[29\] above).

33     In fact, subject to the principle of proportionality, it would appear that the appropriate length of imprisonment to be imposed for the present offence must at least amount to a doubling of the last imprisonment term of 15 months’ imprisonment i.e. to a term of at least 30 months’ imprisonment. Such a length of imprisonment would hopefully drum into the accused that his continual defiance of the law, would be dealt with through the imposition of an appropriately heavy term of incarceration, and one which should make him carefully reflect and to think twice before he considers flouting the law again.

### Precedent Cases

34     The Prosecution also justified its submission for at least 30 months’ imprisonment on the basis of the sentences imposed in two precedent cases where, on similar facts, the courts had imposed sentences of 30 months’ imprisonment and long terms of disqualification.

35     The first case cited by the Prosecution was _Lulla Prem Tirth_, which involved a male accused person who was 44 years old when he was convicted. For that case:

> (a)     The offender had been convicted on various charges relating to his driving a vehicle. Based on the facts set out in the precedent table put up by the Prosecution, it appears that the offender was convicted of:

>> (i)       Two counts of driving whilst under disqualification under s 43(4) punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA;

>> (ii)       Two counts of driving without insurance coverage under s 3(1) punishable under s 3(2) of the MVA;

>> (iii)       One count of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA;

>> (iv)       One count of failing to stop when ordered by a police officer in uniform under s 127(5) punishable under s 131(2) of the RTA;

>> (v)       Two counts of driving without the owner’s consent under s 96(1) of the RTA; and

>> (vi)       One count of dangerous driving under s 64(1) punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA.

> (b)     Amongst the offender’s antecedents were four previous convictions for driving while under disqualification under s 43(4) of the RTA. The details of these previous convictions were as follows:

>> (i)       Conviction in March 2012: Sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and DQAC for life.

>> (ii)       Conviction in March 2012: Sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and DQAC for life.

>> (iii)       Conviction in March 2000: Sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment and 20 years’ DQAC.

>> (iv)       Conviction in October 1998: Sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment and 60 months’ DQAC.

> (c)     In respect of his convictions in DAC 927986-2015 and ors, the offender had received a global sentence of 30 months’ and 8 weeks’ imprisonment, DQAC for life, and a fine of $13,000. The sentences that he received for the charges that were similar to those faced by the accused in the present charge were as follows:

>> (i)       For the two counts of driving whilst under disqualification under section 43(4) punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA: 30 months’ imprisonment and DQAC for life for each charge.

>> (ii)       For the two counts of driving without insurance coverage under s 3(1) of MVA: 3 months’ imprisonment and DQAC for life for each charge.

36     The second case cited by the Prosecution was _Mohamad Esmon bin Omar_, which involved a male accused person who was 40 years old at the time of his conviction. For this case:

> (a)     The offender had similarly been convicted of various charges relating to his driving a vehicle. Based on precedent table presented by the Prosecution, the offender was convicted of:

>> (i)       One count of driving while under disqualification under s 43(4) punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA.

>> (ii)       One count of driving without insurance coverage under s 3(1) punishable under s 3(2) of the MVA.

>> (iii)       One count of driving without owner’s consent under s 96(1) of the RTA.

> (b)     Amongst the offender’s antecedents were three previous convictions for driving whilst under disqualification under s 43(4) of the RTA. The details of these previous convictions were as follows:

>> (i)       Conviction in 2009: Sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment and 20 years’ DQAC.

>> (ii)       Conviction on 12 December 2002: Sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment and 20 years’ DQAC.

>> (iii)       Conviction on 24 January 2002: Sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment and 36 months’ DQAC.

> (c)     In respect of his convictions in DAC 901946-2015 and ors, the offender received a global sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment, 30 years’ DQAC, and a fine of $700. The sentences that he received for the charges that were similar to those faced by the accused in the present charge were as follows:

>> (i)       For the count of driving while under disqualification under section 43(4) punishable under s 67A(1) of the RTA: 30 months’ imprisonment and 30 years’ DQAC.

>> (ii)       For the count of driving without insurance coverage under s 3(1) of MVA: 6 weeks’ imprisonment and 48 months’ DQAC.

37     Thus, from the precedents cited by the Prosecution, it appears that the sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment has been imposed even for 4th time offenders such as in _Mohamad Esmon bin Omar_, while for _Lulla Prem Tirth_, which involved a 5th time offender, a similar sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment was also imposed.

38     Thus, in the present case, it would seem highly incongruous to impose anything shorter than the 30 months of imprisonment imposed in the above two precedent cases, where the accused here was a 5th time offender, similar to the offender in _Lulla Prem Tirth_. I would add that as compared to the offenders in the two cases cited by the Prosecution, the accused in the present case also has more road traffic related antecedents than either of the offenders in those cases.

39     All in all, I saw no reason not to impose any sentence less than the 30 months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution in respect of the accused for his 5th conviction of driving whilst under disqualification.

40     In addition, an order of DQAC for 30 years, similar to what was imposed in _Mohamad Esmon bin Omar_, would also be appropriate, bearing in mind that an order of DQAC for 25 years had already imposed, without much effect, on he accused for his similar conviction in 2014.

### There was nothing significant in the mitigation plea to justify a lower sentence

41     The Defence had sought a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment for the charge of driving whilst under disqualification. However, no specific reason was cited by counsel as to why a sentence of 24 months imprisonment was appropriate, especially when one considered the arguments and cases put forward by the Prosecution to justify the higher custodial punishment sought of at least 30 months’ imprisonment.

42     Counsel had also explained the circumstances behind the commission of the accused’s offence, namely that the accused ostensibly had to drive the vehicle on the material date as he needed to go to the worksite to fetch tools that were needed for his work the following day. With respect, what was put forward on the accused’s behalf amounted to a poor excuse, since the accused’s action of driving the vehicle whilst under disqualification, besides being a deliberate and repeated flouting of the law, also meant that he was managing a dangerous piece of equipment on public roads at the material time. The vehicle that he was driving would have posed a real and present danger not only to the accused himself, but also to unwary members of the public who may have been in the same vicinity. Further, as could be seen from the accused’s conviction for the MVA charge that was committed on the same occasion, these same members of the public would not have been covered by motor insurance should the accused’s driving have caused them to suffer injury or death.

43     I would add that even if the accused truly had a pressing need to travel to the worksite in the wee hours of the night to get hold of the tools on the material date, he could have availed himself of some other form of transport, including making use of taxis or private hire cars as a mode of transportation. Alternatively, the accused could have sought some other form of assistance to deal with the problem. Nevertheless, regardless of why the accused did what he did, what was clear was that he did not need to drive whilst under disqualification, and that his reason for driving on the material date, was neither acceptable as an excuse, nor did it amount to any kind of mitigating factor.

44     For completeness, I would add that the personal circumstances of the accused were also unexceptional, and equally of no mitigating value.

45     Finally, while the accused had pleaded guilty in the present case, so had the offenders in the two cases cited by the Prosecution. Notably despite their pleas of guilt, the sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment was still imposed on each of the offenders in the earlier cases for committing a similar offence.

### Final Sentence

46     To reiterate, for the reasons set out above, I imposed the following sentences on the accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.12%"> <col width="19.58%"> <col width="28%"> <col width="42.3%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-940004-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 43(4) p/u s 67A(1)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">RTA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Thirty (30) months' imprisonment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of thirty (30) years with effect from date of release.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-940005-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 3(1) MVA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three (3) months' imprisonment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of thirty (30) years with effect from 07-January- 2020.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-900712-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">s 8(b)(ii) p/u s 33(1)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 months’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

47     In line with section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), which requires that at least two out of three imprisonment terms are to run consecutively, I ordered that the sentence for the RTA charge (30 months’ imprisonment), and the sentence for the MDA charge (8 months’ imprisonment) run consecutively for a total imprisonment term of 38 months.

48     In addition, the accused was disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of thirty (30) years with effect from the date of his release.

49     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving his imprisonment term.
