Criminal Law – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9431/2020/1.\]

1 July 2020

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge of using criminal force against a public servant under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”):

> You… are charged that you, on the 15th day of June 2019 at about 6.00 a.m., at the rear exit of Lucky Plaza located at No. 304 Orchard Road, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Sergeant Lendl Lim Li Liang, a public servant, to wit, by pushing the said Lendl Lim Li Liang once on his chest with intent to deter the public servant from discharging his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev. Ed.).

2       Another charge of using abusive words towards a public servant under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“**POHA**”) was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing parties on mitigation and sentencing, I imposed a fine of $6,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment.

4       The Prosecution is now appealing against this sentence.

5       The Accused has since paid up the fine amount.

## Statement of Facts

6       The salient points in the Statement of Facts, to which the accused admitted without qualification, are set out below.

7       On 15 June 2019 at about 5.40 a.m., one Mr Gilbert called the police hotline, stating “A group of 8 man quarrelling. Not sure if any weapons used, I was just informed by my officer”. The incident location given was 304 Orchard Road, Lucky Plaza, Singapore 238863, Level 3.

8       At about 5.45 a.m. on the same day, Sergeant Lendl Lim Li Liang (“the victim”) and Sergeant Ali Bin Kamaruzaman (“Sgt Ali”) were despatched to the incident location.

9       Upon arrival, the victim and Sgt Ali met up with Corporal Lie Wei Siang (“Cpl Lie”) and Staff Sergeant Muhammad Hafiz Bin Zuhuri (“SSgt Hafiz”) at Level 3 of Lucky Plaza. No one was fighting at Level 3, but the victim noticed a large crowd leaving the Platinum Music World & Disco Bar, through the rear exit of Lucky Plaza leading to Nutmeg Road. All four officers then began foot patrol to observe the situation.

10     At about 5.59 a.m., the officers were informed of a commotion outside Lucky Plaza, near the loading and unloading bay. When they arrived there, they witnessed two male Indians fighting with each other near Jln Kayu Manis. The accused was trying to separate the two men. The four officers then stepped in to break up the fight, and the victim and Ali managed to successfully separate the two men. At this point, about 6.00 a.m., the accused suddenly approached the victim and pushed him once on his chest, with the intent to deter the victim from carrying out his duty. The victim was caught by surprise and moved backwards, but did not fall or suffer any injuries.

## Antecedents

11     The accused was untraced.

## Mitigation

12     In mitigation, counsel asked for a fine to be imposed, stressing that the push by the accused was not a result of an utter disregard for lawful authority.

13     Counsel explained in mitigation that at the time of the incident, the accused and his friends were on their way home after clubbing when a male stranger approached them out of the blue and attacked them without warning. The male stranger later got into a fight with one of the accused’s friends, and the accused panicked and tried to intervene by separating the male stranger from his friend. When the police arrived, the situation was still chaotic and the accused was “_still extremely fearful for his and his companions’ safety and was still in a heightened emotional state of panic and anger_”. In the chaos and in the spur of the moment, the accused over-reacted in a defensive manner by pushing the victim. In this regard, counsel submitted that the accused’s culpability was low.

14     Other points cited by counsel in support of his mitigation included the following:

> (a)     The accused was genuinely remorseful for his actions and had demonstrated this with his early plea of guilt. The accused had also penned an apology letter to the victim and other officers involved.

> (b)     No injuries had been suffered by the victim, and there was no damaged caused to any property.

> (c)     The accused had a clean record.

> (d)     This was a one-off incident, not in keeping with the accused’s general temperament. There was very little possibility that the accused would re-offend.

> (e)     The accused had rendered full cooperation with the authorities.

15     Referring to the sentencing framework for s 353 offences as set out in _Aw Soy Tee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 114</span> (“_Aw Soy Tee_”) at \[30\], counsel submitted that this case fell within the lowest end of Category 1 – low harm and low culpability, where a fine was an appropriate sentence. Counsel also relied on the case of _PP v An Heejung_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 59</span> (“_An Heejung_”) where a $6,000 fine was imposed for an offender who, when inebriated, had kicked a police officer in his chest twice.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

16     The Prosecution also relied on the same sentencing framework set out in _Aw Soy Tee_, and asked for a sentence of at least three weeks’ imprisonment.

17     The Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) tendered a table of sentencing precedents showing a range of sentences from four weeks to three months’ imprisonment, and cautioned that the case of _Ann Heejung_ should be viewed with circumspection as it pre-dated both _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) and _Aw Soy Tee_. The DPP pointed out that fines have generally not been imposed for cases under s 353 of the Penal Code in recent years.

18     The DPP conceded that they did not know how the fight started and that it was an “extremely chaotic situation”, but the accused, by his actions, had contributed to the disquiet which the police officers had been sent to dispel. The DPP also pointed out that there was another charge to be taken into consideration in sentencing.

## Court’s decision

### Applicable sentencing framework

19     The sentencing framework for offences under s 353 of the Penal Code in _Aw Soy Tee_ at \[30\] is set out below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="17.3%"> <col width="52.12%"> <col width="30.58%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Band</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months to four years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

20     The list of considerations which might potentially influence the level of harm and/or culpability involved in a particular offence is set out in _Jeffrey Yeo_ (which the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee_ affirmed applied in s 353 cases) and include the following:

> (a)     The degree of hurt caused and its consequences;

> (b)     The use or attempted use of a weapon or other dangerous implements or means (_eg_, biting) and its capacity to do harm;

> (c)     The age, lack of maturity or presence of mental disorder where it affects materially the responsibility of the offender;

> (d)     The circumstances leading to the commission of the offence (_eg_, the offender’s motivations for causing hurt to the victim, whether the offence was planned or premeditated, whether it demonstrated contempt for police officers and their authority);

> (e)     The timing and location of the offence, in particular whether it was committed within the public’s view and hearing;

> (f)     Whether the offence involved a sustained or repeated attack;

> (g)     The number of offenders involved;

> (h)     Whether the offender intended to inflict more serious hurt than what materialised; whether any steps were taken to avoid detection or prosecution; and

> (i)     The offender’s criminal history and propensity.

### Present case is a Category 1 case

21     There was no dispute between parties that the present case fell within Category 1, involving low harm and low culpability. I agreed with this categorisation.

22     The action in this case involved a single push, but the victim did not fall and no injury resulted.

23     As for culpability, the accused was not the one who started the fight in the first place, and he had not been trying to evade apprehension when he pushed the victim. I accepted that the push had occurred on the spur of the moment while he was in a heightened state of emotion and panic from suddenly being thrust into an altercation. It was not a sustained attack on the victim, and apart from shouting abusive words at another police officer (the subject matter of the charge taken into consideration and which seemed to have occurred within the same minute), there is no other indication of defiance to police authority. The accused had not tried to flee afterwards. His culpability is therefore low.

24     While the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee_ had affirmed a “starting tariff” of a short custodial sentence for offences under s 353 of the Penal Code, Justice See also stated that this did not mean that the courts will invariably impose a custodial sentence in every s 353 case. It is obviously still important to scrutinise the facts of every case carefully in deciding on an appropriate sentence, and sentencing “should not be undertaken in an inflexible and formulaic manner”. Nevertheless, I was mindful that fines should only be imposed in exceptional cases which lie at the _lowest_ end of Category 1 cases.

### No deliberate defiance of police authority

25     Was the present case such an exceptional one? The precedent cases cited by the Prosecution also involved Category 1 cases, and the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee_ had also considered a number of Category 1 cases involving low harm and low culpability. In all these cases (except _Ann Heejung_), custodial terms were imposed.

26     However, I was of the view that there was one simple distinguishing factor in the present case which made it different from the sentencing precedents. The present facts do not disclose a deliberate defiance of police authority.

27     In all the precedent cases cited, the offenders had used criminal force against police officers either because they were trying to evade apprehension, or they were trying to argue with the police officers when being investigated/questioned.

28     In _Aw Soy Tee_, the offender had committed an offence of littering and was trying to evade apprehension by the Auxiliary Police Officer (“APO”). He refused to comply with directions, and repeatedly walked away. He later grabbed the female APO’s right forearm and pushed her on her chest area above her breast. A term of four weeks’ imprisonment was imposed.

29     In _PP v See Joo Lye_ (DAC 920039/2016), the offender was sniffing glue on the street. When the police officer made inquiries with him, he refused to cooperate and became agitated. He then used his right hand to shove the officer’s chest. A term of three months’ imprisonment was imposed.

30     In _PP v Walter Marcel Christoph_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 305</span>, the offender walked past the police officer and slapped him when the police officer tried to question him regarding an earlier complaint. The officer’s spectacles was displaced as a result. After slapping the officer, the offender then fled and put up a violent struggle when officers tried to restrain him. A term of five weeks’ imprisonment was imposed.

31     In _PP v Fernando Lawrence_ (DAC 901533-2015), the officers interviewed the accused (who smelt of alcohol) and conducted a search on him. In the process, the accused became agitated and shouted loudly. He refused to answer the officers, and decided to walk away. He used his hands to push the officer’s chest and continued to behave in a rowdy manner. A term of 36 days’ imprisonment was imposed.

32     In _Tan Hock Chiang v PP_ (MA 284/2991), the offender was stopped and issued with a traffic summons. He became angry and started shouting at the officer. He then used both hands to push hard on the officer’s chest. A term of four weeks’ imprisonment was imposed.

33     In _Chew Kim Soon v PP_ (MA 78/2004), the offender was pulled over by the police officer for driving erratically. While waiting for the breathalyser test to be administered, he had a verbal exchange with the officer and pushed the officer in the chest. A term of four weeks’ imprisonment was imposed.

34     In _PP v Chua Cheng Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 158</span>, the offender was 21 years old and untraced. He was spotted flicking a cigarette onto the ground. When the APO tried to stop him, the offender grabbed her arm and pushed her on the chest. He then fled from the scene but was subsequently arrested. He was initially sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment, but this was reduced to seven days on appeal.

35     In _PP v Neo Rong Hao Benjamin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 40</span>, the offender had aggressively approached the police officers while they were conducting checks outside St James Power Station. His friends tried to hold him back but he was continued to approach them. The female victim tried to stop him but he pushed her on her left chest, despite knowing full well that she was a police officer. After pushing her, he continued moving towards the other police officers in an aggressive manner. He was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment at first instance, but this was enhanced to five weeks on appeal.

36     In _PP v Stephen Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 246</span>, the offender had fallen asleep in a taxi after consuming alcohol at a club. When the police officer woke him up and requested for identification, he directed vulgar words, racist insults and gestures at the victim and spat on the victim’s face once as he was being escorted to the police car. He was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment at first instance, and this was enhanced to four weeks on appeal.

37     In _An Heejung_, the offender had fallen asleep in a taxi while drunk. When the police officer asked the offender to wake up, he suddenly kicked at the police officer twice on his chest before coming out of the taxi and raising his fist at him. The district court noted that the accused was so inebriated that he had no recollection of the events at the material time, but that he was not a habitual drinker and the incident was a one-off. A fine of $6,000 was imposed.

38     In the present case, the accused had not committed any offence prior to the incident. In fact, it appeared that he was trying to break up a fight. When he later pushed the victim, it was not because he was refusing to comply with the victim’s directions or trying to evade apprehension. The accused asserted in mitigation that the push had occurred while he was still caught up in the frenzy of the moment, in a state of panic and fear. I accepted that this was the case. The Prosecution also did not dispute this.

39     One of the key interests which s 353 protects, apart from the physical protection of our frontline officers, is public confidence in our police officers as authority figures. This is necessary in order to maintain law and order, and to that extent, challenges or any contempt shown to police authority have to be strongly deterred. I found, however, that there was no such deliberate challenge or contempt shown in the present case.

### No other aggravating features

40     I also took into account the list of considerations relevant to the level of harm/culpability analysis, as set out in \[20\] above, but found nothing which qualified as an aggravating factor in the present case. The only possibility might have been that the incident took place in a public area, presumably in full view of the group of people who were involved in the altercation. However, there were no details as to how many people were actually involved, and the timing of the incident (around 6 a.m.) would indicate that the streets shouldn’t have been too crowded. I did not think that I had enough facts on this point to treat this as an aggravating factor.

41     The accused also faced another charge which was taken into consideration (“TIC charge”). However, I note that this charge involved verbal abuse which took place at about the same time as the s 353 incident. I was of the view that they could be considered to be part of the same transaction. While the TIC charge certainly enhanced the egregiousness of the accused’s offence, I did not think this TIC charge alone was sufficient to move this case into the custodial threshold.

42     The Accused had no antecedents, and was gainfully employed with a good testimonial. I accepted that this was indeed a one- off incident for him. His action was a result of panic and fear created by the situation at the moment, and not by any deliberate defiance of police authority. I did not think it likely that the Accused would re-offend.

43     All things considered, I was prepared to accept that the present case was an exceptional one which fell within the lowest end of Category 1 cases, where a fine was an appropriate punishment.

### Fine quantum

44     With regard to the quantum of the fine, I had regard to the case of _An Heejung_, where a fine of $6,000 was imposed. I was inclined to agree with counsel that the facts of _An Heejung_ were in fact more aggravated than the present case, in that there was a more sustained confrontation towards a police officer (two kicks and a raised fist), in a state of inebriation. However, I note that the Accused in the present case had a TICcharge for verbally abusing a police officer. Taking everything into account, I took the view that a similar quantum would be appropriate in the present case.

## Conclusion

45     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a fine of $6,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) was entirely appropriate and justified in the present case, and imposed the same accordingly.
