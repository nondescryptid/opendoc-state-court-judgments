Civil Procedure – Appeals – Notice – Leave to file notice of appeal out of time

Civil Procedure – Extension of time – Application to extend time to furnish security for claim

7 August 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       This application concerns an earlier application made by the Defendant to set aside a default judgment. At first instance, the learned Deputy Registrar (“DR”) ordered that the default judgment be set aside, on the condition that the Defendant furnishes security for the claim in the sum of $30,000 within 21 days from the date of the said order (the “Order”). Dissatisfied with the condition imposed by the learned DR, the Defendant wishes to file an appeal but failed to do so within the 14-day timeframe prescribed under O 55B r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). Through this application the Defendant is asking for an extension of time to file the notice of appeal as well an extension of time to furnish the security ordered by the learned DR. In this judgment, I address the two-fold application in sequence.

## Extension of time to file notice of appeal

2       The principles governing an application for extension of time to file a notice of appeal pursuant to O 3 r 4 of the Rules of Court are well-established. Four factors fall into consideration: (a) the length of the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; (c) the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appeal were extended; and (d) the prejudice caused to the would-be respondent if an extension of time were granted (_Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another suit_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 757</span> (“_Lee Hsien Loong_”)). When assessing these factors, the court is guided by the overriding consideration that the Rules of Court must _prima facie_ be obeyed, with reasonable diligence being exercised, and also the need for finality being a paramount consideration (_Anwar Siraj and another v Ting Kang Chung John_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 1026</span> (“_Anwar Siraj_”) at \[30\]). The need for finality demands that a more stringent approach be taken towards applications to appeal out of time as compared to applications for extension of time for other matters (_Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[33\]-\[34\]).

3       The Order was made on 24 March 2020. The 14-day timeframe would have given the Defendant until 7 April 2020 to file a notice of appeal. As it turned out, the Defendant did not comply with the deadline. On 24 April 2020, it filed the present application for leave to file the notice of appeal out of time.

### Length of delay

4       The first question is whether the length of delay can be regarded as “_de minimis_”. A _de minimis_ delay may be excused without examining the reasons for the delay. As the Court of Appeal held in _Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[21\]:

> 21    In so far as the first two factors are concerned, it would generally be the case that an extremely short delay might be excused without the need for the court to inquire at length into the reasons for that delay. If the delay is _de minimis_, the court may not need to conduct such an inquiry at all. However, as each case generally differs on its facts from other cases, there may be exceptions to the general statement of principle just enunciated.

> 22    If the delay is not merely _de minimis_, the court must examine the reasons for such delay. A mere assertion that there has been an oversight is obviously insufficient and, indeed, could lead to an abuse of process. …

5       In my view, what the Court of Appeal in _Lee Hsien Loong_ had in mind was perhaps a 1 or 2 days’ delay in an ordinary case. In the present case, the delay of 17 days is almost ten-fold of that, and can hardly be considered _de minimis_. Looking at the matter another way, the Defendant took more than double the amount of time prescribed under the Rules of Court to file the present application. To put things in context, the High Court in _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2911 v Tham Keng Mun and others_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 1263</span> found that a 9-day delay was not short enough to be considered _de minimis. A fortiori_, a 17-day delay cannot pass muster without scrutinising the reasons for the delay, and it is to this that I now turn.

### Reasons for the delay

6       The Defendant explained that it “decided to change solicitors sometime on or about the start of April 2020” and that the Covid-19 situation made it “difficult for the Defendant to source around for a new lawyer”.[^1] The Defendant claims that by the time the new solicitors took over on 9 April 2020, the deadline had lapsed.[^2] The glaring problem with this explanation is the Defendant’s failure to address why the appeal was not filed by its former solicitors. As at the deadline of 7 April 2020, the Defendant was still represented by its former solicitors and could have instructed them to file the appeal. The preparation and filing of a notice of appeal is after all an administrative act that can be done with relative ease. The actual hearing of the appeal, which is understandably more substantive, can be left to the new solicitors to argue.

7       The problem is compounded by the fact that the Defendant’s former solicitors were still filing papers for the Defendant right before the expiry of the appeal deadline. Just a day before on 6 April 2020, the Defendant’s former solicitors filed a detailed response to the Plaintiff’s request for further arguments before the learned DR, which suggests that they were still in the course of taking instructions from the Defendant. That being the case, the Defendant could have instructed their former solicitors to file a notice of appeal there and then, if they had the intention to do so. Even if they were unsure as to whether they wanted to appeal, they could have filed a notice of appeal to stop the clock from running. As the Court of Appeal in _Lee Hsien Loong_ explained at \[35\]:

> 35    The present system is eminently just and fair. Indeed, if the losing party is unsure whether or not to appeal against the decision, it can always file its notice of appeal first. Such notice can later be withdrawn if it is so desired. Alternatively, the appeal can be allowed to lapse. This being the case, it is clear that if the losing party drags its heels or is otherwise lackadaisical about its right to appeal, then it cannot legitimately ask the court for an extension of time to appeal. This is logical, commonsensical as well as (above all) just and fair. …

8       The Plaintiff had raised the same point in her reply affidavit, alleging that the Defendant could have asked its former solicitors to file a notice of appeal within time.[^3] This allegation went unanswered in the Defendant’s final reply affidavit. In these circumstances, one can only infer that the Defendant knew full well that the deadline was nearing and knowingly allowed the deadline to lapse.

9       As for the delay after 7 April 2020, the Defendant claims that the onset of the “Circuit Breaker” measures implemented by the Singapore Government to combat the Covid-19 pandemic (which took effect on 7 April 2020) made it “harder for the Defendants and \[the new solicitors\] to communicate and be provided with full and proper instructions”.[^4] While the elevated physical distancing measures implemented to contain the Covid-19 outbreak have undoubtedly upended business operations, technology has empowered law firms to continue functioning to varying degrees in the digital space. This was made possible because not every type of instruction and legal advice necessitates a physical meeting. Instructions and legal advice come in various stripes and forms, and certain forms of instructions can in ordinary circumstances be conveyed remotely. If the Defendant could have conveyed its instructions to appeal remotely, it is difficult to understand how the Circuit Breaker would have made it any more difficult to pursue the appeal. The onus is on the Defendant, as the applicant, to condescend upon particulars of the alleged difficulty in instructing its solicitors to file a notice of appeal. Short of a credible explanation, one can only assume it was open to the Defendant to instruct its new solicitors _via_ remote communication channels. As the Plaintiff put it bluntly in her reply affidavit, “I do not see why \[the Defendant\] cannot adequately give instructions to \[the new solicitors\] by telephone call, e-mail or video conferencing”.[^5] Again, this query went unanswered in the Defendant’s final reply affidavit. The Defendant’s silence is telling. Indeed, a perusal of the affidavits filed in this action revealed that the Defendant’s representatives had no difficulty communicating _via_ email and Whatsapp, having done so in the course of the Defendant’s business operations.[^6] In any event, there is the traditional option of a phone call. In fact, based on the case records, the Defendant’s new solicitors had filed several papers electronically during the Circuit Breaker, presumably on the back of the Defendant’s instructions. A Notice of Change of Solicitors was filed on 9 April 2020. Further filings requesting for the learned DR’s Grounds of Decision and Notes of Evidence were made on 14 and 22 April 2020. If the Defendant was able to give instructions to file these papers, there is no reason why the Defendant could not have instructed them to file a notice of appeal on or shortly after their new solicitors took over the matter on 9 April 2020.

10     The Defendant’s explanation is particularly unconvincing in light of the fact that a notice of appeal is not a document that requires extensive input from the client. The essential details required, such as the name of the DR and the date and terms of the Order, would have been readily available on the eLitigation platform, without the new solicitors having to obtain further input from the Defendant. Notably, the standard form of a notice of appeal does not even require the applicant to provide any grounds of the appeal (see Form 112 of the Rules of Court). If the Defendant were serious about appealing the Order, one would have expected the Defendant, having known that the deadline had lapsed by then, to instruct the new solicitors to promptly file a notice of appeal on 9 April 2020, followed by an application to extend the time for appeal. Thus, even if I were to assume that its former solicitors were, for whatever reason, unable to file a notice of appeal, the Defendant had every opportunity to pursue the appeal promptly through its new solicitors. The fact that it waited till 24 April 2020 to file the present application invites the inference that the intention to appeal only crystallised some time after the new solicitors took over the conduct of the matter.

11     The Defendant also invited the court to “draw an inference from Order 55C r 1(6) of the Rules of Court”.[^7] The provision states that where an application for further arguments has been made, no notice of appeal shall be filed in respect of the order until the court affirms, varies or sets aside the order after hearing further arguments or certifies that it requires no further arguments. Pointing to a request for further arguments filed by the Plaintiff on 31 March 2020 to which the learned DR responded on 6 April 2020, the Defendant’s representative said she “verily believe that the time … to file their Notice of Appeal … can be said to begin on 20 April 2020”.[^8]

12     The Defendant’s reliance on the provision is misplaced. First of all, it is not clear what exactly does the Defendant want this court to infer from the said provision. Any suggestion that the provision operates as a stay on the time to file a notice of appeal is misguided. O 55C r 1 is not applicable to an appeal against an order made by a Registrar. The provision applies to appeals against decisions of “District Judges” to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers, whereas the learned DR rendered his decision in his capacity as a Deputy Registrar and not as a District Judge. O 55B r 1 is the applicable provision that governs appeals from decisions of Registrar to District Judge in Chambers. The provision relied on by the Defendant has not been enacted into O 55B r 1. In its absence, a request for further arguments does not operate as a stay of the time for filing an appeal pursuant to O 55B r 1. _Lim Kok Boon (Lin Guowen) v Lee Poh King Melissa_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 1082</span> is a case in point. When that case was decided, the operative version of O 55C was silent on whether a request for further arguments would stay the time for appeal. The applicant argued that there was a lacuna and sought to supplement O 55C with s 28B of the Supreme Court Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) which provides that the time for appeal is stayed when a party requests for further arguments. Rejecting this contention, the court found that “the rules are silent” and the court has no power to read s 28B of the SCJA into the predecessor of O 55C (at \[15\]-\[16\]). While uniformity may be desirable, that is a “matter for the Rules Committee and not for the court to do so” (at \[21\]). After the decision of _Lim Kok Boon_, O 55C was amended to include the provision in question, but the Rules Committee saw fit not to enact the same provision into O 55B. In my view, this manifests a considered decision not to give a litigant a similar right under O 55B. If the Rules Committee had intended otherwise, a similar provision would have found its way into O 55B.

13     In any event, even assuming for the sake of argument that the provision applies, the time for appeal would have ended – and not started – on 20 April 2020, contrary to what was erroneously asserted by the Defendant. The fact that the Defendant only filed the present application on 24 April 2020, after that putative deadline had lapsed, militates against any suggestion that it had seriously relied on the provision.

14     There is also no suggestion that the Defendant’s former solicitors had misconstrued the provision to operate as a stay on the appeal timelines. Had that been the case, there may be some grounds for sympathy (see _Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd and another v Fraser & Neave Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 355</span> (“_Aberdeen Asset_”)). But the Defendant is not asserting so. It merely invites the Court to draw the appropriate inference from the provision. Without any evidence or assertion that it had relied on the provision at the material time, it seems that the provision was raised as an afterthought.

15     The overriding consideration when assessing applications to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal is, as stated above, that the Rules of Court must _prima facie_ be obeyed, with _reasonable diligence_ being exercised (see \[2\] above). Reasonable diligence invariably entails exploring reasonable means and taking reasonable steps. In the final analysis, the Defendant failed to demonstrate that it had undertaken reasonable diligence to pursue the appeal in a timely manner.

16     With the reasons given being wholly unsatisfactory, where does the Defendant stand in this application? As a matter of principle, it is incumbent on the Defendant to furnish _good reasons_ to move the court’s discretion. As the Court of Appeal held in _Pearson Judith Rosemary v Chen Chien Wen Edwin_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 260</span> (“_Pearson_”), the applicant must provide grounds sufficient to persuade the court to extend sympathy (at \[20\]). Where no such grounds are given, the court can dismiss the application, even if the delay causes no prejudice. _Pearson_ concerned a delay of a shorter duration (12 days) which arose from the solicitor’s error. Notwithstanding that the solicitor made a “_bona fide_ mistake in the computation of time”, the court refused the extension sought primarily because the applicant gave no good reasons for the court to extend sympathy. This was so even though no prejudice occasioned from the delay.

17     In this connection, it is also apposite to refer to the following passage in _Ratnam v Cumarasamy_ \[1965\] MLJ 228 at 229 (cited with approval in _Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[35\]) which aptly explains that good reasons are not insisted as merely a technical requirement; they are necessary to uphold the sanctity of court procedure and timelines:

> The Rules of Court must _prima facie_ be obeyed, and in order to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken _there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion_. _If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of the rules which is to provide a \[timetable\] for the conduct of litigation_.

> \[emphasis added\]

18     Based on the reasons given by the Defendant, the overall picture that emerges is that the delay was self-induced. There was no real obstacle preventing the Defendant from filing an appeal within time. The Defendant had every opportunity to appeal within time but chose to take its chances. In these circumstances, the application is unmeritorious. As the Court of Appeal held in _Anwar Siraj_, oversight or negligence _per se_ is insufficient to justify an extension of time, let alone a conscious assumption of risk (at \[36\]).

19     In sum, the Defendant failed to meet the threshold requirement of providing good reasons for the delay. The Court of Appeal observed in _AD v AE_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 505</span> at \[12\], the remaining two factors (namely, merits of the prospective appeal and prejudice) were “qualifying factors” essential for the court to exercise its discretion. In most cases, the emphasis would invariably be on the first two factors (see _Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[19\]). Where the applicant is unable to meet the threshold requirement, as in the present case, the court may dismiss the application. Be that as it may, I will move on to consider the remaining two factors.

### Merits of the prospective appeal

20     On the issue of merits, the threshold is a rather low one – the test is whether the appeal is “hopeless” (_Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[19\]). If an appeal is hopeless, it would be a waste of time for all parties concerned to ventilate the appeal in full (_Pearson_ at \[17\]). If it is not hopeless, this should be considered a neutral factor rather than against the applicant. In _Aberdeen Asset_, the Court of Appeal explained the concept as follows at \[43\]:

> 43    As to the question of merits, it is not for the court at this stage to go into a full-scale examination of the issues involved. Neither is it necessary for the applicant to show that he will succeed in the appeal. The threshold is lower: the test is, is the appeal hopeless? … Unless one can say that there are no prospects of the applicant succeeding on the appeal, this is a factor which ought to be considered to be neutral rather than against him. …

21     At the outset, it should be borne in mind that the Defendant has already succeeded in setting aside the default judgment, albeit on a condition. It is the condition imposed that the Defendant is seeking to appeal against.

22     The Defendant took issue with the learned DR not explaining why he imposed a condition for setting aside the default judgment.[^9] But the Defendant – who bears the burden of demonstrating merits in the prospective appeal – did not furnish reasons for challenging the condition imposed either. However, in the interests of substantive fairness, I will examine the merits of the application before the learned DR _de novo_.

23     It is trite law that the court has broad discretion to impose conditions for setting aside a default judgment. This discretion is expressly codified in O 13 r 8 of the Rules of Court which provides that the court may set aside or vary the judgment “on such terms as it thinks just”. Conditions that the defendant furnishes security for plaintiff’s costs or claim are usually imposed where the Court takes the view that the defendant’s case is doubtful or suspect (see _Alps Electric v Jinli Freight Express Consolidators_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 532</span> at \[11\] and _IBM Singapore Pte Ltd v Beans Group Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 910</span> at \[14\]). In such cases, even though the Defendant has established triable issues which gives him a right to defend the action at trial, some commitment on the part of the Defendant is nevertheless called for (_Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai v Nomanbhoy & Sons Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 856</span> at \[43\]-\[44\]).

24     The issue is whether the Defendant can realistically show that the learned DR was wrong to have called for some commitment on the part of the Defendant. Having considered the papers filed in the setting aside application, I am of the view that the odds of the Defendant discharging that burden are slim. I find it hard to fault the learned DR’s decision to call for some commitment from the Defendant. Before giving my reasons for arriving at this conclusion, let me briefly outline the background facts of the underlying dispute.

25     The claim was brought to recover salary in arrears arising from a letter of appointment signed on 1 October 2018 (“LOA”). It is undisputed that the Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant as a Senior Director of Human Resources and Administration between October 2018 to September 2019.[^10] Before that, she was employed in the same role by a company called Stratech Systems Limited (“SSL”).[^11] Her employment was terminated when SSL fell into liquidation in September 2018.[^12] With SSL in liquidation, Leong Sook Ching (“LSC”), a former director and Chief Operating Officer of SSL, together with her husband who was also a former director of SSL, decided to start a new company to purchase some of the businesses and assets of SSL.[^13] Both LSC and her husband were however made bankrupt as a result of personal guarantees given to SSL, which prevented them from owning or managing a business. LSC decided to rope in her children into her new venture.[^14] On 9 October 2018, the Defendant was incorporated with LSC’s two children, David Chew and Phoebe Chew, appointed as directors.

26     The LOA forms the main plank of the Plaintiff’s case. The LOA provides, amongst others, that the Plaintiff’s monthly salary would be $9,900 with a monthly transport allowance of $600 and monthly mobile subsidy of $80.[^15] The LOA further provides, in an addendum, that the Plaintiff would receive a joining bonus of $47,256.35 which would be paid to her in nine equal monthly payments from the date of joining.[^16] It is undisputed that the LOA was signed by LSC on 1 October 2019. Relying on the LOA, the Plaintiff claims that her net monthly salary, after deducting employee’s CPF contribution of $450 and contribution to the Chinese Development Assistance Council (“CDAC”), was $10,127. Throughout her 12-month employment, she received the sum of $10,127 on 5 occasions (13 March, 2 May, 27 May, 28 June and 15 August 2019) and the sum of $6,000 on 2 occasions (5 September and 1 October 2019).[^17] In this action, she claims the outstanding balance of $124,925,35, the breakdown of which is tabulated in **Annex A** herein.[^18]

27     The Defendant’s case is that the LOA, entered into before the Defendant was even incorporated, could not have been legally valid and binding.[^19] The Defendant argued that LSC, as an undischarged bankrupt, had no authority to sign the LOA on behalf of the Defendant.[^20] LSC claims to have signed the LOA out of folly and allegedly told the Plaintiff to shred the document.[^21] The Defendant took the position that the Plaintiff’s salary was left open when she first joined the Defendant and it was only agreed in early September 2019 that she would receive a monthly salary of $6,450, and on that basis, her pro-rated salary for the month of October 2018 was $4,767.39.[^22]

28     I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has established a _prima facie_ case. While the LOA was signed before the incorporation of the Defendant, the Defendant had arguably ratified the contract after its incorporation. The essential elements of ratification are knowledge and adoption (_Goh Kim Hai Edward v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 540</span> at \[80\]). Adoption can be either express or implied. Mere acquiescence or inactivity of the principal can give rise to ratification. The concept of implied ratification was explained by the High Court in _Eng Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 241</span> in the following terms at \[35\]:

> 35    Ratification will be implied whenever the conduct of the person in whose name or on whose behalf the act or transaction is done or entered into is such as to amount to clear evidence that he adopts or recognises such act or transaction, and may be implied from the mere acquiescence or inactivity of the principal: see FMB Reynolds, _Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2006) at para 2-070, Art17(3). I note Moore-BickJ’s insightful observations in _Yona International Ltd and Heftsiba Overseas Works Pte Ltd v La Réunion Française Société Anonyme d’Assurances et de Réassurances_ \[1996\] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 84, at 106:

>> Ratification can no doubt be inferred without difficulty from silence or inactivity in cases where the principal, by failing to disown the transaction, allows a state of affairs to come about which is inconsistent with treating the transaction as unauthorised. That is probably no more than a form of ratification by conduct. Where there is nothing of that kind, however, the position is more difficult since silence or inaction may simply reflect an unwillingness or inability on the part of the principal to commit himself. For that reason it will not usually be sufficient to evidence ratification …

29     After its incorporation, the Defendant paid the exact sum reflected in the LOA (after deducting CPF contributions) to the Plaintiff on five occasions in a span of 12 months. It is also significant that David Chew, a director of the Defendant, did not deny that at all material times he knew of the existence of the signed LOA. _Prima facie_, the Defendant had, by its conduct, ratified the LOA as being valid and binding.

30     Upon ratification, the contract becomes binding from the time it was entered into, and neither party can withdraw from it without the usual consequences that follow a breach of contract (Tan Cheng Han SC, _The Law of Agency_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) at para 06.012). Section 41(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) gives statutory expression to this principle as regards companies that were non-existent when the contract was entered into:

> **41.**—(1)    Any contract or other transaction purporting to be entered into by a company prior to its formation or by any person on behalf of a company prior to its formation may be ratified by the company after its formation and thereupon the company shall become bound by and entitled to the benefit thereof as if it had been in existence at the date of the contract or other transaction and had been a party thereto.

31     The main difficulty with the Defendant’s case is that it rests largely on bare assertions. There is hardly any contemporaneous document supporting its case. Rather, the contemporaneous documents point in favour of the LOA being duly recognised and performed by parties. Without going into too much detail at this stage to avoid turning this into a trial on affidavits, I would illustrate the weakness in the Defendant’s case by reference to several key aspects of the evidential picture as it currently stands:

> (a)     First, there is no documentary evidence of the Defendant disavowing the validity of LOA. If the LSC and/or the Defendant’s other representatives did not intend the LOA to have legal effect, and if the Defendant had realised that the signing the LOA was a mistake, it is curious why did the Defendant and/or LSC not set the record straight via written correspondence.

> (b)     Second, LSC claims that she had no authority to represent the Defendant. But in reality, the documents show that she had, on multiple occasions, discussed salary matters with the Plaintiff on the Defendant’s behalf.[^23] Beyond that, she had also corresponded on the Defendant’s behalf with the Plaintiff’s solicitors on matters relating to the underlying dispute.[^24]

> (c)     Third, the Defendant’s case is that, as a start-up, it could not have agreed to paying the Plaintiff salary on a regular basis due to the lack of sufficient cash flow.[^25] The allegation of the Defendant being in financial difficulty is unsubstantiated. No financial statements were exhibited to the supporting affidavits to make good this assertion.

> (d)     Fourth, it is common ground that the Defendant had, on five separate occasions, transferred the sum of $10,127 – the exact amount reflected in the LOA after deducting CPF contributions – to the Plaintiff. The Defendant claims that this in furtherance of an interim arrangement for the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff her prior salary as and when it was able to do so.[^26] But no documentary evidence was adduced to prove that parties had agreed to such interim arrangement.

> (e)     Fifth, the Plaintiff, in an email dated 23 August 2019 to the Defendant’s representatives, proposed to take a “pay cut” to $8,464 per month.[^27] In the same email, the Plaintiff claimed that her “current package” included a monthly salary of $10,127 and asserted that the Defendant owed salary arrears on that basis. All of these presupposes that the LOA was valid and operative. The Defendant’s representatives did not deny these allegations in any of their replies. If the assertions were false, why did the Defendant not correct the Plaintiff in its replies?

> (f)     Sixth, the Defendant has not adduced sufficiently credible documents to prove its assertion that the Plaintiff had orally agreed to a monthly salary of $6,450 in September 2019 and that the agreed salary was meant to have retrospective effect.[^28] The Whatsapp conversation dated 5 September 2019 relied upon by the Defendant does not unequivocally disclose the existence of such agreement.[^29] In that conversation, the Plaintiff asked LSC if she would be getting paid for “August salary based on \[what\] we discussed yesterday”. I understand her to be asking whether she would be paid for the month of August 2019. The payment of $6,000 made to her on 5 September 2019 must be understood in that context. She did not expressly agree to accept $6,000 as her monthly salary for the prior months. The Defendant also sought to rely on a table prepared by the Plaintiff showing that the Plaintiff’s basic salary was $6,000 a month.[^30] In reply, the Plaintiff claims the salaries were artificially reduced, at LSC’s request, to entice a potential investor and was not meant to supersede the terms of the LOA.[^31] The Defendant’s representatives denied this allegation. Based on the current state of the evidence, this document by itself is not dispositive of the issue and its veracity should be tested at trial.

32     As the Court of Appeal recently held in _Akfel Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 412</span> (“_Akfel_”), the discretion given to the court to impose any condition on the grant of leave to defend is a wide one and each case had to be decided on its own facts. The grant of conditional leave is reserved to cases where the defendant’s evidence had not yet reached the level of showing a reasonable probability of a _bona fide_ defence, a fair case for defence, reasonable grounds for setting up a defence or a fair probability of a _bona fide_ defence (at \[51\]). In that case, the court held that the lower court did not err in granting conditional leave to defend against a defendant who failed to produce concrete evidence of his defence, relying instead on mere assertions (at \[55\]).

33     Like the defendant in _Akfel_, the Defendant’s case suffers from the lack of evidence. The Defendant’s allegations are not only largely unsubstantiated but also in some ways contradicted by contemporaneous documents. In these circumstances, the learned DR was plainly justified in asking the Defendant to furnish security for the claim in order to demonstrate some commitment to its defence.

34     Finally, even taking the Defendant’s case at its highest, the Defendant concedes that it owes the Plaintiff salary arrears amounting to $13,082.39. This is assuming that parties did enter into an oral agreement for her to be paid a monthly salary of $6,450 (comprising $6,000 in basic salary and $450 in employee CPF contributions) for the entire duration of her employment. Based on the Defendant’s calculations, the total salary due to the Plaintiff for the period of October 2018 to September 2019 would be $75,717.39 (comprising $4,767.39 for the month of October 2018 and $6,450 per month for the remaining 11 months).[^32] After deducting the aggregate payment of $62,635.00 made to the Plaintiff, the Defendant claims that the net outstanding amount stood at $13,082.39. Even assuming this is the case, the Defendant, by its own position, would still have to make employer’s CPF contributions in the sum of $540 per month.[^33] Based on the salary table relied upon by the Defendant, the total amount of employer CPF contributions payable for the relevant period would be $6,279.00. Including this amount, the aggregate amount due and owing to the Plaintiff would thus be $19,361.39. At the very least, the Defendant ought to furnish this amount as security for the claim. Considering the doubts in the Defendant’s case, the security of $30,000 ordered by the learned DR is hardly excessive.

35     In these premises, the chances of the Defendant’s appeal succeeding are slim to none. As the prospective appeal would most likely be an exercise in futility, allowing the appeal to proceed is likely to result in the wastage of time for all concerned (_Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[20\] and _Pearson_ at \[17\]). This factor weighs against the Defendant, or is – at best – neutral.

### Prejudice to the Plaintiff

36     Prejudice must be one that cannot be compensated by costs (_Lee Hsien Loong_ at \[27\]). There is no evidence that the Plaintiff would suffer any prejudice if the appeal is allowed to proceed. As such this is a neutral factor.

### Conclusion

37     The Defendant failed to establish good reasons for its failure to file the appeal by the deadline prescribed under the Rules of Court. It has also failed to demonstrate sufficient merits in the prospective appeal. In these circumstances, I would have to dismiss the application for leave to file the appeal out of time.

## Extension of time to furnish security for the Plaintiff’s claim

38     The learned DR ordered that the Defendant furnish security for the claim in the sum of $30,000 in the form of a banker’s guarantee or other forms of security acceptable to the Plaintiff. The Defendant failed to furnish the security ordered within 21 days of the Order. When seeking to extend the deadline, however, the Defendant gave no reason on affidavit for its failure to comply with the Order. Taking issue with the Defendant’s failure to provide reasons for the delay and explain any efforts made to furnish the security ordered, the Plaintiff urged the court to dismiss the application.[^34] She argued that, as a matter of law, there must be at least some material to justify the delay.[^35] Against this, the Defendant averred, in its reply affidavit, that it stands ready to furnish the security ordered, having paid the sum ordered to its solicitors and having informed the Plaintiff of the said payment.[^36]

39     The law as it stands draws a distinction between extension of time to file a notice of appeal and other extension of time applications. Insofar as the latter is concerned, it is the issue of prejudice – rather than reasons – that should generally take centre stage in the analysis. The Court of Appeal decision of _The “Tokai Maru”_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 646</span> is the _locus classicus_ on this matter. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to dispute the claims by reason of a breach of the rules unless the other party had been made to suffer prejudice which could not be compensated by costs. As such, it could rarely be appropriate to deny a defendant an extension of time where such denial would have the effect of depriving him of his defence. This was especially so when it was due to a procedural default, even if unjustified, which caused the plaintiff no prejudice, for which he could not be compensated by an award of costs (at \[23\]). Exceptions to this general rule may be made for special cases involving applicants who engage in procedural abuse or questionable tactics which would warrant special treatment (at \[37\]). Applying these principles, the court acceded to an application to file an affidavit out of time, even though the applicant failed to give satisfactory reasons for a delay of nine months (at \[39\]). In this connection, the court found that the lower court erred in applying the more stringent standard reserved for applications to appeal out of time (at \[20\]).

40     It would be apparent from _The “Tokai Maru”_ that the approach in ordinary circumstances is to focus on whether irreparable prejudice would be occasioned more so than the reasons for the non-compliance. While the Defendant’s failure to provide reasons for the delay is obviously unsatisfactory, the Plaintiff has not suffered any prejudice either. In the absence of prejudice, and considering that the delay is not inordinate, applying the approach in _The “Tokai Maru”_ would mean that the Defendant should be given a chance to defend the claim at trial. The 17-day delay in taking out the present application by itself does not amount to an abuse of process, and indeed the Plaintiff is not asserting so.

41     The Plaintiff sought to rely on the case of _All-Trade Construction Pte Ltd v Lo Geok Kwee_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 318</span> (“_All-Trade_”) which concerns a situation where the High Court refused to grant the defendant’s application for an extension of time to furnish security for the claim. In _All-Trade_, the High Court, pursuant to a summary judgment application, granted the defendant conditional leave to defend the action upon furnishing a banker’s guarantee for the sum of $260,907.58 within 28 days, failing which judgment would be granted in favour of the plaintiff. Shortly before the deadline, the defendant filed an application to extend the deadline by two months. Dismissing the application on the ground that the defendant failed to provide material upon which the court could exercise its discretion, the court explained:

> 22    The defendant had asked by SIC 601482/2000 that she be given an extension of time of two months in which to comply with the order to furnish a banker’s guarantee. It was incumbent on her to give the court material on which it could exercise its discretion to extend time in her favour. No such material was, however, furnished. _There was no indication that such an extension would enable her to obtain the banker’s guarantee. No evidence was given either of the attempts that she had made up to the date of the application to obtain such security or of the period of time that was required for such attempts to have a result._ The defendant was the owner of a presumably valuable piece of land in the centre of town and she did not explain why that would not assist her in obtaining the necessary security. In the result, I considered that there was no basis for me to exercise my discretion in her favour. I therefore dismissed the application for an extension of time.

> \[emphasis added\]

42     It is apparent from the passage above that the court’s order was made on a different factual matrix. As can be seen from the sentences emphasised in italics, the court in that case was understandably concerned as to whether the defendant was willing and able to furnish the security ordered. In the present case, the Defendant has substantially dispelled such doubts by paying the security sum ordered to its solicitors and informing the Plaintiff of the said payment, as what remains is for its solicitors to furnish security in a manner agreeable to the Plaintiff. The concern that the applicant may not furnish the security ordered even with the extension of time has been greatly attenuated in these circumstances. In that sense, the Defendant has provided some material on which this court could exercise its discretion. I would give the Defendant 14 days from the date of this Judgment to comply with the learned DR’s order.

## Conclusion

43     In sum, I dismiss the application for leave to file a notice of appeal out of time because the Defendant failed to satisfactorily explain its non-compliance with the prescribed timeline and the chances of the prospective appeal succeeding are slim to none.

44     I would however grant the Defendant an extension of time to furnish the security ordered by the learned DR, having regard to more lenient approach applicable to generic extension of time applications. The security ordered shall be furnished within 14 days from the date of this Judgment.

45     I will hear parties on the issue of costs.
