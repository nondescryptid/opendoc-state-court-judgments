2 September 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge under s 6(b) and three charges under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, (Cap 241) (“PCA”).

2       The following charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing –

> (i)     Three charges under s 6(b) PCA;

> (ii)     13 charges under s 6(c) PCA; and

> (iii)     One charge under s 204A of the Penal Code, Cap 224.

## THE BACKGROUND FACTS

3       The Accused was the Manager of Liong Construction Pte Ltd (“Liong Construction”). Liong Construction was in the business of general construction, maintenance and minor additions and alterations works. This was a family business. The registered directors of Liong Construction were the Accused’s parents. The Accused had joined the company in 2011 or 2012. He continued working for the company after his graduation from university in 2013.

4       The Accused was also the registered director of LAC Construction Pte Ltd (“LAC Construction”) and L.J.W Pte Ltd (“LJW”).

5       As Manager of Liong Construction, the Accused’s job scope included procuring business for the company, managing site contracts, attending meetings, arranging for manpower and preparing quotations when required.

## THE FACTS

6       On 30 Nov 15, Liong Construction was awarded a 3-year term contract (“Term Contract”) worth $152,055 by NetLink Trust (“NetLink”). NetLink owned and operated the fibre network in Singapore. It owned seven facilities across Singapore. Under the Term Contract, Liong Construction was required to carry out any plumbing works for all of NetLink’s facilities. On 8 Apr 16, Liong Construction was awarded a 6-month contract worth $357,505 by NetLink for the removal of aesthetic mortar boxes, and repainting and repair works at its’ Ang Mo Kio Central office. The contract period commenced from May 2016.

7       At this point of time, the Accused became acquainted with Lim Kim Guan (“Lim”), NetLink’s associate engineer. Lim was in charge of routine maintenance, ad-hoc repairs and replacements, and projects for its’ seven facilities. The Accused knew that Lim liaised with the managing agent (“MA”) of the seven facilities, and oversaw the MA’s inspection of repairs and maintenance works carried out by Liong Construction. These inspections were the condition precedent before the works could be approved and payment issued to Liong Construction. The Accused also knew that Lim was in charge of overseeing the repairs and maintenance works for these seven facilities and he would call contractors for quotations if work needed to be carried out.

### Facts relating to DAC 927583/18, 927588/18 and 927590/18

8       Between 2016 and 2017, Lim told the Accused that he was required to find contractors for various works to be carried out at the seven NetLink facilities. As each of the works were below the value of $200,000, Lim was required to call for three independent quotes before making his recommendations to his superior on the contractor for the works.

9       At the material time, Lim and the Accused agreed to use fictitious quotations to enable Liong Construction to be awarded these works. The quotations were purportedly issued by different companies. The prices in these fictitious quotations were higher than those quoted by Liong Construction. This was to ensure that Liong Construction would be awarded the contract for the projects.

10     Pursuant to the agreement, between 2016 and 2017, the Accused had submitted 13 fictitious quotations to Lim as described in \[9\]. These were for seven projects with NetLink amounting to $911,867.40. The 13 quotations used submitted using the letterheads of six companies; two of the six were the Accused’s own companies, while the remaining four were sub-contractors of Liong Construction.

11     In relation to the three proceeded charges, the Accused submitted quotations for the following projects –

> (i)     Project for “Supply and Install Makeup tank, portable tank and fire hose reel tank at Ang Mo Kio Exchange worth $179,899.80 (DAC 927583/18);

> (ii)     Project for “Supply and Install GRP water tank for level 1 (transfer water tank) and roof top (makeup water tank) at Jurong West Exchange worth $182,340.90 (DAC 927588/18); and

> (iii)     Project for renovation of toilets at Ayer Rajah Exchange worth $179,600 (DAC 927590/18).

12     The Accused had created these fictitious quotations and made it such that they purportedly were submitted by three different companies. He did this by using the letterheads of these companies. He set the prices in these quotations at a higher rate than the price quoted by Liong Construction. This would ensure that Liong Construction stood a much better chance of being awarded the works. The companies in whose names the quotations were submitted had no intention of bidding for or performing the works. The quotations were created for the sole purpose that Liong Construction would be awarded the works.

13     Lim knew that the quotations were intended to mislead NetLink into believing that they were genuine independent quotations sourced from the open market. Lim submitted these quotations together with the quotation from Liong Construction to NetLink, and recommended that Liong Construction be awarded the works. Liong Construction was eventually awarded the works.

14     The Accused knew that NetLink would not have accepted the quotations, and approved Lim’s recommendation that the works be awarded to Liong Construction, if it had known that these quotations were fictitious.

15     On 3 Aug 18, NetLink terminated the Term Contract with Liong Construction before the expiry of the contract.

### Facts relating to DAC 927555/18

16     Sometime in January 2017, the Accused and Lim met to discuss work matters. Lim told the Accused that he was facing financial difficulties. The Accused, believing that Lim was hinting for monies, decided to give bribes to Lim. He made this decision because he knew that Lim was tasked with inspecting Liong Construction’s works and he wanted Lim to show leniency to Liong Construction by not finding fault with the works. He also wanted Lim to ensure that the payments due to Liong Construction from NetLink were processed, approved and paid promptly.

## ACCUSED’S ANTECEDENTS

17     The Accused was a first offender.

## PROSECUTION’S SENTENCING SUBMISSION

18     DPP Ang Siok Chen sought for a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment on each of the four proceeded charges, with three to run consecutively.

19     She submitted that the custody threshold has been crossed because of the following aggravating factors common to all four proceeded charges –

> (i)     There was persistent offending by the Accused. The offences were committed over a significant period between October 2016 to May 2017, and over 13 different occasions. There was also an escalation in severity.

> (ii)     There was deliberation and premeditation in the commission of the offences. For the three s 6(c) offences, he had worked with Lim to obtain the fictitious quotes. He created the quotes himself and ensured that the prices quoted were higher than that of Liong Construction’s. This was to ensure that Liong Construction was awarded the contracts. For the s 6(b) offence, he made the deliberate and considered decision to give Lim the bribe and he did so on four occasions.

> (iii)     The Accused had derived personal benefit from the offences. He was motivated by the business and the profits that would be garnered by the family business, which he was personally invested in.

20     DPP Ang said that the s 6(b) charge fell into Category 2 of the classification set out in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“_Syed Romel_”). The giving of the bribe was to induce Lim to be lenient in his inspection of the works done by Liong Construction. She said that according to Menon CJ in _Syed Romel_, such cases frequently attracted custodial sentences. As for the s 6(c) PCA offences, they involved a serious compromise to NetLink’s procurement process. Further, the offences manifested themselves amidst corrupt dealings between the Accused and Lim.

21     DPP Ang also submitted that the principle of parity in sentencing was applicable in this case. Like the Accused, Lim had pleaded guilty to one s 6(a) offence and three s 6(c) offences. Three s 6(a) offences and 10 s 6(c) offences were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment on each charge, with two sentences ordered to run consecutively. The total aggregate sentence was eight weeks’ imprisonment.

22     However, DPP Ang argued that the Accused’s total aggregate sentence should be higher than Lim’s because of the following reasons -

> (i)     His culpability was greater because his role was more extensive. He created the false quotations using the letterhead of six different companies. He took steps to ensure that the quotations were higher than that of Liong Construction thereby guaranteeing that it would be awarded the projects.

> (ii)     There was a greater degree of persistent offending. He had also submitted false quotations for projects other than those from NetLink. Also he has more charges taken into consideration.

> (iii)     The level of remorse shown by the Accused was lower. Lim had surrendered all the pecuniary benefits that he had gained from the corrupt transactions. The Accused had not done the same.

## THE MITIGATION PLEA

23     Mr Paul Loy, counsel for the Accused called for fines to be imposed instead - $16000 for the s 6(b) offence, and $5000 for each of the s 6(c) offences.

24     His reasons for why the custody threshold had not been crossed in relation to the three s 6(c) offences were as follows -

> (i)     The fictitious quotations were done at Lim’s behest. The Accused was not the one who had come up with this. Neither did he offer to create the false quotations to gain an unfair advantage. In any event, the Accused was under the impression that the projects for which he created fictitious quotations were under the 3-year Term Contract, and he thought that the fictitious quotations were meant to simplify the administrative process and to expedite payments under the Term Contract.

> (ii)     No real detriment or loss was accrued by NetLink. Liong Construction had invoiced for work that was actually done. So it was only paid for actual work done. Invariably, the charges for work actually done were much lower.

> (iii)     The Accused did not gain any personal benefit. He was only a salaried employee of Liong Construction.

> (iv)     The false quotations were created with the explicit approval of the companies and sub-contractors. They were capable of performing the works quoted for in the event NetLink awarded the projects to them.

25     His reasons for why the custody threshold has not been crossed in relation to the s 6(b) offence were as follows -

> (i)     The bribe was given at Lim’s request as a loan. The Accused had given him the loan because of the friendship that existed between them.

> (ii)     No real harm or loss was caused to NetLink. There was no complaint of shoddy workmanship.

> (iii)     This was private sector corruption and the bribe amount was low. The level of culpability was therefore much lower.

> (iv)     The Accused did not make any personal gain. At all times, the Accused only had the best interest of Liong Construction in mind.

26     Mr Loy also highlighted that credit should be given to the Accused for pleading guilty at the pre-trial stage. It was a reflection of his genuine remorse and contrition, and showed a desire to facilitate the administration of justice by saving time and resources of the Court and the prosecution.

27     Mr Loy also pointed out that the Accused had been under tremendous pressure and stress over the case. That constituted sufficient and adequate punishment for him. Therefore, although deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration, it should be tempered by proportionality in relation to the severity of the offence committed and the moral and legal culpability of the Accused. Rather than imposing a blanket deterrent sentence, the court should be more nuanced in sentencing as “…different kinds and levels of punishment may be needed to produce a deterrent effect on different types of offending”: _Yang Suan Piau v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 809</span> at \[33\].

## COURT’S FINDINGS

### The s 6(c) PCA Charges

28     These charges targeted “non-bribery conduct”. The central mischief targeted was the dishonest exploitation of an agent-principal relationship, in this case the submissions of fictitious quotations by the Accused with the connivance of Lim, to the principal NetLink: see _Goh Chai Bee Anne v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> at \[57\] and \[59\]. In that case, CJ Menon said that “\[t\]he usual result of the offence is economic harm to the principal, and therefore the degree of such harm will often be a significant indicator of the seriousness of the offence in most cases. That said, an offence under s 6(c) may have wider repercussions” (at \[59\]).

29     CJ Menon went on to say that depending on the facts, a s 6(c) offence might be seen to undermine integrity in business dealings. In _Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 52</span>, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) recognised at \[75\] that it was not inconceivable that some kind of dishonest conduct falling within s 6(c) might be regarded as corrupt conduct. In such cases, the sentencing judge should take account of it as an aggravating factor. In the present case, I found that the offences had seriously compromised NetLink’s procurement process thereby infecting the integrity of its business dealings. There were also elements of corrupt conduct present between the Accused and Lim.

30     There was persistent conduct in the commission of the offences. 10 s 6(c) offences were taken into consideration. The 13 offences were committed over a period of eight months, which was not an insignificant period. The sole purpose of the fictitious quotations was to deceive NetLink into thinking that these were genuine, independent quotations for its projects. Independent quotations were required under NetLink’s procurement process. In creating these false quotations and pitching the prices higher than that quoted by Liong Construction, the Accused, with Lim’s connivance, had influenced the outcome of the awards towards his company.

31     The Accused has also derived personal benefit from these offences. He might have been a salaried employee with Liong Construction, but it was a family business; more to the point, his family’s. Further it was admitted in the Accused’s mitigation that he would take over the family business one day, which was not altogether surprising or unusual. He has a vested interest in ensuring that the family business continued to prosper. Winning the NetLink contracts was one way of ensuring this. For perspective, Liong Construction had won projects worth $911,867.40 by these means.

32     The defence had cited the case of _Ong Beng Leong v PP <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 766</span>_ in support of its argument that the Accused had not derived any personal benefit because he was only a salaried employee. The High Court, in reducing the sentence under s 6(c), noted that “there was never any suggestion by the Prosecution that the appellant had been motivated by pecuniary gain. Indeed, the evidence suggested that the appellant had honestly believed, albeit misguidedly, that he was expediting the works for the benefit of … the SAF \[his employer\]” (at \[60\]). That was not the case here. Even so, the High Court nevertheless still imposed sentences of imprisonment, though it reduced the sentences imposed by the trial court.

33     I would now address some of the other points raised by the defence to support their contention that the custody threshold has not been crossed. The defence argued that the Accused had thought the projects for which he had created the fictitious quotations were under the 3-year Term Contract, and that the quotations were merely meant to simplify the administrative process and to expedite payments under the Term Contract. I found this assertion to be disingenuous for various reasons. First, the statement of facts, to which the Accused had admitted to unreservedly, made patently clear that he knew the quotations were meant to enable Liong Construction to win the awards for these projects. Second, he was the manager of Liong Construction. One of his roles as manager was to prepare and submit quotations for works. He must know or was aware that quotations were not required for works under the Term Contract because Liong Construction was already contracted to do them. As for his further claim that these quotations were for administrative expediency and quick payments, this was similarly without any logic. Just as Liong Construction was legally obligated to do the jobs under the Term Contract, NetLink was also legally obligated to make payments promptly upon completion of the works. I can only conclude that the assertion was made with an eye at minimising his culpability.

34     The defence argued that the conspiracy was not initiated by the Accused. Even if that was true, and that Lim had initiated the conspiracy, the Accused was very committed in its prosecution. He had created the fictitious quotations, used the letterheads of his own companies and that of his sub-contractors, and purportedly obtained their acquiescence: see \[10\] to \[13\] above. These were significant and critical steps in the conspiracy. In my mind, their culpabilities were equal.

35     The defence said that that the other companies and sub-contractors whose names were used for the fictitious quotations were ready and able to perform the works. This argument was neither here nor there. It did not alter the fictitious nature of the quotations. It also did not alter the fact that they were not genuine quotations; that they were designed for the sole purpose of deceiving NetLink into believing that they were genuine independent quotations. The other companies and sub-contractors had no intention of bidding for the works. The quotations were never intended to be acted on.

36     For these reasons I agreed with DPP Ang that the custody threshold was crossed in relation to the s 6(c) charges.

### The s 6(b) Charge

37     The defence argued that the amount of the bribe was low ie $2500. This factor, and the fact that this was a private sector corruption, militated against an imprisonment term being imposed. He cited CJ Menon in _Syed Romel_ at \[20\] that for private sector corruption, where the amount of the bribe was below $30,000 and where there was no real detriment to the interests of the principal, such cases could be dealt with by the imposition of fines. Here, it would be prudent to highlight that CJ Menon also went on to say that this did not give rise to the presumption in favour of non-custodial sentences whenever private sector corruption is concerned. It was critical in the context of private sector corruption to be sensitive to the specific nature of corruption that one was concerned with.

38     In _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (“_Ang Seng Thor_”). VK Rajah JA, at \[46\], had emphasised that the size of the gratification was an important factor in determining whether the sentence should be custodial or not. He said that the size of the bribes was not only linked to the culpability of the offender, but was also related to the harm caused by the offence. The higher the amount of the bribe, the greater the corrupt influence exerted on the receiver. This in turn presumptively lead to a greater subversion of the public interest; which was the expectation that transactions and decisions, whether in the private or public sphere, were carried out fairly and transparently.

39     The take-away from \[38\] and \[39\] was that the size of the bribe was an important factor for consideration, and that the proper weightage must be accorded to it. A bribe below $30,000 was a strong indication for a non-custodial sentence. But it was not a given. One should also look at the specific nature of the corruption in question. In the present case, the purpose of the bribe was to induce Lim to perform acts which were detrimental to NetLink. In this case Lim was induced to be lenient in his dealings with Liong Construction. This case fell squarely into the second category in _Syed Romel_ (at \[28\] of the judgment). There was a compromise of one’s duty or a serious betrayal of trust, and therefore such cases would frequently attract custodial sentences.

40     The bribes were given to Lim over four separate occasions. Each act of bribery was deliberate and premeditated. They were not one-offs. The decisions to give the bribes were deliberately made and motivated by the prospect of obtaining an advantage for the benefit of Liong Construction and the Accused. I cannot agree with the defence’s contention that there was no detriment to NetLink. The detriment was that the bribes compromised the integrity of the inspection process in relation to works done by Liong Construction.

41     For the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs, I was of the opinion that the custody threshold has been crossed for the s 6(b) offence.

### Quantum of Imprisonment

42     In determining the appropriate quantum of imprisonment for the individual offences, the sentences meted out to Lim were relevant. Lim had pleaded guilty to one s 6(a) and three s 6(c) charges. Three s 6(a) and 10 s 6(c) charges were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment for each of the four proceeded charges. Two sentences, namely one s 6(a) and one s 6(c) charges, were ordered to run consecutively.

43     I agreed with DPP Ang that the principle of parity in sentencing applied in this case. Therefore, the Accused was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment on each of the four proceeded charges. I also noted that these individual sentences were in line with the case precedents. For the s 6(b) offence, the precedents showed a starting point of 4 weeks’ imprisonment where the bribe amount was in the range of $2000 to $3000 - _PP v Yeo Chin Ho_ (DAC 924646/14 & Ors) where the bribe amount was $2800, the sentence was 3 weeks’ imprisonment on each of the two charges; _PP v Sawant Mahesh Manohar_ (DAC 923530/14 & Ors where the bribe amount ranged from $2600 to $3300, the sentence was 10 weeks’ imprisonment on each of the five charges; _Toh Hong Huat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 198</span> (MA 9075/2016) where for bribe amounts of $918 to $2000, the sentence was one month’s imprisonment per charge, and for bribe amounts of $2040 to $3080, the sentence was two months’ imprisonment per charge.

44     I would only disagree with DPP Ang’s submission that three sentences should be ordered to run consecutively instead of two as in Lim’s case because the Accused’s culpability was greater. As I had stated in \[35\], I found that their culpabilities were equal. Therefore, I ordered two sentences to run consecutively; these being the s 6(b) offence (DAC 92755/18) and one s 6(c) offence (DAC 927583/18).

45     The total aggregate sentence was therefore eight weeks’ imprisonment.

46     The Accused has lodged an appeal against the sentence. He is presently on bail pending appeal.
