\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9120/2021/01.\]

31 May 2021

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mr Tan Jun Kai is 27 years of age. On 5 September 2018, while undergoing treatment at the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”), he punched a senior staff nurse in the face six times, causing grievous hurt. On 10 April 2020, he was found to be in possession of methamphetamine; an analysis of his urine sample showed that he had consumed methamphetamine.

2       On 18 May 2021, he pleaded guilty to charges of voluntarily causing grievous hurt (VCGH), drug consumption and drug possession. As he had an antecedent for drug consumption, having been admitted before to a drug rehabilitation centre, he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 3 years’ imprisonment for the charge of drug consumption. He was also sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment for VCGH. These two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, giving a total sentence of 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment. He commenced serving the sentence. He filed the present appeal against the sentence the next day, on 19 May 2021.

3       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Charges proceeded

4       The defendant pleaded guilty to three charges, which were as follows:

>     DAC-917502-2019 (1st charge – VCGH)

>     You, \[…\] are charged that you, on 5 September 2018, sometime between 2.00pm and 3.00pm, at the Institute of Mental Health located at 10 Buangkok View, Buangkok Green Medical, Ward 33A, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to Senior Staff Nurse Nyan Lin, _to wit_, by punching him in the face about 6 times, knowing that you were likely thereby to cause grievous hurt to said Nyan Lin and causing Nyan Lin to suffer a mild displaced fracture of right maxilla, a right periorbital hematoma, a right cheek contusion and a 1-cm superficial abrasion on his right elbow, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

>     DAC-918687-2020 (3rd charge – drug consumption, with enhanced punishment)

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, on or about 10 April 2020, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, methamphetamine, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the said Act

>     and further,

>     that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 24 August 2011, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under s 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely, Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Cluster B, Changi Prison Complex, for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, methamphetamine, and you shall now be punished under s 33(4AA) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

### Facts

5       The salient facts were as follows.

#### Voluntarily causing grievous hurt (VCGH) (1st charge)

6       At the material time, the defendant was warded at the IMH for suspected drug-induced psychosis.

7       On 5 September 2018, a senior staff nurse at the IMH (the “**Victim**”) was overseeing the general ward where the defendant was a patient. The Victim saw the defendant making his way from the visitor lounge to the day lounge. In accordance with the hospital’s protocol, the Victim conducted a body check on the defendant. The Victim found six cigarette sticks in the defendant’s left pocket and confiscated the cigarettes, as patients were not permitted to smoke in the hospital. The Victim then brought the defendant to the utility room to conduct further checks; nothing else was found on the defendant. After this, the Victim allowed the defendant to join the day lounge.

8       It was about 2.30 pm. Before the defendant entered the day lounge, he asked for the cigarettes to be returned. The Victim declined and told him that he could not smoke in the hospital. The defendant was enraged and punched the right side of the Victim’s face six times with his left hand. The defendant knew that in so doing, he was likely to cause grievous hurt to the Victim. He did not stop until other nurses intervened. The Victim did not retaliate.

9       The Victim complained of double vision immediately after the assault. He visited the Sengkang General Hospital shortly after. He was observed to have a right periorbital hematoma, a right cheek contusion and a one-cm superficial abrasion on his right elbow. A CT scan was later performed. He was diagnosed to have a mild displaced fracture of right maxilla. This was a result of his being punched by the defendant.

#### Consumption, possession of methamphetamine (3rd, 4th charges)

10     Sometime in April 2020, the defendant was supplied with “Ice” (methamphetamine) by an unknown person.

11     On the evening of 10 April 2020, he smoked “Ice” using a shisha bottle. He was found by police officers at a public playground just as he finished consuming the drug. A search was conducted on him. He was found in possession of, among other things: (a) one transparent plastic containing white crystallised substance; and (b) drug paraphernalia. He was arrested and taken to the Woodlands Police Division.

12     Later that day, he provided two bottles of his urine samples. The urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) for analysis at the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. Two analysts each issued a certificate under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”) stating that on analysis, each urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The defendant was not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to consume a specified drug. Investigations revealed that the defendant experienced a relapse of his drug consumption habits sometime between 2018 and 2019. He would smoke “Ice” for three to four days and finish whatever amount was in his possession, until he felt calm. He last consumed the drug before his arrest on 10 April 2020. (**3rd charge**)

13     The white crystallised substance contained in the transparent plastic found in the defendant’s possession was also submitted to the HSA for analysis. An analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, having conducted the analysis, issued a certificate under s 16 of the MDA stating that the substance was found to contain not less than 0.15 g of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The defendant admitted ownership of the drug and knew that it was “Ice”. He was not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to possess the drug. (**4th charge**)

## Sentencing

### Charges taken into consideration

14     The defendant admitted to two other offences and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing:

> (a)     One charge of theft of an e-scooter and an e-scooter battery, committed on 23 December 2019, an offence punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (MAC-902147-2020, 2nd charge); and

> (b)     One charge of possession of utensils intended to be used in connection with the consumption of a drug, committed on 10 April 2020, an offence under s 9 and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (DAC-918689-2020, 5th charge).

### Antecedents

15     The defendant had been admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) from 24 August 2011 to 6 September 2012 for the consumption of methamphetamine.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

16     The prosecution sought a total sentence of at least 3 years and 5 months’ imprisonment, with the following individual sentences:

> (a)     VCGH – at least 5 months’ imprisonment (consecutive).

> (b)     Drug consumption – 3 years’ imprisonment (consecutive).

> (c)     Drug possession – 8 months’ imprisonment (concurrent).

17     For the VCGH charge, the prosecution submitted on the two-step sentencing process set out in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> at \[55\]. The first step was to consider the seriousness of the injury caused to identify the indicative starting point for sentencing. It was noted that the harm involved a mild displaced fracture of right maxilla, as well as a right periorbital hematoma, a right cheek contusion and right elbow abrasion. From the sentencing precedents, a range of 5 to 6 months’ imprisonment was generally imposed for nasal fractures. It was noted that the present Victim’s injuries were slightly less severe than in the precedents, as it was a mild _displaced_ fracture as opposed to a complete fracture. There were, however, aggravating factors: the Victim was a healthcare worker who deserved protection from such acts of violence, and the Victim was punched six times. While it was recognised that the defendant had a mental condition, it could not justify any downward adjustment to the sentence, as there was no causal link between the defendant’s psychiatric illness and the offence: IMH report dated 11 April 2019, at para 18(a). It was submitted that a sentence of at least 5 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

18     For the drug consumption charge, the minimum sentence was 3 years’ imprisonment. For the charge of drug possession, it was submitted that the defendant was not a first-time user and was a casual user, and that a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

### Mitigation Plea

19     Counsel for the defendant urged the court to impose a total sentence of not more than 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment, with the following individual sentences:

> (a)     VCGH – not more than 4 months’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> (b)     Drug consumption – 3 years’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> (c)     Drug possession – 10 months’ imprisonment (concurrent).

20     For the VCGH charge, counsel largely concurred with the prosecution’s submitted sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment, but urged a downward calibration of the sentence to 4 months, given the severity of the defendant’s psychiatric condition as a mitigating factor.

21     Counsel highlighted that the defendant had a long history of mental illness. The defendant had been a long-term patient of IMH. His history of severe psychiatric illness was documented in various IMH medical reports and memos. He was first admitted to the IMH in May 2013 when he was referred there by the Singapore Armed Forces for suicidal ideations. He was subsequently diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, between 2013 to 2016. His condition worsened in 2016 when he developed psychotic symptoms – hallucinations – such as hearing voices and believing he was being followed by people. The frequency of his IMH admissions intensified, with admissions in October 2016, November 2016, April 2017 and August 2018, where he was treated during short in-patient stays. His diagnosis was subsequently revised to one of Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder. His offence of VCGH was committed in September 2018. By April 2019, his diagnosis was once again revised, this time to Schizophrenia, due to his persistent psychotic symptoms even when he was not abusing drugs. He was admitted for in-patient stay between 15 to 24 May 2019 due to a relapse of his Schizophrenia. He was seen as an outpatient between June 2019 to March 2020, with heavy medication prescribed. He suffered a relapse again in April 2020, and he stayed at the IMH for two months (between April and June 2020) as an inpatient. In August 2020, he was detained at the IMH under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (Cap 178A) for further treatment. He was released five months later, in January 2021. IMH deemed him sufficiently unwell to invoke its statutory powers to detain him. Presently, he continued to suffer hallucinations. He continued to be prescribed heavy medication for his condition. The treatment regime was expected to be long-term, with no end-date in sight.

22     Counsel submitted that, taken in totality, the Respondent’s predicament deserved sympathy. He was a young man who had for a better part of his young life laboured under severe mental illness and continued to be so. Counsel urged the court to temper “mercy with justice”, and to sentence the defendant to the shortest possible term of imprisonment that could be derived with the proceeded charges.

### Sentencing considerations

23     At the outset, I considered the individual and aggregate sentences sought by the prosecution and counsel to be entirely reasonable given the offences that the defendant had pleaded guilty to. The aggregate sentences sought by the prosecution (at least 3 years and 5 months’ imprisonment) and the defence (not more than 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment) were not far apart.

24     For the charge of drug consumption, given the defendant’s prior admission to a drug rehabilitation centre, the offence was punishable with an enhanced sentence of a mandatory minimum of 3 years’ imprisonment. I accepted the submissions of both parties that it was appropriate to impose that mandatory minimum sentence.

25     For the charge of drug possession, there was no suggestion that the drug was intended for any purpose other than his own consumption. The defendant was not a first-time drug user. He had been admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre from August 2011 to September 2012 for the consumption of methamphetamine. He had also been abusing the drug since his relapse sometime between 2018 and 2019. I considered that a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for this charge, and that the sentence ought to run concurrently with the sentence for drug consumption.

26     For the charge of VCGH, the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution was reasonable and entirely justifiable. That said, I was prepared to accept the submission of counsel that a slightly lower sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment would suffice. It was a decision based on a compassionate consideration of the defendant’s psychiatric condition as highlighted by counsel, despite the lack of a contributory link to the defendant’s offences. In making this decision I took into account the long mandatory imprisonment term that the defendant would have to undergo on account of his drug consumption offence.

27     I also accepted the submission of parties that it would be appropriate to order the sentences for the drug consumption charge and the VCGH charge to run consecutively. This would give an aggregate sentence of 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.

28     I also considered the question of whether a compensation order ought to be made. The prosecution made no submission on compensation. Counsel highlighted that the defendant was legally aided, had not been working, and would be unable to afford to pay compensation, and urged the court not to make a compensation order. I accepted counsel’s submission and made no compensation order as the defendant did not have the financial means to pay.

### Sentence imposed
