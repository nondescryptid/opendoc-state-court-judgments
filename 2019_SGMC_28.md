\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9131/2019/01.\]

17 June 2019

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused, aged 46 years, pleaded guilty to a charge of being a member of an unlawful society, an offence under s 14(3) of the Societies Act (Cap 311, Rev Ed 2014). He was a ‘fighter’ of the ‘Sio Kun Tong’ secret society of the ‘18’ Group from late-2016 until his arrest on 11 October 2018.

2       He was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. He has brought this appeal against that sentence.

## Summary of facts

3       On 11 October 2018, acting on information received, a party of police officers from the Secret Societies Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department arrested the accused for being a member of an unlawful society.

4       Investigations revealed that sometime in 2015, the accused was introduced by one Ah Lai (established to be Ng Tiam Lai) to a male Chinese known as Ah Gu (established to be Loh Ping Huang). The trio became close and often went out together for meals and drinks. After associating with them, the accused learned that both Ah Lai and Ah Gu were gang members of the ‘Sio Kun Tong’ secret society of the ‘18’ Group, which operated at 391 Upper Aljunied Road. The accused also learned that Ah Gu was the headman.

5       Sometime in mid-2016, the trio fought with another secret society at Lorong 7 Geylang. After this fight, the accused decided to pledge his allegiance to Ah Gu. He joined the ‘Sio Kun Tong’ Secret Society of the ‘18’ Group as a ‘fighter’. He remained a member until his arrest.

6       During the time when the accused was a member, he often met up with other members of the secret society and participated in gang gatherings.

## Antecedents

7       In 1995, the accused was fined $800 and disqualified from driving for 12 months for an offence of driving without third-party insurance coverage. A charge of taking a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent under s 96(1) of the Road Traffic Act (276) was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

8       In 2004, he was fined $2,800 and disqualified from driving for 10 months for an offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act.

9       In 2017, he was sentenced to 25 days’ imprisonment for an offence of causing hurt under s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Another charge under s 323 of the Penal Code was taken into consideration.

## Mitigation

10     The accused stated that he was in the car trade business. He urged me to impose a light sentence.

## Sentence

11     The punishment under s 14(3) of the Societies Act is a fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to three years or both.

12     The prosecution sought a term of six weeks’ imprisonment. The learned DPP referred to a table of eight unreported cases where terms of imprisonment of between two to five months’ imprisonment were imposed, except in one case where a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment was given.

13     For example, in _PP v Muhammad Ridzuan Bin Abdul Hamid_ (SC-900424-2014), the 21-year-old offender was a ‘fighter’ for six months in a secret society. He pleaded guilty to the s 14(3) charge and an offence of rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code. He received five months’ imprisonment on the s 14(3) charge and 24 months’ imprisonment and three strokes on the s 147 charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently. In contrast, in _PP v Leow Zheng Yang_ (SC-909219-2016) the 21-year-old offender was a ‘fighter’ in a secret society for 1½ years and also faced a charge under s 147 of the Penal Code and a charge under s 326 r/w s 34 of the Penal Code. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment on the s 14(3) charge, 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes on the s 147 charge and five years’ imprisonment and six strokes on the s 326 r/w s 34 charge. The five-year and 18-month terms were ordered to run consecutively. In _PP v Sativel s/o Arumugam Kuppusamy_ (SC-913265-2015), the 58-year-old offender was convicted after a trial for being a ‘senior member’ of a secret society for 45 years. He was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. In _PP v Tan Lee Wei_ (SC-901079-2014) where three weeks’ imprisonment was imposed, the 24-year-old offender pleaded guilty to one charge under s 353 of the Penal Code and one charge under s 14(3) of the Societies Act. A charge of disorderly behaviour was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. He had been a ‘member’ of the secret society for about four years. He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment on the s 353 charge which was ordered to run consecutively with the three-week term.

14     There is no clear sentencing pattern which can be discerned from the cases. Accordingly, I found the precedents to be of limited value. I thus approached the sentencing by considering the factors which would influence the assessment of the harm and culpability of the accused.

15     The offence of acting as a member of an unlawful society can occur in a multitude of circumstances and the culpability of an offender can thus vary considerably. Some of the offence-specific factors which are relevant include the nature of the unlawful society, the position of the offender in the unlawful society, the duration of the membership, the nature of the participation in the activities of the unlawful society, the position of the offender in society, et cetera.

#### (i)   Nature of the unlawful society

16     The history of the ‘Sio Kun Tong’ secret society of the ‘18’ Group has been detailed in the statement of facts, the accuracy of which has been accepted by the accused. The secret society was founded sometime in the late 1970s. Members of the secret society are known to operate illegal gambling dens, to be involved in unlicensed moneylending, vice rings and in violent attacks arising from staring incidents, name calling or relationship issues.

17     Despite the efforts of the police to suppress secret societies, the ‘Sio Kun Tong’ secret society of the ‘18’ Group continues to actively recruit new gang members, and its members are known to commit serious violent offences from time to time.

18     Such unlawful societies which are prejudicial to public peace and public safety have no place in our society. Acting as a member of a secret society is therefore inherently harmful. The relevant purpose of punishment must thus be general and specific deterrence.

#### (ii)   Position in unlawful society

19     The more senior a person is in the secret society, the greater will be his influence. Accordingly, the culpability of a senior member will be higher compared to that of a junior member.

20     Here, the accused was not a senior member. However, his role as a ‘fighter’ is significant in light of the nature of the secret society. In this regard, he has an antecedent of violence, which pertains to the incident referred to at paragraph 5 of the statement of facts, that led him to pledge his allegiance to the secret society.

#### (iii)   Nature of involvement in unlawful society

21     The accused’s involvement was not passive. The statement of facts stated that he participated in gang gatherings.

#### (iv)   Duration of membership

22     The accused first embraced the secret society in late 2016. His offending only ended with his arrest in October 2018. The period of offending is therefore close to two years.

#### Conclusion

23     Having regard to the four factors above, I agreed that the custody threshold was crossed. The only real mitigating factor in favour of the accused was his early plea of guilt. On balance, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that a term of six weeks’ imprisonment was just and proportionate and sentenced the accused accordingly.
