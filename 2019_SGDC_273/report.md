\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9293/2019/01.\]

5 December 2019

### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The Accused is a 42-year-old male Singaporean. The Prosecution proceeded against him on two charges under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act[^1] (“MDA”) of drug possession (“Proceeded Charges”). He pleaded guilty to both charges and consented to a third charge, also under s 8(a) of the MDA, being taken into consideration (“TiC”) for the purpose of sentencing.

2       I imposed a global imprisonment term of 5 years and 6 months. The Prosecution, which sought an imprisonment term of at least 9 years, has appealed against the sentence. The Accused is currently serving his imprisonment term.

## Facts

3       The following sets out the facts of this case, as gleaned from the Statement of Facts admitted to by the Accused.

4       On 6 December 2017, at about 10.00am, the Accused was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) at No.1 Yishun Street 1, Aposh Bizhub #08-09, Singapore (“Bizhub Unit”).

#### The First Proceeded Charge (DAC 944740/2017)

5       Upon searching the Bizhub Unit, the CNB officers found the following two trays of damp vegetable matter in the Accused’s possession:

> (a)     One tray (marked as ‘B1’) placed on the floor, containing not less than 1,335 grams of damp vegetable matter; and

> (b)     Another tray (marked as ‘G1’) placed under a table, containing not less than 1,339 grams of damp vegetable matter.

6       The trays B1 and G1 were sealed and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Thereafter, HSA issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA certifying the following.

> (a)     In respect of tray B1:[^2]

>> (i)       not less than 4.00 grams of damp vegetable matter was removed by HSA for analysis; and

>> (ii)       the remaining damp vegetable matter was dried to a constant weight of not less than 982.6 grams.

> (b)     In respect of tray G1:[^3]

>> (i)       not less than 4.17 grams of damp vegetable matter was removed by HSA for analysis; and

>> (ii)       the remaining damp vegetable matter was dried to a constant weight of not less than 989.0 grams.

7       HSA’s certificates further stated that the damp vegetable matter in sub-paragraphs 6(a)(i) and (b)(i) above, as well as the dried vegetable matter in sub-paragraphs 6(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) above, contained the following synthetic cannabinoids:

> (a)     THJ-2201 or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group (these being Class A Controlled Drugs under the First Schedule to the MDA); and

> (b)     5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group (these being Temporarily Listed Drugs in the Fifth Schedule to the MDA).

8       The dried vegetable matter in sub-paragraphs 6(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) above, which collectively added up to a weight of not less than 1,971.6 grams, thus formed the subject of the first charge proceeded with against the Accused (“First Proceeded Charge”):

> **DAC 944740/2017**

> You … are charged that you, on 6 December 2017 at about 10:00 a.m., at No.1 Yishun Street 1, Aposh Bizhub, #08-09, Singapore, did have in your possession a Class ‘A’ Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to wit, not less than 1,971.6 grams of dried vegetable matter and 8.17 grams of damp vegetable matter, in which THJ-2201 or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group was detected, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the said Act …

9       The Accused, who was not authorised to possess controlled drugs, admitted to the following:

> (a)     He knew that the vegetable matter in the trays B1 and G1 contained THJ-2201 or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group.

> (b)     He had received the vegetable matter from a contact of one Abang Kumar.

> (c)     He had, on Abang Kumar’s instructions, put the vegetable matter into the trays B1 and G1 to dry.

> (d)     He intended to return the dried vegetable matter to Abang Kumar, upon which he would be paid for drying the vegetable matter.

> (e)     This was the second time that the Accused had performed this task.

#### The Second Proceeded Charge (DAC 904741/2019)

10     After the Accused was arrested at the Bizhub Unit, he was escorted to his residence at Block 124 Rivervale Drive, where the CNB officers conducted a raid. The CNB officers found, _inter alia_, three packets which collectively contained not less than 66.18 grams of vegetable matter. These three packets were marked as exhibit N1A.

11     The HSA issued a certificate under s 16 of the MDA stating that exhibit N1A contained the synthetic cannabinoids as set out at paragraph 7 above.[^4] Exhibit N1A thus formed the subject of the second charge proceeded with against the Accused (“Second Proceeded Charge”):

> **DAC 904741/2019**

> You … are charged that you, on 6 December 2017 at about 4:40 p.m., at Blk 124 Rivervale Drive, #04-227, Singapore, did have in your possession a Class ‘A’ Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), to wit, three packets containing not less than 66.18 grams of vegetable matter in which THJ-2201 or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group was detected, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the said Act …

12     In respect of exhibit N1A, the Accused admitted that he:

> (a)     knew that it contained THJ-2201 or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group; and

> (b)     had received exhibit N1A from Abang Kumar and intended to return the same to the latter.

#### The TiC Charge

13     A further charge under s 8(a) of the MDA, pertaining to the Accused’s possession of two packets collectively containing not less than 42.28 grams of vegetable matter,[^5] was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Both packets, which had been seized from the Bizhub Unit, also contained THJ-2201 or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group.

## The Accused’s Antecedent History

14     The table below sets out the Accused’s antecedent history. Of relevance is the Accused’s conviction on 1 April 2003 for possession of cannabinol, under s 8(a) of the MDA. As that conviction still stands, he is now liable to a minimum imprisonment term of 2 years[^6] for each of the two Proceeded Charges.

## Plea in Mitigation

15     In the mitigation plea, the Defence highlighted that the Accused is the primary caregiver of his 69-year-old mother, who depends on him for her daily needs and medical expenses.[^7]

## Parties’ Submissions on Sentence

#### Overview of submissions

16     The Prosecution argued that although the First Proceeded Charge was one for possession of drugs:

> (a)     The fact that the Accused intended to return the drugs to Abang Kumar showed that the possession was with a view to illicit circulation. As such, this brought into play the sentencing approach in drug trafficking cases. As per that approach, the quantity of drugs possessed had a critical bearing on the sentence.

> (b)     Cannabis is the “closest proxy” to THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter. As such, the weight of the vegetable matter should be juxtaposed against the capital punishment thresholds for cannabis and cannabis mixture, to get a sensing of the seriousness of the offence.

> (c)     In this case, the vegetable matter, being 1,971.6 grams in weight, verged on

>> (i)       four times the capital punishment threshold for trafficking in cannabis (_ie_, four times 500 grams); and

>> (ii)       two times that for trafficking in cannabis mixture (_ie_, two times 1,000 grams).

> The quantity of vegetable matter, having reached capital proportions, consequently warranted an imprisonment term close to the 10-year limit prescribed under s 8(a) of the MDA.

##### The Prosecution thus sought an imprisonment term of at least 9 years for the First Proceeded Charge.

17     The Defence disagreed that the drug possession in this case was connected to illicit circulation. The Defence claimed that the Accused did not know what Abang Kumar was going to do with the drugs, contending that Abang Kumar may well have even intended to keep the drugs entirely for his own consumption, rather than circulate the same to others. The Defence thus argued for a global imprisonment term of no more than 4 years.

18     As regards the Second Proceeded Charge, the Prosecution did not object to the minimum imprisonment term of 2 years’ being imposed, concurrently with the imprisonment term for the First Proceeded Charge.

19     I canvass these arguments in greater detail below.

#### First Proceeded Charge: Were the drugs linked to illicit circulation?

20     The Prosecution began by alluding to the “multiple starting points” approach adopted in sentencing drug traffickers. In _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> (“_Vasentha”_), Sundaresh Menon CJ had proposed multiple starting points for sentencing traffickers of diamorphine, with higher indicative starting sentences corresponding to higher drug weights. The learned Chief Justice explained that this approach was suitable for trafficking cases, where the drug quantity tended to be proportionate to the harm. The drug quantity thereby serves as a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the trafficking.[^8]

21     The Prosecution also explained that while the correlation between drug quantity and harm might be strong in trafficking cases (since higher drug quantities facilitate wider circulation), this correlation may not always hold in cases of drug _possession_. The Prosecution cited the case of _Liew Zhenyang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 257</span> (“_Liu Zhengyang_”), where Steven Chong JA explained that an offender committing the offence of drug possession may do so for a variety of reasons, _eg_:[^9]

> (a)     for his own consumption;

> (b)     for the purpose of trafficking; or

> (c)     for a purpose which is not clear on the evidence.

Chong JA opined that where the purpose of possession is personal consumption, the punishment may not be as severe as if it were for trafficking. This is because the harm from the latter is caused to others, while that for the former is only to oneself[^10]. As such, Chong JA opined that the “multiple starting points” approach adopted in sentencing traffickers, where severity of the sentence hinges on drug quantity, may not be suitable for drug possession offences.9

22     The Prosecution then argued that in this case, the Accused did not possess the drugs merely for his own consumption. Rather, he obtained the drugs from Abang Kumar’s contact and intended to return the same to Abang Kumar. The Accused was thus facilitating the illicit circulation of the drugs, such that his actions could be likened to possession for the purpose trafficking. Consistent with the principle underlying the “multiple starting points approach” in trafficking cases, the huge quantity of the vegetable matter in this case necessitated a higher sentence.

23     In support of its argument, the Prosecution cited the case of _Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor & anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 17</span> (“_Ramesh a/l Perumal_”). In that case, the accused person was charged under s 5 of the MDA for trafficking in 29.96 grams of diamorphine. Given that this exceeded the capital punishment threshold of 15 grams, the accused person would have been liable to the death penalty if convicted. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that the facts of that case were akin to bailment - the accused person had been entrusted with the drugs by one Chander and merely intended to return the same to Chander. The Court of Appeal ruled that in such a situation, the accused person would not be guilty of trafficking. The Court of Appeal thus amended the charge against the accused person to one of drug possession under s 8(a) of the MDA and convicted him accordingly.[^11] However, when it came to the issue of the appropriate sentence for the (amended) charge of possession, the Court of Appeal opined that in taking possession of the drugs, the accused person must have known that he was committing an act connected to the illicit ‘circulation’ (in the loose sense of the word) of the drugs:[^12]

> We have found that the Prosecution has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that \[the accused person\] was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Nevertheless, **_it is clear that he was not in possession of the drugs for his own consumption. On the assumption that \[the accused person\] had agreed to take custody of D1 in order to safekeep the drugs for Chander, we find that he must have known that he was committing some act that was connected (at least in the loose sense of the word) to the illicit circulation of the drugs_**, even if this did not amount to abetment of trafficking. \[emphasis added\]

The Court of Appeal felt that as the weight of the diamorphine was almost double the threshold for capital punishment (had the charge been for trafficking), the accused person should be punished with a sentence at the high end of the sentencing range prescribed by s 8(a) of the MDA:12

> That being so, we are of the view that this is an appropriate case for imposing a penalty at the high end of the sentencing range. **_Having regard to the fact that the quantity of diamorphine in question was 29.96g – almost double that which would attract capital punishment in the context of a trafficking charge_** – we find that it is appropriate to impose a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment. \[emphasis added\]

24     Reverting to the present case, the Prosecution had initially argued before me[^13] that this case was (as with _Ramesh a/l Perumal_) related to illicit circulation because the Accused’s acts were _similar_ to that of the accused person in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_. Specifically, the Accused had been entrusted with the drugs and intended to return the same to Abang Kumar.[^14] At a subsequent mention of this case,[^15] the Prosecution developed upon its prior position, arguing that the Accused’s culpability was actually _higher_ than that of the accused person in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_. Specifically:

> (a)     The accused person in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ had intended to return the drugs to _the exact same_ individual who entrusted the drugs to him in the first place. Here, the Accused took the drugs from someone _other than_ Abang Kumar, _ie_, Abang Kumar’s contact. By proposing to hand the drugs to Abang Kumar, the Accused was effectively planning to transmit the drugs from one person to another.[^16] The factual matrix here was thus less akin to the bailment scenario in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ and instead bore greater semblance to plain drug trafficking.

> (b)     The Prosecution also highlighted other aspects of the Accused’s conduct which heightened his culpability. Specifically, he had taken the added step of helping to dry the vegetable matter. He was also going to be paid by Abang Kumar, upon returning the dried vegetable matter to the latter.16

25     The Defence countered that, unlike in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_, it was not appropriate to infer that the drugs were for illicit circulation. Specifically:

> (a)     There was no evidence that the Accused knew what Abang Kumar was going do with the vegetable matter.[^17]

> (b)     The Defence went so far as to suggest that Abang Kumar may even have intended to keep the vegetable matter for his own consumption.[^18]

The Defence also argued that in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_, it was because the weight of the drugs was almost double the capital punishment threshold for trafficking in diamorphine that the Court of Appeal made the inference of illicit circulation. In contrast, the facts of the present case do not lend themselves to such an inference because no capital punishment threshold exists for THJ-2201.[^19]

#### First Proceeded Charge: Impact of drug quantity on sentence

26     Having advanced the position that the Accused’s possession of the vegetable matter was to facilitate its illicit circulation, the Prosecution followed through with the argument that the sentencing approach in drug trafficking cases came into play. Specifically, the weight of the drugs would have a critical impact on the sentence.

27     To this end, the Prosecution contended[^20] that cannabis was the “closest proxy” for the vegetable matter seized from the Accused. Given that trafficking in more than 500 grams of cannabis or 1,000 grams of cannabis mixture attracts the death penalty, the weight of the vegetable (standing at 1,971.6 grams) was substantial by any measure. This, argued the Prosecution, warranted an imprisonment term of at least 9 years for the First Proceeded Charge.

28     In response to these arguments, I highlighted[^21] the following concerns to the Prosecution:

> (a)     The Court of Appeal in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ had calibrated the imprisonment term at close to the highest end of the range because the drug weight was close to double the capital punishment threshold. The same cannot be said in the present case, where there is _no_ capital punishment threshold for THJ-2201. As such, by what yardstick could one say that the drug weight was so ‘substantial’ that it warranted close to the maximum imprisonment term?

> (b)     I also voiced concerns with the Prosecution’s suggestion that cannabis was the “closest proxy” for the vegetable matter seized in this case, such that the capital punishment thresholds for trafficking in cannabis and cannabis mixture can be used as an indicator of just how substantial the drug quantity was. What was the basis for equating the THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter in this case with cannabis, for the purpose of sentencing?

29     After taking some time for further research, the Prosecution tendered written submissions offering more background on THJ-2201:[^22]

> (a)     THJ-2201 is a new psychoactive substance (“NPS”) that bears structural features allowing it to bind to cannabinoid receptors, thereby producing pharmacological effects similar to those of tetrahydrocannabinol. THJ-2201 is thus a synthetic cannabinoid.[^23]

> (b)     Synthetic cannabinoids, which make up approximately 30% of NPSs,[^24] are commonly laced onto vegetable matter that is then smoked. The lacing process usually entails dissolving the synthetic cannabinoid in an organic solvent which is in turn sprayed on, or used to soak, the vegetable matter. Once the solvent evaporates, the laced vegetable matter is ready for smoking. The result is a product that mimics cannabis[^25]

30     The Prosecution argued that THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter should be placed on the same footing as cannabis for the purpose of sentencing, given the potency of THJ-2201. The Prosecution contended that[^26]

> … there is evidence that abuse of synthetic cannabinoids such as THJ-2201, in the form of laced vegetable matter or otherwise, is at least as harmful as abuse of cannabis. … Another risk factor is that such laced matter can even potentially be manufactured to be disproportionately potent, for example through lacing a particularly high amount of starting material into a small quantity of substrate.

The Prosecution thus argued:[^27]

> While the comparison between the two types of drugs for the purpose of sentencing can only be approximate given the absence of statutorily prescribed benchmarks for the former, it is a necessary consideration given the pharmacological similarities between both drugs.

31     After reading these submissions, I called parties into chambers[^28] to seek clarification on, _inter alia_, the following points:

> (a)     Is there any way to ascertain the amount of THJ-2201 in the vegetable matter seized from the Accused?

> (b)     Is there any test which can be employed to show whether the potency of the vegetable matter seized from the Accused was similar to cannabis, such that both should be accorded parity in sentencing treatment?

32     After taking some further time to deliberate, parties eventually filed further submissions. Appended to the Prosecution’s further submissions was an affidavit from the Laboratory Director of HSA’s Illicit Drugs Laboratory, deposing to the following.

> (a)     Currently, HSA can _neither_:[^29]

>> (i)       quantify the amount of synthetic cannabinoids (such as THJ-2201) within laced vegetable matter; nor

>> (ii)       comment on the pharmacological effects of the laced vegetable matter.

> As such, HSA is _unable_ to comment on the effects of the drug exhibits seized from the Accused.[^30]

> (b)     However, HSA is able to provide information about THJ-2201 _generally_. Specifically, THJ-2201:

>> (i)       is as potent as, if not more potent than, tetrahydrocannabinol (the main psychoactive substance in cannabis);30 and

>> (ii)       does not degrade over time[^31] (unlike the tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis, which does[^32]).

33     In its further submissions, the Prosecution raised the following arguments:

> (a)     In sentencing traffickers of cannabis, the court takes account of the gross weight of the cannabis and not the amount of the psychoactive component within the cannabis (_ie_, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol). The Prosecution reasoned that correspondingly, it is the weight of the vegetable matter in the present case that has to be determinative of the appropriate sentence, regardless of the amount of the psychoactive component (_ie_, THJ-2201).[^33]

> (b)     On the street, cannabis is sold by gross weight and without reference to potency.[^34]

Following from the above, the Prosecution argued that since cannabis trafficking is currently sentenced according to gross weight and cannabis street sales are similarly transacted by gross weight, it is only principled and logical that vegetable matter laced with synthetic cannabinoids, being a synthetic substitute for cannabis, should be treated similarly.[^35]

34     On its part, the Defence argued that sentencing should be based on the amount of THJ-2201 (despite the difficulty in ascertaining its quantity within the vegetable matter) and not the weight of the vegetable matter. [^36] The Defence contended that the distinction between cannabis and vegetable matter laced with THJ-2201 must be maintained - the two cannot be conflated for sentencing purposes.[^37] The Defence thus argued that the global imprisonment term imposed in this case should not exceed 4 years.[^38]

#### Second Proceeded Charge

35     As regards the Second Proceeded Charge, which pertained to a much smaller quantity of vegetable matter (_ie_, 66.19 grams), the Prosecution:

> (a)     did not seek an imprisonment term exceeding the mandatory minimum of 2 years;[^39] and

> (b)     did not object to this imprisonment term running concurrently with that to be imposed for the First Proceeded Charge.[^40]

## Decision

36     After hearing the above arguments, I arrived at the following conclusions.

37     In respect of the First Proceeded Charge:

> (a)     I agreed with the Prosecution that on the facts, the Accused’s possession of the drugs was connected to illicit circulation. Consequently, the quantity of the drugs possessed has a strong bearing on sentence.

> (b)     However, I disagreed with the Prosecution that the drug quantity, to be used as a measure of the seriousness of the offence (and thereby of the severity of the sentence), should on the facts of this case be measured by the weight of the vegetable matter seized. What was material was the quantity of the THJ-2201, and not that of the vegetable matter which it laced.

> (c)     Even if the drug quantity ought to be measured by the weight of the vegetable matter, I did not agree with the Prosecution that the weight in this case (standing at 1,971.6 grams) could simply be juxtaposed against the weight limits triggering capital punishment for trafficking in cannabis (500 grams) or cannabis mixture (1,000 grams), as a gauge of the offence’s gravity. That would entail putting the laced vegetable matter in this case on the same footing, gram-for-gram, as cannabis or cannabis mixture, for the purpose of sentencing. The Prosecution was not able to convince me why this was appropriate.

As such, I did not think that the Prosecution could rely on the weight of the vegetable matter seized in this case to justify the 9-year imprisonment term sought. Instead, I imposed an imprisonment term of 5 years and 6 months for the First Proceeded Charge, this being slightly above the minimum sentence that would have applied had the First Proceeded Charge been one of trafficking in THJ-2201.

38     As regards the Second Proceeded Charge, I imposed the minimum imprisonment term of 2 years, to run concurrently with the imprisonment term for the First Proceeded Charge.

39     I explain my reasons below.

#### First Proceeded Charge: Drugs were linked to illicit circulation

40     I agreed with the Prosecution that on the authority of _Ramesh a/l Perumal_, the Accused’s possession of the drugs under the First Proceeded Charge could be regarded as connected to illicit circulation, given that he intended to hand the drugs to Abang Kumar. Sentencing should thus proceed on that basis.

41     The Defence sought to distinguish _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ by highlighting that the weight of the drugs in that case was almost double the capital punishment threshold for trafficking in diamorphine. That was why, argued the Defence, the Court of Appeal inferred that the drugs were connected to illicit circulation in the case. In contrast, the present facts do not support such an inference because there is no capital punishment threshold for the drug (_ie_, THJ-2201) in question.[^41] My response to this argument would be as follows:

> (a)     Firstly, a reading of the relevant section of the _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ judgment (extracted at paragraph 23 above) shows that the Court of Appeal had placed reliance on the enormity of the drug quantity when deciding on the _magnitude of the sentence_. However, the point concerning the drug quantity did not appear to factor into the court’s conclusion that the accused person’s possession of the drug was connected to its illicit circulation.

> (b)     Further, there is no basis for insisting that the drug quantity must hit the capital punishment thresholds before an inference can be drawn that the drug was meant to be trafficked. Though not directly on point, I note that s 17 of the MDA, which lists out weight thresholds triggering the presumption that the drug possessed was meant for trafficking, specifies numbers that fall far below the thresholds attracting capital punishment.

42     The Defence argued that the vegetable matter here could not be regarded as being connected to illicit circulation, given the absence of any evidence that Abang Kumar was going to re-circulate the vegetable matter to others. However, I was of the view that the Accused’s very act of passing the drugs to Abang Kumar would, in and of itself, have constituted the illicit ‘circulation’ (in the loose sense of the word) referred to in _Ramesh a/l Perumal._ What Abang Kumar intended to do with the vegetable matter thereafter would not impact on this conclusion. I say this because in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_, there was similarly little evidence to show that Chander (to whom the accused person was going to return the drugs) was going to re-circulate the drugs to others. This is clear from the following passage of the judgment:[^42]

> … we do not think that the facts before the court disclose an alternative charge of abetment of trafficking, or doing acts preparatory to or for the purposes of trafficking on Ramesh’s part. No charge of abetment is made out because **_there is insufficient evidence concerning what was to be done with the D bundles, and therefore, no primary offence of trafficking to speak of_**. Ramesh claims that he was supposed to return Chander the drugs at 1.00pm or at the end of their workday. If that is so, **_there is certainly no evidence before the court concerning whether Ramesh knew of Chander’s intentions, assuming for the moment that Chander is found to have had the intention of trafficking the D bundles. There was also no evidence before the court to suggest that, by taking temporary possession of the D bundles, Ramesh had enabled, assisted or facilitated any act of trafficking of the D bundles_**. \[emphasis added\]

Yet, the Court of Appeal held that the accused person[^43]

> must have known that he was committing some act that was connected (at least in the loose sense of the word) to the illicit circulation of the drugs, even if this did not amount to abetment of trafficking.

43     In any case, even if what Abang Kumar planned to do with the drugs (after receiving them from the Accused) is relevant, the large quantity of vegetable matter here would, at the very least, tend to go against the grain of the claim that circulation of the drugs would have stopped at Abang Kumar and no further. The Prosecution explained that to date, the present case involves the largest haul of THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter ever brought to our courts.[^44]

44     Finally, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the present factual matrix bore even greater semblance to trafficking than the bailment scenario in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_. The Accused intended to pass the drugs from one person to another (_ie_, from Abang Kumar’s contact to Abang Kumar). There was thus an additional link in the chain of illicit circulation, with the Accused acting as middleman passing the drugs from one individual to the next. In contrast, the bailment scenario in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ entailed the accused person returning the drugs to the very same individual who had entrusted the drugs to him in the first place.[^45] This was all the more reason to treat the present case as one related to illicit circulation.

45     In any case, during the course of my exchanges with parties in oral arguments, Defence Counsel ultimately conceded that it was a “reasonable inference” that the vegetable matter seized from the Accused was linked to illicit circulation.[^46]

#### First Proceeded Charge: Impact of drug quantity on sentence

46     Having concluded that the Accused’s possession of the vegetable matter was connected to illicit circulation, I was of the view that (as in the case of _Ramesh a/l Perumal_) the **_drug quantity_** would now have a pivotal bearing on the appropriate severity of sentence. Such an approach to sentencing coheres with that in trafficking cases, where the courts have set indicative sentencing benchmarks that correlate to drug weight.

47     This brings me to the main bone of contention: What exactly is the ‘drug quantity that should be used as a measure of the seriousness of the offence, and consequently the severity of the appropriate sentence?

> (a)     The Prosecution argued that the quantity of the drugs in this case would be the weight of the **_vegetable matter_**. Further, given the similarity between THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter and cannabis, the weight of the vegetable matter in this case should then be juxtaposed against the capital punishment thresholds for trafficking in cannabis and cannabis mixture, to get a sensing of the seriousness with which the weight of the vegetable matter should be viewed.

> (b)     The Defence countered that the relevant drug quantity here was the weight of the THJ-2201 and not of the vegetable matter.

After much deliberation, I was of the view that the drug quantity should be the quantity of THJ-2201 and not the weight of the vegetable matter.

48     The Prosecution argued that since traffickers of cannabis and cannabis mixture are sentenced according to the gross weight of the vegetable matter and not the quantity of the underlying psychoactive components (_ie_, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol), the Accused must similarly be sentenced according to the weight of the THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter and not the quantity of THJ-2201 lacing the vegetable matter.[^47] However, the simple reply to this is that the Second Schedule to the MDA specifically sets out sentencing thresholds linked to the weight of cannabis and cannabis mixture. It is thus pursuant to an explicit legislative framework that we sentence traffickers according to the weight of the vegetable matter concerned (_ie_, cannabis and cannabis mixture) without delving further into the quantity of the psychoactive substances within these vegetable matters. There is no corresponding legislative provision directing us to sentence offenders according to the weight of vegetable matter laced with synthetic cannabinoids such as THJ-2201.

49     The Prosecution highlighted that “controlled drug” is defined by s 2 of the MDA to include not only the relevant substance or product but also “_anything that contains any such substance or product_”.[^48] Presumably, this would allow the term to catch the vegetable matter which carries the synthetic cannabinoid listed by the MDA. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the legislatively prescribed thresholds for _sentencing_ traffickers hinge on the weight of the substance, and not that of the medium in which the substance is contained. Thus, under the Second Schedule, heroin traffickers are sentenced according to the quantity of diamorphine and not the weight of the heroin powder, while traffickers of ‘ice’ are sentenced according to the quantity of methamphetamine and not the weight of the ‘ice’ crystals. The Prosecution sought to distinguish cases involving diamorphine and methamphetamine by arguing that HSA is able to measure the quantity of these substances within the raw drug, but is unable to measure the quantity of THJ-2201 in laced vegetable matter.48 However, the Prosecution was not able to explain why, just because the quantity of the drugs cannot be scientifically ascertained, it is open to the court to avail itself of some other proxy for quantity to inflate the Accused’s punishment.

50     The difficulty with using the weight of the vegetable matter as a proxy for drug quantity (which is then used as a measure of the seriousness of the offence) becomes apparent in the following scenario which I had posed to the Prosecution:48

> (a)     I asked the Prosecution what the position would be if Abang Kumar’s contact had _separately_ entrusted the Accused with a vial of pure THJ-2201, plus 2 kg of _unlaced_ tobacco. The Prosecution replied that the Accused would be charged for possession of the THJ-2201 and not of the tobacco. The Prosecution also accepted that if the Accused’s act of possession was likened to trafficking, the severity of the sentence should hinge on the quantity of THJ-2201 in the vial.

> (b)     I then postulated the premise that, based on an appropriate sentencing framework,[^49] the vial of pure THJ-2201 would have attracted a sentence of (say) 5 years. I asked the Prosecution what the position would then be if Abang Kumar’s contact had, prior to entrusting the tobacco to the Accused, sprayed the entire vial of THJ-2201 onto the tobacco. Would the appropriate sentence now bloat from 5 years to 9 years, just because the tobacco was 2 kg in weight, notwithstanding that the quantity of THJ-2201 at play remained _exactly the same_?

The Prosecution replied in the affirmative.[^50] The Prosecution explained that ultimately, what is released into the market for circulation is the laced tobacco. It is also up to the person lacing the tobacco to decide how much tobacco he wishes to release into the market. It is thus appropriate for that person to be punished according to the weight of the tobacco.

51     However, I observed that the Prosecution’s position could lead to arbitrary results. Technically, it would mean that _x_ grams of THJ-2201 could attract an even _lower_ penalty than x/2 grams of the same, if the former was in pure form but the latter had been heavily diluted with solvent and sprayed over a sufficiently large quantity of tobacco leaves. This result is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the MDA criminalises the possession / trafficking of THJ-2201, and not some other substance. It I difficult to accept that the quantum of some other substance such as tobacco, which has not been criminalised by the MDA, should assume such pre-eminence in the calculation of sentence.

52     As such, I rejected the Prosecution’s submission that the weight of the laced vegetable matter should be used as a measure of the seriousness of the offence.

53     Even if I had agreed with the Prosecution that the weight of the vegetable matter was the appropriate indicator of seriousness, I did not agree that the sentence here should be calibrated by juxtaposing that weight (_ie_, 1,971.6 grams) against the weight limits triggering capital punishment for trafficking in cannabis (500 grams) and cannabis mixture (1,000 grams). The Prosecution was effectively asking me to place the laced vegetable matter seized in this case on the same footing, gram-for-gram, as cannabis or cannabis mixture, for sentencing purposes. While the Prosecution adduced an affidavit from HSA’s Laboratory Director deposing to the effects of synthetic cannabinoids (such as THJ-2201) generally, there was no evidence to show why the laced vegetable matter seized _in this case_ should be regarded as qualitatively similar to cannabis or cannabis mixture. HSA was unable to tell the concentration of synthetic cannabinoid in the vegetable matter.

54     There is in fact a clear example within the MDA framework of when traffickers can be punished according to the weight of the substance, seemingly _without reference to that substance’s purity or concentration_. Specifically, traffickers of cannabis mixture face a minimum imprisonment term of 20 years if the mixture’s weight exceeds 660 grams, as well as capital punishment if the mixture’s weight exceeds 1,000 grams. These thresholds were promulgated to tackle a loophole where cannabis traffickers could evade the sentencing thresholds for cannabis by simply mixing cannabis with tobacco. At the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in November 1993,[^51] then Minister for Home Affairs Professor S Jayakumar had this to say:

> … The Central Narcotics Bureau has detected some cases in which cannabis was trafficked in mixed form, ie the plant is broken up and mixed with other vegetable matter such as tobacco. Currently, this does not attract the death penalty.

> To deter traffickers from trafficking in large amounts of cannabis in this form, a new capital offence will be created for this type of drug.

In prescribing these sentencing thresholds for cannabis mixture, the MDA explicitly hinges the sentence on the quantity of the laced medium (_ie_, the mixture), without appearing to make any distinction as regards the concentration of the lacing (_ie_, cannabis) within that medium. There is no similar provision within the MDA that directs the court to sentence an accused person according to the weight of THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter, regardless of the quantum of THJ-2201 within it.

55     Even then, I observe that in laying down the sentencing thresholds for trafficking in cannabis mixture, the legislature was mindful that cannabis mixture typically contains **at least 50%** of cannabis. In the same second reading speech cited above, the Minister also said:

> As the amount of cannabis in such a mixture does not usually fall below 50%, it is proposed that for the purpose of capital offences, trafficking in a cannabis mixture should be in amounts of more than 1,000g (as compared to more than 500g in the case of cannabis alone).

It is thus clear that in fixing the sentencing thresholds for traffickers of cannabis mixture, concentration was a key determinant. After deliberating on the typical concentrations of cannabis within cannabis mixture, the legislature made the policy decision to adopt a 2:1 ratio in mapping the sentencing thresholds for traffickers of cannabis mixture to that for traffickers of pure cannabis.

56     The Prosecution relied on a 2017 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, _United States v Nahmani_ 696 Fed.Appx. 457 (“_Nahmani_”). In that case, the accused person was charged with conspiring to possess, with intent to distribute, 1,200 kg of material, comprising:

> (a)     1,100 kg of plant material laced with synthetic cannabinoids; plus

> (b)     100 kg of synthetic cannabinoid powder.

In sentencing the accused person, the district court applied the Sentencing Guidelines issued by the United States Sentencing Commission (“US Sentencing Guidelines”). At that point in time, the US Sentencing Guidelines prescribed that for cases involving tetrahydrocannabinol, the court was to apply a ratio equating 1 gram of tetrahydrocannabinol with 167 grams of marihuana, for the purpose of sentencing. The district court in _Nahmani_ had likened the synthetic cannabinoids seized from the accused person to tetrahydrocannabinol, and thus found the ratio to be applicable. However, in applying the ratio, the district court multiplied the _entire_ weight of 1,200 kg (_ie_, _including_ the 1,100 kg of laced plant material) against the multiplier of 167, yielding an equivalent weight of 200,400 kg of marihuana. On that premise, the accused person was sentenced to the statutory maximum term of 240 months’ imprisonment. On appeal, he argued (_inter alia_) that the weight of the plant material should not have been included in calculating the equivalent weight of marihuana. However, the appeal was dismissed.

57     The Prosecution explained that the approach in _Nahmani_ has now been codified in the US Sentencing Guidelines.[^52] As explained above, the court in _Nahmani_ had used the ratio in the US Sentencing Guidelines that was applicable to tetrahydrocannabinol. The US Sentencing Guidelines have since been expanded to include ratios for synthetic drugs, _eg_: [^53]

> (a)     1 gram of synthetic cannabinoid is equated with 167 grams of marihuana.

> (b)     1 gram of synthetic cathinone is equated with 380 grams of marihuana.

58     The Prosecution invited me to take a similar approach as the district court in _Nahmani_, _ie_, by factoring the entire weight of the vegetable matter into account, when sentencing the Accused.

59     I did not find _Nahmani_ to be of assistance. A close reading of the case shows that the US Court of Appeals did _not_ explicitly endorse the district court’s approach of factoring the entire weight of the plant material into account. In fact, the US Court of Appeals held that _even if_ the District Court had erred in factoring the entire weight of the plant material into the calculation, no intervention was necessary as the collective weight of the remaining drug items (_ie_, the synthetic cannabinoid powder) was enough to trigger the maximum sentence. This is seen in footnote 23 of the judgment:

> First, even if the district court erred in attributing the weight of the plant material seized … in calculating his sentence, any error was harmless and does not warrant resentencing. …

> Resentencing is unnecessary because if the district court excluded the weight of the plant material seized …, the sentence calculated under the Guidelines would remain the same. Nahmani did not challenge the portions of the PSR attributing to him 40 kilograms of powder seized from him in July 2014, 60 kilograms of powder that he ordered from China, and 150 kilograms of powder that he sold to Hurley. Even if the district court had used 250 kilograms of a mixture containing synthetic cannabinoids as the relevant drug quantity, Nahmani's sentence would have remained the same. His guideline range still would have been 360 months to life, and the statutory maximum of 240 months would have become his sentence.

60     If anything, _Nahmani_ proves the point that an attempt to map synthetic cannabinoids to cannabis for the purpose of sentencing requires a considered policy call as to what is the appropriate conversion ratio. The US policymakers have (by way of the US Sentencing Guidelines) prescribed a 1:167 ratio when mapping the sentencing treatment of synthetic cannabinoids to that for marihuana. As alluded to earlier, our legislature had similarly taken a considered policy call in adopting a 2:1 ratio to map the sentencing treatment of trafficking in cannabis mixture to that for trafficking in cannabis.

61     With that backdrop in mind, there is some cause for pause when faced with the submission that the vegetable matter seized from the Accused be treated on the exact same footing, for purpose of sentencing, as cannabis or cannabis mixture. In effect, the Prosecution was asking me to apply a 1:1 ratio, _ie_, that 1 gram of the THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter should be treated as equivalent to 1 gram of cannabis, for sentencing purposes. Without any evidence regarding the vegetable matter’s THJ-2201 concentration, or its potency relative to cannabis, I felt ill-placed to embark on any such mapping exercise.

62     Even if I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that cannabis was (to use the Prosecution’s words) the “closest proxy”[^54] to THJ-laced vegetable matter, it was not clear to me why the conversion ratio mapping the vegetable matter to cannabis should be 1:1, rather than 2:1 (as with cannabis mixture), or some other ratio that our policymakers may see fit to adopt. Particularly in this case, where there is no evidence of the THJ-2201 concentration within the vegetable matter seized from the Accused. I did not think that my concerns pertaining to concentration of THJ-2201 should be dismissed out of hand, merely on account of HSA not being able to ascertain that concentration. After all, the US Sentencing Guidelines cited to me by the Prosecution also state, _inter alia_:53

> a downward adjustment may be warranted where the synthetic cannabinoid is diluted with an unusually high quantity of base material, thus creating a particularly impotent end product.

As such, concentration is a salient consideration. In this instance, there was no evidence to show just how concentrated (or diluted) the THJ-2201 within the seized vegetable matter was.

63     As a matter of policy, I agreed with the Prosecution that given the deleterious effects of NPSs[^55] and their growing penetration,[^56] this is a scourge that urgently needs nipping in the bud. However, I am bound to sentence within the framework of the MDA. If there had been specific provisions within the MDA providing for traffickers to be sentenced according to the weight of the NPS-laced vegetable matter, without regard to the concentration of NPS (similar to how there appears to be no requirement to delve into the quantity of cannabis within cannabis mixture, when sentencing traffickers of such mixtures), the dynamics in this case would have been quite different. However, given that the prohibition in the MDA specifically lists THJ-2201 (and not the vegetable matter), that is where the focus must sit.

64     Finally, I note that in the two precedents cited by the Prosecution involving trafficking in THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter,[^57] the sentence imposed was either the statutorily prescribed minimum or close to the minimum. This was despite the weight of the vegetable matter being quite different in both cases – _ie_, the weight of the vegetable matter did not appear to have a very strong pivoting effect:

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v Widayanti Binte Ahmad_ (SC-906092-2017, unreported) an accused person with no past drug antecedents pleaded guilty to trafficking **0.32 grams** of THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter. She was sentenced to the statutory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment. Caning was inapplicable as the accused person was female.

> (b)     In _Public Prosecutor v Ang Choon Keong Vincent_ (SC-906248-2017, unreported) an accused person with drug antecedents pleaded guilty to trafficking in a much larger quantity of THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter, _ie_, **59.46 grams**. He was sentenced to 5½ years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, _ie_, close to the statutory minimum as well.

While there are no grounds of decision explaining these cases, their results do not appear to run counter to my earlier opinion that the ‘drug quantity’, which dictates the exact point on the scale at which sentence should be pegged, is not the weight of the vegetable matter (as suggested by the Prosecution).

#### First Proceeded Charge: Appropriate sentence

65     Given the element of illicit circulation in respect of the First Proceeded Charge, I regarded the sentencing approach in trafficking cases as being apposite. A trafficker’s sentence would have been heavily dependent on the drug quantity and would, in any event, have attracted an imprisonment term of no less than 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane (THJ-2201 being a Class A drug). While this statutory minimum is technically not applicable here, I thought that it was not irrelevant either, given the factual matrix of this case.

66     In terms of culpability, the Accused was as culpable as (if not more culpable than) a regular trafficker, for the following reasons:

> (a)     He was proposing to pass the drugs from one individual to another, thereby helping to shunt the drugs along the chain. This is a step removed from the facts of _Ramesh a/l Perumal_, where the accused person took on the relatively passive role of a bailee.

> (b)     If this had been a trafficking case, the Accused would not have been a mere courier, as he took the added step of drying the vegetable matter for Abang Kumar. Given the affidavit from HSA’s Laboratory Director deposing that the drying of vegetable matter (post-lacing) is a key step in manufacturing synthetic cannabis, I could not regard the Accused’s actions as passive or minor.

> (c)     He was going to be paid for handing the dried vegetable matter to Abang Kumar. An element of profit thus drove the illicit circulation by the Accused.

67     As regards the quantity of the vegetable matter, I have already explained above why I did not think it should constitute the yardstick for determining exactly where to insert the peg along the sentencing scale. Nonetheless, _from a broader perspective_, the sheer quantity of the vegetable matter in the present case still ought to have some bearing on the assessment of potential harm. The Prosecution explained that this case involves the largest haul of THJ-2201-laced vegetable matter ever brought to our courts.[^58] Even if the vegetable matter had turned out to be quite impotent (there being no evidence of its THJ-2201 concentration), one cannot ignore its potential reach, which would have been pervasive.

68     Given the above considerations, I was not prepared to peg the Accused’s sentence below the statutory minimum for trafficking. However, I decided that the sentence should not be elevated too far beyond that either, given the absence of evidence regarding the quantity of THJ-2201 involved and the potency of the vegetable matter relative to cannabis. In that regard, I gave the Accused the benefit of the doubt.

69     I thus sentenced the Accused to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, this being slightly above the minimum sentence that would have applied had the First Proceeded Charge been one of trafficking in THJ-2201. In arriving at this sentence, I had also factored in an uplift, to take account of the Accused’s drug antecedents.

#### Second Proceeded Charge

70     As regards the Second Proceeded Charge, this could technically also have been regarded as entailing an element of illicit circulation (going by the holding in _Ramesh a/l Perumal_), as the vegetable matter that was the subject of this charge was similarly meant to be passed to Abang Kumar. However:

> (a)     I note that the culpability factors relating to the First Proceeded Charge, set out at paragraph 65 above, are absent in respect of the Second Proceeded Charge.

> (b)     In terms of potential harm, the significantly lower quantum of vegetable matter meant that the extent of any circulation to third parties beyond Abang Kumar would necessarily be narrower (as compared to the First Proceeded Charge).

I thus imposed the minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the Second Proceeded Charge.

71     Given that the drug under the Second Proceeded Charge was

> (a)     of the same category as that under the First Proceeded Charge; and

> (b)     in the Accused’s possession at the same time as that for the First Proceeded Charge,

I ordered the imprisonment terms for both Proceeded Charges to run concurrently.

## Conclusion

72     I thus sentenced the Accused to a global imprisonment term of 5 years and 6 months.
