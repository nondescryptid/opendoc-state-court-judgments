Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Road Traffic Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9262/2021/01.\]

17 November 2021

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Wee Guo Cai, a 38 years-old male Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty on 2 November 2021 to the following charge:

1 st Charge

> are charged that you on 6 September 2021 at about 1.25 am along Pan Island Expressway towards Airport Boulevard (18km Lamp post 890) Singapore did drive a motor vehicle No SMY3198H at a speed of 154 kmph, such speed being in excess of the imposed speed limit of 80 kmph of the road and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 63(4) and punishable under Section 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

2       After carefully considering the accused’s oral plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $1,000 in default five days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of six months with effect from the date of conviction _ie_ 2 November 2021.

3       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence and order of disqualification on 15 November 2021. He has paid the fine of $1,000 and the disqualification order took effect from 2 November 2021 to 1 May 2022.

4       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

5       The accused admitted without qualification that on 6 September 2021 at about 1.25am along the Pan Island Expressway (“PIE”) towards Airport Boulevard Singapore, he had driven his motor car at a speed of 154 kmph in excess of the speed limit of 80 kmph for the said expressway.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

5       The prescribed penalty for a first offender for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. Pursuant to s 42(1) of the RTA, as the offence is in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, the Court may order the offender from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

### Antecedents

6       The accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

7       The Prosecution sought a fine of $1,000 with a disqualification from obtaining or driving all classes of vehicles for a period of six months.

### Mitigation

8       In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused asked for leniency as this was first speeding offence. According to him, he has to ferry his parents around and his father has difficulty walking. He would also have to bring them to see a doctor every few months.

### My decision on sentence

9       The usual sentence for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA for a first offender is typically a fine and an order of disqualification would ordinarily be imposed where the offender had driven at an excessive speed. Speeding offences involving a motor car are usually compoundable with demerit points imposed where the offender is found driving less than 40 km/h above the speed limit. Offenders like the accused, are required to attend court where they are found driving more than 40 km/h above the prescribed limit.

10     The relevant factors that the Court would consider in determining the appropriate sentence for speeding would include the following:

> (a)     Absolute speed;

> (b)     Location of the offence _eg_ built-up area, residential area, expressways;

> (c)     The prevailing traffic and/or weather condition;

> (d)     The manner in which the vehicle was driven;

> (e)     The type of motor vehicle;

> (f)     Whether there was serious risk to other road users;

> (g)     Whether there was an accident where injury or damage was caused.

11     In the present case the accused was found driving his motor car at 154 km/h along the PIE towards Airport Boulevard in the early hours of the morning. The speed limit of that portion of the expressway was 80 km/h. This was almost twice the prescribed speed limit. He was clearly driving his motor car at an excessive speed and had posed a serious risk not only to himself but also to other road users.

12     Although the offence was committed at 1:25am where there is usually less traffic along expressway, when driving at such an excessive speed he would have been less able to react and control the vehicle should there be an unexpected obstacle on the road. Survivors of a high-speed accident would often suffer serious injuries apart from the resulting serious property damage. Hence, general and specific deterrence are the relevant sentencing considerations when dealing with an offence of speeding. The sentence imposed must act as a form of deterrence to the accused from re-offending while at the same time deterring future like-minded potential offenders.

13     In the present case, although the accused was a first offender who had pleaded guilty to the charge, the fact that he had driven at such an excessive speed was an aggravating factor. Accordingly, I was of the view that the imposition of the maximum fine of $1,000 and disqualification order of six months for all classes of vehicles was appropriate in the circumstances.

14     A disqualification order for a period of six months for all classes of vehicle in the present case was a necessary punitive measure to prevent the accused from driving and endangering himself and other road users. At the same time, it would give him an opportunity to reflect on the consequences of his driving at an excessive speed before allowing him to drive again.
