Statutory interpretation – Construction of statute – Section 35 of the State Courts Act

5 July 2021

### District Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

## Introduction

1       A plaintiff has commenced an action in the Magistrate’s or District Courts. She then chooses to discontinue that action, and subsequently commences a fresh action based on the same cause of action. This is not an uncommon occurrence and is expressly allowed under O 21 r 4 of the Rules of Court (“ROC”) which provides as follows:

> **Effect of discontinuance (O. 21, r. 4)**

> **4**.    Subject to any terms imposed by the Court in granting leave under Rule 3, the fact that a party has discontinued or is deemed to have discontinued an action or counterclaim or withdrawn a particular claim made by him therein shall not be a defence to a subsequence action for the same, or substantially the same, cause of action.

2       In the recent case of _Arunachalam Balasubramanian v Lion City Rental Pte Ltd and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 33</span> (“_Arunachalam_”), the Deputy Registrar (“DR”) effectively held that the plaintiff in the scenario I have painted is _prohibited_ from commencing fresh proceedings on the same cause of action because doing so infringed s 35 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCA”), which provides as follows:

> **Division of causes of action**

> **35**.    A cause of action shall not be divided for the purpose of bringing 2 or more actions.

3       I had to decide whether I should follow _Arunachalam_ and prohibit the Plaintiff here from continuing with MC/MC 13078/2017 (the “Suit”).

## Background facts

4       On 18 November 2015, the Plaintiff commenced DC/DC 3479/2015 (“DC 3479/2015”) against Dino Media Asia Pte Ltd (the “1st Defendant”) and ID8 Pte Ltd (“ID8”) for injuries the Plaintiff suffered on 21 September 2014 whilst exiting a truck that was used as a mobile showroom for an event (the “Incident”). The 1st Defendant was at the material time the Plaintiff’s employer. ID8 had been engaged by the 1st Defendant to manage and run the event. The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants had breached the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WSHA”). On 21 July 2017, about 18 months after DC 3479/2015 was commenced, it was discontinued.

5       Very soon after, on 2 August 2017, the Plaintiff commenced the Suit, initially against the 1st Defendant and Aeroxcan Pte Ltd (the “2nd Defendant”), for the injuries she suffered arising out of the Incident. The 2nd Defendant was the owner of the truck. Aside from breaches of the WSHA, the Plaintiff also pleaded that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had breached the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MVA”).

6       Subsequently, the Plaintiff amended her claim to include Hung Ka Hang Thomas (the “3rd Defendant”) and Yap Chee Kiong (the “4th Defendant”), who were the directors of the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff says that the 3rd and 4th Defendants were personally liable as they failed to procure the necessary workmen compensation insurance for the 1st Defendant, in breach of the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WICA”).

7       Interlocutory judgment has been entered against the 1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants. Only the 2nd Defendant is left to contest the Suit.

8       The Suit was originally fixed for trial before me on 4 May 2021. After reviewing the papers, it appeared to me that there was a potential issue with s 35 of the SCA arising out of the interpretation of that provision in _Arunachalam_. In _Arunachalam_, the DR held that s 35 of the SCA was breached where the plaintiff had discontinued his action and then subsequently commenced a fresh action based on the same cause of action. The DR held that in such a situation the later action was “null and invalid from the onset”.

9       If _Arunachalam_ is correct, then the Suit cannot proceed (assuming the cause of action in DC 3479/2015 and the Suit was identical). As such, I asked the Registry to issue a correspondence to parties highlighting this potential issue and asking that parties address it.

10     When the parties appeared before me on 4 May 2021 for the trial, I was prepared to hear the evidence. I indicated that the s 35 issue could be dealt with in closing submissions after parties had given their evidence. However, Plaintiff’s Counsel Mr Mohamed Ibrahim informed me that because of certain new facts that had just come to his attention, he had instructions to amend the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim and therefore requested a vacation of the trial.

11     For the purposes of this decision, I need not go into the details of how the Plaintiff intends to amend her Statement of Claim. Whether any proposed amendment should be allowed would have to be decided at a later hearing, after the application is filed, the draft amended Statement of Claim is tendered, and the 2nd Defendant has had a fair opportunity to respond. Nevertheless, I was persuaded that it was in the interest of justice that the Plaintiff at least be given an opportunity to apply to amend her Statement of Claim. That would necessarily mean a vacation of the trial, even if I ultimately decided, after full arguments, that no amendment should be permitted.

12     However, that left the issue of s 35 of the SCA to be resolved. I initially took the view that after vacating the trial, parties could file whatever applications they deemed necessary – in the Plaintiff’s case it would be an amendment application and in the 2nd Defendant’s case it would be a striking out application on the basis that s 35 of the SCA had been infringed. However, on further consideration, I thought the better way to proceed was to decide the s 35 issue as a preliminary issue given that it could fully dispose of the Suit. If the Suit was struck out, then the parties did not have to incur time and costs dealing with the Plaintiff’s amendment application.

13     Therefore, I informed parties that whilst I would not be hearing any evidence, I would proceed to decide, as a preliminary issue, whether the Suit could not proceed because of s 35 of the SCA. Parties thereafter made oral submissions on 4 May 2021. I then gave parties leave to file written submissions if they thought it necessary. Both parties have done so.

## Parties’ positions

14     The Plaintiff argued that s 35 of the SCA was not breached, for the following reasons:

> (a)     There was no intention to split or divide the cause of action. Unlike the case of _Ng Kong Choon v Tang Wee Goh_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 935</span> (“_Ng Kong Choon_”) where multiple writs were filed and pursued to claim for different losses (namely, for uninsured loss, personal injury and cost of repairs) arising out of the same accident, there was only one writ at any one time and all claims were made in that writ.

> (b)     The cause of action in this Suit is not quite the same as the cause of action in DC 3479/2015. In DC 3479/2015, the claim was based on the negligence of the 1st Defendant and ID8 in complying with the WSHA. In the Suit, the claim is based on breaches of the WSHA as well as breaches of the MVA and WICA.

> (c)      _Arunachalam_ was wrongly decided. The mere fact that a claim had been discontinued, without more, cannot attract the operation of s 35 of the SCA. _Arunachalam_ is also inconsistent with the principles governing discontinuance of actions in O 21 r 4 of the ROC, which provides that the fact that an action has been discontinued is not a defence to a subsequent action for the same, or substantially the same, cause of action.

15     The 2nd Defendant argued that s 35 of the SCA was breached, for the following reasons:

> (a)     The claims in both DC 3479/2015 and the Suit arose from a single cause of action. The injury that underpinned the claims in the two actions were the same. The fact that the defendants in the two actions were not identical did not make a difference. Neither did the additional claim for breaches of the MVA or WICA change anything. That was simply a different legal characterisation of the same underlying facts.

> (b)     The discontinuance of DC 3479/2015 followed by the commencement of the Suit established the Plaintiff’s subjective intention to divide her single cause of action.

> (c)     O 21 r 4 of the ROC cannot affect the application of s 35 of the SCA. In any event, the ROC was in the nature of subsidiary legislation, and in so far as it was inconsistent with s 35 of the SCA, s 35 should prevail.

## Decision

16     I found that s 35 of the SCA was not breached because the Plaintiff never intended to divide her cause of action into two or more actions. I therefore resolved the preliminary issue in the Plaintiff’s favour.

## Analysis

### Ng Kong Choon

17     I start with a discussion of _Ng Kong Choon_, a decision of Belinda Ang J. That decision is binding on me and is in fact the only reported decision to-date on the scope of s 35 of the SCA.

18     In _Ng Kong Choon_, the plaintiff had filed multiple writs arising out of the same accident. There was first a writ filed for insurance excess and loss of use (also referred to as “uninsured loss”). Then a writ was filed for damages for personal injury. Finally, there was a writ filed for cost of repairs. The claims for uninsured loss and personal injury were resolved and notices of discontinuance were filed. The writ for cost of repairs was the last writ to be filed, and it was filed after the discontinuance of the two earlier actions.

19     The defendant argued that the writ for cost of repairs infringed s 35 of the SCA and filed a striking out application under O 18 r 19 of the ROC. Ang J considered the history of s 35 and similar provisions from other countries. Ang J came to the following conclusions on the scope of s 35:

> (a)     Section 35 of the SCA provides that a plaintiff with a single cause of action must bring forward all of his case in one action. He is not permitted to divide or split his cause of action by suing separately for different heads of damage.

> (b)     Section 35 of the SCA is a statutory prohibition that is allied to the limited jurisdiction of the State Courts and the management of cases within its jurisdiction. The test of claim-splitting is not determined by whether there is a prior judgment but whether the requirements of s 35 are satisfied.

> (c)     There are three elements to s 35 – the first relates to the existence of a cause of action, the second involves the word “divided”, and the third concerns the phrase “for the purpose of bringing 2 or more actions.”

> (d)     What is a single cause of action is a question of fact. On the facts of _Ng Kong Choon_, a case where an accident resulted in both personal injury and property damage, Ang J held that only one cause of action arose out of the tort even though that tort resulted in damage to both his person and his property. Consequently, all three claims (i.e., the claim for uninsured loss, the claim for damages for personal injury and the claim for the cost of repair) arose out of a single cause of action.

> (e)     The plaintiff in _Ng Kong Choon_ had _divided_ his cause of action by the issuance of the three writs, each for a different head of loss. His subjective intention in dividing his cause of action “for the purpose of bringing of 2 or more actions” was demonstrated by the same act of filing and serving multiple writs for different heads of loss. Ang J rejected the plaintiff’s argument that since the claim for cost of repair was commenced after the two earlier actions had been discontinued, s 35 of the SCA was not breached. This was because the plaintiff’s argument would involve interpreting the word “bringing” in s 35 to mean “bringing and maintaining”. There is nothing in s 35 of the SCA which suggests that it is only breached where there is more than one pending action.

### Arunachalam

20     In _Arunachalam_, the plaintiff claimed for damages for personal injury arising out of a motor accident. The matter had proceeded quite far along, with only the assessment of damages outstanding. At the assessment of damages hearing, the intervener argued that the action infringed s 35 of the SCA because the plaintiff had previously commenced another action on the same cause of action which he discontinued before filing the present action. The DR agreed that s 35 of the SCA was breached. Relying on _Ng Kong Choon_, he held that the fact that the earlier action had been discontinued did not prevent s 35 of the SCA from being breached. Although not explicitly stated, the DR effectively held that every time a party discontinued an action, he would be _prohibited_ from commencing any action based on the same cause of action. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that this is an unprecedented holding, especially as it contradicts the recognised principles on discontinuance of actions set out in O 21 r 4 of the ROC. I will discuss O 21 r 4 in more detail, but at this point I would simply observe that the DR in _Arunachalam_ did not discuss O 21 r 4 at all.

### The fact that an action had been discontinued is not sufficient to engage s 35 of the SCA

21     In _Ng Kong Choon_, the plaintiff had argued that because the earlier actions had been discontinued and were not pending at the time he filed the writ for the cost of repair, s 35 of the SCA was not breached. This argument was rejected. However, Ang J’s rejection of the plaintiff’s argument has to be seen in the context of the case, where there was a clear intention by the plaintiff to split his cause of action through the act of filing of multiple writs and claiming a different head of loss in each writ. But just because the act of discontinuing or resolving the other actions did not prevent the operation of s 35 in _Ng Kong Choon_, it does not follow that _every_ act of discontinuing an action would lead to a breach of s 35.

22     In my view, this is where the court in _Arunachalam_ made an error. The plaintiff in _Arunachalam_ was not in the same position as the plaintiff in _Ng Kong Choon_. The plaintiff did not commence multiple actions and claim for different losses in different actions, unlike the plaintiff in _Ng Kong Choon_. Rather, the plaintiff in _Arunachalam_ had discontinued an earlier action and commenced a fresh action based on the same cause of action. At all times, all of the plaintiff’s claims were made in one action, and one action only.

23     The plaintiff in _Arunachalam_ argued that s 35 of the SCA did not apply but this argument was rejected by the DR as being “misguided” (_Arunachalam_ at \[12\]-\[13\]):

> 12    The Plaintiff contends that the concern of multiplicity of proceedings does not arise given that the Plaintiff had discontinued the First Action before commencing the present action. In my judgment, this argument is misguided. It is plain from the provision that the filing of a separate action is enough to invoke the rule, so long as the separate action traverses the same facts. Nothing in the provision requires the first action to be pending. If Parliament had meant to confine the rule to operate against concurrent actions only, one would expect the following words in italics to appear in the provision:

>> A cause of action shall not be divided for the purposes of bringing _and maintaining_ 2 or more actions _concurrently_.

> 13    Indeed, the Court in _Ng Kong Choon_ had considered and rejected the same argument raised by the Plaintiff. There, the claimant argued that the rule applies only when there are proceedings in existence and that the claimant did not fall afoul of the rule since parties had settled and discontinued the prior action. Rejecting this argument and affirming the lower court’s decision to strike out the separate action, Justice Belinda Ang held that the claimant’s interpretation would entail reading the word “bringing” to mean “bringing and maintaining”, which is not how the provision is worded (at \[79\]-\[80\]):

>> 79    … \[The claimant’s\] interpretation would involve reading the word “bringing” in s 35 as meaning “bringing and maintaining”. As highlighted by \[the defendant\] before the District Judge, the word “maintaining” is nowhere to be found in the provision.

>> 80    In my view, there is nothing in the statutory language (express or implied) that supports \[the claimant’s\] interpretation of s 35. I agree with the District Judge that there is no statutory exception suffixed to s 35 stating, for example, that the provision does not apply when there was no other pending action. …

24     I have to part company with the DR on this point. It is true of course that s 35 does not say that another action must be pending in order for there to be a breach of s 35. Ang J has made that clear. However, in _Ng Kong Choon_, there was a clear intention to split the cause of action through the act of filing multiple actions where different heads of losses were claimed in each action and the fact that some of the actions were resolved before the final action was filed did not alter this intention. But where there was no splitting of the cause of action in the first place, where the plaintiff did not file multiple actions claiming different losses in each action, how can it be said that s 35 would apply? In my view, the DR had misread _Ng Kong Choon_, to stand for the proposition that _every_ discontinuance and subsequent filing of an action based on the same cause of action would attract the operation of s 35 of the SCA. I do not think _Ng Kong Choon_ stands for such a broad proposition.

### Policy reasons

25     In rejecting the plaintiff’s argument that s 35 of the SCA was not breached where the earlier proceedings had been discontinued, the DR in _Arunachalam_ said there were good policy reasons for doing so. He discusses this at \[14\] as follows:

> In my view, the Plaintiff’s position is also untenable from a policy standpoint, as it would have the effect of undermining the legislative objective of preventing claimants from unnecessarily vexing defendants with repeated actions. Taking the Plaintiff’s argument to its logical conclusion, it would mean that claimants can file multiple suits against the same defendant in quick succession, so long as they discontinue one suit before they file the next. I have no doubt that defendants confronted with such successive lawsuits would be unduly vexed, perhaps no less than one who is defending concurrent lawsuits. This would stymie the object of the statute and allow the targeted mischief to fester.

26     I have reservations with some of the statements made here. The first is that a plaintiff can file, discontinue and re-file the same proceedings repeatedly if he wants to. O 21 r 4 of the ROC expressly provides that a discontinuance is not a defence to a subsequent action for the same, or substantially the same, cause of action. I consider the concern of vexing defendants to be somewhat overstated in any event. Where the writ has not been served, there is no vexing of defendants to begin with. Surely a defendant cannot be vexed if the papers are not even served on him.

27     Furthermore, if the papers are indeed served on the defendant, and the proceedings are discontinued and refiled repeatedly, the plaintiff would be penalised with costs. Given the costs consequences, a plaintiff is not likely to do this unless it was necessary.

28     Finally, if the plaintiff is indeed repeatedly filing and discontinuing the action for no good reason except to oppress the defendant, the defendant may file a summons asking the court to prevent this abuse. The point is that there are tools in the court’s arsenal to control such vexatious proceedings. It cannot be said that if s 35 of the SCA does not apply to a situation where a party discontinues his action and then commences a fresh action based on the same cause of action, that the court would be powerless to stop any abuse arising.

### O 21 r 4 of the ROC

29     Another reason why I am unable to agree with the DR’s views in _Arunachalam_ is that if s 35 of the SCA applies to every action which is discontinued and then re-filed, it would contradict O 21 r 4 of the ROC. Although the ROC is a piece of subsidiary legislation, I would venture to say that O 21 r 4 is an important provision which gives something akin to substantive rights. It gives the plaintiff a positive right to discontinue and thereafter commence a new action based on the same cause of action (subject to any time bar issue). That it is more than just a rule of procedure, and akin to a substantive right, is suggested by _Woon Tek Seng and anor v V Jayaraman a/l V A Vellasamy and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 43</span> (“_Woon Tek Seng_”). There, certain proceedings had been auto-discontinued pursuant to O 21 r 2(6) of the ROC. Chan Seng Onn J held that the plaintiff had a right to commence a fresh action after proceedings were auto-discontinued, so long as there was no time bar, and that commencing a fresh action in those circumstances was not an abuse of process. He also held that in some situations, repeatedly allowing proceedings to be auto-discontinued and then filing fresh proceedings may amount to an abuse of process. He said this at \[40\]:

> As such, I cannot see how the bona fide use of an available process of recommencement for the first time after the deemed discontinuance is an abuse of process. Of course, if the plaintiff repeatedly allows the matter to be discontinued and repeatedly starts a fresh action each time without any good reason, I will be inclined to find that an abuse of the court process has taken place and strike out the fresh action on an O18 r 19 application by the defendant on the basis that the repeated litigation on the same subject matter was not brought bona fide for the legitimate purpose of accessing the courts to secure for himself an enforceable judgment on the basis of a valid claim, but for some ulterior or collateral purpose which is to unjustly harass, vex or oppress the defendant and to put him through unwarranted anxiety and expense. However, the present case before me is nowhere near the hypothetical factual scenario I painted.

30     I would make two points about _Woon Tek Seng_:

> (a)     First, the court recognised that a plaintiff whose action has been auto-discontinued has a _right_ to commence fresh proceedings, subject to any time bar.

> (b)     Second, the court can prevent the abuse of its court processes if a party continuously re-files fresh proceedings after they have been auto-discontinued. This supports my point above at \[28\] that the court has the tools to prevent abusive conduct arising from a party repeatedly filing fresh proceedings that have been discontinued solely to oppress or vex a defendant.

31     I would simply note that the DR in _Arunachalam_ did not consider O 21 r 4 at all. It may be that the provision was not bought to his attention. In my view, the DR’s holding in _Arunachalam_ directly contradicts O 21 r 4 and denudes it of any effect. In fact, I do not think the DR’s holding can be fairly reconciled with O 21 r 4 and _Woon Tek Seng_. If the DR is correct, it would mean that a party who allows his action to be auto-discontinued can file a fresh action (per _Woon Tek Seng_) but a party who voluntarily discontinues his action may not do so. There is no logic to this differing treatment. It also seems somewhat perverse to me. It rewards the dilatory plaintiff but penalises a plaintiff who is pro-active.

### My interpretation of s 35 of the SCA

32     In my view, a party who has discontinued an action and commences a fresh action based on the same cause of action is entitled to do so under O 21 r 4 of the ROC (subject of course to any time bar) and is not prohibited from doing so by s 35 of SCA. There is simply no intention to divide a cause of action by bringing 2 or more actions in those circumstances. Whether or not another action is pending does not provide an answer as to whether s 35 is infringed. The critical issue is whether the plaintiff intended to divide her cause of action into 2 or more actions. Where a party with a single cause of action files multiple actions and claims for different losses in each action, there is a clear intention to divide the cause of action. The fact that perhaps some of the actions may have been resolved or discontinued does not alter this intention. However, where a party files one action and claims for all her losses in that action, but subsequently discontinues that action and files a fresh action, there is simply no intention to divide her cause of action. At all times, all her claims were pursued in one action or another.

33     Applying this to the facts before me, I find that the Plaintiff never possessed any intention to divide her cause of action. The first action, DC 3479/2015, was discontinued after which this Suit was commenced. At all times, all of the Plaintiff’s claims were made in one action or another. The Plaintiff’s claims were never divided into two or more proceedings.

34     It follows then that there is no contradiction between s 35 and O 21 r 4.

35     I believe that my conclusion finds some indirect support in _Ng Kong Choon_. At \[82\] of the decision, Ang J says:

> For the sake of argument, if there are concurrent proceedings, s 35 could still operate to preclude the second action save that in such a situation the plaintiff would still have the chance to apply to the court to amend the first action in order to bring in the claim(s) of the second action. Objections to the second action on s 35 grounds could be raised at any time without having to wait until judgment on the first action. As stated, s 35 is not governed by or subject to the doctrine of _res judicata_.

36     In the above scenario, a plaintiff could file one action, and then another action subsequently, splitting his cause of action. He can salvage the situation by amending the first action to include the claims in the second action. Presumably the second action would then be discontinued, and the first action can proceed. If Ang J says that this situation is acceptable, why should the situation in the Suit be prohibited? Why should it matter that, instead of discontinuing the action and then commencing a fresh action, the Plaintiff does the reverse (i.e., he commences another action first and then discontinues one of the actions)? It seems to me illogical if one situation is allowed and the other is not.

37     That is enough for me to resolve the preliminary issue, in the Plaintiff’s favour. It is not necessary for me to decide whether the cause of action in the Suit is the same cause of action in DC 3479/2015. However, I will comment briefly given that parties had made full arguments on this point.

38     I consider that the cause of action in the Suit to be different from the cause of action in DC 3479/2015. In the Suit, there is a claim premised on the breach of WICA. That is a claim pursued against the two directors of the 1st Defendant. I considered that claim to be sufficiently different from the WSHA claim common to both actions. Whilst it is true that the damage or loss complained of is the same in both actions, I do not think that in every case where the damage is the same, the cause of action would be the same as well, no matter how the claim is characterised.

39     Finally, I should also mention that I disagree with the characterisation by the DR in _Arunachalam_ that an action commenced in breach of s 35 of the SCA is “null and invalid from the onset.” Respectfully, I am not sure what that means. Would it mean, for example, that any orders made in the action would be similarly null and invalid? If a cost order had been made and a party had made payment, can that party claw back what he paid on the basis that the costs order is null and invalid? In my view, I do not think an action commenced in breach of s 35 of the SCA can or should be characterised as being “null and invalid from the onset.” It is sufficient to say that such an action is legally unsustainable and can be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC. That is what happened in _Ng Kong Choon_.

## Conclusion

40     I therefore found that the commencement of the Suit did not infringe s 35 of the SCA because the Plaintiff had no intention to divide her cause of action into two or more actions. The Suit can therefore proceed.

41     Costs of the hearing of the preliminary issue is reserved to me, to be decided at the conclusion of the trial.
