Criminal Law – Offences – Hurt

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9263/2021/01.\]

15 December 2021

### District Judge Kevin Kwek:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Chen Song was originally charged with committing an offence of driving without reasonable consideration and causing grievous hurt to one Mr Muhammad Zamri Bin Rahman (the “**victim**”) under section 65(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“**RTA**”).

2       On condition of plea, the prosecution proceeded with a reduced charge of driving without reasonable consideration and causing hurt under section 65(4)(a) of the RTA.

3       The accused pleaded guilty on 15 November 2021. The prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of at least six weeks and a disqualification order of 18 months should be imposed. On the other hand, the defence argued that the custodial threshold had not been crossed and urged the court to impose a “high fine”[^1] and a disqualification order of no more than ten months.

4       After considering the parties’ submissions, I sentenced the accused to an imprisonment term of three weeks with effect from 15 November 2021 and disqualified the accused from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 16 months from the date of release.

5       The accused appealed the decision. The commencement of the imprisonment term and the disqualification order were stayed pending the appeal.

6       I set out my full grounds of decision below.

## Background

### The charge

7       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> You…are charged that you, on the 28th day of December 2020, at or about 10.40 a.m., along Seletar North Link towards the direction of Seletar West Link… did drive a motor vehicle, SMM1122C, on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, to wit, by failing to give way to traffic with the right of way when making a right turn at a non-signalised T-junction of a construction site along the said location and thus resulted in a collision with a motorcycle, FBR8884U, which was travelling straight from your opposite direction and had the right of way, and hurt was caused to one motorcycle rider \[_ie_, the victim\], Male, 35 years old… by such driving, you have thereby committed an offence under Section 65(1)(b) punishable under Section 65(4)(a) of the \[RTA\].

### Facts

8       The material portions of the Statement of Facts dated 15 November 2021 (“**SOF**”) are set out below:

> **Facts**

> On 28 December 2020, at or about 10.40 a.m., the accused was driving motor vehicle SMM1122C along Seletar North Link towards the direction of Seletar West Link on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, by failing to give way to traffic with the right of way when making a right turn at a non-signalised T-junction of a construction site along the said location and resulted in a collision with a motorcycle FBR8884U ridden by the victim who was travelling straight from the accused’s opposite direction and had the right of way, and hurt was caused to the victim.

> The accused admitted having seen the victim coming from a distance of about 200 metres to 300 metres away from the opposite direction before the accused made the right turn.

> **Injuries**

> As a result of the accident, the victim was conveyed conscious to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“**KTPH**”). The victim was warded on the same day of accident _ie_, 28 December 2020 and discharged on 11 January 2021 _ie_, 15 days. The victim received 46 days of hospitalisation leave from 28 December 2020 to 11 February 2021.

> The medical report of the victim from KTPH dated 24 February 2021 stated that the victim suffered the following injuries:

>> **1**)     **Mesenteric injury**

>> Computed tomography trauma angiogram on 28 December 2020 showed extensive mesenteric injury with arterial contrast extravasation in the right lower quadrant and haematoma along the entire mesenteric root, associated with moderate haemoperitoneum and small right retroperitoneal haematoma with no extravasation of contrast.

>> The victim underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy and haemostasis of bleeding mesentery, resection of small bowel, packing of the abdomen, and temporary abdominal closure on 28 December 2020, with intraoperative findings of large tear in ileal mesentery with active bleeding from two arterial branches and associated moderate haematoma, affecting about 30cm of the small bowel abutting IC valve distally, also a separate mesenteric contusion and small haematoma at zone I in lesser sac. The victim underwent relook laparotomy, washout and limited right hemicolectomy with primary closure of the abdomen on 30 December 2020.

>> The victim was monitored in the surgical intensive care unit post-operatively and was haemodynamically stable with no evidence of further intraperitoneal bleeding, with stable haemoglobin trend.

>> The victim’s post-operative recovery was complicated by:

>>> a)    Post-operative ileus

>>>> The victim had high nasogastric tube aspirates post-operatively as anticipated post blunt abdominal trauma with mesenteric injury requiring bowel resection, and was placed on parenteral nutrition and prokinetics. He was subsequently weaned to diet as tolerated.

>>> b)    Left-sided pneumonia

>>>> The victim had a febrile episode likely secondary to left-sided pneumonia. Chest X-rays on 31 December 2020 showed interval development of a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis of the left lower zone. He was placed on two litres of oxygen via nasal prongs, completed an inpatient course of intravenous antibiotics for pneumonia and participated with chest physiotherapy. He was subsequently afebrile and was weaned off oxygen support in the ward.

>>> c)    Surgical site wound infection

>>>> The victim was noted to have area of discharge and dehiscence of his midline wound on 5 January 2021 and was placed on negative pressure wound therapy on 6 January 2021 to aid wound closure. His wound healing was monitored outpatient with good recovery.

>> **2**)     **Right acromioclavicular joint dislocation**

>> X-rays of the victim’s right shoulder on 28 December 2020 showed mild widening of the right acromioclavicular joint. The victim was seen by the orthopaedic surgery team inpatient and placed in an arm sling. Interval X-rays of the right shoulder on 3 January 2021 showed dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint with the inferior border of the clavicle elevated beyond the superior border of the acromion.

>> He was reviewed by the orthopaedic surgery team subsequently and advised for interval surgical intervention. He was re-admitted for interval elective right acromioclavicular joint stabilisation after recovery from the injuries in (1).

>> **3**)     **Left wrist contusion**

>> The victim subsequently had left wrist pain during mobilization while he was recuperating from his injuries in (1). Interval X-rays of the scaphoid of the left wrist on 9 January 2021 showed no acute fracture or dislocation. He was reviewed by the orthopaedic surgery team and advised for conservative management with a hand splint.

>> He was subsequently reviewed outpatient and further magnetic resonance imaging of the left wrist was performed on 3 February 2021, which showed no fracture, a small tear of the triangular fibrocartilage, and bony contusions and soft tissue oedema likely related to trauma.

> **Condition of the victim’s motorcycle**

> The front portion of the motorcycle was totally ruptured.

> **Condition of the accused’s motor car**

> The top left portion of the front windscreen of the motor car was shattered. There were scratches to the left top portion. The front left passenger door had scratches, dents and was crumpled. The skirting of the said door was crumpled. The left side mirror was broken. The rear left portion of the motor car also had scratches and dents to it.

> **Prevailing Conditions**

> It was established that at the time of offence, the weather was clear, road surface was dry and the visibility was clear. The traffic flow was light at the time of accident.

9       The injuries sustained by the victim set out in the SOF were based on the medical report of KTPH dated 24 February 2021 (the “**Medical Report**”) which was undisputed.

10     However, prior to taking the accused’s plea, I brought the parties’ attention to certain medical terms that were used in the SOF and Medical Report, which, in my view, were rather technical _eg_, “laparotomy”, “ileal mesentery”. I was mindful that one of the court’s considerations in sentencing would be the severity of the injuries sustained by the victim. While this entailed parties submitting on the severity of the injuries based on the agreed facts, I wanted to ensure that such submissions were _not_ based on any misapprehension of what certain medical terms used in the SOF meant.[^2] This was of particular importance in this case given the parties’ diametrically opposite positions _ie_, the prosecution seeking at least six weeks’ imprisonment and the defence seeking a high fine.

11     In this regard, I queried the prosecution and defence on whether a further clarification medical report was necessary, or whether there was any agreement between the parties on what these medical terms meant. The matter was stood down for the parties to confer and for defence counsel to take his client’s instructions.

12     When the hearing was reconvened, the prosecution and defence informed the court that while the medical terms used in the SOF were “long and complicated”[^3], the parties did not require a further medical clarification report and that the parties had agreed on the meaning of the terms used in the SOF. The parties confirmed that they were prepared to proceed with the hearing on this basis.[^4]

13     The parties then informed the court of the medical terms used in the SOF (in **bold** below) and their agreement as to what these terms meant (in _italics_ below):

> (a)      **Mesenteric injury**: _injury to the fold of the membrane that attaches the intestine to the abdominal wall and holds it in place_;[^5]

> (b)      **Large tear in ileal mesentery**: _large tear at the lower part of the small intestine_;[^6]

> (c)      **Laparotomy**: _surgical incision into the abdominal cavity for diagnosis in preparation for surgery_;[^7]

> (d)      **Hemicolectomy:** _surgery for the removal of part of the large intestine_;[^8]

> (e)      **Resection**: _removal_.[^9]

14     Upon reaching the common landing above, the accused admitted to the offence and the SOF without qualification.

## Summary of the parties’ positions

15     Section 65(1) of the RTA encapsulates the primary offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. The subsequent subsections from (2) to (4) are the penalty prescribing provisions, each tiered according to whether death was caused; the degree of hurt caused and for subsection (5), for property damage caused and/or potential harm. The present offence under section 65(1) of the RTA was enacted on 1 November 2019, following the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 19 of 2019).

16     While there is currently no existing sentencing framework under section 65(4)(a) of the RTA, there are at least two decisions of the State Courts in relation to this provision that are pending appeal before the High Court – _Public Prosecutor v Dong Tao_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 126</span> (“**_Dong Tao_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Syed Qasim s/o Syed Nizam_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 157</span> (“**_Syed Qasim_**”). _Syed Qasim_ and the unreported cases cited in \[53\] of _Dong Tao_ were relied on by the parties as sentencing precedents and will be addressed below.

17     Both parties agreed that the harm caused to the victim and the culpability of the offender were relevant in arriving at the appropriate sentence. Indeed, it is uncontroversial that in sentencing an accused person for a road traffic offence, the sentencing court must consider the principles of harm caused by the offence and culpability of the offender: _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> at \[41\]. Thereafter, the court should consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in reaching the final sentence.

### The prosecution’s position

18     The prosecution submitted, and the defence agreed, that the culpability of the accused in this case was low as the accused had failed to give way to the victim who had the right of way when the accused was making a right turn at a non-signalised T-junction. The prosecution further highlighted that the victim, being a motorcyclist, was a vulnerable victim.

19     As for the harm sustained by the victim, both the prosecution and defence referred to the “functional definition” of the degree of harm adopted by the court in _Public Prosecutor v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen Richard Alexander_”) at \[110\].

20     The court in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ categorized the degree of harm into four categories - low, medium, serious and very serious:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="22.22%"> <col width="77.78%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of Harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Definition</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Minor Injury</u>: Conservative treatment with no or short hospitalisation and/or short medical leave period.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Typically involves minor fracture/dislocation and usually at less vulnerable parts of the body.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medium</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Moderate Injury</u>: Treatment includes minor surgical procedures with average/fair hospitalisation and medical leave period.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Typically, involves fracture/dislocation with no or no significant permanent impairment and may include fracture/dislocation at more vulnerable parts of the body.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Serious Injury</u>: Treatment includes significant surgical procedures with long hospitalisation (may include rehabilitation) and medical leave period.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Typically involves more complex fracture/dislocation (including open or multiple fractures) and/or serious damage to any member or part of the body and/or permanent disfiguration of the head or face.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Usually resulting in significant permanent impairment and/or inability to pursue daily living independently.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Very Serious</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Very Serious Injury:</u> Typically resulting in loss of limb, sight, hearing, member or life or other major bodily functions or paralysis. A person’s daily living is permanently and severely affected.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

21     The prosecution submitted that the harm sustained by the victim in this case fell within the “serious” category for the following reasons.[^10]

> (a)     The victim underwent major surgical procedures including having parts of his small bowel (_ie_, small intestine) and large intestine removed. The victim sustained “the loss of some form of his body parts internally”.[^11]

> (b)     The victim’s recovery was complicated by post-operative ileus, pneumonia and surgical site wound infection. This required the victim to be admitted to the surgical intensive care unit post-operation where he was placed on oxygen support.

> (c)     In total, the victim was granted 46 days of hospitalization leave from the date of the accident _ie_, 28 December 2020 to 11 February 2021. Within that period, the victim was warded in hospital for 15 days from 28 December 2020 to 11 January 2021.

> (d)     The victim also sustained a right acromioclavicular joint dislocation and was medically advised to undergo interval surgical intervention. The victim was subsequently re-admitted for interval elective right acromioclavicular joint stabilization after recovery from the mesenteric injury. To emphasize the severity of this injury, the prosecution submitted that the “dislocation of a bone” _in itself_ is designated as “grievous hurt” under section 230 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”).

> (e)     The “functional definition” of harm in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ was a case involving an accused facing a _grievous_ hurt charge under Section 65(3)(a) of the RTA. Given that the accused in the present case was facing a reduced charge of causing hurt _simplicitor_, the degree of harm sustained in this case had to be “recalibrated upwards”[^12] if the “functional definition” of harm in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ was being used as a reference. The prosecution submitted that on the facts, the proper classification of the harm caused was “serious”.

22     In view of the harm caused to the victim, the prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold had clearly been crossed in this case. For a “low culpability – serious harm” matter such as the present, the prosecution submitted that a one to two months’ imprisonment term and an 18 months’ disqualification order were warranted. Taking into account the accused’s plea of guilt and clean driving record, the prosecution submitted that a six weeks’ imprisonment term and an 18 months’ disqualification order were appropriate.

### The defence’s position

23     The defence agreed with the prosecution that the accused’s culpability was low.[^13]

24     The primary dispute was the harm sustained by the victim. The defence submitted that the harm caused to the victim fell within the “medium” spectrum of the “functional definition” set out in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ (refer to \[20\] above). While the defence recognised that the victim sustained extensive mesenteric injury with complications, right acromioclavicular joint dislocation and left wrist contusion,[^14] the defence highlighted the following.[^15]

> (a)     The victim’s “vital organs”[^16] were not injured.

> (b)     The victim did not suffer any fractures but a small tear of the triangular fibrocartilage and bony contusions.

> (c)     There were no permanent disabilities arising from the mesenteric injury.

> (d)     Like the prosecution, the defence also focused on the 46 days of hospitalisation leave granted to the victim. However, from the defence’s perspective, the victim’s “\[r\]ecovery was well and uneventful”.[^17]

25     For the reasons above, the defence submitted that the harm caused to the victim should be categorised as “medium” and that the custodial threshold had not been crossed. For a “low culpability – medium harm” matter such as the present, and taking into account the accused’s personal mitigating factors, the defence submitted that a high fine with no imprisonment term and a disqualification order of no more than ten months were appropriate.

## Prescribed Penalties

26     Under section 65(4)(a) of the RTA, an accused shall on conviction under section 65(1)(b) of the RTA be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,500, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

27     Pursuant to section 42(1) of the RTA, a court may order an accused on conviction to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

## Antecedents

28     The accused had a clean driving record.

## Decision

29     Having considered the facts of the case, I agreed with the prosecution that the custodial threshold had been crossed. However, I disagreed that a six weeks’ imprisonment term and an 18 months’ disqualification order were warranted on the present facts.

30     I imposed an imprisonment term of three weeks and a 16 months’ disqualification order with effect from the date of release. I elaborate on my decision below.

### Culpability

31     I agreed with the prosecution and defence that the accused’s culpability in this case was low. The accused failed to give way to the victim who had the right of way when the accused was making a right turn at a non-signalised T-junction. This was despite the accused having seen the victim coming from about 200 metres to 300 metres away. Apart from this, there were no additional culpability-enhancing factors (_eg_, speeding, drink-driving, sleepy driving, driving while using a mobile phone) that tipped the accused’s culpability above the “low” category.

32     While the prosecution and defence agreed that the culpability of the accused was low, I should address the prosecution’s submission that the victim, as a motorcyclist, was a vulnerable one. This point was made in passing during the prosecution’s oral submissions on the accused’s culpability.[^18] While it was not expanded on or disputed by the prosecution or defence respectively, for completeness, I should state that I did not view this as a culpability-enhancing or aggravating factor. In this regard, I am guided by _Public Prosecutor v Hue An Li_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span> at \[79\], where it was held that singling out vulnerable classes of victims could result in double-counting where the charge – as in the case here – has been framed by reference to the harm actually caused.

### Harm

33     As highlighted above, both the prosecution and defence had referred to the “functional definition” of harm set out in _Cullen Richard Alexander_ in their submissions on how the harm in this case should be categorised. I found this approach to be unobjectionable insofar as this functional definition was used as a _general reference_. However, I was mindful of the following.

> (a)      _Cullen Richard Alexander_ involved an accused facing a _grievous_ hurt charge under section 65(3)(a) of the RTA, and not a hurt _simplicitor_ charge under section 65(4)(a) of the RTA, as in the present case. While the “functional definition” has been relied on by parties in cases before the State Courts, it has, thus far, not been applied by the High Court in any section 65(3)(a) or section 65(4)(a) RTA cases.

> (b)      _Crucially_, and as emphasized by the High Court in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> at \[76\], indicative categories of harm (and culpability) are meant to assist analysis and assessed as a matter of _common sense_. Ultimately, the facts of each case have to be reviewed carefully as a whole, including the medical evidence on the physical injury or injuries sustained by the victim.

34     In this regard, having considered the SOF and the Medical Report, I was of the view that the harm caused to the victim fell within the “serious” category – albeit at the lower end of this spectrum. I elaborate.

35     First, according to the Medical Report, the accident on 28 December 2020 caused the victim to sustain _extensive_ mesenteric injury _ie_, extensive injury to the fold of the membrane that attaches the intestine to the abdominal wall and holds it in place. This was not a case where the victim was conservatively treated or had undergone a single surgical procedure. The present injuries resulted in surgical procedures having to be undertaken including the removal of parts of the victim’s small and big intestines. The victim was subsequently warded in the surgical intensive care unit.

> (a)     On the day of the accident, the victim underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy and haemostasis of the bleeding mesentery, resection of the small bowel, packing of the abdomen and temporary abdominal closure. It bears noting that part of this process entailed a laparotomy being undertaken _ie_, surgical incision made to the abdominal cavity of the victim in preparation for surgery. Subsequently, part of the victim’s small bowel (_ie_, small intestine) was removed. The findings indicated that the victim had sustained _a large tear at the lower part of the small intestine_ with active bleeding from two arterial branches.

> (b)     Two days later, on 30 December 2020, the victim underwent another laparotomy, washout and limited right hemicolectomy with primary closure of the abdomen. Part of the victim’s large intestine was removed as part of the limited right hemicolectomy. He was monitored in the surgical intensive care unit post-operatively.

36     Second, the victim’s recovery from the mesenteric injury was complicated by the following.

> (a)     The victim suffered from post-operative ileus _ie_, the obstruction of the intestine. A nasal tube was inserted into the victim (_ie_, “\[h\]e had high nasogastric tube aspirates \[post-operatively\]”[^19]) and he was placed on parenteral nutrition and prokinetics. This meant the victim had to take in his nutrients through other means other than from the mouth.

> (b)     The victim suffered from left sided pneumonia and was placed on oxygen support and a course of inpatient intravenous antibiotics.

> (c)     The victim sustained surgical site wound infection. He was noted to have an area of discharge and dehiscence (_ie_, splitting) of his midline wound on 5 January 2021. He was placed on negative pressure wound therapy on 6 January 2021 to aid wound closure.

37     Third, apart from the injuries mentioned above, the victim also sustained a right acromioclavicular joint dislocation from the accident. While I accepted that a dislocation may not be as severe as a fracture, the “dislocation of a bone” _in itself_ is designated as a form of “grievous hurt” under section 230 of the Penal Code. Classification aside, the injury was of sufficient severity for the KTPH orthopaedic surgery team to advise the victim to proceed with interval surgical intervention. The victim was re-admitted for interval elective right acromioclavicular joint stabilisation after recovery from the mesenteric injury.

38     Fourth, the victim sustained contusion on his left wrist. This was the least severe of his injuries and the victim was treated conservatively with a hand splint.

39     Fifth, the victim was granted 46 days of hospitalization leave from the date of the accident _ie_, 28 December 2020 to 11 February 2021. Within that period, the victim was warded in hospital for 15 days from 28 December 2020 to 11 January 2021. It was held in _Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> at \[26\] that the period of hospitalisation/medical leave is a relevant consideration insofar as it represents a medical professional’s opinion as to the length of time required for the treatment of the injuries and for the victim to resume his daily activities. In this regard, 46 days, while not protracted, is a fairly lengthy period, especially when compared to the shorter medical leave periods that were granted to the victims in the cases where the maximum fine was imposed by the court. These cases are addressed in \[46\] to \[54\] below.

40     The _objective_ medical evidence that I have set out in \[35\] to \[39\] led me to conclude that the harm sustained by the victim was “serious” and not “moderate” as submitted by the defence. I should add that in assessing the harm caused, I also considered the extensive damage caused to both vehicles - in particular - the victim’s motorcycle. In this regard, the impact of the collision caused the front portion of the victim’s motorcycle to be _totally ruptured_.[^20] It also caused the top left portion of the windscreen of the accused’s motor car to shatter and the crumpling of the passenger door.[^21] This was _not_ a minor accident.

41     The defence submitted that the harm should only be classified as “moderate” given that the victim did not suffer any injuries to his vital organs or sustain any permanent disability.[^22] I accepted that this was an important factor that the court had to take into account. However, I was of the view that this was not a pre-requisite to classifying an injury as “serious”, especially in the context of a hurt _simplicitor_ charge. Evidence of permanent disabilities was but _one of the factors_ which the court had to take into account in the overall holistic assessment of the harm caused. Having considered the _other_ factors set out in \[35\] to \[40\] above, I concluded that the harm caused in this case was serious. I set out a summary of these factors.

> (a)     The victim sustained extensive mesenteric injury. The findings indicated that the victim had sustained a large tear at the lower part of the small intestine with active bleeding from two arterial branches.

> (b)     Surgical procedures had to be undertaken including the removal of parts of the victim’s small and big intestines. The victim was subsequently warded in the surgical intensive care unit.

> (c)     The victim’s recovery from the mesenteric injury was complicated by post-operative ileus. A nasal tube was inserted into the victim and he was placed on parenteral nutrition and prokinetics. This meant the victim had to take in his nutrients through other means other than from the mouth.

> (d)     The victim suffered post-operative pneumonia and was placed on oxygen support and a course of inpatient intravenous antibiotics. The victim also sustained post-operative surgical site wound infection. He had to undergo negative pressure wound therapy on 6 January 2021 to aid wound closure.

> (e)     In addition, the victim was diagnosed with a right acromioclavicular joint dislocation and was advised to proceed with interval surgical intervention. The victim was re-admitted for interval elective right acromioclavicular joint stabilisation after recovery from the mesenteric injury.

> (f)     The victim sustained contusion to the left wrist and was treated conservatively with a hand splint.

> (g)     The victim was granted a fairly lengthy period of hospitalization leave _ie_, 46 days.

> (h)     Extensive damage was caused to both motor vehicles as a result of the accident.

42     Taking into account the accused’s culpability and the serious harm caused, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed. In addition to the objective evidence set out above, the section 65(4)(a) RTA cases relied on by the parties persuaded me that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

43      _Syed Qasim_ and the unreported cases of _Public Prosecutor v Yuan Haoran_ (“**_Yuan Haoran_**”)[^23] and _Public Prosecutor v Nor Sarah Binte Mohamad Noor_ (“**_Nor Sarah_**”)[^24] were relied on by the defence in support of the position that a fine would be appropriate on the present facts.

44     In these three cases, the court meted out the maximum fine of $2,500 (_ie_, _Yuan Haoran_ and _Nor Sarah_) or near-maximum fine of $2,300 (_ie_, _Syed Qasim_) with no imprisonment term imposed. All three cases were plead guilty cases with the accused persons being untraced.

45     In summary, I found these cases to be of limited assistance to the defence. In fact, these cases, in my view, reinforced the prosecution’s position that a custodial sentence was warranted on the present facts.

#### Yuan Haoran (SC-908395-2020)

46     In _Yuan Haoran_, the accused was driving a motor van and failed to give way to the victim’s motorcycle when he was driving out from Haw Par Villa carpark on to Pasir Panjang Road. The victim was travelling straight along the said road at the material time and had the right of way. As the accused’s van encroached into his path of travel, the victim skidded and fell off from his motorcycle. There was no contact between the accused’s van and the victim’s motorcycle.

47     The victim suffered multiple abrasions and contusions, as well as an occult rib fracture on the right sided chest wall. He was discharged from hospital on the same day and granted 14 days of medical leave.

48     The court imposed the maximum fine of $2,500 fine and a 10 months’ disqualification order in that case.

49     It is evident from \[47\] that the injuries suffered by the victim in _Yuan Haoran_ were much less severe than the victim in the present case. It was not apparent that the victim in _Yuan Haoran_ underwent any surgical procedures for the abrasions, contusion or rib fracture sustained. Notably, the victim was _discharged on the same day of the accident_ and granted a much shorter period of medical leave (_ie_, 14 days) than the present case.

#### Nor Sarah (SC-901389-2021)

50     In _Nor Sarah_, the accused failed to exercise care when making a right turn from the carpark entrance on to Jurong East Street 21 and encroached into the path of the victim’s motorcycle, which was travelling along Jurong East Street 21 from the accused’s right to left perspective. The accused’s car collided into the motorcycle.

51     The victim sustained the following injuries: (i) retrograde amnesia; (ii) lower lip laceration; (iii) chipped lower teeth; (iv) multiple abrasions; and (v) right medial knee laceration. The victim was warded for two days and given 28 days of hospitalisation leave. At the time of the accident, the accused did not possess a valid driving licence.

52     The court imposed the maximum fine of $2,500 fine and an 18 months’ disqualification order in _Nor Sarah_.

53     The lack of details in the case summary of _Nor Sarah_ placed some limitation on the utility of any comparison with the present case: _GCM v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1086</span> at \[75\]. In this regard, it should be highlighted that the injuries sustained by the victim in _Nor Sarah_ appeared to be quite different from the present case. Second, it was not clear from the case summary of _Nor Sarah_ on the _extent_ of the injuries sustained by the victim and whether any surgical procedures were undertaken.

54     What _was_ evident however was that the victim in _Nor Sarah_ was _warded for only 2 days_ and given _28 days of hospitalisation leave_. This is a markedly shorter recovery period than the present case where the victim was warded for 15 days and granted 46 days of hospitalisation leave.

#### Syed Qasim

55     In _Syed Qasim_, while turning out from a carpark, the accused, who was driving a motor car, collided into the victim who was a motorcyclist.

56     The victim sustained a left-hand injury (_ie_, a fracture on the fourth metacarpal bone and a fracture on the fifth metacarpal bone). I found the harm caused in that case to be on the higher end of the “medium” spectrum given the substantial number of days _ie_, 123 days of hospitalisation leave granted to the victim. I was however of the view that a custodial sentence was not warranted and that a near-maximum fine of $2,300 and disqualification period of 14 months was justified given the following:

> (a)     While the victim had sustained two fractures, they were located within close proximity _ie_, on the victim’s left hand and undue weight should not be placed on the number of fractures: _Syed Qasim_ at \[21\].

> (b)     The victim was treated conservatively with a cast and subsequently in a splint in an outpatient setting; no surgical procedures were necessary: _Syed Qasim_ at \[23\] and \[26\].

> (c)     There was no evidence of any permanent or significant disability: _Syed Qasim_ at \[26\].

57     It is clear from \[56\] that the injuries suffered by the victim in _Syed Qasim_ were less severe than the victim in the present case. While I was mindful that the victim in _Syed Qasim_ was given a much longer period of hospitalisation leave than the present victim, this is just one of the many factors that the court has to take into account. A _significant_ difference which makes the harm in the present case more severe than the harm sustained in _Syed Qasim_ is that the victim in this case sustained _several_ internal and external injuries and post-operative complications. In comparison, the victim in _Syed Qasim_ sustained a _localised_ injury _ie_, left hand, which was managed conservatively. Unlike the present case, the victim in _Syed Qasim_ did not undergo any surgical procedures for his injuries.

### Summary

58     The prosecution submitted that a “low culpability-serious harm” classification in this case warranted a custodial sentence of at least six weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification order of 18 months.

59     A maximum imprisonment term of 12 months may be imposed on the conviction of a section 65(4)(a) RTA offence. A custodial term approaching this maximum should be reserved for offences of the most egregious nature _ie_, high culpability-very serious harm. Given my finding that the accused’s culpability was _low_ and the harm caused to the victim was on the _lower end of the “serious” category_, I agreed with the prosecution that the custodial sentence imposed should be at the _lower end_ of the 12 months’ imprisonment term range. I would however add that the prosecution’s sentencing position of at least six weeks’ imprisonment required further calibration _downwards_ given that the victim did not sustain any permanent disabilities.

60     Similarly, a reduction of the disqualification order sought by the prosecution was also warranted. Having said that, I considered the defence’s submission of a disqualification period of no more than ten months to be inadequate after taking into account the harm caused in this case and compared to the cases cited in \[46\] to \[57\] above. I highlight that the imposition of an imprisonment term should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification than would otherwise have been ordered: _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ \[2013\] 3 SLR 1139 at \[13\].

### Mitigation

61     In calibrating the sentence downwards, I also took into account the personal mitigating factors raised by the defence in the written mitigation plea.[^25] In particular, I gave weight to the accused’s timeous plea of guilt (_ie_, the accused pleaded guilty at the fourth hearing) and that he was a first-time offender. The accused’s co-operation with the authorities and genuine remorse were also considered in the eventual sentence.

## Conclusion

62     In the circumstances, I imposed an imprisonment term of three weeks and disqualified the accused from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 16 months from the date of release.

63     The commencement of the imprisonment term and the disqualification order were stayed pending the appeal.
