\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9116/2021/01.\]

11 June 2021

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       The accused, a 34-year-old man, pleaded guilty to two charges. One charge was for committing mischief by punching and kicking the door of another person’s car and thereby causing to it damage to an amount exceeding $500, an offence under the version of s 427 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) in force at the time the accused committed those acts. I shall refer to this charge as the “mischief charge”. The other charge, which arose out of events distinct from those that gave rise to the mischief charge, was for intentionally causing alarm to another person by uttering abusive words, an offence under s 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (the “PHA”). I shall refer to this charge as the “PHA charge”. Taken into consideration was a third charge, also under s 3 of the PHA, for using abusive words with intent to cause harassment as he was committing his acts of mischief.

2       After convicting the accused on the two charges and hearing submissions on sentence from Deputy Public Prosecutor Ms Lim Ying Min and counsel for the accused Mr Hee Theng Fong, I imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for the mischief charge and a fine of $4,000, in default ten days’ imprisonment, for the PHA charge. The accused has filed an appeal against sentence and so I explain now in writing my reasons for imposing these sentences. The execution of the sentences has been stayed pending the appeal and the accused is presently on bail.

3       It might be useful to state at the outset that one key issue that came up in this case was whether the mischief charge belonged to the class of “road rage” offences that is well-established in sentencing jurisprudence such as to bring considerations of deterrence to the fore in the sentencing exercise. This issue arose because the accused had committed his acts of mischief in the course of driving on the road, and the genesis of those acts was a disagreement that the accused had had with the driver of the car to which he caused damage.

## Facts

4       The events giving rise to the mischief charge occurred on 30 June 2019. The car to which the accused caused damage was at the time driven by Tjia Kok Siang (“Mr Tjia”). I shall refer to this car as “Mr Tjia’s car” even though it seems from the charge sheet that the car’s registered owner was Mr Tjia’s wife.

5       In setting out the facts below I take the liberty of paraphrasing the statement of facts and supplementing its written contents with my observations from the videos annexed to it. Around 12.30pm on 30 June 2019 the accused was driving his car directly behind Mr Tjia’s car in the centre lane of a three-lane road in the Punggol area. Mr Tjia wished to move into the rightmost lane and started veering right without having switched on his right-turn signal. But the accused had barely a second ago completed his own switch from the centre lane and was driving in the rightmost lane, and the gap between the cars was narrowing because the accused was driving at a higher speed than Mr Tjia. By the time the accused’s car started to come alongside Mr Tjia’s car the latter had crossed slightly the dividing line between the centre and rightmost lanes. Instead of allowing Mr Tjia to complete his lane change, the accused accelerated forward and blocked Mr Tjia, preventing him from moving into the rightmost lane. Seeing this Mr Tjia stopped veering to the right.

6       Mr Tjia then accelerated and pointed his right middle finger at the accused as they drove side by side. Subsequently the accused accelerated ahead of Mr Tjia and then slowed down and came to a stop at the entrance to the single-lane slip road leading to the Tampines Expressway (“TPE”). With the accused’s car blocking the entrance to the TPE, Mr Tjia had no choice but to attempt to pass the accused by driving over the chevron markings to the left of the accused’s car. But the accused reacted by moving off from his stationary position and accelerating in order to foil Mr Tjia’s attempt to pass him.

7       All this meant that Mr Tjia was driving behind the accused’s car as they approached the point where the slip road joined the TPE. Mr Tjia moved right from the slip road to the leftmost lane of the TPE and drove past the accused, who was still travelling on the slip road at a lower speed than Mr Tjia. The accused was also gesturing out of the window of his car. Mr Tjia then moved into the centre lane of the TPE, which comprised three lanes at that location. The accused, by now driving in the leftmost lane of the TPE, abruptly swerved halfway into the centre lane in front of Mr Tjia’s car before swerving back into the leftmost lane. The accused once again gestured out of his window. Mr Tjia continued driving in the centre lane. Some time later the accused, by now driving in the rightmost lane of the TPE, accelerated past Mr Tjia’s car and suddenly moved into the centre lane ahead of Mr Tjia and stepped on the brakes to force Mr Tjia to slow down unnecessarily.

8       Thereafter, around 12.45pm, the accused and Mr Tjia stopped at a traffic light showing red at the junction of Lentor Avenue and Yio Chu Kang Road. Here the accused got out of his car and approached Mr Tjia’s car. Mr Tjia remained in his car. Standing beside Mr Tjia’s car the accused confronted Mr Tjia aggressively. He punched the driver’s window of Mr Tjia’s car and kicked its driver’s door. He uttered a vulgarity at Mr Tjia and challenged Mr Tjia to alight from his car. Mr Tjia informed the accused that he had children in his car, and Mr Tjia’s wife said that she was very scared. The following exchange then ensued between the accused and Mr Tjia.

| 

The accused:

 | 

“You point middle finger for fuck?”

 |
| 

Mr Tjia:

 | 

“Then you point for fuck?”

 |
| 

The accused:

 | 

“You got signal or not? Then you point middle finger for fuck?”

 |
| 

Mr Tjia:

 | 

“OK _la_, you are right _la_, I wrong _lor_, _wah_.”

 |

  
  

9       Thereafter the accused punched the driver’s window of Mr Tjia’s car once more and kicked its driver’s door twice. The punches and kicks that the accused inflicted on Mr Tjia’s car caused damage in the form of dents to the driver’s door. The cost of repairing the dents was $6,883.63. The accused has since paid Mr Tjia that amount in full.

10     As for the PHA charge, the events giving rise to it took place on 8 September 2020 in the carpark of the Riversails condominium development along Upper Serangoon Crescent. Around 5.50pm on this day Sabino Valentino (“Mr Valentino”) was walking in the middle of a one-way lane in the carpark. He stopped at the white line marking the end of the lane. The accused was driving his car in the carpark. Around the spot where Mr Valentino stood the accused attempted to turn into the one-way lane against the correct flow of traffic. Mr Valentino placed himself in front of the accused’s car to prevent him from entering the one-way lane from the wrong direction. The accused drove forward and tried once more to turn into the lane, but Mr Valentino moved to block the accused yet again.

11     The accused got out of his car and confronted Mr Valentino. He said to Mr Valentino, “Fuck off before I punch your fucking face…you go back to your country OK…you go fuck off to your country OK.” Mr Valentino was alarmed as a result.

12     For ease of reference I reproduce in full the mischief charge (MCN-900422-2020) followed by the PHA charge (MAC-910236-2020):

> You … are charged that you, on the 30th day of June 2019, at or about 12.20pm, at junction of Lentor Avenue and Yio Chu Kang Road, did commit mischief to the vehicle SFW2823L, to wit, by punching and kicking on the vehicle doors, causing damage to the said vehicle’s door amounting to S$6833.65/-, belonging to one Tang Kay Kay \[_ie_, Mr Tjia’s wife\], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 427 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> You … are charged that you, on the 8th of September 2020, at or about 5.50pm, at 20 Upper Serangoon \[Crescent\] Singapore 534026, did intentionally cause alarm to one Sabino Valentino, to wit, by uttering the abusive words “Fuck off before I punch yur fucking face…you go back to your country ok…you go and fuck off to your country ok”, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Revised Edition 2015, Chapter 256A.

## The mischief charge

### Whether this was a road-rage case attracting a deterrent sentencing policy

13     It is well-established that for “offences involving road rage violence” there is an “overriding policy imperative of deterrence”, such that the “primary sentencing consideration” for such offences is “both general and specific deterrence”: see the decision of Chan Seng Onn J in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span> (“_Lim Yee Hua_”) at \[2\]–\[3\]. Ms Lim characterised the mischief charge as falling within this category of “road rage violence” and on that basis submitted that with deterrence in mind the sentence should be at least three weeks’ imprisonment – the punishment prescribed for the offence of mischief under the version of s 427 of the Penal Code in force as at 30 June 2019 was imprisonment for a term of up to two years, or a fine, or both. Mr Hee strongly disputed Ms Lim’s characterisation. He submitted that this was not a case of “road rage” because the causative event that triggered the accused’s anger and led ultimately to his commission of mischief was Mr Tjia’s act of pointing the middle finger at him and not Mr Tjia’s driving. On this premise Mr Hee argued that a fine would suffice.

14     I thought myself bound to follow the “litmus test” that Chan J articulated in _Lim Yee Hua_ (at \[21\]) for determining “whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply for a particular offence of violence”, which is “whether the violence originates from differences arising through common road use” or in other words whether the violence was perpetrated “_specifically_ over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads”, meaning that if “the cause of the violence has _no nexus to the parties’ shared use of the roads_, the road rage deterrent sentencing policy should _not_ apply” (all emphases in original). Applying that test to this case, it seemed to me that the accused’s acts of mischief did in fact originate from a dispute with Mr Tjia arising from common road use. The accused targeted Mr Tjia’s car out of displeasure at Mr Tjia’s conduct as both of them were driving and sharing the road. He was unhappy that Mr Tjia had tried to change lanes without signalling his intention to do so, and became even unhappier when Mr Tjia pointed his middle finger. Assessed from a common-sense perspective I thought that the circumstances in which the accused committed the offence readily satisfied the test in _Lim Yee Hua_ and made this a case of road rage that warranted the “deterrent sentencing policy”.

15     Mr Hee’s submission placed great emphasis on the fact that Mr Tjia had shown his middle finger to the accused. I was prepared to accept that if Mr Tjia had not done so the accused might not have reacted the way he did and might not have committed his acts of mischief on Mr Tjia’s car. But in my view it did not follow that this was not a case of road rage. It is clear from _Lim Yee Hua_ that the expectation behind the “deterrent sentencing policy” for road-rage offences is that every road user should “exercise self-restraint, de-escalate conflict and amicably resolve their differences” even if they should encounter “provocation” such as “ungentlemanly conduct” or “bad driving” or “breach of road traffic rules” on the part of another road user, or “even serious traffic accidents caused by” another road user: none of this “justifies any act of causing hurt” or “any act of mischief causing damage” (at \[29\]). Mr Tjia was without question guilty at least of “ungentlemanly conduct”. But I thought that it would undermine the “deterrent sentencing policy” to permit the accused’s acts of mischief to escape the “road rage” label just because they were committed in response to “provocation” that had emanated from Mr Tjia, provided of course that these events could be traced to a dispute arising from shared use of the road. In that regard I thought there could be no doubt that the initial rancour between the accused and Mr Tjia stemmed from precisely such a dispute, in that they were mutually dissatisfied with each other’s driving – the accused was peeved at Mr Tjia’s failure to signal when attempting to change lanes, and Mr Tjia was not pleased that the accused prevented him from completing the lane change.

16     It seemed to me that Mr Hee’s submission required me to cast Mr Tjia’s act as the point where a dispute about road use ceased abruptly to possess that character and was transformed into a dispute about a vulgar gesture instead. I was not minded to do so. A dispute arising from shared use of the road does not invariably cause violence to erupt immediately. Events may instead develop and escalate in stages. The dispute might start out as a “trivial” or “minor” incident, to borrow adjectives used by Yong Pung How CJ in _Ong Hwee Leong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 458</span> at \[7\]. There might then be a heightening of emotions until one of the disputants reaches breaking point and resorts to violence. I thought it more consonant with this reality to view a given dispute over road use holistically as a single transaction from its possibly “trivial” or “minor” beginning to its violent culmination than to slice the transaction into fine segments and look at each segment in isolation. I was thus inclined to see Mr Tjia’s act of pointing the middle finger at the accused not as a separate originating event but as an instalment in and so an inextricable part of a continuous and escalating disagreement between them over common road use. I thought that the sort of approach advocated by Mr Hee was too intricate and would lead to overly complicated if not impossible exercises in line-drawing. Hence saying that the accused’s acts of mischief were caused by Mr Tjia’s impolite act or “ungentlemanly conduct” was in my opinion not at all incompatible with saying that they originated from “differences” between the accused and Mr Tjia “arising through common road use”.

17     Mr Hee relied heavily on Chan J’s treatment of the facts in _Lim Yee Hua_. In that case one of the charges on which the offender Lim was convicted was a charge of causing hurt to the victim Basil by punching him on the right side of his face (at \[4\]). As narrated at \[8\]–\[9\], Lim had driven his car through a zebra crossing without stopping to give way to Basil even though Basil was a pedestrian who had already taken a few steps into the crossing. Upset, Basil used his open palm to hit the top of Lim’s car. Basil continued to cross the zebra crossing and made his way up a flight of stairs towards a block of flats. Meanwhile Lim had pulled over at the side of the road immediately after having heard the thud on the roof of his car. He alighted from his car and chased after Basil and caught up with him near a lamp post at the foot of the block of flats, which was about 30m from the zebra crossing. There Lim and Basil “got involved in a heated verbal exchange”. Lim “shouted and hurled vulgarities at Basil, demanding to know why he had hit his car”, and then “grabbed Basil’s shirt and pushed Basil, causing him to lose his balance”. Shortly after Lim landed the punch on Basil that formed the subject-matter of the charge.

18     Chan J rejected (at \[51\]) the prosecution’s contention that this incident was “one involving road rage violence on the part of Lim”. In his view Lim had assaulted Basil “_only because Basil had hit the top of Lim’s car_” (emphasis in original), and Lim’s “rage” that motivated the punch on Basil “had nothing to do the traffic incident on the zebra crossing or any dispute over the traffic incident, but was merely in retaliation to what Basil had done to his car”. Chan J said that Basil was in fact the “road rage aggressor” because he was “technically the one who had escalated a minor traffic transgression into a physical act inflicted against the property of another road user” (at \[52\]).

19     Mr Hee argued that just as Chan J in _Lim Yee Hua_ had found Lim’s punch not to have involved “road rage violence” because it was retaliation not for any “traffic incident” but for “what Basil had done to his car”, so I should in this case find that the accused’s acts of mischief were not an instance of road rage because they were a reaction not to any road-related dispute but to Mr Tjia’s act of pointing the middle finger. But I thought that Chan J’s decision in _Lim Yee Hua_ could be confined to its own special facts and thus be distinguished. In that case Lim and Basil shared the road in an exceedingly fleeting manner. Lim would have driven through the zebra crossing within a few seconds. To confront Basil, Lim had in fact to alight from his car and move away from the road. The confrontation itself took place a not insubstantial distance of 30m from the road. So far as Lim was being taken to task for having done a physical act, it was Basil who had first committed a wrongful physical act, albeit one directed at an inanimate object rather than a human being.

20     It seemed to me that this unique combination of factors – the sheer brevity of the encounter on the road, the subsequent rapid removal of events from the road, and the fact that the act of the offender that constituted the offence had been prompted by an act of the victim of similar nature, that is a physical act of force – was what enabled Chan J to conclude that any “traffic incident” involving Lim and Basil would have been overtaken and superseded by Basil’s act of hitting the top of Lim’s car such that it was possible to say that Lim’s anger “had nothing to do with the traffic incident”. It was in a sense incidental that Basil’s act took place on the road – it would have been a morally equivalent situation had Lim’s rage been roused by Basil hitting his car while it was parked off the road. In that sense the mere location of Basil’s act did not suffice to make Lim’s violent response a case of road rage.

21     In this case, on the other hand, the accused and Mr Tjia shared the road for a far more substantial duration of at least ten to 15 minutes. The accused’s acts of mischief took place on the road while both his and Mr Tjia’s cars were stopped at a traffic light. And although it might be arguable that Mr Tjia had himself committed an offence under the PHA by pointing his middle finger at the accused, Mr Tjia had not committed any physical act of force against the accused or his car that could be described as a supervening event generating its own independent outcomes removed from the initial dispute over shared road use. Given these differences between this case and _Lim Yee Hua_ I was not persuaded that Chan J’s decision assisted the accused. On the contrary, adopting the negative corollary of Chan J’s “litmus test” I did not think I could say that the cause of the accused’s acts of mischief had “no nexus to the parties’ shared use of the roads” (_Lim Yee Hua_ at \[21\], emphasis omitted). Accordingly I held that the “deterrent sentencing policy underlying road rage violence” (_Lim Yee Hua_ at \[29\]) was applicable in this case.

### Harm and culpability

22     I accepted that following _Lim Yee Hua_ the “deterrent sentencing policy” does not “invariably” mean that “a custodial term must be imposed for _all_ offences involving road rage violence” (at \[45\], emphasis in original). In an appropriate case “a high fine could well be sufficient to function as a deterrent sentence” (at \[47\]). As District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee put it in _Public Prosecutor v Wang Jianliang_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 27</span> (“_Wang Jianliang_”), “the classification of a case as one of road rage should not trigger a knee-jerk reaction that mechanically kicks the custodial option up to the default position” (at \[30\]).

23     It seemed to me appropriate to assess the gravity of the mischief charge in this case using the “two principal parameters” of “_harm_ caused by the offence” and “_culpability_ of the offender” that Chan J considered in _Lim Yee Hua_ (at \[27\]). Although _Lim Yee Hua_ concerned a different offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a person, as Chan J observed the harm-and-culpability analysis is “not unique” to that offence and “has frequently been applied in a wide variety of offences” (also at \[27\]). I saw no reason why I should not also apply it to the offence of mischief.

24     As to the harm caused by the accused’s acts of mischief, on a scale ranging from low through moderate to high I would place it at the low end. While the monetary amount of damage caused to Mr Tjia’s car ($6,883.63) was significant, I gave this little weight because the accused made full restitution such that there was no permanent financial loss suffered by Mr Tjia or his wife. The harm directly occasioned by the accused’s acts would have consisted of distress and alarm on the part of Mr Tjia and his wife and their child, as well as temporary inconvenience to Mr Tjia or his wife due to the dent in the driver’s door and the need to get it repaired. I did not think this harm was serious. To the extent that the notion of harm encompasses also “collateral harm or damage caused to other persons or property” and “disruption or distress caused to the public”, as Chan J pointed out in _Lim Yee Hua_ (at \[27\]), I perceived no “collateral” harm at all, and even though it might be possible to speculate that the accused’s decision to leave his car to confront Mr Tjia when stopped at a junction might have caused a degree of disruption to the flow of traffic, there was no evidence that this was in any way substantial.

25     But as for the culpability of the accused I did not think I could regard it as being at the low end of the spectrum. There were two reasons for this. One was that the accused’s acts of mischief were sustained in nature and went well beyond a solitary kick or punch. It was apparent from the video footage that the acts of mischief comprised no fewer than five or six blows to Mr Tjia’s car and occurred over a span of not less than 20 seconds. This I thought a rather protracted assault.

26     The second reason was that the accused had chosen to prolong the initial road-related dispute with Mr Tjia despite having had ample opportunity to disengage. I accepted that Mr Tjia was himself not beyond reproach in his use of the road. Mr Tjia did not signal before seeking to change lanes and to that extent was inconsiderate in his driving. Mr Tjia also pointed his middle finger at the accused. This was needless provocation and it was not unreasonable for the accused to have become angry as a result. But I ascribed to this minimal mitigating weight. Given that the law expects all road users to “exercise self-restraint, de-escalate conflict and amicably resolve their differences when a conflict arising from the shared use of the roads arises” (_Lim Yee Hua_ at \[29\]), I thought it fair to expect the accused to put aside his anger and leave the incident behind and get on with life. Instead the accused maintained the spat. First he blocked Mr Tjia’s path to the TPE, and later while both their cars were on the TPE he gestured out of the window at Mr Tjia and twice cut into Mr Tjia’s lane from the front for no good reason. According to the statement of facts the initial dispute over Mr Tjia’s lane change and rude gesture took place around 12.30pm and the accused committed his acts of mischief around 12.45pm. Even allowing for the fact that these times might have been rounded off to the nearest five minutes, the accused had at least ten minutes in which to cool off. So far as the accused’s acts of mischief were an expression of his antipathy towards Mr Tjia the fact that he had harboured and fed this antipathy for all that time made his offence in my opinion more deserving of blame than if he had acted impulsively on the spur of the moment.

27     At the hearing before me a contest arose as to whether Mr Tjia had in fact pointed his middle finger at the accused twice or thrice more after the first time. Mr Hee said that his instructions from the accused were that Mr Tjia had done so. Ms Lim contended that the accused’s allegations were not borne out by the investigations. I did not think it necessary to resolve this dispute because it did not strike me as a material point. Even if I assumed in the accused’s favour that Mr Tjia had shown him the middle finger multiple times and had thereby persistently contributed to the raising of emotional temperatures, I thought this would diminish the accused’s culpability to a negligible degree only. This was because, as mentioned more than once above, each road user is expected to “exercise self-restraint” and “de-escalate conflict” whatever the “provocation” might be from another road user (_Lim Yee Hua_ at \[29\]). In view of the fact that the accused had had a substantial amount of time in which to calm himself down I did not think it mattered much to the assessment of his blameworthiness whether Mr Tjia’s “provocation” consisted of one vulgar act or several.

28     To the extent that the accused had driven in an unsafe manner prior to his acts of mischief – I thought that by cutting into Mr Tjia’s lane twice he performed manoeuvres that unnecessarily increased the risk of a collision between them – Mr Hee argued that in appraising culpability I should not take that into account because the accused had in fact already been penalised for it. After this matter emerged for the first time at the hearing Ms Lim was able to verify that the accused had in connection with the events in this case paid a sum of money to compound an offence under s 65(1)(_b_) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for driving without reasonable consideration for other road users. Ms Lim was unable at that time to confirm Mr Hee’s statements that the composition sum was $200 and that the accused had in addition been given six demerit points, but I did not think I needed those details. Given that Ms Lim appeared not to take a contrary position I was prepared to accept that I ought not to punish the accused twice for inconsiderate driving by treating it as a distinct factor that increased his culpability in respect of the mischief charge. But I did not think that this precluded me from giving weight to the accused’s role in prolonging his road-related dispute with Mr Tjia.

29     Therefore it appeared to me that while the mischief charge involved low harm the accused’s culpability was somewhere between the low and moderate levels. This assessment informed my consideration of the sentencing precedents placed before me.

### Sentencing precedents

30     There was no dearth of sentencing precedents involving offenders who caused damage to other persons’ motor vehicles and thereafter pleaded guilty to the same offence of mischief under the same version of s 427 of the Penal Code that governed this case. Ms Lim cited three precedents in which custodial terms of one week or two weeks were imposed. On the other hand Mr Hee relied on four precedents in which fines were meted out for the mischief offences.

31     In summary, I was satisfied on the basis of the prosecution’s precedents that to achieve consistency with past cases I should impose a short imprisonment term of not more than a few weeks’ duration. As for the precedents relied on by Mr Hee I took the view that they did not militate against imprisonment because in three out of four of them the acts of mischief were but one component of a broader set of events on the road that gave rise to at least one other charge for which a custodial sentence was imposed. This implied two related things. First, that imprisonment is not unwarranted on a global basis for wrongdoing on the road that involves causing damage to another person’s vehicle as well as causing hurt to another person or driving rashly such as to put others in danger, meaning that if a sequence of inconsiderate driving and causing damage to another person’s vehicle gives rise to a mischief charge only, imprisonment may yet be suitable for that charge. Second, in those precedents fines might have been thought adequate for the mischief offences given that custodial terms had already been imposed on another charge arising out of the same set of events. There was then a remaining precedent cited by Mr Hee that could not be explained on these grounds – this I regarded it as an outlier that need not be followed. I elaborate below.

32     I begin with the prosecution’s three precedents. Although these were all unreported precedents and there did not appear to be any written record of the sentencing courts’ reasons, I thought that the prosecution provided me with enough information on the facts and circumstances in those precedents to enable me to make meaningful comparisons with this case. I am obliged to set out those facts and circumstances at some length given that they are not the subject of any published decisions and so are not generally available.

33     In the prosecution’s first precedent _PP v Douglas Zeris_ SC-901122-2017 (24 October 2017) (Magistrate’s Court), the offender’s act of mischief consisted of throwing a water bottle at the windscreen of the victim’s car, causing a large crack to the windscreen and a dent to the bonnet. The damage was quantified at $3,780 and the offender made no restitution. The dispute over road use that led to the act of mischief started when the offender, who was driving a taxi, overtook the victim’s car and abruptly cut into the victim’s lane from the right such that the victim had to step hard on the brakes to avoid a collision. At the offender’s instigation both vehicles stopped along the road shoulder. The victim got out of his car and went over to the offender’s taxi and a verbal spat ensued. When the victim returned to his car the offender alighted from the taxi and followed him. On entering his car the victim closed the door when he saw the offender grabbing the handle of that door, and thereafter the offender attempted to grab the victim through the window but was thwarted because the victim managed to wind up the window in time. At this point the offender went back to his taxi and retrieved a water bottle and committed his act of mischief. He was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

34     In the prosecution’s second precedent _PP v Maslan bin Mansor_ SC-907863-2016 (15 August 2016) (Magistrate’s Court), the offender’s act of mischief consisted of giving a hard kick to the rear passenger door of the victim’s car and causing a big dent in it. This damage was quantified at $997.24 and the offender made no restitution. The dispute over road use leading to the act of mischief started as the offender rode his motorcycle alongside the victim’s car. As the victim moved into a filter lane towards Jalan Jurong Kechil the offender sounded his horn at the victim. Later, at the junction between Jalan Jurong Kechil and Toh Yi Drive, the offender hurled vulgarities and pointed his middle finger at the victim. When the victim wound down his front passenger window the offender stuck his hand through the window and pointed his middle finger in the victim’s face – this gave rise to a separate charge under the PHA. Thereafter the offender got off his motorcycle and committed his act of mischief. The offender had a criminal record but no related antecedents. He was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.

35     In the prosecution’s third precedent _PP v Muhammad Fazli bin Mustaffah_ SC-913658-2015 (11 July 2016) (Magistrate’s Court), the offender’s act of mischief consisted of punching the right-side mirror of the victim’s car, causing the mirror to dislodge with fragments falling to the ground. The damage was quantified at $959.52 but the offender made full restitution. The dispute over road use leading to the act of mischief started when the offender, who was also driving a car, overtook the victim and cut abruptly into the victim’s lane while they were both driving along Mountbatten Road, whereupon the victim sounded his horn at the offender. When both cars were stopped at a traffic light showing red further along Mountbatten Road, the offender alighted and confronted the victim aggressively and asked why the victim had sounded his horn. The victim wound his window down slightly and tried to reason with the offender, but the offender became more agitated and told the victim that he had just been released from jail and would not mind going back in. The offender then committed his act of mischief. I had no information about this offender’s criminal record but given the offender’s allusion to previous incarceration I assumed that the offender had a relevant antecedent that the sentencing court took into account – given incomplete information I thought I should err on the side of the accused in this case and it seemed more favourable to him to assume that the sentence imposed on the offender in this precedent was explicable in part by the existence of an antecedent. The offender was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

36     Using the harm-culpability analysis to compare this case before me with the prosecution’s three precedents, in terms of harm the fact that the monetary amount of damage caused in this case ($6,883.63) was markedly higher than in the precedents ($3,780, $997.24 and $959.52) was in my view negated by the fact that the accused in this case had made full restitution. Hence I thought not only that this case involved no greater harm than in the prosecution’s precedents but also that the harm in this case was slightly lower than in the two precedents in which the offender did not make any restitution to the victim. But as for culpability I thought that it was somewhat higher in this case than in the prosecution’s precedents. The accused’s acts of mischief were more drawn-out whereas in the precedents the offenders’ mischief had comprised one-off momentary acts of throwing a water bottle, kicking a door and punching a mirror. In pointing out this difference I do not mean to downplay the culpability of the offenders in the precedents given that their acts were preceded or accompanied by aggressive and intimidating behaviour, but equally there was such behaviour on the part of the accused in this case. Also, the accused had had more time than the offenders had in the precedents for dissipation of any anger arising from the initial dispute over road use. In all the prosecution’s precedents the location of the offenders’ acts of mischief was more or less the same road on which the initial disputes over road use took place, and so it may safely be inferred that the gap in time between the initial disputes and the acts of mischief was not large. The accused’s acts of mischief were thus less impulsive and more deliberate than the offenders’ acts in the precedents.

37     Given the similar or marginally lower harm but appreciably elevated culpability in this case relative to the prosecution’s three precedents, I considered that there was greater seriousness overall in the accused’s acts of mischief than in the offenders’ acts in the precedents. If sentences of one or two weeks’ imprisonment were thought proper in those precedents it seemed to me that a two- or three-week term of imprisonment was called for in this case even taking into account the accused’s lack of criminal history.

38     Turning to the four precedents relied on by Mr Hee in which fines were imposed for mischief offences, one of them was _Wang Jianliang_ (mentioned at \[22\] above). In that precedent the offender’s acts of mischief consisted of hitting the bonnet of the victim’s car “forcefully” four times, “thereby denting it”, and the cost of repairing the bonnet was $2,171 (at \[6\]). District Judge Tan held that the mischief offence “did not warrant an imprisonment term” and imposed a fine of $2,000 on the offender (at \[53\]), and although the prosecution did not take the position that this was “an act of road rage” he added that he would not have imposed a custodial sentence even if it was (at \[52\]). But I thought it pertinent that in this precedent the offender had driven in an unsafe manner shortly before he committed his acts of mischief, in that he had thrice “applied his brakes abruptly” while driving his car directly in front of the victim’s car, and on the third occasion the victim was unable to brake in time and collided with the offender’s car (at \[4\]). For this the offender pleaded guilty to a separate offence of acting so rashly as to endanger the personal safety of others. District Judge Tan held that this offence of rash driving was indeed one of road rage such that the “principle of deterrence” was “brought to the fore” (at \[28\]) and he imposed an imprisonment term of one week (at \[49\]). Given the closeness in time between the offender’s rash driving and his acts of mischief, I thought it proper to view his criminality holistically as approximately one transaction containing an element of road rage for which a global sentence of a short custodial term plus a fine was reasonable. That being so, given that in this case before me the accused’s criminality might similarly be regarded as roughly one transaction involving road rage spread out over ten to 15 minutes encompassing inconsiderate driving as well as acts of mischief, I thought that it would not be out of step with _Wang Jianliang_ to impose on the accused in this case a short term of imprisonment in addition to the financial detriment he had already sustained in paying the composition sum.

39     Another precedent that Mr Hee invoked was _Public Prosecutor v Ong Kok Leong and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 208</span>. The relevant offender, named Tay, committed an act of mischief by punching the front windscreen of the victim’s car and causing to it damage quantified at $560 – at this time s 427 of the Penal Code contemplated damage of or exceeding $25 rather than $500, but nothing turns on this. For this offence District Judge Loo Ngan Chor imposed a fine of $1,000. But soon after committing this act of mischief Tay punched the victim in the face and chest (at \[11\]), and this gave rise to a distinct offence of voluntarily causing hurt for which District Judge Loo sentenced Tay to two weeks’ imprisonment (at \[42\]). It is evident that the this offence of causing hurt was foremost in the minds of all parties because District Judge Loo observed that in respect of the mischief offence he “was not addressed at all on an appropriate sentence by either Tay’s counsel or the Prosecuting Officer” (at \[43\]). This signalled to me that even though Tay’s acts of punching the windscreen of the victim’s car and then the victim himself resulted in distinct offences they could be seen as constituting a unitary episode of “road rage” violence – that District Judge Loo thought the offence of causing hurt involved “road rage” is clear from the repeated references to that phrase (including at \[30\] and \[32\]). So seen the individual sentence for each offence would be less important than the total sentence for both offences, and the imposition of a fine for the mischief offence could be explained on the basis that Tay’s overall criminality across that episode of road-rage violence was sufficiently punished by the two-week custodial term handed down for the other offence such that there was no need for further incarceration on the mischief offence. Hence I thought that this precedent supported the principle that a short imprisonment term might be warranted for road-rage violence even where the harm caused is “minor” in nature and the violence is “unpremeditated” and “brief and unsustained” (at \[37\]) so that culpability is low. It seemed to me that it would not be inconsistent with that principle to impose a custodial sentence for the mischief charge in this case before me given that the road-rage violence perpetrated by the accused gave rise to that charge alone.

40     Yet another precedent that Mr Hee relied on was _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Chuan Lock Philip_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 45</span>. In this precedent the offender’s act of mischief comprised using a key to scratch the right rear portion of the victim’s car and causing to it damage quantified at $250 – again, at this time the monetary threshold in s 427 of the Penal Code was $25 not $500 but nothing turns on this. For this offence District Judge James Leong Kiu Yiu imposed a $3,000 fine. This act sparked off a somewhat bizarre chain of events in which the victim jumped onto the bonnet of the offender’s car to avoid being run over and held on as the offender continued driving. In an attempt to shake the victim off his car’s bonnet the offender “drove in a zig-zag manner” and “jerked” his car by accelerating and braking in rapid succession (at para 7 of the statement of facts reproduced at \[5\]). Driving on, the offender later collided with a stationary motorcycle when he swerved to the right, causing its rider to fall off. In consequence of these events the offender pleaded guilty to two other driving-related offences, one concerning his driving while the victim was clinging to his car’s bonnet and the other his collision with the motorcycle, and for these he was sentenced to eight and two weeks’ imprisonment respectively. Once more I thought that the imposition of a fine for the mischief offence could be explained on the basis that it was but one part of a wider chain of events that involved subsequent criminal behaviour of a more serious nature, and the imposition of custodial sentences for that subsequent behaviour meant that on a holistic treatment of the matter there was no insufficiency in imprisonment to make good when sentencing for the mischief offence. Therefore where as in this case before me the mischief charge was the sole charge proceeded on in respect of a sequence of wrongdoing on the road it would not be out of line with this precedent to impose a custodial term for the mischief charge.

41     The remaining precedent relied on by Mr Hee consisted of a CNA news report dated 28 December 2020 about the case of Kumaresan Krishnasamy headlined “Man fined S$8,000, banned from driving for a year after road rage against driver in Sengkang”. According to this report the offender “pleaded guilty to three charges of driving dangerously, using threatening behaviour and committing mischief”, with the charge of mischief having arisen out of his act of kicking the driver’s door of the victim’s car and leaving a dent in it. The report does not state the sentences meted out for each charge but it does say that the offender “was fined S$8,000 and given a year’s driving ban” and so there is no doubt that the charge of mischief did not attract any imprisonment even though the report suggests that this was thought to be a case of road rage. I accepted that if this precedent stood on its own it would pull in favour of a fine for the mischief charge in this case before me. But in the light of all the other precedents including those put forward by the prosecution I was minded to put it aside as an extraordinary case that was not representative of the usual sentencing outcomes for road-rage violence.

### The appropriate sentence for the mischief charge

42     Given that the accused’s acts of mischief involved road rage such as to make applicable the “deterrent sentencing policy” established in the authorities and his culpability in committing those acts was not low, and given the need for consistency with precedent, I was satisfied that the custodial threshold was crossed for the mischief charge. Although in two of the prosecution’s precedents one-week terms of imprisonment were considered adequate I thought that the mischief charge in this case merited something more than that because the accused’s culpability was higher than that of the offenders in the prosecution’s precedents. On the other hand I did not think it was necessary to adopt the prosecution’s submission of three weeks’ imprisonment. It seemed to me that two weeks’ imprisonment would suffice for purposes of deterrence.

## The PHA charge

43     The parties’ positions on the sentence for the PHA charge were not too far apart. They agreed that a fine would suffice but differed on the amount. The maximum fine was $5,000. Mr Hee submitted that $2,000 would do but Ms Lim argued that $4,500 would be right.

44     Mr Hee cited two precedents in which fines of $2,000 were imposed for offences under s 3 of the PHA. One of them, _Public Prosecutor v Lim Keng Tat_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 80</span>, was quite like this case in that the offender there hurled multiple vulgarities at the victim in the context of a disagreement that took place while the offender was driving in a carpark. But I agreed with Ms Lim’s contention that the fine in this case should be higher simply because the accused committed his offence under the PHA while he was under investigations in connection with the mischief charge. This demonstrated a failure to learn from his earlier brush with the law and I thought that a degree of specific deterrence was called for. Ms Lim’s proposed sum of $4,500 was based on two unreported precedents in which fines of $3,000 and $4,000 were meted out to offenders who had no relevant criminal history. There was in these precedents no written record of the sentencing courts’ reasons but the latter, _PP v Teo Tong Lee_ SC-905858-2017 (14 December 2017) (Magistrate’s Court), was likewise very similar to this case in that the offender and victim got into a carpark dispute that culminated in the offender uttering multiple vulgarities at the victim. Given that $4,000 was thought in that precedent to be appropriate for a first-time offender Ms Lim’s submission was not unreasonable, but it seemed a little too close to the maximum fine available for the offence given that the accused’s wrongdoing was not especially grave and so I reduced it slightly to a fine of $4,000.

## Conclusion

45     Adding up the sentences for the mischief charge and the PHA charge the total sentence imposed on the accused was two weeks’ imprisonment and a $4,000 fine. Taking a step back at the end I thought this was reasonable globally for the accused’s overall criminality, which was not high but for the most part came within the realm of road rage in which considerations of deterrence are particularly weighty.
