### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       This is a defamation claim brought by the plaintiff based on a letter of demand dated 1 April 2019 (“the Letter”) sent to him by the defendants’ former solicitors. The letter of demand set out certain inaccuracies in the minutes of meetings of the management council of a strata development and alleged that the plaintiff, as the chairman of the council, had acted in breach of the provisions of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (“BMSMA”).

## The parties

2       The parties were all members of the fifth management council (“5th MC”) of The Management Corporation Strata Plan No. 3959 (the “MCST”) of the industrial development known as Harvest @ Woodlands (the “Development”) situated at 280 Woodlands Industrial Park E5 Singapore 757322[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The Development consists of ten storeys with 470 units – 47 units on the first floor, 45 units on each of the second to eighth floors and 54 units on each of the ninth and tenth floors[^2].

3       The plaintiff had served as chairman of the MCST since its first management council was formed in April 2014. Together with the defendants and three others, the plaintiff had been elected to the management council at the MCST’s fifth annual general meeting (“AGM”) on 28 April 2018. Several of the defendants had been persuaded by the plaintiff to serve with him on the 5th MC.

4       At the first meeting of the 5th MC on 3 May 2018, the plaintiff was appointed the chairman. The first, second, third and fourth defendants were appointed to hold the offices of secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer and vice-chairman respectively. The second and third defendants resigned from the 5th MC in December 2018[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

5       The plaintiff describes himself as an entrepreneur with interests in multiple businesses.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) He owns several strata lots in the Development through some of his business entities. One of the plaintiff’s companies, of which he is the sole shareholder and director, is Starlite Vision Pte Ltd formerly known as Harvest Nutek Pte Ltd (“HNPL”). In November 2018, the plaintiff had caused the name of the company to be changed from HNPL to its present name to reflect that it was marketing the “Starlite Vision” brand of an enhanced digital closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) system[^5].

6       Each of the defendants is either a subsidiary proprietor, or a director and shareholder of companies which are subsidiary proprietors of different units in the Development.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Notably, while they were running various businesses, all the defendants had limited competency in the English language and, save for the fourth defendant, they all had to rely on a Mandarin interpreter to give their testimonies at the trial.

7       The plaintiff had served as chairman of the MCST since its first management council was formed in April 2014. He had continued to hold the office of chairman in successive terms. He was, however, not re-elected to the management council at the sixth AGM in April 2019.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

##    Chronology of events leading to the Letter

8       The subject matter of the dispute between the parties which led to the defendants engaging solicitors to send the Letter to the plaintiff is the installation of the Starlite Vision CCTV system on the MCST’s premises by the plaintiff’s company at a cost of $200,000.

9       It is common ground that a presentation of the features of the Starlite Vision CCTV system was given at the fifth meeting of the 5th MC held on 4 October 2018. What actually transpired during that meeting is in dispute.

10     According to the plaintiff, after the presentation, there was a general consensus for HNPL to proceed with the installation of the new CCTV system.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) The minutes of the meeting were drafted by one Lim See Moo, the MCST’s administrator (“PW1”), and approved by the plaintiff as chairman. PW1 had recorded that one Chew Tien Tien (_aka_ Chew Choon Tien), the MCST’s administrative-cum-accounts executive (“DW2”) “presented the budget for the following works/purchases”[^9]:

> 2.2 CCTV

> Present memory data is insufficient for 60 cameras for the present DVR.

> It was noted that there is a provision of S$120,000.00 from the Sinking Fund and S$80,000.00 form _(sic)_ the approval at the last AGM. The estimated cost for the CCTV system is S$150,000.00.

> The council approved balance of S$50,000.00 for Network System.

> At this juncture, Mr Charles Lim declared his interest under Section of the BMSMA that the company invited to present the proposal, M/s Harvest Nutek Pte Ltd, is under his directorship, and that he will not be involve _(sic)_ in any decision making.

> M/s Harvest Nutek Pre Ltd presented their proposal, Starlite Vision, on their latest technology, features and services to incorporate and complement the existing system.

11     Subsequently PW1, who was also responsible for the minutes of the sixth MC meeting held on 8 November 2018, recorded at paragraph 3.8 headed “CCTV” as follows[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10):

> Having gone through other systems and their costings, M/s Harvest Nutek Pte Ltd, was selected to carry out the installation of the Starlite Vision system.

> Mr Tuo presented the work progress of the installation of the video and features walls with 20 small boxes for advertisement for each video wall located at the lobby. Trunking works for L2 to L8 at Block 1 have been completed. The security room will have a 46” video wall. Design work is on at L1, L9 and L10.

12     According to the defendants, however, contrary to what was reflected in the minutes of the two meetings on 4 October 2018 and 8 November 2018, they had never approved the installation of the new CCTV system. Their account of what happened at the fifth council meeting on 4 October 2018 held at the MCST’s management office is as follows[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11):

> (a)     DW2 gave a presentation on the MCST’s accounts and proposed expenditure and mentioned a proposed spending of $200,000 for a new CCTV system.

> (b)     After DW2’s presentation, the plaintiff then invited one Tuo Jing Tao into the meeting room, and Tuo gave a presentation on the Starlite Vision CCTV system.

> (c)     There was no declaration by the plaintiff at any time of his directorship in the company marketing the Starlite Vision CCTV system or his interest in the Starlite Vision CCTV system.

13     All the defendants took the position that no decision had been taken at the MC meetings to spend on a new CCTV system. They disputed the minutes of the sixth MC meeting which recorded that there was a confirmation of the minutes of the fifth MC meeting of 4 October 2018. They were also insistent that there had been no discussion of inviting quotations and no decision had been made to purchase the Starlite Vision CCTV system[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) contrary to the record made by PW1 of the sixth MC meeting held on 8 November 2018

14     It was the first defendant who discovered the discrepancies in the minutes of the meetings and notified the other council members. She recounted that sometime in February 2019, DW2 had approached her to sign some cheques for the MCST’s expenditure. This was after the plaintiff had informed DW2 that he could not sign the cheques as Starlite Vision Pte Ltd was his company. The first defendant was surprised to hear that the MCST was making payment to the plaintiff’s company. After checking, she found out that the plaintiff was a director and the sole shareholder of Starlite Vision Pte Ltd, previously known as HNPL. It had changed its name to Starlite Vision Pte Ltd only on 7 November 2018, the day before the sixthMC meeting.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

15     The first defendant then obtained copies of the MC meeting minutes from DW2. The minutes had not been circulated to her previously even though she was the appointed secretary of the MC. She was surprised when she read the minutes of the fifth meeting as the plaintiff had not made any declaration of his directorship at that meeting.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

16     She was further surprised to read the minutes of the sixth meeting as she had not heard about any other CCTV systems and did not take part in any decision-making to appoint HNPL to carry out the installation of a CCTV system. It was also surprising that the minutes had referred to Tuo’s presentation on “work progress” since no such presentation had taken place. Even if the MC had appointed HNPL to carry out the works on that day as recorded in the minutes, it could not be that the works had already started before the appointment.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

17     On 9 March 2019, the first defendant informed the MC members through their Whatsapp group chat that they should stop allowing any of the council members to take on _ad hoc_ works for the MCST and requested that this matter be discussed at the next meeting. On 21 March 2019, the first defendant wrote to the group again to request a review of the last AGM’s documents. There was no reply to her requests.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

18     On 25 March 2019, the first defendant then took a photograph of paragraph 3.8 of the sixth MC meeting minutes and sent it to another Whatsapp group comprising PW1 and the MC members. Her accompanying message instructed PW1 to stop all CCTV works immediately as they had not seen any costings/quotations from other companies. She had also instructed the Development’s facilities manager, S Zainol bin Musthafa (DW3), to make sure that no contractor engage in CCTV works from the next day.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

19     The defendants met up after receiving the first defendant’s message of 25 March 2019. All of them confirmed that they had not heard the plaintiff declare his interest in HNPL and that they had not taken part in any decision to appoint HNPL to install a new CCTV system in the Development.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

20     The defendants then jointly approached the law firm of Subra TT Law LLC (“Subra Law”) for advice. When asked by the lawyers how the plaintiff could be reached, it was mentioned that the plaintiff as chairman had a room reserved for him in the MCST’s management office which he frequented. To ensure that he would receive the Letter, the defendants asked the lawyers to send it to the plaintiff’s personal email as well as to the MCST’s management office.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

21     As instructed by the defendants, the Letter from Subra Law stated _inter alia_ that the plaintiff did not declare his interest in HNPL, had made the decision to appoint HNPL to install CCTVs without the consent of the rest of the Council, had acted in breach of the BMSMA and demanded that the CCTV works be removed and HNPL not be paid.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

22     Subra Law sent the Letter to the plaintiff addressed to him as Chairman of the MCST at the management office by registered post, certificate of posting, fax and by email to his personal email account. The plaintiff claims that the fax copy was left on DW2’s desk in the management office which was visible to other employees of the MCST.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) He asserts that the Letter had been read by three persons namely Chew Tien Tien, S Zainol bin Musthafa, and Anthony Tan.[^22]

23     On 2 April 2019 upon receiving the Letter, the plaintiff sent his response by Whatsapp group to his fellow MC members stating that the allegations in the Letter were lies. He urged them to check their records and recollection as the matters were all minuted and requested that they come forward to make their position known if their instructions given to lawyers were wrong. As he had been threatened with legal action, he stated that he would be swift to act to protect his reputation and rights.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

## Plaintiff’s case

24     The plaintiff pleads that the following words in the Letter are defamatory of him (“the Words”):

> (a)     At \[3(b)\] of the Letter: “The statement in paragraph 2.2 of the 1st MOM \[defined as the Minutes of Meeting of the 5th Management Council of the MCST dated 4 October 2018\] in relation to the installation of CCTV cameras is untrue. It is stated therein that at the said meeting, you had declared your interest under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (‘BMSMA’), namely that you were a director of M/s Harvest Nutek Pte Ltd (now known as ‘Starlite Vision Pte Ltd’) (‘Nutek’), the company invited to present the proposal for the installation of the CCTV cameras, and that you were not involved in any decision making concerning the installation of more than 480 CCTV cameras in the estate.”

> (b)     At \[3(c)\] of the Letter: “Our clients were present at the said meeting and are clear that you did not make any declaration as stated in paragraph 2.2 of the 1st MOM. You did not seek to recuse yourself from the said meeting and the discussion on the installation of the CCTV cameras and that you made the decision to appoint Nutek to carry out the installation without the consent of the rest of the MC members.”

> (c)     At \[3(d)\] of the Letter: “The statement in paragraph 3.8 of the 2nd MOM \[defined as the Minutes of Meeting of the 5th Management Council of the MCST dated 8 November 2018\] is untrue. The statement that _‘having gone through other systems and their costings, M/s Harvest Nutek Pte Ltd was selected to carry out the installation’_ in (_sic_) untrue. No other vendors were invited to quote for the project. In fact, Nutek itself did not submit or quote and were in fact authorized by you to proceed with the installation without the consent of the other members of the MC.”

> (d)     At \[4\] of the Letter: “In the premises, it appears that you had acted in breach of the BMSMA, specifically ss. 60 and 61.”

25     In their natural and ordinary meaning, the Words meant and were understood to mean that:

> (a)     the plaintiff had abused his position as member and Chairman of the 5th Management Committee of the MCST by causing the MCST to engage HNPL (a company in which the plaintiff had an undisclosed interest) to install CCTV cameras in the Development without the consent or approval of the other members of the 5th Management Committee; and

> (b)     the plaintiff had committed offences under ss 60 and 61 of the BMSMA in failing to declare his interest in HNPL and failing to act honestly and use reasonable diligence at all times in the discharge of his office.

26     It was further pleaded that in the lead-up to the 6th AGM of the MCST scheduled for 30 April 2019, the defendants or one or more of them spoke and published the Words or words to the same or similar effect to subsidiary proprietors, tenants and/or occupiers in the Development. The Words were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication. In consequence, the plaintiff’s reputation has been seriously damaged, and he has suffered distress, embarrassment and hurt to his feelings.

27     The plaintiff claims aggravated damages due to the defendants’ refusal to apologise. He further asserts that they were reckless in the publication of the Letter/Words by reason of the following:

> (a)     The minutes of the fifth MC meeting on 4 October 2018 had reflected that the plaintiff did expressly disclose his interest in HNPL and did not participate in the decision-making in respect of the installation of the 480 CCTV cameras in the Development.

> (b)     At the 4 October 2018 meeting, the defendants had expressed support for the proposal presented by Tuo on behalf of HNPL for the installation of the CCTV cameras in the Development.

> (c)     The 5th MC (which included the defendants) did consider the prices of other systems and component parts.

> (d)     The installation of the CCTV system by HNPL was carried out openly, and at no time prior to the Letter did any of the defendants complain about or question the said installation or the decision for HNPL to carry out the said installation.

> (e)     In connection with HNPL’s installation of the CCTV cameras in the Development, the third defendant, through his company known as Hoyi System Pte Ltd, supplied and installed hanging boxes for the monitors and laminate panels for a consideration of S$8,560.00 (inclusive of GST) which HNPL paid on or about 4 December 2018.

> (f)     Prior to the Letter, none of the members of the 5th MC (including the defendants) had disputed the minutes of the 4 October 2018 meeting or the minutes of the meeting of the 8 November 2018 meeting. The minutes of the meetings had been confirmed by the 5th MC at their subsequent meetings on 8 November 2018 and 13 December 2018 respectively.

> (g)     The defendants had caused the Letter to be published because they were prompted by their own realisation that they had approved and/or were complicit in the approval of HNPL’s installation of CCTV cameras in the Development without the necessary procedural compliance of first obtaining quotations.

28     The timing of the publication on 1 April 2019 so close to the sixth AGM of the MCST on 30 April 2019 was part of a deliberate plan by the defendants to enhance their re-election prospects and/or to damage the plaintiff’s re-election prospects.

29     Further or alternatively, the first defendant had orchestrated the publication of the Letter out of a personal vendetta arising from an unrelated falling-out she had with the plaintiff in connection with the preparations for the Chinese New Year dinner of the MCST held on 22 February 2019.

## Defences

30     The defendants admit that they had instructed Subra Law to send the Letter but deny that the Words were defamatory. They also deny that there had been any publication of the Words.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

31     They deny the defamatory meanings pleaded by the plaintiff, and pleaded that in the context of a letter of demand sent by lawyers, the Words meant and/or were understood to mean that:

> (a)     the plaintiff did not comply with provisions under the BMSMA relating to disclosure of interests in proposed contracts; and

> (b)     the plaintiff decided on the appointment of HNPL for the installation of CCTV cameras in the Development without the consent of the rest of the Council members.

32     The defendants also contend that the Words were in any case true in substance and in fact, whether on the natural and ordinary meanings referred to in \[31\] above or as ascribed to them by the plaintiff. They rely on the following particulars:

> (a)     At the meeting of the Council on 4 October 2018, the plaintiff did not declare his interest in the MCST’s proposed contract with HNPL for the installation of CCTV cameras.

> (b)     The plaintiff had taken part in the discussion on the installation of CCTV cameras.

> (c)     The plaintiff had made a decision to appoint HNPL to carry out the installation of CCTV cameras without the consent of the rest of the Council members.

> (d)     The minutes of the meeting of the Council on 4 October 2018 were inaccurate in that they stated that the plaintiff had declared his interest in the MCST’s proposed contract with HNPL for the installation of CCTV cameras.

> (e)     The minutes were also inaccurate in that they stated that other systems and costings were considered for the installation of CCTV cameras.

> (f)     The installation of more than 480 CCTV cameras at the cost of $200,000 was unnecessary under the circumstances because at a meeting of the Council on 3 May 2018, only $60,000 was authorised for the enhancement of the CCTV system.

33     The defendants also sought to rely on defences of qualified privilege and fair comment on a matter of public interest:

34     On qualified privilege, they pleaded that:

> (a)     the defendants were at all material times subsidiary proprietors, directors / representatives of subsidiary proprietors of strata lots in the Development and/or members of the Council.

> (b)     The Letter was not published to anyone. However, even if it was, this publication was limited to employees of the MCST.

> (c)     The Words were in relation to affairs of the MCST, discussed at meetings of the Council, with such discussions being witnessed and minuted by employees of the MCST.

> (d)     In the circumstances, the defendants had a legitimate duty and/or interest to communicate the Words and/or the matters therein to the employees of the MCST, who had a legitimate interest to receive and/or be informed of the same.

> (e)     The Defendants and the employees of the MCST therefore had a common and corresponding interest in the subject-matter of the Words.

35     On the defence of fair comment, the defendants pleaded that in so far as the Words contained the comment that the plaintiff did not comply with provisions under the BMSMA relating to disclosure of interests in proposed contracts, they were fair comment on a matter of public interest, namely to ensure the MCST’s compliance with the relevant statutory provisions and regulations.

## Issues

36     From the submissions made by the parties, the issues that the court has to decide are:

> (a)     whether the defendants can be vicariously liable for Subra Law’s publication of the Words;

> (b)     whether there was publication of the Words to third parties;

> (c)     whether the Words complained of, in their natural and ordinary meaning, are defamatory of the plaintiff;

> (d)     whether the defendants can rely on the defence of justification;

> (e)     whether the defendants can rely on the defence of qualified privilege; and

> (f)     if the defendants are liable, what is the appropriate measure of damages that should be awarded to the plaintiff.

37     Although the plaintiff has addressed the pleaded defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest in his submissions, it appears to have been altogether abandoned in the defendants’ closing submissions. As such, there will be no necessity for the court to address the defence of fair comment in this judgment.

38     Additionally, the defendants had canvassed the argument that the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed for disclosing no substantial tort even if publication of the Words to third parties was proven. This issue will be addressed at the appropriate juncture in this judgment.

## Whether the defendants are vicariously liable for Subra Law’s publication of the Words

### Defendants’ case

39     Counsel for the defendants, Mr Chen, had in his closing submissions[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) (and also in the opening statement at the start of trial) identified as the first issue for decision whether the defendants could be vicariously liable for a publication that was made by their lawyers. It was highlighted to the court that it was Subra Law that had drafted and sent out the Letter containing the Words alleged to be defamatory. As such, the actual tortfeasors in the defamation claim must surely be Subra Law. In order for the defendants to be liable for the publication of the Words by Subra Law, the plaintiff would have to prove that the defendants are vicariously liable for Subra Law’s publication of the Words.

40     Relying on the principles expounded by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Huat Seng and another v Munib Mohammad Madni and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 58</span> (“_Ng Huat Seng_”) for determining when vicarious liability would be imposed, the defendants contend that they cannot be held vicariously liable for the tort committed by Subra Law. This is because the engagement of Subra Law has to be considered as that of an independent contractor. Just as how the house owners in _Ng Huat Seng_ had instructed a licensed contractor to undertake demolition works and entrusted such works to the contractor on the basis of its professional know-how, the defendants in this case had engaged qualified lawyers to provide legal services (including writing appropriate letters) and entrusted the provision of those legal services to the lawyers on the basis of their professional know-how in that sphere.

41     As such, it was argued that the responsibility for the publication, if any, lay with Subra Law. The defendants should not be held vicariously liable for Subra Law’s publication of the Words via the Letter, and the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed.

42     In further support for their submission as to why they cannot be held liable for the publication made by their lawyers, the defendants canvassed the following arguments:

> (a)     A solicitor-client relationship should not result in the client being vicariously liable for the actions of his solicitor, in particular because absolute privilege extends to solicitor-client communications on a subject matter for which the solicitor was retained. It would be antithetical to that principle if such communications lose their protection the moment they are relied on by the lawyer in the course of his engagement.

> (b)     In his attempt to attribute vicarious liability to the defendants, the plaintiff had pleaded (at ASOC \[5\]) that the Letter from Subra Law “_was dictated by the Defendants to or for transcription by their then solicitor_ …”. However, no evidence was adduced by the plaintiff to support this allegation which in any event was denied by the defendants. The plaintiff himself admitted under cross-examination that he had no way of knowing what had transpired between the defendants and their lawyers[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) and claimed that by ‘dictated’ he did not mean word-for-word dictation but rather ‘general instruction’ to the lawyer by the client to ‘do something’ for the client.[^27]

> (c)     The responsibility for a solicitor’s publication of material to third parties lies with the solicitor, even when the client expressly instructs the solicitor to publish the material to third parties. See the ruling made in _The Law Society of Singapore v Tan-Au Beng Carolyn_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGDSC 6</span>.

> (d)     The defendants cannot be regarded as having authorised or intended the republication of the defamatory Words by Subra Law as they cannot be said to be the originators of the Words. This is because the words in the Letter were written in the voice of the lawyer, and were not stated by the defendants to Subra Law. Given also their lack of proficiency in the English language and understanding of the BMSMA provisions, the defendants cannot be said to be the originators of the Words. Since there was no primary publication of the Words by the defendants to Subra Law, the plaintiff cannot rely on republication as the basis to impute liability on the defendants.

### Plaintiff’s case

43     Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Sarbjit Singh Chopra, submitted that the issue of vicarious liability was a red herring and should not even arise for the court’s consideration in this case as it had not been pleaded anywhere in the defendants’ Defence. Neither had it been raised in any of the defendants’ AEICs.

44     On the contrary, the entirety of the defendants’ case was premised on them having authorised Subra Law to send out the Letter as seen from the pleadings[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28). The defendants had in fact gone on to plead justification as a defence to the defamatory statements in the Letter as well as raise the defence of qualified privilege.

45     It was therefore highly prejudicial for the defendants to now raise the issue of vicarious liability as the plaintiff had relied on the defendants’ admission in their Defence to having authorised Subra Law to send the Letter and decided not to join Subra Law as a co-defendant.

46     Further, the issue of vicarious liability is completely irrelevant in the present case. Instead, the issue turns on whether the defendants could be liable for the republication of the defamatory statements. The following points were highlighted:

> (a)     The originator of a defamatory statement is liable for any subsequent publication as long as he intended for it to be published or failed to take reasonable care to prevent its publication, citing _Loh Siew Hock and others v Lang Chin Ngau_ \[20141 4 SLR 1117 and _The Law of Torts in Singapore, Gary Chan Kok Yew_ (2nd Ed, 2015) Academy Publishing – “a person who originated a defamatory statement with the intention of publishing it is liable for the defamatory publication.”

> (b)     As such, a letter of demand sent by a law firm, if authorised and procured to be published by the originator of the defamatory statement, may constitute publication of the defamatory statement. By going to Subra Law and requesting them to send the Letter to the MCST’s office, the defendants had thus authorised and clearly intended the publication of the Letter.

47     Furthermore, given that the defendants had admitted that they had in fact instructed and authorised Subra Law to draft and publish the Letter (as admitted in their Defence), the principles applicable are those of agency and not vicarious liability. Subra Law, who was at all material times acting on the defendants’ instructions when drafting and sending the Letter, were acting as the defendants’ agents for that specific purpose, and were authorised to do so. There is clear authority that a solicitor in starting an action is acting as his client’s agent.

48     It was further emphasised that the legal positions of an agent and an independent contractor are not mutually exclusive (see _Ong Han Ling and another v American International Assurance Co Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 549</span> at \[164\])_._ Just because a party is found to be an independent contractor of another does not prevent that party from being an agent. Applying this principle to the instant case, while Subra Law is an independent contractor (_ie_ not the defendants’ employee), this does not prevent them from being the agent of the defendants. The relationship of agent-principal was clearly present given that the defendants had by way of their instructions authorised Subra Law (as expressly admitted by the defendants) to draft, mail and fax the Letter. It was never once alleged whether in the Defence, AEICs or during cross-examination that Subra Law had acted outside of their authority. On that basis, the court must hold that Subra Law was acting as the defendants’ agent in drafting, mailing and faxing the Letter.

### My decision

49     It is trite that parties are bound by their pleadings. From the way the Defence was pleaded, I have to agree with the plaintiff that the defendants are precluded from raising vicarious liability as an issue. Looking at the plaintiff’s ASOC, he had pleaded the primary facts as follows:

> 4.    On or about 1 April 2019, the Defendants caused to be written and published the following words (the “Words”) contained in a typewritten letter dated 1 April 2019 from Subra TT Law LLC (the “Letter”), which are defamatory of the Plaintiff …”

> 5.    The Letter was dictated by the Defendants to or for transcription by their then solicitor …

> 6.    Further or alternatively, the Letter was drafted, engrossed, mailed and/or faxed by … and/or other employee(s) of Subra TT Law LLC (whom the Plaintiff cannot at present identify), on the instructions of the Defendants.

50     In response to ASOC \[4\], the defendants had pleaded at AD \[4\] and \[5\] as follows:

> “4.    Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim is admitted save that the Words in the Letter from Subra TT Law LLC, the then solicitors for the Defendants, were not defamatory of the Plaintiff.

> 5.    Save that the Defendants had instructed Subra TT Law LLC on this matter, paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim are denied.

51     From AD \[4\] and \[5\], there is a clear admission by the defendants that firstly, they had caused the Words to be published, and secondly, they had instructed Subra Law on the matter. Given these express admissions by the defendants, it is not open to them to argue that they cannot be liable for the acts of their then solicitors.

52     The law is also clear that the relationship between a solicitor and his client is that of an agent _vis-à-vis_ his principal[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). The solicitor acting on the client’s instructions binds the client and accordingly if there is a commission of a tort in the carrying out of the client’s instructions, the client would bear the liability as principal.

53     The defendants are in any case precluded by their own evidence from disavowing the acts of Subra Law whom they had jointly appointed to send the Letter to the plaintiff. As disclosed by the first defendant during her cross-examination, all seven defendants had turned up at Subra Law’s office and given instructions to issue the Letter[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30). The second defendant (“DW7”), despite not being conversant in English, had also admitted to giving instructions to Subra Law to send the Letter to the plaintiff[^31].

54     Notably, when clarification was sought from the defendants, they did not press the issue that they could not be found liable for the acts of their lawyers any further[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32).

55     The Letter itself explicitly stated that Subra Law had been instructed by the named seven defendants[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33), and none of them had disputed that they had authorised Subra Law to send the Letter. As such, while their counsel had strenuously argued that they ought not to be liable for the publication of the Words – whether on account of solicitor-client privilege, their lack of proficiency in the English language, or that the matters pertaining to the provisions of the BMSMA were not within the defendants’ knowledge – I have to agree with the plaintiff that it is the principles of the law of agency which apply in the present context and the defendants would be bound (as principals) by the acts of their appointed lawyers, Subra Law.

## Whether there was publication of the Words to third parties

56     As regards the fact of publication, the plaintiff had pleaded as follows:

> 7.    The Letter was then sent addressed to the Plaintiff at the management office of the MCST by registered mail, certificate of posting and fax without the same being marked private and confidential for the attention of the Plaintiff only. At all material times, the Defendants knew that the Letter was likely to be opened and read by an employee or employees of the management office of the MCST in the ordinary course of business, as it in fact was by Mr S Zainol Bin Musthafa, Ms Chew Tien Tien and Mr Anthony Tan.

57     The defendants deny there was any publication as pleaded on the basis that the Letter was addressed to the plaintiff and had been sent to him at the MCST’s management office where he had maintained a separate room as his office. They did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that the Letter was likely to be opened or read by persons other than the addressee. The contents of the Letter were in fact not read by the three named members of the MCST’s staff.

### Presumption of publication – whether rebutted

58     In the plaintiff’s reply, he pleaded that there was publication of the Letter on the basis of the set-up in the MCST’s management office which handles all correspondence sent to the MCST. He further pleaded that the registered mail and facsimile (fax) copies of the Letter were on Ms Chew’s desk when he went to the management office to collect the hard copies of the Letter several days after receiving the email from Subra Law. The hardcopy Letter had been stamped by Mr Zainol indicating the date of receipt by the management office.

59     In his closing submissions, the focus of the plaintiff’s case on publication shifted to the copy of the Letter which had been transmitted by fax to the MCST’s office number and received at 9.27am on 1 April 2019. The plaintiff submitted that because the fax was an open communication in that it was not marked “Private & Confidential”, there was a strong presumption of fact that the Letter had been published to third parties for the following reasons:

> (a)     the location of the fax machine in a visible and easily accessible area of the MCST’s management office;

> (a)     besides the MCST’s eight employees at the material time, various subsidiary proprietors and third-party vendors would also enter the management office from time to time;

> (b)     the MCST’s security guards and various Bangladeshi workers including but not limited to one “Firdaus” and “Rony” would occasionally enter the MCST’s management office; and

> (c)     there was a time lapse between the time in which the Letter was received by the fax machine, and the time in which it was passed to the plaintiff.

60     The plaintiff submitted further that far from rebutting the presumption, he had also shown that there was in fact publication from the evidence adduced during the cross-examination of the defendants’ witnesses, as outlined below:

> (a)      DW2:

>> DW2 confirmed that the Letter was left lying on the fax machine from 1 April 2019 at 9.27am until she picked it up on a date and time that she could not recall. Since the Letter was not marked “Private & Confidential”, DW2 would not have known that she should not be reading it until she saw the contents of the Letter. She handed the Letter to DW3 because she had read the defamatory statements in the Letter and understood that serious allegations were being raised against the plaintiff.

> (b)      DW3:

>> As the Letter was not marked “Private & Confidential” and appeared to be an office letter addressed to the MCST, it would not be apparent to anyone unless he/she had read its contents that the Letter was not intended to be read by anyone other than the plaintiff. DW3 had admitted that when he saw the Letter, he thought it was unusual because it not only came from a law firm but also related to the installation of the CCTV system in the Development. As the MCST’s then facilities manager, it was highly unlikely that he had not read the Letter in its entirety.

> (c)      DW4 and DW5:

>> It was also likely that the seven defendants had communicated the contents of the Letter to them when they met up to discuss the CCTV installation by HNPL and the absence of three quotations being called prior to the CCTV works being carried out.

### My finding

61     All parties were agreed that where the mode of communication is an open one, in this case the fax copy of the Letter from Subra Law to the MCST’s office, there is an inference or presumption that the allegedly defamatory words have been published to third parties, as outlined in _Chia on Defamation_, LexisNexis 2016, at paragraph 5.14 and the cases cited therein.

62     The plaintiff had, in particular, referred to the example given in the Malaysian case of _Matchplan (M) Sdn Bhd & Anor v William D Sinrich & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 MLJ 424</span> at \[22\] that where a fax message defamatory of _A_ is sent by _B_ to _A_ who works in a large office, with evidence to show that the fax machine is situated in a general area in _A_’s office, and that several employees have ready access to the machine, the court may presume that there was publication to one or more third parties. The Malaysian Court of Appeal had gone on to observe that:

> “(i)n such circumstances, the defendant may find it difficult, if not impossible, to show that there was no publication unless it can be shown that no one other _A_ himself read the document. It goes without saying that the presumption may be strong or weak according to the facts of each case.”

63     The defendants had objected to the plaintiff’s reliance on the presumption of publication on the basis that it was not pleaded. I dismiss this objection as I agree with the plaintiff that he had sufficiently pleaded the primary facts required to give rise to the presumption.

#### Defendants have rebutted the presumption

64     On my overall assessment of the evidence, I would, however, agree that the defendants have substantially rebutted the presumption. My reasons are as follows:

> (a)     It was disclosed that the MCST had eight employees at the material time, namely PW1, DW1, DW2, DW3, a Bangladeshi general worker by the name of Rony and three security guards[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34). DW1, DW2, DW3 who had been specifically identified as the persons who had read the Letter were called as witnesses by the defendants.

> (b)     DW1, Anthony Tan, testified in his AEIC that his work as a property officer requires him to inspect various parts of the premises. Hence, he was rarely at the MCST’s management office. While he was aware of the fax machine in the management office, he has never read any fax from the fax machine throughout his employment at the MCST as he does not help out with office work. He stated categorically that he did not read the Letter sent by fax to the management office. His evidence was accepted without any cross-examination. His evidence was also corroborated by DW2.

> (c)     DW2 testified that one of her duties was to collect documents faxed to the MCST via the MCST’s fax machine and preparing a response where appropriate.

>> (i)       Almost every fax received at the MCST’s fax machine was a request by lawyers under s 47 of the BMSMA, essentially for a certificate by the MCST certifying whether a subsidiary proprietor selling his unit in the Development was in arrears of his contributions. She would deal with such faxes by preparing a statement of accounts and issuing the requisite “Section 47 BMSMA Certificate”.

>> (ii)       When she saw the fax of the Letter in the fax machine, she noticed that it was not addressed to the MCST but to the plaintiff. She did not read any part of the fax except for the letterhead (of a law firm) and the name of the addressee (_ie_ the plaintiff) which was why she had passed the Letter on to DW3, her “superior”.

>> (iii)       She had agreed with plaintiff’s counsel when it was put to her that the reason she had handed the Letter to DW3 was because she had in fact read the Letter, became aware and was concerned at the serious allegations raised therein against the plaintiff[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35). I did not, however, regard this agreement as an unequivocal admission by DW2 that she had read and understood the meaning of the Words in the Letter.

>> (iv)       From my observation, DW2 is a junior employee with limited proficiency in the English language who was focused on carrying out her administrative tasks.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) She was not someone who would concern herself with matters that were not within her scope of duties, _eg_ she had not even read the minutes of meetings that PW1 had tasked her to circulate.[^37] Once she had noted that the Letter was not a s 47 BMSMA request and did not come within her purview, she immediately handed it over to her supervising officer, DW3, as can be seen from her evidence extracted below[^38]:

>>> Q    Yes. In fact, Ms. Chew, you---you know, I---I will show to the Court later that in fact, the date which you handed to Mr. Zainol was the 2nd April of 2019, can you recall that? Meaning---sorry. I’ll clarify. Meaning the date you saw the fax was the 2nd April and not the 1st.

>>> A    No, I don’t agree. For this fax, once again, I took it---I saw that the chairman’s---the Plaintiff’s name is on it, I directly passed it to Zainol. I recall very clearly that once it came in, I took it and then I passed to Zainol.

>>> …

>>> …    … what I’m sure was this was the only fax that was addressed to our chairman, so---and I was very clear that once I receive it, I saw the name there and then I passed it to Zainol.

>> (v)       When asked in re-examination to clarify what she understood by the “serious allegations” raised against the plaintiff in the Letter, she had no knowledge of the details, see below[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39):

>>> Q:    So, the question is just what---what do you mean by serious allegations against Mr. ‘Charles’ Lim?

>>> A:    I know it’s a kind of allegation, but I do not know what kind of allegation.

>>> Q:    Okay. It was also put to you that you read this letter and you were concern and therefore handed it to Mr. Zainol to deal with and you agreed. What do you mean---can you clarify what you mean---what you understand by “concern”?

>>> A:    Yah, for these facts[^40] I handed it over to my manager because it is not within my duty to deal with that. Therefore, I hand it to the manager. That is let---letter from the lawyer addressed to the chairman. I had no authority to interfere.

>> (vi)       I found DW2 to be an honest witness who had answered all questions put to her in a direct and forthright manner. There was no basis to doubt or reject her testimony. Accordingly, I find that DW2 had not read the Words in the fax copy of the Letter. She had, as she recounted, handed the Letter over to higher authority, namely DW3, to deal with upon seeing that it was a lawyer’s letter addressed to the plaintiff.

>> (vii)       DW2’s account of her handling of the fax Letter has also disproved the plaintiff’s assertion that the registered mail and fax copies of the Letter were on her desk when he went to the management office to collect the hard copies of the Letter several days after receiving the email from Subra Law.

> (d)     As for DW3, his testimony of how he had received the fax copy of the Letter tied in with the evidence given by DW2:

>> (i)       He was informed by DW2 that the Letter was addressed to the plaintiff but had been sent to the MCST’s fax machine.

>> (ii)       After checking that the Letter was addressed to the plaintiff, he read the title of the Letter and saw that it had something to do with the CCTV installation. He then put the Letter in his drawer with the intention of handing it over to the plaintiff the next time he came to the management office. He did not read any part of the Letter other than the letterhead, the addressee and the title of the Letter.

>> (iii)       When it was put to him that he must have read the fax Letter because he knew there was some concern relating to the CCTV cameras, he disagreed. He had placed the MCST’s stamp on the Letter at the plaintiff’s request[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41). This occurred when he was handing over the Letter. He was adamant that he had not read the full contents of the Letter, see extract below[^42]:

>>> Q    As I---as I say that, I only did not read the full context, but---yah

>>> …

>>> Q    So, just to---to pick up on this point, when you say you did not read the full context,---

>>> A    Yah.

>>> Q    Mr. Zainol, **_I’ll suggest to you that, in fact, you---you read the letter, maybe not in its entirety_**, but you understood that this letter was a personal letter to Mr. ‘Charles’ Lim only because you read the letter. Do you agree with me?

>>> A    I---you want me to tell me where, which part that I stopped, so that at least I can tell you that I stopped here? **_Because I’m being very truthful. Yah. Because I did not the whole--- read the whole context_**.

>>> …

>>> …

>>> Q    Right. So, you---you saw his letter, so you saw the top of the letter---

>>> A    Mmm hmm.

>>> Q    from a law firm, you saw---

>>> A     **_The installation of CCTV cameras_**,---

>>> Q    Yes,---

>>> A    uh, how was \[inaudible\], ah, **_this is_**\---

>>> Q    that’s right.

>>> A     **_where I stopped_**.

>>> Q    Okay. Now, I would say to you that **_you didn’t stop there, and the reason why_** I say that is because you get an answer that you first believed that this letter was an official letter to the MCST, but then in your affidavit, you---you said that---I believe you said that---that this was personal letter to the chairman, but **_to come to that conclusion that this is a personal letter, you would only know that if you read the letter_**?

>>> A     **_No, I won’t agree to that_**. …

>>> …

>>> …

>>> Q    … what I am putting to you is this, ..

>>> .. on the 2nd of April by Ms. Chew. At that time when you received this fax, you saw that it was a letter from the law firm addressed to mister---to the chairman relating to CCTV cameras, and you knew that there was concern. And then **_you read the letter, and then you realised it is a letter for the personal attention of Mr. ‘Charles’ Lim_**. And that is the reason why you say you have had a read of this letter.

>>> A     **_No, Sir_**.

>>> Q    Okay. So, you disagree with that?

>>> A     **_I disagree, Sir_**.

>>> …

>>> …

>>> Q    … You already knew there were problems, and therefore for you to know that this letter was meant for Mr. ‘Charles’---

>>> A    Yah.

>>> Q    personally, would have meant that you would have read the letter. But you---you can agree or disagree

>>> A    Yes, read but only to certain point. **_I’ll agree with you, I read, but only to a certain point._**

>>> Q    Yes.

>>> A     **_I did not read the full context on everything_**.

>>> Q    Yes, but I’m putting to you---

>>> A    Yah.

>>> Q    that you did read the full context.

>>> A     **_Full context, is it_**?

>>> Q    Yes.

>>> A     **_No, I didn’t_**.

(emphasis in **_bold italics_** mine)

>> (iv)       From my observation, DW3 was also a forthright witness. He was adamant that he had not read the entirety of the Letter in his testimony even after repeated questioning by counsel for the plaintiff as outlined above.

>> (v)       Since DW3 was no longer an employee of the MCST at the time of his testimony in court (and had in fact been subpoenaed to compel his attendance), there is no basis to disbelieve his evidence. Accordingly, I find that DW3 had only read the top portion of the Letter up to subject heading and had not read the full contents of the Letter including the Words complained of as defamatory at paragraphs 3(b), (c) and 4.

>> (vi)       Further, while DW3 could not be definite about the date when he had handed over the fax and mailed copies of the Letter to the plaintiff, he was able to recount quite clearly that it was the same day that the postman delivered the mailed copy to the MCST office.

>> (vii)       Given that the Certificate of Posting stamp on the envelope[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) indicated that the Letter was mailed on 1 April 2019, which was a Monday, it seems more likely than not that the posted Letter would have been delivered on the next working day, _ie_ 2 April 2019. Also, as the fax copy was received at the MCST’s fax machine at 9.27am on 1 April 2019, it is more likely than not that DW2 had picked up the fax Letter on the morning it was received (it being a Monday morning) or sometime on the same day and handed it over to DW3 as she recounted. While the fingerprint records did not capture the plaintiff’s access to the management office on 2 April 2019 but only on 3 April 2019, DW3 had explained that it was quite usual for the MCST staff to open the door for the Chairman and on such occasions his fingerprint would not be captured in the system. While DW3 had agreed with counsel for the plaintiff that based on the fingerprint record, he must have handed over the copies of the Letter to the plaintiff only on 3 April 2019, from the overall tenor of the evidence given by DW2 and DW3, I find it more probable that the handing over took place on 2 April 2019, and that DW2 had in turn handed the fax copy of the Letter to DW3 on 1 April 2019, the date it was received.

> (e)     As to whether the fax copy of the Letter could have been read by the remaining four employees of the MCST, namely the Bangladeshi handyman, one Rony Fidaus, and the three security guards, for the duration that it remained uncollected by DW2 on the fax machine, I find this to be a most unlikely scenario. As explained by DW3, while these workers were able to have access to the main office by their fingerprint, they generally frequented only the backyard portion of the office which is separated from the main office by an exit door which is kept locked. Since the plaintiff had only named DW1, DW2 and DW3 as the employees of the MCST who could have read the Letter in the ordinary course of business, I did not think it was incumbent on the defendants to also have called the remaining four employees in order to rebut the presumption of publication. It would be most far-fetched, in my view, for any of the MCST’s security guards or the Bangladeshi handyman to have entered the main office between 9.27am on Monday 1 April 2019 up to the time the fax Letter was collected by DW2, picked up the fax Letter from the fax machine, perused its contents and understood the Words as defamatory of the plaintiff.

> (f)     Given the physical set-up of the management office, where interaction with subsidiary proprietors was carried out through a glass partition, it is again most unlikely that any other third party would have entered the management office and read the fax Letter for the duration that it remained uncollected by DW2 on the fax machine.

65     Finally, the plaintiff had submitted that the Letter had also been published to Rodney Chiang (“DW4”) and Ng Wee Kien (“DW5”), the two subsidiary proprietors (and present MC members) who had met and questioned the defendants on the CCTV installation. I am unable to agree. Based on the evidence adduced, all that can be elicited is that the defendants had told DW4 and DW5 that they had not seen any three quotes for the CCTV system. The genesis of DW4’s query was the minutes of the fifth and sixth MC meetings which DW4 had read on the notice board of the Development after noticing cabling works being carried out by the MCST’s Bangladeshi handyman.

66     At the meeting that the seven defendants had with DW4 and DW5, the focus of the discussion was the absence of three quotations being procured before the CCTV installation works were awarded to the plaintiff’s company. While there was mention of a lawyer’s letter having been sent to the plaintiff, there was no evidence adduced that the Letter had been shown to DW4 and/or DW5 at the meeting.

67     It also appears that the meeting likely took place before the Letter was sent. From DW4’s testimony, it could have been in December 2018[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44). DW5 indicated that it was in late 2018 or early 2019[^45]. DW6 had placed the meeting as occurring in early March 2019 [^46]. DW7 stated that the meeting was sometime in early April 2019[^47]. DW8 had no recollection as to when the meeting took place[^48]. DW9 vaguely recalled that it was after the Chinese New Year[^49]. As for DW10, he could not recall when the meeting took place[^50] and was not pressed further as to the content of the meeting. DW11 was not specifically questioned on when the meeting had taken place. However, from the tenor of the cross-examination, the position taken by the plaintiff appeared to be that DW11 together with the other defendants had instructed Subra Law to send the Letter only after the meeting with DW4, DW5 and one Mr Manu[^51].

68     If DW4 and/or DW5 had met with the seven defendants _before_ they even instructed Subra Law or at any time _before_ 1 April 2019, there is no basis to make any finding that the Words in the Letter were published to them.

69     As for publication of the Words (or similar words) at the sixth AGM, the evidence adduced is that only DW4 and DW5 had questioned the plaintiff on the failure to obtain three quotations for the CCTV installation works. From my analysis, there is no evidence to support the pleaded assertion that “the Defendants or one or more of them spoke and published the Words or words to the same or similar effect to subsidiary proprietors, tenants and/or occupiers in the Development”.

70     In the premises, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove there was publication of the Words to third parties.

## Whether the Words complained of, in their natural and ordinary meaning, are defamatory of the plaintiff

71     A statement is regarded as defamatory if it tends to:

> (a)     lower the claimant in the estimation of right-thinking members of society (or ordinary reasonable persons) generally; or

> (b)     cause him to be shunned or avoided; or

> (c)     expose him to hatred, contempt, or ridicule.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52)

An offending statement would be deemed to be defamatory in nature if any one of the above tests is satisfied.

72     It is also trite that words carrying an imputation of dishonesty or improper conduct would lower a person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society.

73     The defendants have denied that the Words are defamatory of the plaintiff when considered in the relevant context, namely[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53):

> (a)     The parties were all members of the 5th MC and had attended the council meetings of 4 October 2018 and 8 November 2018.

> (b)     The rules governing MCST council meetings are set out in the BMSMA, and include duties of disclosure by council members (under s 60 of the BMSMA), a duty of diligence by council members (under s 61 of the BMSMA) and an obligation on the MC to keep minutes of its meetings (paragraph 3(1) of the 2nd Schedule to the BMSMA).

> (c)     Further, s 103(1) of the BMSMA provides that:

>> “\[w\]here… the provisions of (the BMSMA) have not been complied with in relation to a meeting of … the council… the (Strata Titles Board) may, by order (a) invalidate any resolution of … the persons present at the meeting…”

> (d)     The Letter from Subra Law had expressed concern that the plaintiff had not declared his interest in the company appointed to carry out CCTV works (_ie_ HNPL), and that the decision to appoint HNPL had been made without obtaining quotations from other vendors and without the consent of the other council members.

> (e)     The Letter asked for a return to the _status quo_ that existed before the 5th and 6th Council Meetings, _ie_ that whatever had been installed be removed and that no payment be made. This demand for a return to the _status quo_ makes clear that the thrust of the Letter (and the Words) was that:

>> (i)       the decision to appoint HNPL had not been made in compliance with various BMSMA requirements; and

>> (ii)       the decision was therefore invalid, and the MCST should return to the _status quo_ that existed before the purported decision.

74     Accordingly, they pleaded that the natural and ordinary meaning of the Words was simply that the plaintiff did not comply with the BMSMA provisions relating to disclosure of interests in proposed contracts; and had decided on the appointment of HNPL for the installation of the CCTV system without the consent of the other council members.

### The Words in their natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory

75     The general principles applicable to the construction of words based on their natural and ordinary meanings, as reiterated by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 506</span> (“_Chan Cheng Wah”_) at \[18\] are as follows:

> (a)     the natural and ordinary meaning of a word is that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable person;

> (b)     as the test is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended to convey is irrelevant;

> (c)     the ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can read between the lines and draw inferences;

> (d)     where there are a number of possible interpretations, some of which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only the defamatory one;

> (e)     the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus “the bane and the antidote must be taken together”; and

> (f)     the ordinary reasonable reader will take note of the circumstances and manner of the publication.

76     In terms of context in the present case, it is crucial to bear in mind that the Words are set out in a letter of demand sent by a law firm addressed to the Chairman of the MCST. While the intended recipient of the Letter was the plaintiff, the publication of the Words (according to the plaintiff’s pleaded case) was only to the MCST employees (namely DW1, DW2 and DW3) and subsidiary proprietors (DW4 and DW5) who are members of the MCST.

77     Reading the statements in paragraphs 3(b), 3(c), 3(d) and 4 of the Letter, it is undeniable that they contain imputations of dishonesty or at the very least, of improper conduct on the part of the plaintiff, in particular from the words emphasised in bold italics as extracted below:

> (a)     at \[3(b)\] of the Letter: “The statement in paragraph 2.2 … of the … Minutes of Meeting of the 5th Management Council of the MCST dated 4 October 2018\] in relation to the installation of CCTV cameras **_is untrue_**…”

> (b)     at \[3(c)\] of the Letter: “Our clients were present at the said meeting and are clear that **_you did not make any declaration as stated in paragraph 2.2_** of the 1st MOM. **_You did not seek to recuse yourself_** from the said meeting and the discussion on the installation of the CCTV cameras and that **_you made the decision_** to appoint Nutek to carry out the installation **_without the consent of the rest of the MC members_**.”

> (c)     at \[3(d)\] of the Letter: “The statement in paragraph 3.8 of the … Minutes of Meeting of the 5th Management Council of the MCST dated 8 November 2018\] **_is untrue_**. The statement that ‘having gone through other systems and their costings, M/s Harvest Nutek Pie Ltd was selected to carry out the installation’ in (sic) **_untrue_**. … In fact, Nutek itself did not submit or quote and were in fact **_authorized by you to proceed_** with the installation **_without the consent of the other members of the MC_**.”

> (d)     at \[4\] of the Letter: “In the premises, it appears that **_you had acted in breach of the BMSMA_**, **_specifically ss. 60 and 61_**.”

78     While I agree with the defendants that the ordinary reasonable reader of the Letter might not interpret the Words to mean that the plaintiff had abused his position as member and chairman of the 5th MC and also committed criminal offences, I should state that even the lesser meaning canvassed by the defendants[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) (see \[74\] above) is defamatory. By stating that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the relevant law and acted without the consent of fellow council members in the appointment of HNPL would convey to a reasonable reader that the plaintiff was guilty of improper conduct or high-handedness in his dealings. It is untenable to maintain that an allegation of this nature would not lower the standing of the person concerned in the eyes of right-thinking members of society.

79     In my view, the natural and ordinary meaning of the Words, as would be understood by the ordinary reasonable reader, and one who is not avid for scandal, would be that:

> (a)     the plaintiff as Chairman of the MC had caused untrue statements to be reflected in the minutes of the council meetings,

> (b)     the plaintiff had acted improperly in failing to make the required declaration under the BMSMA, and appointed his own company to carry out the CCTV installation without the consent of his fellow council members, and

> (c)     the plaintiff’s actions were in breach of the BMSMA.

80     Further, it is indisputable that the use of the word “untrue” necessarily carries with it an inference of dishonesty on the part of the maker of the statement. Coupled with the accusation of improper conduct in the appointment of his own company for the CCTV installation works and breaching the relevant law, it cannot be denied, and it is my finding that the Words in their natural and ordinary meaning would lower the reputation of the plaintiff and cause him to be shunned or avoided.

## Whether the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed for disclosing no substantial tort

81     The defendants have canvassed the additional argument that the plaintiff’s claim ought to be dismissed pursuant to the principles laid down in _Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] QB 946</span>, CA (“_Jameel_”) as the plaintiff’s best case is that only three employees of the MCST, three security guards and one Bangladeshi worker read the Letter. The publication, if proven, was miniscule as at the very most, only seven persons had read the Words.

82     Further, the impact of the Words would be even more negligible. The persons who could have read the Words are not the most educated. Judging by the level of understanding of the defendants as business owners and elected council members, it would not be a stretch to say that the employees, the guards and the Bangladeshi worker would hardly comprehend the Letter even if they had read it.

83     Since I have found on the evidence that the plaintiff has failed to prove there was publication of the Words to third parties, there is no necessity to consider the defendants’ additional argument under _Jameel_. I would only add my observation that the line of cases mentioned by the defendants have all referred to _Jameel_ in _obiter_, and only as another possible alternative reason to dismiss a claim in an appropriate case. This is hardly surprising given the Court of Appeal’s treatment of _Jameel_ in _Yan Jun v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 752</span> (“_Yan Jun_”) in our local context. In the final analysis, each inquiry has to be a fact-sensitive one, having regard not just to the extent of the publication but also the nature and the impact of the publication. After all, if the defamatory allegations are serious in nature, which I have found to be the case here (see \[79\] and \[80\] above), publication to even one person would have damaged the standing and reputation of the plaintiff.

84     Hence, even if the plaintiff had proven the fact of publication to the two MCST employees who had handled the Letter, DW2 and DW3, I would be hesitant to rely on _Jameel_ alone as a ground to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim.

## Whether the defendants can rely on the defence of justification

85     In the event that I am wrong in my finding of no publication, I will also deal with the defences pleaded, the first of which is justification.

86     It is trite that the burden is on a defendant to prove on a balance of probabilities that the sting of the defamation is more likely than not to be true. A defendant would have to prove only the truth of the main or substantial gist of the charge made. There is no requirement to prove the truth of all the words complained of if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff’s reputation, having regard to the truth of the remaining charges.

87     In the present case, the defendants will succeed in their defence of justification if they are able to prove that the minutes of the meetings on 4 October 2018 and 8 November 2018 are inaccurate in that:

> (a)     the plaintiff did not declare his interest in the MCST’s proposed contract with HNPL and did not recuse himself from the discussion on the installation of CCTV cameras,

> (b)     the plaintiff had made the decision to appoint HNPL to carry out the installation of CCTV cameras without the consent of the rest of the Council members, and

> (c)     the council members had not considered other systems and costings in the appointment of HNPL for the installation of the CCTV system.

### Did the plaintiff declare his interest and recuse himself at the meeting on 4 October 2018?

88     In his AEIC, the plaintiff had averred that after DW2 had completed her presentation on the budget available for the CCTV system, she informed the meeting that a presentation on a new digital CCTV system would be given by HNPL. The plaintiff then informed the council members present of his interest in the proposal, “specifically, that (he was) a director and owner of HNPL, and that (he) would not take part in the decision-making process”. He then introduced Tuo Jing Tao (“Tuo”) to the council members and invited Tuo to give his presentation[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55).

89     From the plaintiff’s account, he had made the declaration before Tuo was invited to do his presentation.

90     The plaintiff’s version was contradicted by DW2[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) who recounted that she was not aware that Tuo would be called to give a presentation at the 5th MC meeting. After she had completed her presentation slides, she heard from the plaintiff that he would be calling the contractor in to do a presentation. She stayed in the meeting for another ten minutes during Tuo’s presentation but did not hear the plaintiff making any declaration of interest for the duration of her presence at the meeting. Counsel for the plaintiff did not challenge DW2’s testimony at all on this aspect of her evidence.

91     PW1, who recorded in the minutes that “at that juncture”, the plaintiff had declared his interest under the BMSMA that the company invited to present the proposal was under his directorship, was extremely evasive when cross-examined on the manner in which the plaintiff is alleged to have given his declaration. He was unable to say categorically that the plaintiff had made a declaration. Instead, he sought to rationalise his answers by saying that the declaration was made “informally”.

92     When asked what he meant by “informally”, PW1 then likened the declaration made to be “on the same note” as the declarations made by the other council members at the first Council Meeting.[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) On further questioning by Mr Chen, PW1 clarified that these “informal” declarations were not declarations in respect of specific contracts or proposals. Rather, they were general declarations made by council members when they first took office to say that they were in various trades in case the MCST might require any supply or services in these trades, and not in relation to any specific contract. While he did expressly disagree when it was put to him that the plaintiff did not declare his interest in the proposal presented by Tuo, taken against the entirety of his responses on this issue, I am unable to accept his version as the truth.

93     As against PW1’s confusing testimony, all the defendants gave clear evidence that they had no idea that Tuo had anything to do with the plaintiff, or that the system being presented was being sold by a company owned by the plaintiff. None of them vacillated from this position during cross-examination.

94     The plaintiff had specifically sought to discredit the sixth defendant (DW11)’s testimony on this issue on the basis that DW11 had approached him immediately after Tuo’s presentation to ask if the plaintiff could arrange a similar presentation to other parties such as schools where DW11’s company had contracts with. The plaintiff questioned why DW11 would make such a request if he had not known that the plaintiff had an interest in HNPL. This doubt was, however, resolved as DW11 had clarified in re-examination that he had addressed his query to the plaintiff since it was the plaintiff who had brought Tuo in to conduct the presentation. He had no idea that the company represented by Tuo was owned by the plaintiff which I accept to be a plausible explanation[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58).

95     The plaintiff had also highlighted that the third defendant would have been aware of the plaintiff’s involvement in the CCTV installation since he had engaged the third defendant’s company, Hoyi System Pte Ltd, to supply the wooden cabinets to house the ancillary equipment. While the third defendant had during cross-examination agreed that when his company did the installation of the cabinets he was aware that it related to the CCTV project, the evidence adduced is that he was approached by the plaintiff on 15 October 2018, _after_ the fifth council meeting. This does not detract from the common position taken by the defendants that none of them knew of the plaintiff’s connection to the company represented by Tuo during the meeting on 4 October 2018.

96     What is also significant is that the plaintiff had chosen not to call the other two council members who were present at the meeting, namely Hou Rui Sheng and Michael Lim[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59), who would have been able to testify that they heard him make his declaration of interest in HNPL and seek a recusal if indeed he had done so. An adverse inference can be drawn against the plaintiff in this regard.

97     I would also accord significant weight to DW2’s unchallenged testimony that she had not heard the plaintiff making any such declaration of interest. As mentioned, I had found DW2 to be forthright witness. She would also be regarded as an independent witness with no vested interest in the current proceedings.

98     Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff had not declared his interest that he was a director of HNPL, the company invited to present the proposal for the installation of the CCTV cameras, contrary to what was recorded in the minutes of the fifth MC meeting on 4 October 2018. If the plaintiff had made no declaration of interest, as I have found, it logically follows that he would not have informed the meeting that he would recuse himself from the discussion on the installation of the CCTV system.

### Did the plaintiff make the decision to appoint HNPL without the consent of the rest of the Council members?

99     All the defendants were firm in their account that no decision had been taken at the meeting of 4 October 2018 to appoint HNPL to carry out the CCTV installation works. Their common position was that they had witnessed a presentation by Tuo of the Starlite Vision CCTV system but were not aware that it had anything to do with the plaintiff. It was clear that there was no proposal or resolution that was tabled at either of the two meetings on 4 October 2018 and 8 November 2018 for the council members to discuss and decide on in the appointment of HNPL to do the CCTV installation works.

100    The plaintiff’s justification on the decision to appoint HNPL was based on there being no objection expressed by any council member, _ie_ their silence was taken to mean consent. The extract from the cross-examination of PW1 set out below is especially pertinent[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60):

> Q    … can you say whether you know that---did anybody--okay, so, just now, you said Mr. ‘Chan’ did not say, “I want to appoint ‘Havas Natech (sic)’,” right?

> A    Yes

> Q    Nobody else said that either.

> A    No---

> …

> Q    And also, of course, you did not call for a vote here, right?

> A    No.

> Q    You did not ask for a show of hands?

> A    No.

> Q    You did not ask everybody to add---to say whether they support or reject?

> A    No

> …

> …

> Q    Let’s go back to the---the ABD, Agreed Bundle of Documents, page 335. You recorded that ‘Havas Natech’ was selected to carry out the works, yes?

> A    Yah.

> Q    You took it that council had made this decision.

> A     **_There is no objection, silence_**, lah,---

> Q    Okay. Okay.

> A     **_means consent_**.

> …

> …

> Q    … And it was your assessment that just because nobody said anything, there was an approval and ‘Havas Natech’ was selected.

> …

> A    … informally there is no objection and all this thing.

> …

> …

> Q    Nobody said go ahead with the works?

> A    Yah.

> Q    But they were just discussing the work?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And so, you yourself, you took it that this kind of situation constitutes a decision by the council?

> A    It’s a informal kind of discussion and then I took it as—

> …

> …

> Q    You took it as a decision?

> A    Yah.

> Q    That’s why you recorded it here?

> A    Yah.

> Q    That it was selected---

> A    Yah.

> Q    at the 6th meeting?

> A    Yes.

> Q    … Mr. Lim, I put it to you that council did not decide to select ‘Havas Natech’ to carry out the installation of the Startlight Visions system. You can agree or disagree.

> A    Formally, I agree, but informally there was a---this agreement.

101    From the tenor of PW1’s evidence, there was clearly no discussion carried out among the council members as to whether to appoint HNPL to carry out the CCTV installation works. If the members had not been asked whether they supported or objected to the appointment of HNPL for the job, the lack of response or silence on their part surely cannot be taken as consent. There was simply no basis, in my view, for PW1 to come to any conclusion that an informal agreement had been reached when he had not put the question to them at the meeting.

102    The plaintiff’s explanation as to how the agreement of the council members to the appointment of HNPL was arrived at was equally remarkable. The presentation by Tuo on the new digital system had elicited positive responses from at least two of the council members present, namely the sixth and seventh defendants respectively. Reliance was placed on a general “feeling” of approval for the CCTV system as the members were impressed by the presentation given by Tuo, and although neither PW1 nor the plaintiff had asked if the members agreed or approved the appointment of HNPL, the plaintiff had concluded from the general good feeling that a decision had been made by the council to appoint HNPL for the installation of the CCTV system at the cost of $200,000. See the following extract[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61):

> Q    Yes. But you took it that based on these 2 positive comments and the lack of objection from anybody else that there was a general consensus for ‘Havas Natech’ to proceed with these works at $200,000.

> A     **_There was a general nod_**, okay, but no comments.

> Q    “There was a general nod.”

> …

> Q    So, everybody nodded their head?

> A    Yah. Basically, an agreement to---to---because they were impressed, I didn’t get involved. They were impressed by the e---by presentation.

> Q    Okay. Wait, wait. So, you said everybody nodded their head.

> A    Yah.

> Q    There was a general nod.

> A    Yah

> Q    But **_there was actually no question asked about whether everybody will be agreeable to appointing HNPL_**?

> A    Yah, there was---

> Q    Yes.

> A     **_there was a feeling that everybody is okay with the whole situation_**. There was no rejection or say “no”.

103    If indeed there had been an implicit approval by the 5th MC members reached at the meeting of 4 October 2018, it had certainly not been recorded by PW1 in his minutes. As the administrator, PW1 had testified that he was responsible for preparing the minutes of council meetings. While he did not take down verbatim what was said at the meetings, he would record down the decisions made by the council at these meetings, draft the minutes and send them to the plaintiff for his approval as the chairman. As admitted by PW1, the minutes, notwithstanding the approval of the chairman and supposedly confirmed by the entire council, contained various errors and were incomplete.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

104    PW1’s evidence was also contradictory. He had recorded a purported approval by the 5th MC to spend $50,000 on the network system but conceded that there was no vote called for a decision to be taken nor was there a show of hands.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

105    On the appointment of HNPL for the CCTV installation, PW1 had in fact recorded it as having taken place at the sixth meeting on 8 November 2018.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) Notably, while PW1’s record stated that the selection of HNPL to carry out the installation of the Starlite Vision system was preceded by the 5th MC “_having gone through other systems and their costing_”, this did not mean that quotations from other companies had been presented to the council before HNPL was selected. What he meant was that a comparison was made with the works that were previously carried out in 2016. He conceded that in fact the 5th MC was not presented with any other choice. He also conceded that on the same day that HNPL was appointed or selected by the 5th MC, they had already started work, albeit for the network system only.[^65]

106    The plaintiff’s version was at odds with PW1’s account. While PW1 was firm in his testimony that the informal agreement to appoint HNPL was made at the sixth meeting on 8 November 2018 as recorded in the minutes, PW2’s position was that this was a mistake by PW1. PW2 had candidly admitted the minutes did not “gel” with what had actually taken place[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66).

107    The plaintiff tried to rationalise the error by explaining that it was an oversight on the part of PW1. Further, PW1’s use of the past tense “was” in his minutes with reference to HNPL being selected to carry out the CCTV works referred to what had happened at the fifth council meeting on 4 October 2018.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)

108    From the garbled evidence adduced in the cross-examination of the plaintiff’s own witnesses juxtaposed against the clear and steadfast accounts given by the defendants, I have to find that the decision to appoint HNPL was made by the plaintiff without the consent of the rest of the Council members.

### Did the 5th MC go through other systems and costings before HNPL was appointed?

109    What is also particularly significant is PW1’s express admission that the council did not go through other systems and costings before HNPL was selected to carry out the works. See the following extract[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68):

> Q    But the minutes in the 5th meeting did not say that ‘Havas Natech’ was appointed, right?

> A    No.

> Q    But ‘Havas Natech’ went ahead and did the works.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Without being appointed by council for the network system.

> A    The work was already in progress.

> …

> …

> Q    Okay. Okay. I mean, that’s interesting. So, you say that the network system was, there was no actual approval by the council, but they just went ahead because council approved the budget of 50,000. Okay.

> …

> that council---according to you, council approved expenditure of $50,000 on the network system---

> A    Yes.

> Q    at the 5th meeting.

> A    Yes.

> Q    And council did not approve---did not select or appoint ‘Havas Natech’ to do the network system works---to do the network system, to install the network system.

> A    Yes, it was not recorded.

> …

> …

> Q    Now, you are saying that---oh, you are saying it’s not recorded, but are you---

> A    I can’t recall then, but it was recorded in the 6th council meeting.

> Q    Wait, wait, wait. I’m talking about the approval to select ‘Havas Natech’ to do the network system installation. It was not recorded, but are you saying now that there was actually approval to select ‘Havas Natech’ to do the network system installation? Because just now, you said “no”.

> A    But in the 6th council meeting, I did minuted as ‘Havas Natech’ was selected.

> …

> …    … I asked you, if you are saying that the whole thing was approved at the 6th meeting, and the 6th meeting, Mr. Tuo also presented the progress of the works, right?

> A    Mmm hmm, yah.

> Q    So, before the approval, the works already started.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay. Okay. I just put a few things to you, Mr. Lim.

> A    Mmm.

> Q    You can agree or disagree. **_I put it to you that council did not go through other systems and costings_**.

> A    Yes.

> Q    You can---

> A    Agree.

> Q    agree or---

> A    Okay.

> Q    disagree.

> A     **_I---I---I agree._**

> Q     **_Agree that they did not go through other systems and costing_**?

> A     **_Yah, agreed_**.

110    The plaintiff’s explanation that what was meant by the statement was that the 5th MC did in fact go through the costings of other CCTV systems by comparing the prices of the various systems that were already installed in the Development. This position was inconsistent with the reply given by his previous solicitors on 2 April 2019 just one day after the Letter was sent. He had asserted there through his solicitors that the statement _“(h)aving gone through other systems and their costings”_ was true as _“(t)here was a further presentation by Mr Tuo at the meeting on 8 November 2018. The Council did consider the prices of other systems and component parts_”.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69)

111    When cross-examined on the inconsistency, the plaintiff retracted his earlier assertion and came up with a nebulous excuse of not having checked the minutes that PW1 had prepared[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70).

112    In my view, no reasonable reader would construe the phrase “_“(h)aving gone through other systems and their costings”_ as referring to the system that was already installed in the Development some years back to come to a conclusion that the price of a proposed system was fair and reasonable. The general understanding of a reasonable reader must surely be that other systems besides what was presented at the meeting had been tabled for consideration before the proposed system by HNPL was selected. The meaning that the plaintiff attempted to put to the words _ex post facto_ appears to be a distortion of the language used.

113    In my analysis, the defendants have sufficiently proven that the statement appearing in the minutes of the 8 November 2018 council meeting that other systems and costings were considered is untrue.

### Plaintiff’s reliance on the “confirmation” of the minutes is misplaced

114    The plaintiff had contended that the minutes of the fifth and sixth Council Meetings must be taken as accurate as they had been confirmed by the Council at the subsequent meetings.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) Reference was made to PW1’s instruction to DW2 to print and circulate the agenda and minutes of the meetings to the council members. Based on this, the plaintiff submitted that it is highly likely that the defendants did in fact have sight of the minutes of the two meetings in question prior to or at the subsequent meeting. They would thus have had the opportunity to question or correct the minutes had they wanted to.

115    Ordinarily, the written record of the confirmation of the minutes of a previous meeting would have considerable weight in the determination of what had transpired in that particular meeting. In the present case, however, the evidence from all parties (including that of PW1, the author of the minutes) renders the written record as unreliable. In particular, the following points have to be taken into account:

> (a)     DW2 who was tasked to print and circulate the minutes testified that what actually took place was that she would print and put the minutes in the files which were placed in the meeting room[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72). She did not observe any of the council members referring to the files with the draft minutes of the previous council meetings[^73].

> (b)     For each of the meetings on 4 October 2018, 8 November 2018 and 13 December 2018, DW2 testified that she was present at the start of the meetings as she was tasked to give a presentation of the summary of accounts to the council members. During these meetings, there was in fact no mention of the minutes of the previous council meetings.

> (c)     As earlier noted, all the defendants have very little proficiency in English, and in the case of the seventh defendant, almost nil. The only defendant who testified in English (DW-9) also demonstrated a limited competence in the language. They had testified that they had not read or understood the minutes as they were written in English[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74). DW6, who testified that she had been “compelled” to take up the role of secretary, had not checked the minutes until March 2019 when she had been approached by DW2 to sign the cheques in favour of the plaintiff’s company. The notices and agenda for the council meetings had been sent to the 5th MC members by Whatsapp only[^75], usually without any minutes attached.

> (d)     The draft minutes prepared by PW1 were sent only to the plaintiff for his approval as chairman. There were material errors found in the minutes[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76).

> (e)     The plaintiff himself had not corrected obvious errors and omissions in the minutes of the council meetings, such as the failure to record the alleged approval for HNPL to carry out the CCTV installation at the cost of $200,000[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77). Curiously, while the plaintiff was to have vetted and approved the draft minutes, he admitted that even he did not read the minutes of the fifth and sixth council meetings until “months later”.[^78]

116    In the premises, the plaintiff’s reliance on the confirmation of the minutes as recorded by PW1 to prove their accuracy is misplaced.

## Whether the defendants can rely on the defence of qualified privilege

117    On the basis that the Words had been published to the employees of the MCST (including DW2 and DW3), the defendants submit that they would be covered by the defence of qualified privilege.

118    A summary of the principles of the defence of qualified privilege can be found in the following passage from _Gatley on Libel & Slander_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) at paragraph 14.9, as endorsed by the High Court in _Gao Shuchao v Tan Kok Quan and others_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 115</span> at \[35\]:

> “… the tendency of the courts has been to regard most privileged occasions under the common law as very broadly classifiable into two categories: first, where the maker of the statement has a duty (whether legal, social or moral) to make the statement and the recipient has a corresponding interest to receive it; or, secondly, where the maker of the statement is acting in pursuance of an interest of his and the recipient has such a corresponding interest or duty in relation to the statement, or where he is acting in a matter in which he has a common interest with the recipient.”

119    As DW2 and DW3 were the only third parties who had sight of the Letter, even if they had read the Words (although I have found that they did not), I would agree that in their respective capacities as the MCST’s Accounts and Administrative Executive and then Facilities Manager, the duty-interest test to avail the defendants of the defence of qualified privilege is satisfied.

> (a)     In the case of DW2, she was in charge of preparing the MCST’s accounts for each council meeting as well as the circulation of the minutes of meetings. It would be within her interest to know if contracts and payments to be made by the MCST had been properly approved by the council.

> (b)     In the case of DW3, as the manager tasked with the administrative matters of the MCST on-site, the works carried out for the installation of the CCTV system fell within his scope of duties. It would be within his interest to be informed of whether the works had been properly approved.

120    While the plaintiff has pleaded particulars of malice in their attempt to defeat the defence of qualified privilege[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79), the evidence adduced provide no basis for the court to find malice on the part of any of the defendants. The Letter sent by their instructed solicitors was the defendants’ attempt to put right what they saw was a wrongdoing on the part of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is unable to cross the high threshold of showing that the defendants had caused the Letter to be published with the dominant motive of injuring his reputation.

## What should be the appropriate measure of damages had the plaintiff succeeded?

121    There is no necessity to deal with this issue as I have found in the defendants’ favour on the issue of publication as well as the applicable defences. I would only observe that the plaintiff’s submission for the sum of $10,000 as general damages appears consistent with the damages awarded in similar cases. However, the circumstances and the nature of the defamatory Words do not warrant any award of aggravated damages in this case.

## Conclusion

122    In conclusion, my findings are as follows:

> (a)     The Words in the Subra Letter in their natural and ordinary meaning are defamatory of the plaintiff as they carry imputations of dishonesty and improper conduct. However, the plaintiff has failed to prove that there was publication of the defamatory Words to any third party.

> (b)     The defendants have proven that the Words are true in substance and in fact and have succeeded in their defence of justification.

> (c)     The defendants have also succeeded in their defence of qualified privilege.

123    Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed. I will hear parties on the issue of costs on a date to be fixed.
