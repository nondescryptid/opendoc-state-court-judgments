### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused is Mr Mohamad Hamal Bin Abd. Karim, a male Singaporean, who was 44 years of age at the time of his arrest on 20 April 2017. He claimed trial to a charge under s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) and s 50T(1)(_a_) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed)(“PA”):

> …are charged that you, on 20 April 2017 at or around 11.53 am, inside a motorcar bearing registration number SJE4451K, in the carpark of Block 113 Tampines St 11, did traffic in a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking one block containing not less than 499.99 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), which is punishable under section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, and further

> that you, from 26 July 2016 to 25 July 2017, were subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.) which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act and while the remission order is in effect you, on 20 April 2017, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the Prisons Act, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 97 days from 20 April 2017 to 25 July 2017 for that offence.

2       A similar charge for possession of one block containing not less than 303.8 grams of cannabis mixture for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)_(a)_ read with s 5(2), and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA in DAC 936798-2017 was stood down for the purposes of this trial.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, as I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, I convicted the accused on the charge in DAC 943028-2018. I also ordered a discharge amounting to an acquittal in respect of DAC 936798-2017 pursuant to the Prosecution’s application.

4       The matter was adjourned to 17 August 2021 for the Prosecution to prepare the address on sentence and for the Defence to prepare the written plea in mitigation. On 17 August 2021, I sentenced the accused to 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane as well as an enhanced sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment pursuant to s 50T(1)_(a)_ of the PA. I ordered that his sentence was to be backdated to the date of his arrest on 20 April 2017 but with the period that he was in custody and on bail, namely 22 June 2020 until 27 August 2021 to be excluded from the computation of his sentence.

5       The accused is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. A stay of execution was granted for the sentence of imprisonment and caning.

6       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full.

## Circumstances leading to the arrest and charge

7       The undisputed facts leading to the accused’s arrest and charge were:

> (a)     On 20 April 2017, at or around 5 a.m., Mr Khairulanuar Bin Hashim (PW1) picked up the accused in a red Renault Megane bearing registration plate number SJE4451K and drove to various places in Singapore for the accused to deliver poultry to his customers. After making the deliveries, PW1 dropped the accused off and the parties went their separate ways;

> (b)     Later in the morning on the same day, the accused once again met PW1 who drove the car while the accused was again seated at the front passenger seat. After a brief stop in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang bus interchange, on the accused’s instructions, PW1 drove to a minor road behind an Esso petrol station near Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4;

> (c)     A Malaysian car was already parked inside the Esso station when they arrived. The Malaysian car subsequently exited the Esso station, turned onto the minor road which the car was on, and turned into an adjacent multi-storey carpark (“MSCP”). PW1 followed the Malaysian car into the MSCP;

> (d)     Inside the MSCP, the accused got out of the front passenger seat of the car and walked towards the driver-side window of the Malaysian car. A transaction took place between the accused and the driver of the Malaysian car while PW1 remained in the car during the transaction. Thereafter, the accused walked back to the car and boarded it. PW1 then exited the MSCP to continue the journey;

> (e)     On the accused’s instructions, PW1 drove the car from Choa Chu Kang towards Tampines;

> (f)     PW1 drove to the open-air carpark at Block 113 Tampines St 11 and his car was intercepted by various operational vehicles driven by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”). After a rear collision with a CNB vehicle, a black bundle with adhering tissue paper was thrown out of the front left passenger window of the car;

> (g)     Both the accused and PW1 were arrested by CNB officers at an open-air carpark of Block 113 and Block 114 of Tampines Street 11;

> (h)     The black bundle was sent to Health Science Authority (“HSA”) for analysis and it was found to contain not less than 632.7 grams of cannabis, a Class A controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA;

> (i)     On 21 April 2017, a blood sample was collected from the accused and placed on a Forensic Technology Analysis Card. On 26 April 2017, an analyst who conducted DNA analysis of the accused’s blood sample produced a report under s 263 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”).

## The law

8       The elements of a charge under s 5(1)(_a_) of the MDA as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 721</span> at \[59\]) are:

> (a)     possession of a controlled drug;

> (b)     knowledge of the nature of the drug; and

> (c)     proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised.

## The Prosecution's Case

9       It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had physical possession and actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs when he was in the motorcar. As he was in possession of more than 15 grammes of cannabis, the Prosecution had relied on the presumption concerning trafficking under section 17(d) of the MDA.

## The Defence's Case

10     The accused denied having physical control of the drugs and knowledge as to the nature of the drugs as they were found on the ground in the carpark. The presumption under s 17 or in the alternative s 18 of the MDA did not arise as the accused did not have physical possession and knowledge of the said drugs.

## Assessment of the Evidence

11     In order to prove its case on the charge, the Prosecution led evidence from 22 witnesses while the accused was the only witness for the Defence. The present case turns primarily on my determination of whether the PW1’s account or the accused’s account of the events on 20 April 2017 should be preferred. In my assessment of their credibility, I was guided by the case of _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> where the High Court has set out three key considerations in assessing a witness’s credibility namely:

> (a)     her demeanour;

> (b)     the internal consistency, or lack thereof, in the contents of her evidence; and

> (c)     the external consistency, or lack thereof, between the contents of her evidence and the extrinsic evidence _eg_ the evidence from other witnesses.

### PW1’s evidence

12     PW1 testified that he first knew the accused when they were both serving their sentences in prison around 1998 to 2003. He bumped into the accused by chance at the Geylang Market in 2017. The accused offered him a part-time job as a delivery driver for poultry and he agreed.

13     PW1 testified that on 20 April 2017, at or around 5:00am, he picked up the accused in his car and drove to various places in Singapore for the accused to deliver poultry to his customers. He then met the accused for the second time on the same day when the accused asked him to send him to Choa Chu Kang. PW1 did not ask the accused about the purpose of going to Choa Chu Kang since it was a usual place for them to make deliveries of poultry. When the car was in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang, the accused told PW1 to drop him off at a shop facing the bus interchange so that he could buy cigarettes.

14     PW1 gave evidence that he parked his car by the roadside facing the bus interchange. The accused alighted for about two to three minutes, during which PW1 noticed a missed call from a long string of numbers on the accused’s handphone which was left behind in the car. PW1 further gave evidence that when the accused returned, PW1 told him about the missed call and the accused left the car to make a phone call. About 5 to 10 minutes later, the accused returned to the car and told PW1 to drive him to Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4.

#### Events at the Esso station on Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4

15     PW1 testified that he drove to Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4 as directed. Thereat, the accused told him to enter a minor road and proceed to the back of an Esso station at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4. PW1 parked his car at the back of the Esso station.

16     PW1 also testified that when he parked his car, he noticed a Malaysian car parked inside the Esso station (at the location of the blue car shown in P3). The driver of the said car stood next to the car and signalled to the accused. The accused then alighted from PW1’s car and went to the Malaysian car. He returned shortly thereafter and told PW1 to follow the Malaysian car into the MSCP, 13 which is next to the Esso station.

#### Events at the MSCP

17     PW1 gave evidence that he waited for the Malaysian car to exit the Esso station and followed it into the MSCP. The Malaysian car drove up the ramp of the MSCP and reversed into a parking lot (as shown by the white van’s position in P7). PW1 parked his car in front of the Malaysian car, with the front passenger’s door (_ie_ the accused’s seat) facing the Malaysian car.

18     PW1 further gave evidence that while he remained seated at the driver seat, the accused took a piece of tissue paper with him before alighting from the car. The accused approached the driver of the Malaysian car. According to PW1, he did not notice what happened there, but the accused later returned to the front passenger seat of the car, carrying “something black \[which\] looks like a box” using tissue paper. The accused placed the item on the left side of the car and told PW1 to drive him to Tampines Street

#### Along the expressways from Choa Chu Kang to Tampines:

19     PW1 testified that somewhere along the expressways from Choa Chu Kang to Tampines, the accused told him that there was a white or silver car tailing PW1’s car. The accused asked PW1 for a plastic bag and PW1 told him that there was one inside the pocket behind the accused’s seat. The accused then took out the “black thing… together with the tissue” by holding on to the “black thing” using the tissue. He then placed them into the said plastic bag.

20     PW1 further testified that he asked the accused what the “black thing” was, and the accused told him that it was “ganja”. PW1 was shocked because he understood “ganja” refers to drugs.

#### Events at Tampines Street 11

21     PW1 gave evidence that after he turned his car into Tampines Street 11, he drove his car and joined the queue leading into the carpark of the Tampines Round Market at Blocks 138 and 139 of Tampines Street 11. According to PW1 it was at that point that the accused “confirmed” to him that a car was following his car. PW1 testified that he was scared that they were followed by the police as he had absconded from his urine test and had heroin in his pouch. PW1 thus swerved his car to the left and continued to drive forward. Soon after, he turned left and drove into an open-air carpark at Blocks 113 and 114 Tampines Street 11.

22     PW1 further testified that he drove straight into the carpark along Block 113 Tampines Street 11, made a turn to the side of the carpark nearer to Block 114 Tampines Street 11. At that point, another vehicle intercepted his path from the opposite direction. He thus accelerated and mounted the kerb onto a grass patch divider from the side of the carpark near Block 114 Tampines Street 11 and went down the grass patch divider near the other side of the carpark. His car then collided head-on with another silver-coloured vehicle.

23     PW1 gave evidence that at the point when his car went onto the kerb, he saw the accused taking out the “black thing and the tissue” but he did not know what the accused did with it. After the collision, he saw the same “black thing” with the tissue on the floor of the carpark at the spot with a marking ‘A’ as shown on P20. He identified that the “black thing” with the tissue was visually similar to the bundle as shown in photograph P34.

24     I next considered the extrinsic evidence produced by the Prosecution to establish the element of physical possession of the drugs by the accused.

### Extrinsic evidence showing the accused’s physical possession of the drugs

#### In-car camera footages

25     In the course of the trial, the Prosecution tendered two in-car camera footages obtained from the CNB vehicles, showing that the front left passenger of PW1’s car _ie_ the accused, was the one who threw the black bundle from the front left passenger window of the car immediately after the rear collision. P96 was recorded from the CNB vehicle that had a head-on collision with the front of PW1’s car, and P101 was recorded from the CNB vehicle that collided with the rear of PW1’s car.

26     I agreed with the Prosecution that the authenticity and accuracy of these two in-car camera footages were never seriously disputed at trial save for the Defence’s bare assertion that they were edited versions of the video footages and did not show the full picture of what had happened. I was mindful that the Defence had not specified which portion of the footages were allegedly edited. Having watched the footages of the collision between PW1’s car and the CNB vehicles to the throwing of the black bundle out of front passenger window multiple times in the course of the trial, I did not accept the Defence’s assertion that they had been edited and did not show the full picture of what had happened.

27     I accepted the evidence of PW4 Goh Jun Xian (Eric), PW18 Huang Yixia and PW20 Koh Soon Sim on the chain of events that led to the extraction of the in-car camera footages from the two original SD cards of the CNB operational vehicles. On the fact, I found that the footages that P96 and P101 were the actual footages and that they had been properly extracted from the two CNB vehicles.

28     Based on the two original in-car camera footages (P96 and P101) and the enhanced video (P97), I agreed with the Prosecution that it was clear that a black rectangular object with loosely adhering white paper-like material was thrown out of the front left passenger window of the car shortly after the collision. This was particularly since the accused was seated at front left passenger seat throughout the car journey from Choa Chu Kang to Tampines, including at the material time of the collision.

#### Expert evidence

29     I also accepted and gave full weight to the expert evidence of PW15 Dr Alaric Koh Chin Wai, a Senior Forensic Scientist with the HSA, who had produced a report P89 which explained in detail why, on analysis of the two footages, the “black rectangular object with loosely adhering white paper-like material” thrown out of the front left passenger window is more likely than not to have been thrown out by the front left passenger of the car as opposed to the driver. He had comprehensively set out the reasons for his findings in his first electronic report (P89). I found his findings were clear, meticulous and logical, and there was no serious challenge to his findings when he was cross-examined by the Defence.

30     I accepted his evidence that PW1 did not have the sufficient reach to the left passenger window, without leaning to his left. I also accepted his evidence that PW1 was not observed to have leaned over to his left. I agreed with his conclusion that it was more likely than not that the front left passenger (_ie._ the accused), rather than the driver (_ie_ PW1) who threw the black bundle out of the car. This conclusion was borne out by the neutral, coherent, independent and objective nature of Dr Koh’s evidence, based on his observations of the footages and his objective evidence in court.

#### The accused’s DNA was found on the tissue adhering to the Bundle

31     The Prosecution had tendered objective evidence that the accused’s DNA was found on the tissue that was found stuck to the black bundle. The pieces of tissue paper and the black tape on the exterior of the black bundle were submitted to the HSA for analysis. PW14 Analyst Ng Huey Hian produced a report (P67) explaining that, on analysis the DNA profile obtained from the tissue paper was found to match the DNA profile of the accused although there was no interpretable DNA profile obtained from the analysis of the black tape.

32     I agreed with the Prosecution that the presence of the accused’s DNA on the tissue paper which was adhering to the bundle corroborates the Prosecution’s case, including PW1’s evidence, that the accused used the tissue paper to handle the black bundle, and threw the entire bundle with adhering tissue out of the front left passenger window. As the Court of Appeal held in _Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor_ \[2018\] 2 SLR 108754 at \[62\], “\[u\]nlike the absence of DNA evidence, which is neither conclusive nor even necessarily probative, the presence of DNA is generally probative because it tends to establish that the subject did in fact come into contact with the surface or point where his DNA was found”.

### Extrinsic evidence showing accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs

#### The accused’s phone records

33     To establish the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs, the Prosecution had relied on the records from the accused’s mobile phone. One of the accused’s seized mobile phones labelled MHA-HP2 (P107) contained multiple WhatsApp messages and calls with a Malaysian number (XXX@s.whatsapp.net) in the 24 hours leading up to the accused’s arrest.

34     I agreed with the Prosecution that the contents of the messages strongly suggested that the accused made arrangements with the user of the Malaysian number to collect 1 kg of cannabis. I was mindful that the authenticity and accuracy of the forensic examination of the accused’s mobile phones, including MHA-HP2 were also not disputed at trial. I considered the most incriminating message was a WhatsApp audio message from the Malaysian Number to the accused on MHA-HP2 one day before the arrest, informing the accused that he was to collect “buku satu buku” the following morning (_ie_ the day of the arrest). In addition, there was a series of exchanges between the accused and the Malaysian Number pertaining to an arrangement to meet at Choa Chu Kang at 9.30 am on 20 April 2017. I agreed with the Prosecution that the context of the entire exchange shows that the meet up was for the purpose of collecting “buku satu buku”.

35     I also considered the evidence of the various calls between the accused and the Malaysian number on 19 and 20 April 2017. Inspector Feroz Bin Abd Rahman (PW21) was shown the entire exchange of messages and calls between the accused and the Malaysian Number. PW21 had testified that based on his understanding of the entire exchange, the term “buku satu buku”, while literally translated meant “book, one book”, was used in the context of this exchange to refer to “1 kg of cannabis”.

36     I accepted his evidence and found on the facts that ‘book’ referred to rectangular blocks of packaged vegetable matter containing cannabis, with each “book” having a gross weight of approximately 1kg in vegetable matter. I had no reason to doubt his competency to give expert evidence since he is well-acquainted with drug jargon given his 22 years of experience, 10 years of which were with the Intelligence Division of the CNB. It was unchallenged that he had prior experience in interacting with drug offenders and has personal knowledge of the meaning of drug jargons commonly used by drug offenders. I agreed with the Prosecution that his opinion evidence on the drug jargon would be admissible as expert evidence under s 47 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), and gave his evidence full weight. (see _Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ \[2017\] 1 SLR 25763 at \[64\] – \[65\]; _Leong Wing Kong v Public Prosecutor_ \[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 68164).

37     PW21 had cogently explained that in his experiences as a CNB officer, drug offenders used the term “buku satu buku” when dealing with cannabis because cannabis was “usually packed in a rectangular form just like a book, so that’s why they call it 1 book and it usually weighs around 1 kg.”.

38     I agreed that PW21’s evidence on the weight of the cannabis (around one kg) was further corroborated by HSA’s analysis that the actual weight of the vegetable matter in the bundle was not less than 936.5g – or almost 1 kg. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s evidence that ‘buku satu buku’ refers to money, and that the entire exchange above pertains to the collection of money, was illogical and unbelievable.

#### The accused’s manner of handling of the black bundle

39     PW1 had testified that the accused handled the black bundle by holding it with a piece of tissue paper at all times. PW1 had observed this when the accused received the bundle from the Malaysian car at the MSCP, when he placed the bundle into the plastic bag and when he took the bundle out from the plastic bag as PW1’s car mounted the kerb. I agreed with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference to be drawn from the accused’s manner of handling the bundle with a piece of tissue paper, rather than directly touching the bundle, must be that he knew that the bundle contained cannabis and was extremely careful not to leave his DNA on the bundle in order to distance himself from potential offences. I also agreed that his manner of handling the bundle further supports the Prosecution’s case theory that the accused knew that the bundle contained cannabis.

40     In addition, the accused had thrown the bundle out of the front passenger side window of the car after the head-on and rear collisions between PW1’s car and the CNB operational vehicles. The accused was aware that PW1’s car was being tailed by another vehicle and he had thrown it out once PW1’s car was wedged by the CNB vehicles. I found that the accused clearly knew that the bundle contained cannabis and had thrown it out of the window in a desperate attempt to distance himself from the incriminating evidence and to deny having physical possession of the controlled drug.

#### The accused’s post-arrest conduct

41     PW1 had testified that several days after the arrest, when he passed by the accused’s lock-up at the Police Cantonment Complex, the accused asked him about the contents of his statement. He told the accused that he “just said whatever \[he\] wanted to say”. Subsequently, when they were seated next to each other at the waiting area of the State Courts (ahead of their first court mention), he further testified that the accused had offered to give PW1 $20,000 if the latter were to take responsibility and inform the Judge that his previous statements were false. According to PW1, he turned down the accused’s offer.

42     I agreed with the Prosecution that the offer of a substantial $20,000 bribe showed that the accused must have known that the bundle contained cannabis, an illicit drug, which would attract severe punishment. He therefore had the incentive to pay a large sum of money to PW1 to try to get him to take the blame instead. I also agreed that PW1’s evidence was internally consistent because he had provided a similar oral account of the accused’s monetary offer to SSI Tony Ng (PW12). PW12 had testified that when he escorted PW1 to the Changi Medical Centre on 22 April 2017, PW1 informed him that the accused had offered him $20,000.

43     I agreed that PW1’s evidence was also externally consistent and was largely corroborated by Ahzli Bin Syed Karim (PW2), another inmate who overheard the conversation between PW1 and the accused at the State Courts. PW2 had testified that the accused told PW1 that if he took responsibility for the cannabis that he would offer him $20,000 in Malay. I found PW2 to be a credible and independent witness who ought to be believed as he had no personal interest in this matter. I agreed with the Prosecution that he did not know the accused personally and had no reason to lie in Court to implicate the accused, or to subject himself to being prosecuted for perjury if he gave false evidence.

#### Presumption that the accused was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking

44     In the present case, the Defence did not dispute the chain of custody in relation to the black bundle marked A1A1A or the analysis of the drugs. The weight of the drugs after analysis was unchallenged by the Defence. HSA Analyst Lim Kheng Aik (PW13) had testified that the black bundle was found to contain not less than 632.7 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be cannabis. As the weight of the cannabis exceeded 15g, the Prosecution had relied on the presumption under s 17(d) of the MDA that the accused had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. The onus thus shifted to the accused to adduce evidence to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

### The accused’s defence

45     The accused’s defence was a bare denial of the drug trafficking charge. According to his Defence Counsel, it was PW1 who had thrown the bundle out of the front passenger window. He was asleep at the time of the collision between PW1’s car and the CNB operational vehicles. He was unaware and had not seen if anything had been thrown out of PW1’s car.

46     He testified that his purpose of going to Choa Chu Kang was to collect $50,000 from one ‘Samy’ for illegal horse betting. He had never met Samy and had worked for him for ten months. His job entailed collecting betting tickets from punters to gamble on horses. If they won, the accused would pay out the punters from that money. He further testified that he helped Samy to collect debts from others and bought contraband cigarettes from Samy.

#### Events at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4

47     He gave evidence that on 20 April 2017, Samy called him to inform of the meeting location at a petrol kiosk near Block 474 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4. Samy told him there was about $100,000 and that he could choose to either take the full sum and keep the excess $50,000 for his own use subject to 20% repayment interest or to return the entire sum to Samy’s sibling.

48     He further testified that after collecting the money at the petrol kiosk, the accused went to the nearby MSCP and counted the money that was placed in a transparent bag in PW1’s presence. The accused decided to return the money as the initial agreement with Samy was for $50,000. If he took the excess money for investing and lost money, he would have to repay the $50,000 plus 20% interest. He returned the money to Samy’s brother at the main road near the petrol kiosk. He then asked PW1 to drive him to ‘Block 208A Tampines’ to meet his grandmother.

49     The accused testified that he was asleep along the expressways from Choa Chu Kang to Tampines as he was under medication such as Tramadol and Gabapentin for his spine problems. According to him whenever his mobile phone rang, he would wake up to answer the call.

#### Events at the open-air carpark at Block 113 Tampines St 11

50     The accused further testified that while he was sleeping in PW1’s car, he suddenly woke up as PW1 ‘had gone up something’ and had collided with a car. Someone then opened the door and wanted to handcuff him. He denied throwing anything out of the car. He also did not see anybody throw anything out of the car as he was unaware of what was happening.

### Inconsistencies in the accused’s evidence

#### The accused’s involvement with Samy

51     The accused had testified that he usually collected money from Samy every Friday since horse betting took place between Friday and Sunday every week. In the present case, the accused was arrested on 20 April 2017 which fell on a Thursday and not his usual day for the collection of money. When cross-examined about this, his position shifted and the accused claimed that he occasionally collected money from Samy before Friday as well, if there were punters who wanted to place their bets earlier. I agreed with the Prosecution that this explanation did not make sense because there would not have been any need to collect money to pay punters since the races took place between Friday and Sunday. Even as the accused tried to wriggle himself out of a predicament, I also agreed with the Prosecution that he had fabricated an explanation that did gel with his course of conduct.

52     The accused had testified that Samy had never used the term “buku satu buku” in any of their earlier conversations to refer to money. In fact, Samy would usually only say “Yes, I will give you money” without specifying whether the money would be kept in a box, package or bundle. When confronted about this, the accused insisted that he nonetheless understood the word “buku” to refer to money because it was his personal “lingo”. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s claim that “buku” referred to money in his own understanding made no sense and was clearly a futile attempt by him to invent an explanation to cover up the objective evidence of his voice message exchange with Samy and PW21’s expert evidence.

53     The accused gave evidence that on 20 April 2017, Samy told him that he would receive “about $100,000” and that he was to check and confirm the exact amount. In my view, this was by no means a small amount of money and this claim was illogical as it made no sense for Samy to give double the amount than that was originally instructed by him on 19 April 2017. I also found the accused’s evidence that Samy gave an estimate of the amount that the accused was to receive illogical considering that the money came from Samy. The accused had conceded during cross-examination that this was not a normal transaction because he would usually receive only $50,000.

54     I agreed with the Prosecution that it was also unbelievable that Samy would hand over a significant extra sum of about $50,000 that the accused was free to use for himself. Furthermore, this extra $50,000 that he could use for himself, upon repayment of interest, was never mentioned in any of the accused’s statements to CNB. In my view, the accused had fabricated this incredible explanation as an afterthought to explain his reason for purportedly returned the sum of money shortly after receiving it.

55     The accused had testified that he had only worked for Samy and did not work for anyone else. Since ‘Amy’ also worked for Samy, the collections from Amy and Samy’s sibling were both fixed by Samy concurrently at 9.30am on 20 April 2017 at Choa Chu Kang. This was internally inconsistent with his prior statement in D8 at \[3\] where he stated that he, PW1 and Amy collected debts for unlicenced moneylenders and that different moneylenders would call them and ask them to collect money. I noted that it was also not the Defence’s case that apart from assisting the accused in the delivery of poultry, PW1 was involved in collecting debts from various unlicenced moneylenders. When he was confronted with the inconsistency on PW1’s involvement, he did not provide any explanation and merely insisted on that PW1 merely followed him as the driver.

#### The accused’s account that he was sleeping during the car ride is unbelievable

56     The accused had consistently claimed in his statements in D8 and D9 as well as in Court that he was asleep throughout the car ride, except when he woke up to answer phone calls and only eventually woke up when PW1’s car mounted the kerb.

57     His account was clearly contradicted by objective evidence of the mobile forensic records and in-car camera footages. The mobile forensic records of the accused’s three mobile phones (MHA-HP1, MHA-HP2, and MHA-HP3117) revealed that he had received and made numerous phone calls between 11:00am and 11:53am which the accused accepted was the time he was travelling in PW1’s car from Choa Chu Kang to Tampines. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was unbelievable that the accused had any time fallen asleep given that he had received and made 18 phone calls over the span of less than 53 minutes. This meant that on average, he received or made a phone call every 2 to 3 minutes when he was in PW1’s car.

58     Significantly, the mobile forensic records showed that the accused was engaged in a 52-second call at 11:50:09am which was a mere three minutes before the collision. Further, I found that the accused claim that he only woke up whenever he received phone calls was untrue as he had conceded that he had also made outgoing phone calls when he was in PW1’s car. When confronted with his phone records, he initially claimed that he could have accidentally made the outgoing calls while holding onto his phone in the car. However, when pressed further about the absurdity of making accidental outgoing calls using different phones to different numbers at different timings, the accused ultimately admitted that he did in fact make outgoing phone calls while he was in PW1’s car. On the facts, I found that the accused had claimed to have fallen asleep in PW1’s car and was not aware of what had happened in order to distance himself from the offence and in particular, the bundle that was thrown out from the accused’s side of PW1’s car.

#### The accused’s account was contradicted by in-car camera footages

59     The accused’s claim that he was asleep was also contradicted by the in-car camera footage of the CNB vehicle which collided with the rear of PW1’s car showed that shortly before PW1’s car mounted the kerb. From the footage, the accused was leaning his head and entire body forward, away from the head rest and in front of the position of the driver (_ie_ PW1’s) head. This could be seen clearly because the front left passenger window was partially wound down.

60     This observation was made by PW15 Dr Alaric Koh Chin Wai and was undisputed by the accused when he was shown the in-car camera footage during cross-examination. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s position strongly suggested that he was not only awake but was leaning forward in an alert and prepared manner, even before PW1’s car had mounted the kerb.

#### The accused’s explanation of his DNA on the tissue paper is unbelievable

61     In another attempt to distance himself from the bundle containing the cannabis, the accused had strenuously denied using tissue paper, which was thrown out together with the bundle, to handle the bundle. To explain the presence of the accused’s DNA on the tissue paper, the Defence had argued that there could be direct or primary transfer of a person’s DNA or a secondary transfer of DNA (hence or both) and offer three possible explanations for this.

62     The accused first claimed that he had asked PW1 for tissue paper to wipe his face because he had sinus and was sweating due to a headache. He then placed the used tissue in a box between himself and PW1. He speculated that PW1 could have subsequently used the tissue to hold and throw the bundle out of the car. I was mindful that this version was never put to PW1 despite his contradictory account that he had seen the accused using the tissue paper to hold the bundle. In addition, PW1’s DNA was not found on the tissue paper. When confronted about this, the accused postulated that his DNA was detected but not PW1’s possibly because he had sweaty palms and was more prone to shedding skin cells.

63     The accused next claimed that his DNA might have landed onto the tissue paper because he sat in PW1’s car for a long time (about four to five hours on the material day). I agreed with the Prosecution that this theory is inconsistent with the DNA evidence because PW1, as the driver of the car, was in the car for an even longer duration than the accused, yet his DNA was not found on the tissue paper at all.

64     Finally, the accused claimed that his sweat could have dripped from his body onto the tissue paper when he was brought near the bundle and the tissue paper by the CNB officer at the carpark lot. However, when he was shown the scene photographs, he was unable to point out the distance between him and the bundle. Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was simply no basis for his claim that he was so close that his sweat could have dripped onto the tissue paper. Based on the evidence before me, I found that the accused had not offered any plausible explanation as to why his DNA was found on the tissue paper which was adhering to the bundle.

## Inconsistencies in his testimony and statements of the events on 19 and 20 April 2017

65     The accused had provided inconsistent versions of the events on 19 April 2017 and 20 April 2017 in his testimony and his statements. The accused’s statements were admitted as defence exhibits and was part of his evidence. During his examination-in-chief, he had confirmed that all the statements were recorded accurately and that he did not wish to make any amendments to the statements. During cross-examination, he again confirmed at least three times that all the statements were accurate and voluntary. He agreed that he signed on the statements and ensured their accuracy because he knew that they were important documents that could be used against him in Court.

66     However, during cross-examination, whenever the accused was confronted with an inconsistent version in his previous statements, he switched tack to claim that the statement was not recorded accurately. This was despite the fact that these allegations were not put to the recording officers when they were cross-examined by his Counsel and his confirmation that the statements were accurately recorded.

#### Identity of the Malaysian moneylender

67     For instance, when his statement in D8 was recorded, no reference to the name ‘Samy’ was made. In his statement, the accused had stated that on 19 April 2017, a Malaysian moneylender had messaged him to meet Amy at Block 400+ Choa Chu Kang near the bus interchange and Amy will bring the details. After Amy failed to turn up, the accused left with PW1 to go to Tampines as he wanted to visit his grandmother.

68     Subsequently on 27 April 2017 in D9, the accused stated he was contacted by a Malaysian moneylender on 19 April 2017. Subsequently, on the day of his arrest _ie_ 20 April 2017 after Amy failed to turn up at Choa Chu Kang, he had received a telephone call from another Malaysian number which belonged to another moneylender ‘Samy’ that he worked for. Samy told the accused that he had some money for the accused and he was to meet his runner at the Esso station. The money was for black market horse betting and 4D on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The money that the accused should receive for helping his illegal moneylending was also included in the amount. After the accused met the runner, he had called to ask Samy how much was inside the plastic bag. Samy told him that there was $100,000 inside the plastic bag. The accused then told him as they had only agreed on $50,000, he did not want to be responsible for so much money and that he would pay Samy back. The plastic bag containing the $100,000 was handed back to Samy’s runner.

69     When the accused was confronted with the above inconsistencies, he failed to provide any satisfactory explanation and simply stated that he had provided the wrong information to the recording officer by mistake.

#### Purpose of the $100,000

70     The accused testified at trial that he had worked for Samy in relation to horse betting, debt collection and contraband cigarettes. He did not deal with collection of money for 4D. He also claimed that the sum of $50,000 was for the sole purpose of horse betting. However, in his previous statement to CNB, _ie_ D9 he stated that the sum of $50,000 was for multiple purposes namely horse betting, 4D and illegal money-lending. When he was confronted with the inconsistencies regarding whether he was involved in 4D and whether the purpose of the $50,000 was fully meant for horse betting, the accused did not provide any explanation and merely insisted that his oral testimony was correct.

#### The accused was not a credible witness

71     Based on the above, I did not the find the accused to be a credible witness. He was unable to provide credible explanations for the multiple material inconsistencies in his evidence. His evidence on material issues were illogical and the constantly shifting nature of his defence showed that they were fabricated afterthoughts in his attempt to escape his culpability for the charge.

## Conclusion

72     Accordingly, I rejected the Defence’s case that the accused was not found in possession of the drugs as they were found on the ground in the carpark. After having seen the footages numerous times in the course of the trial, I also rejected the Defence’s unsubstantiated claim that the in-car camera footages were edited versions and did not show the full picture of what had happened. It was clear that every second of the collision and the throwing of the bundle from PW1’s car was captured. Hence, I saw no basis and little merit in the Defence’s submissions that an adverse inference must be drawn against the Prosecution.

73     Based on the evidence before me, I found that the accused did have physical possession of the drugs and had the requisite knowledge as to the nature of the drugs. I accepted the Prosecution’s case that it was entitled to rely on the presumption under s 17(d) of the MDA. The onus was on the Defence to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. In the present case, I found that the accused had failed to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking.

74     After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established its case in respect of the trafficking charge beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted him on the charge.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

#### s 5(1)(a) of the MDA

75     The prescribed penalty for an offence of trafficking in not less than 330 grammes and not more than 500 grammes of cannabis is a minimum sentence of 20 years and 15 strokes and a maximum sentence of 30 years and 15 strokes for offences prosecuted in the State Courts.

#### Enhanced sentence pursuant to 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act

76     As the accused was released from prison on 26 July 2016 subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons, he was liable to enhanced sentence of imprisonment term not exceeding the remaining duration of his remission order.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

78     The Prosecution had submitted for a sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, as well as an enhanced sentence of 97 days. In support of its position, the Prosecution relied on the sentencing guidelines for trafficking in cannabis set by the Court of Appeal in _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span>. Where the applicable weight of the cannabis is between 431 and 500g, the indicative starting sentence is 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. In _Poopathi Chinaiyah s/o Paliandi v PP_ (Criminal Appeal No 2 of 2020), the Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s holding that the indicative starting imprisonment term for trafficking in 499.99g of cannabis is 29 years’ imprisonment. It was further submitted the indicative starting sentence could be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the accused’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.

#### Appropriate underlying sentence for the charge

79     The Prosecution had submitted that the appropriate base sentence for the charge under s 5(1)_(a)_ read with s 5(2), and punishable under s 33(1) MDA is 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

### Aggravating factors should be considered in determining the appropriate sentence:

#### The accused’s conduct at trial demonstrates his evident lack of remorse

80     The accused made entirely baseless allegations that violence was used against him by one of the officers from the CNB, SSI Tony Ng. He persisted in his allegations even when the evidence in the form of objective in-car camera footages, and the testimony of CNB officers, show that SSI Tony Ng was not even at the scene of the arrest. In the course of the trial, significant latitude was given to Defence Counsel to play the in-car camera footages of the arrest numerous times. Each CNB officer was made to watch the footages (often more than once) in an attempt to get them to identify SSI Tony Ng. This significantly protracted the trial. Ultimately, all the CNB officers unanimously testified that they did not see SSI Tony Ng in the footages. Faced with the overwhelming evidence that directly contradicted his allegation, the accused did not retract it; instead, he cast wild aspersions against all the CNB officers, admitting that the upshot of his allegation was that all of them had conspired to give false evidence in Court.

81     When the accused was unable to explain away the inconsistencies between his statements recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) during cross examination, he consistently pushed the blame to the recording officers by asserting – for the first time – that the statements were inaccurately recorded. This is despite the fact that:

> (a)     the statements were admitted as Defence exhibits, as part of his case;

> (b)     the recording officers were not cross-examined on the accuracy of statement recording; and

> (c)     the accused had confirmed at least three times during his examination-in-chief and cross-examination that all the statements were accurate and given voluntarily.

82     Despite the clear evidence from Prosecution witnesses that the in-car camera footages were properly extracted from the two original SD cards of the two CNB operational vehicles that collided into the car that the accused was in, the accused insisted on making allegations that the footages were edited and did not show the full picture of what had happened. The Court had rejected this “unsubstantiated claim” which had no merit. When faced with objective in-car camera footage and expert analysis on who had thrown out the bundle, he repeatedly claimed that it was not him who did so.

#### The accused’s high culpability

83     The accused played a key role in the transaction involving the bundle of cannabis. The accused was the one who directed PW1 on where to drive to in Choa Chu Kang, and to follow the Malaysian car into the multi-storey car park. At the multi-storey car park, the accused collected the bundle containing cannabis from the driver of the Malaysian car. He then directed PW1 to drive to Tampines. He was also the one who threw the black bundle out of the left passenger side window in order to dissociate himself from the incriminating bundle, when he was surrounded by CNB operational vehicles.

#### The accused is a recalcitrant offender

84     The accused is not a first-time drug offender. Instead, he is traced for multiple drug-related antecedents dating back to 32 years ago in 1989. In addition, his antecedents showed that he dealt with a variety of drugs over the years. He had further continually re-offended shortly after being released from prison. The accused is also a repeat drug trafficker, with his first drug trafficking offence in January 2000, for which he was sentenced to 22 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

85     It was the Prosecution’s case there were no mitigating factors which would result in a downward adjustment of the indicative starting sentence. It was submitted that there should be an uplift from the starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment, in light of the accused’s lack of remorse, high culpability and repeated offending behaviour.

86     In the present case, the accused was convicted after a 10-day trial. He would therefore not be entitled to a plead guilty discount (usually about one-third), since no resources were saved as a result of his plea of guilt, nor can he be said to be remorseful. As such, it was submitted that a sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane would be appropriate.

#### The Enhanced Sentence

87     The accused was released from prison on 26 July 2016, after serving a sentence under s 11(b) of the MDA for permitting his co-tenant to use the rented premises for the unlawful trafficking of controlled drugs. The accused was therefore subjected to a remission order made under s 50I of the PA from 26 July 2016 to 25 July 2017 (both dates inclusive). As at the date of his current offence on 20 April 2017, the accused had 97 days remaining in his remission period.

88     Applying the framework in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> summarised at \[87\], it was submitted that the most significant factor is the gravity of the fresh offence. The more serious the fresh offence, the greater the harm caused, and the longer the enhanced sentence. In the present case, the offence under s 5(1)_(a)_ read with s 5(2) MDA is a one of the most serious offences, for which the mandatory minimum sentence is at least 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and the maximum sentence is 30 years’ or life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

89     In terms of rehabilitative prospects (_ie_ the extent to which the accused’s fresh offending behaviour can be said to have undermined the goal of encouraging good conduct and facilitating rehabilitation and reintegration into society, under s 50E PA):

> I.     Timing of fresh offence: The offence was committed about three-quarters into the accused’s remission period.

> II.     Similarity of fresh offence to original offence: The offence is similar – indeed far more serious – than the original offence under s 11(b) MDA. The accused was charged for possession for the purpose of trafficking a controlled drug himself (as opposed to simply permitting another to use his premises to do this). In addition, the amount of cannabis in the proceeded charge is nearly a capital amount.

Given the factors above, it was submitted that the present case falls within Band 3 (high severity). Given the serious fresh offence that was committed, the full remaining duration of the remission period _ie_ 97 days’ imprisonment, ought to be imposed.

#### Backdating of sentence

90     The Prosecution submitted that it was not objecting to the sentence be backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest, _ie_ 20 April 2017, but with the period that the accused was not in custody and on bail (_ie_ 22 June 2020 to 27 August 2021) excluded from the computation.

## Mitigation

91     In his oral plea in mitigation, it was submitted that the accused is married with three children. He was born on 27 December 1973 and is presently 47 years old. His family runs a stall in the market selling and supplying chickens to stalls and restaurant. His family needs his help and support in running the business.

92     In response to the Prosecution’s submissions of his lack of remorse and the aggravating factors, it was submitted that what was presented was his defence and it was up to the Court to decide whether to accept his version. His Counsel urged the Court not to impose a crushing sentence and to deal with the accused in the most lenient way possible.

## Decision on Sentence

### Sentencing framework for trafficking in cannabis

93     In my determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed I was bound by the Court of Appeal decisions in _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> where the Court of Appeal set out sentencing guidelines for the trafficking of cannabis. I also considered the case of _Poopathi Chinaiyah s/o Paliandi v PP_ (Criminal Appeal No 2 of 2020), where the Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s holding that the indicative starting imprisonment term for trafficking in 499.99g of cannabis is 29 years’ imprisonment. The indicative starting sentence for the present charge is 29 years’ imprisonment together with the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane.

94     The next step is for me to adjust the sentence either upward or downward after taking into account the accused’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. I agreed with the Prosecution that there were several aggravating factors namely:

> (a)     The accused’s conduct at trial demonstrates his lack of remorse;

> (b)     The accused played a key role in the transaction involving the bundle of cannabis. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that his level of culpability is high;

> (c)     The accused is a recalcitrant and a repeat offender. The accused is traced for multiple drug-related antecedents dating back to 32 years ago in 1989. He has dealt with a variety of drugs over the years. He had also continually re-offended shortly after being released from prison. I was mindful that for his first drug trafficking offence was in 19 January 2000, he was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment of 22 years’ and 15 strokes of the cane. Despite the lengthy sentence, this was not a sufficient deterrent to prevent him from re-offending.

95     I agreed with the Prosecution that there are no mitigating factors in the accused’s favour which would result in a downward adjustment of the indicative starting sentence of 29 years’ imprisonment. All things considered, I agreed with the Prosecution that there should be an uplift from the starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment, in light of the accused’s lack of remorse, high culpability and repeated offending behaviour. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

#### Enhanced sentence

96     I next considered whether an enhanced sentence should be imposed pursuant to s 50T of the Prisons Act. In the present case, having regard to the gravity of the fresh offence, its similar nature to the offence for which the accused was given a remission order and the length of time for which the accused had not reoffended, I was of the view that an enhanced sentence ought to be imposed.

97     I then applied the sentencing framework in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> (“Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman_”)_.

#### Gravity of the fresh offence

98     In the present case, the offence under s 5(1)_(a)_ read with s 5(2) MDA is a very serious offences as for which the mandatory minimum sentence is at least 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and the maximum sentence is 30 years’ or life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

#### Length of time before re-offending

99     In terms of rehabilitative prospects, I considered the fact that the fresh offence was committed about three-quarters into the accused’s remission period.

#### Similarity of fresh offence to original offence:

100    The fresh offence was similar and far more serious than the original offence under s 11(b) MDA. The accused was charged for possession for the purpose of trafficking a controlled drug himself. In addition, the amount of cannabis in the proceeded charge is nearly a capital amount.

101    The sentencing band adopted by the High Court in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman_ is set about below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.9774045190962%"> <col width="22.6554689062188%"> <col width="64.3671265746851%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of severity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to the full remaining duration</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

102    After having considered the gravity of his fresh offence and the accused’s rehabilitative prospects, I agreed that the case fell within Band 3 of the sentencing band where the sentencing range was 2/3 to the full remaining duration of his 97 days. As I considered the overall severity of his fresh drug trafficking offence to be high, I was of the view that it fell within the mid-point of Band 3. In my view the appropriate enhanced sentence for this offence is five-sixths of the remaining remission period of 97 days or 80 days’ imprisonment.

103    His total sentence is therefore an enhanced sentence of 80 days and for the fresh offence in DAC 94328-2018, 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. His sentence is to be backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest, _ie_ 20 April 2017, but with the period that the accused was not in custody and on bail (_ie_ 22 June 2020 to 27 August 2021) to be excluded from the computation of his sentence.
