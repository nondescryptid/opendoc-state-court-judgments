### District Judge James Leong Kiu Yiu:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff and the Defendant are both in the business of commodities trading and general wholesale trade. The action was commenced by the Plaintiff against the Defendant to claim the amounts on 4 post-dated cheques issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff which were countermanded. These 4 cheques and 2 others were issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff as payment pursuant to a sale and purchase contract for Myanmar White Rice (“cargo”) dated 21 June 2017. The cargo was shipped under 6 bills of lading (“bills”), with 2 bills dated 26 July 2017, another 2 bills dated 6 August 2017 and a further 2 bills dated 11 August 2017 respectively.

2       On 22 January 2019, the Plaintiff sought and obtained summary judgment for US $ 182 050 with interest and costs on the 4 cheques under Order 14 of the Rules of Court before the Learned Deputy Registrar in DC/SUM 3235/2018. On 2 April 2019, I heard and dismissed the Defendant’s appeal in RA No 19 of 2019. The Defendant has appealed against my decision to the High Court in RAS No 9 of 2019 and these are the grounds for my decision.

## Submissions of Parties

3       As highlighted by counsel for the Defendant at the outset of the RA, there was no dispute between the parties regarding the applicable law on Bills of Exchange. It was also not in dispute that under the contract, the determinative quality survey was to be done at the load port although a subsequent survey by the Defendant at the port of discharge found a higher quantity of broken rice. Both at the hearing before the Deputy Registrar and me, counsel for the Defendant confined himself to the argument that the delivery of the cheques was subject to a condition. It was submitted before me that the Plaintiff should notify the Defendant that the cargo was ready for loading and they should get the Defendant’s consent for the packaging of the rice and quality before loading. It was asserted that this agreement was reached orally between representatives of the two parties and there were WhatsApp exchanges showing that the cheques were delivered on condition as pleaded.

4       It was also pleaded that there was an express agreement between representatives of the parties that the Plaintiff would not present the 6 cheques for payment until the Defendant gave consent to the same, pending confirmation that the cargo complied with specifications.

5       Counsel for the Plaintiff agreed that there was indeed an issue relating to the quality of the bag printing at the load port and highlighted that the WhatsApp messages relating to this took place in July 2017. It was highlighted however that the cheques in question were issued in November 2017 and the Defendant had agreed to accept the post-dated cheques as an indulgence as payment was already due by then. On the discharge port survey, it was highlighted that apart from the fact that it was not determinative, it was also done much later and at all times, the cargo was with the Defendant. In essence, it was submitted that there was never any agreement that payment was to be dependent on any further survey or presentation upon confirmation. In this regard, it was highlighted that the Defendant’s email to the Plaintiff dated 1 December 2017 makes no mention of any condition, and simply sought more time to arrange funds to clear the cheques. It was also submitted that the conditions would not have been commercially realistic. In response to my query as to the context in which the cheques were sent, counsel for the Defendant noted that on the face there were no conditions but the conditions were oral.

## Analysis

6       Whether or not the Defendant would succeed in resisting the application for summary judgment on the countermanded cheques depended on whether there was conditional delivery of the cheques. In this regard, I was guided by the approach of District Judge Tan Puay Boon (as he then was) in _Lo Hing Yong v Reign Geoponics Pte Ltd \[2016\] SGDC 242_ (Lo Ying Hong) which also concerned summary judgment proceedings based on 2 dishonoured cheques. Specifically, on the issue of whether there was conditional delivery in that case, it was noted at \[38-39\] that:

_“38_      _In Marina Sports Ltd \[note: 11\] where the same defence was raised, the High Court stated that –_

_7 ….. Section 55 of the Bills of Exchange Act (Cap 23, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) stipulates in effect that the drawer of a cheque, by drawing it, engages that upon due presentation it will be paid, and if it is dishonoured, he will compensate the holder. Thus, if those were the bare facts and there was nothing more, the plaintiffs would be entitled to have summary judgment entered against the defendants….._

_39_      _In that case, conditional leave to defend was eventually granted. This was because there was a telex from the defendants to the plaintiffs stating “We even issued a postdated cheque to you with specific instructions not to deposit said cheque until further advice from us on the postdated due date.” \[note: 12\] In the present case, there was no evidence of the relationship between Insignia Holdings Pte Ltd and the parties, let alone any documentation of the condition for delivery of the cheques. The Defendant has therefore also not established as a triable issue whether the delivery of the cheques were conditional.”_

7       Our case bore striking similarities to the decision in Lo Ying Hong in relation to the absence of any documentation or contemporaneous evidence to support the Defendant’s contention of a triable issue. As indicated to parties in my brief oral grounds dismissing the RA, having reheard the matter, I found myself in full agreement with the Deputy Registrar that this was a plain and obvious case for summary judgment based on the countermanded cheques and there were no triable issues. In this regard, the purported conditions were unsupported by any credible evidence and the WhatsApp exchanges were equivocal, in addition to being held prior to the issuance of the cheques.

8       All things considered, the factual matrix, documents and correspondence pointed to a clear case for summary judgment for the Plaintiff. As noted by counsel for the Plaintiff, the purported condition was raised very late in the day, after the payment of the first 2 cheques, which presumably would have been issued under the same conditions. It is also pertinent to note that agreeing to these conditions made no commercial sense for the Plaintiff, making it even more important for the Defendant to document the oral conditions, if that was indeed the position agreed to by parties. Finally, it was particularly telling that the Defendant’s email of 1 December 2017 seeking indulgence from the Plaintiff made no mention whatsoever of the purported conditions under which the cheques were issued.

## Conclusion

9       In light of all of the above, I dismissed the RA with costs to the Plaintiff fixed at $ 5000 plus disbursements of $ 408.50 and GST.
