Criminal law – Offence – s 201(a) Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, Rev Ed 2006)

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9122/2021/01.\]

5 July 2021

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused faced 60 charges under s 201(a) and punishable under s 204(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, Rev Ed 2006) (“SFA”) for employing a scheme to defraud and three charges under s 201(b) and punishable under s 204(1) of the SFA for engaging in a practice which operated as a deceit on City Index Asia Pte Ltd (‘City Index’). He pleaded guilty to 20 charges under s 201(a) of the SFA and one charge under s 201(b) of the SFA. The remaining 42 charges were taken into consideration with the consent of the accused for the purpose of sentence.

2       He entered 107 false orders (35 for proceeded charges and 72 for the TIC charges) and executed 60 spoof trades. The total profit from the 60 spoof trades was $24,195.83. He was sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment on each of the s 201(a) charges with two sentences to run consecutively. He was fined $30,000 (in default one month’s imprisonment) on the s 201(b) charge. His total sentence was six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $30,000. He has paid the fine.

3       The prosecution has appealed only in respect of the sentences imposed on the s 201(a) charges. The prosecution has sought a 14-week term. Accordingly, a stay on the execution of the sentence was granted.

## Summary of facts

4       The accused had a Contracts for Differences (‘CFD’) trading account with City Index, a cash trading account with Lim & Tan Securities Pte Ltd (‘L&T’) and a margin trading account with L&T. His CFD account was terminated by City Index on 30 April 2018. Thereafter, the accused used three CFD accounts belonging to his friends with City Index to make the CFD trades.

5       The accused transacted in CFDs which were based on securities listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (‘SGX’). The accused knew that the CFDs for securities that he was transacting with City Index were generally priced according to the real-time prices of underlying securities listed on SGX. This meant that the CFD provider would generally allow investors to execute long trades based on the lowest price the underlying security could be bought off SGX and investors could execute short trades based on the highest price the underlying security could be sold on SGX. Hence, the accused decided to profit from trading in CFDs by influencing the prices of the underlying securities. This strategy to defraud is known to the trade as ‘spoofing’.

6       The strategy involved entering fraudulent orders in the securities market to artificially increase the best bid price and decrease the best offer price of the underlying securities in order to fraudulently induce City Index to react to the deceptive market information that had been created, and with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution. The accused’s strategy moved the prices of CFDs in a direction favourable to him, enabling him to purchase CFDs at prices which are lower and to sell at higher prices. Using this technique he profited at the expense of City Index, as City Index would have to pay him based on his trades in the CFDs and could not hedge the transactions (reduce its risk in the transaction). In a typical trade, a CFD provider hedges the transaction by transacting in the underlying asset at prices of CFDs bought and sold, so that the CFD provider can pay investors if the investors make a profit from the profit the CFD provider makes itself in the securities market. However, when the accused executed his scheme, City Index was unable to perform these underlying trades as the accused removed the false orders in the securities market before City Index could execute such trades.

7       He engaged in trading on 31 separate days over a period of eight months in April, May, June, July, October, November and December 2018. He executed the strategy in respect of three SGX-listed securities. He entered 107 orders through the securities accounts and 60 trades through the CFD accounts to make a total profit of $24,195.83. The accused made restitution of $18,378.95 to City Index, which City Index accepted as final settlement taking into account the commissions and taxes incurred on the trades.

8       The 60 CFD trades and the individual profit is listed in the Annex to the SOF. The details in respect of the 20 proceeded charges are found at \[24\] to \[44\] of the SOF.

## Address on sentence

9       The prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of at least 14 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 201(a) charges. The following factors were highlighted.

#### (a)   Extent of gain

10     The accused made a profit of $24,195.83. The prosecution agreed that credit ought to be given for the restitution of $18,378.95 (excluding commission and taxes).

#### (b)   Extent of premeditation and sophistication

11     There was a high degree of premeditation to design a sophisticated modus operandi that was well thought out. The design of the fraudulent scheme was such that the accused would always profit at City Index’s expense by ensuring that the buy price of the CFD would always be lower than the sell price as he could set both by swiftly deleting the buy and sell orders on SGX for the underlying securities, often (if not always) within seconds.

#### (c)   Use of multiple accounts

12     The accused was not deterred when his City Index CFD trading account was terminated. Instead, he boldly asked three friends for access to their accounts to continue the fraudulent trades.

#### (d)   Difficulty of detection

13     It is difficult for regulators to discern whether the placing of the orders and then cancelling them subsequently is for legitimate reasons or not. As the accused manipulated the prices of the underlying securities on the market, the exchange regulator and the CFD provider would each only see half of what the accused was doing. This makes it extremely difficult for detection.

#### (e)   Frequency and duration

14     The accused made a total of 60 fraudulent CFD trades over eight months.

#### (f)   Motivation

15     The spoofing was carried out with the motive to profit. The commission of an offence for personal gain is generally an aggravating consideration.

## Mitigation

16     The accused is 50 years of age. He is single and resides with his partially disabled sister and brother who suffers from cancer. His parents passed away when he was a first year undergraduate and he supported himself during his tertiary studies. He worked as an account manager at a chemical specialist company since 2007. He resigned in March 2021 due to the criminal proceedings.

17     The accused started trading in CFDs with City Index in November 2017 until his account was closed on 30 April 2018 without any reasons provided to him. The accused then used the accounts of his three friends to trade.

18     The defence relied on the following personal mitigating factors.

#### (a)   Full restitution

19     The accused made full restitution to City Index of $18,378.95 after deduction of the commissions and tax. The restitution was made ‘at the earliest opportunity once the figure was settled by the Prosecution after representations’.

#### (b)   Good character

20     The accused had an unblemished record. He has contributed back to the community by participating in charitable and social work.

#### (c)   Full cooperation with authorities and plea of guilt

21     The accused fully cooperated with the Commercial Affairs Department (‘CAD’) and provided all the information requested. He also pleaded guilty.

22     Learned counsel highlighted the financial impact on the accused. He suffered a loss of about $5,700 due to the CFD positions that he was forced to close. He also lost his promising career where he earned an income of more than $150,000 annually.

23     Learned counsel submitted that the custodial threshold was not crossed as the accused’s case was less aggravated than _PP v Tey Thean Yang Dennis_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 120</span> (‘_Dennis Tey_’) where I had sentenced the offender to 12 weeks’ imprisonment on the s 201(a) charge and 4 weeks’ imprisonment on the section s 201(b) charge, making a total sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Sentence

24     The offence carries a maximum fine of $250,000 or an imprisonment term of up to seven years or both.

25     The relevant sentencing objective for financial market-related crimes is general deterrence (see \[27\] of _Public Prosecutor v Wang Zhi Able_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 1082</span>). As to when the specific offending conduct crosses the custody threshold turns on culpability and harmfulness of the conduct. A non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered have been set out by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span> at \[58\]. In _Lee Chee Keet v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1316</span>, it was held that not all the factors enumerated in _Ng Sae Kiat_ might be relevant in every case and that it is necessary to consider all the factors of the case to determine if the offending conduct in question warrants a custodial sentence. The factors that assist to determine the level of culpability are broadly as follows:

> (i)     Sophistication of the scheme to defraud

> (ii)     Level of planning and steps to evade detection

> (iii)     Scale, frequency and duration of the offending conduct

> (iv)     Extent of gain

> (v)     Position of the accused

26     Harm is assessed by reference to the following factors:

> (i)     Distortion of the operation of the market

> (ii)     Consequential financial harm

> (iii)     Difficulty of detection

27     As the defence has not appealed against the imprisonment term, I would simply state that having regard to the factors, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that the custodial threshold is crossed.

28     As for the length of the imprisonment term, the prosecution agreed with the defence submission that the culpability of the accused is lesser than that of the offender in _Dennis Tey_. It was submitted that the prosecution has accordingly calibrated the individual sentences to be seven weeks’ imprisonment per charge and was seeking a global term of 14 weeks’ imprisonment as opposed to the 16 weeks’ imprisonment which I had meted out to _Dennis Tey_.

29     To begin with, I would point out the fact that the accused faced 60 charges, whereas _Dennis Tey_ faced 18 charges under s 201(1)(a) is irrelevant. The accused faced more charges simply because the prosecution chose to frame a separate charge in respect of each CFD trade. For _Dennis Tey_, there was an amalgamation of multiple CFD trades which resulted in the lesser number of 18 charges despite the significantly overall higher number of CFD trades.

30     I did not agree it was correct to make a comparison with the 16 weeks’ aggregate imprisonment term because it comprised of the four week term for the separate and distinct s 201(b) charge. The sentence that was attributable to the s 201(a) offences was 12 weeks’ imprisonment. In the instant case, the prosecution agreed that the s 201(b) charge did not warrant a custodial sentence. By asking for a 14-week term, the prosecution was effectively asking for a higher sentence than what _Dennis Tey_ had received although the prosecution rightly conceded that the accused’s culpability was lower in comparison. I would add that the harm was also lesser, especially have regard to the fact that the accused had made timely restitution.

31     I will make a comparison between the two cases to explain why I calibrated the sentence downwards to an aggregate term of six weeks’ imprisonment which is half the sentence which _Dennis Tey_ received.

#### (i)   Sophistication of the scheme

32     The mechanics of the strategy adopted in both cases was to exploit the loophole in the real-time interdependency between the pricing of the CFDs and the underlying securities. This was done by cancelling the orders of the securities after they had been placed. In _Dennis Tey_, the offender had also utilised a function available on the CFD trading platform which automated the process of closing the CFD trades. The accused was unaware of the availability of such a function.

33     The manual cancellation of orders involved no elaborate means and I therefore disagreed that the mechanics of the strategy was sophisticated.

#### (ii)   Level of planning and steps to evade detection

34     With respect to the level of planning and steps to evade detection, learned counsel referred to \[34\] of the decision in _Dennis Tey_ where I listed five factors which showed that the scheme was carefully thought out. Paragraph 34 is reproduced below:

> 34    The scheme was carefully thought out and planned to ensure its success. The accused had observed that the prices of CFDs were updated almost immediately after the false orders in the underlying securities were placed. He realised that he could therefore exploit this by quickly executing trades in the CFDs and deleting the false orders in the securities as there was a low chance that an investor could match the false orders within the short period of time. In order to ensure the success of his plan, he took the following additional precautions:

>> (a)    He picked securities which were not traded frequently.

>> (b)    He picked securities which had a significant difference between the best bid and best offer price. This was necessary as the spoofing technique involved temporarily narrowing the difference between the two prices.

>> (c)    He ensured that the CFD trades would be accepted immediately by keeping the volume of CFD trades to be lower than the volume of securities orders.

>> (d)    He utilised a function available on the CFD trading platform which automated the process of closing the CFD trade for over 80 per cent of his CFD trades. He used this to ensure that the CFD position would be closed immediately once the CFD provider updated the prices of the CFDs to reflect the prevailing prices as set by the false securities orders thereby obviating the need to manually close the CFD position which require more time.

>> (e)    He also masked his identity by using the trading accounts belonging to others to perpetrate the scheme.

35     Learned counsel submitted that \[34(c)\] to \[34(e)\] did not apply and only \[34(a)\] and \[34(b)\] were applicable to the instant case. This was not disputed by the prosecution. In respect of \[34(e)\], the accused had initially used his CFD account. He was unaware why it was terminated. It was only upon termination, that he used the accounts of others. The prosecution accepted that the accused’s intention to use his friends accounts was not to mask his identity although it had the effect of it.

#### (iii)   Scale, frequency and duration of the offending conduct

36     In _Dennis Tey_, there were 17 SGX-listed securities, 465 false orders through the securities account and 325 trades through the CFD accounts. The offender also traded with two CFD providers. In contrast, the accused’s scheme involved only three SGX-listed securities, 107 false orders through the securities account and 60 trades through the CFD account. In addition, he only traded with one CFD provider.

37     As for the duration, although the accused’s offending took place over a longer period of about eight months as opposed to the over two month period (24 October 2012 to 8 January 2013) in _Dennis Tey_, learned counsel highlighted that 90% of the spoof trades were executed during the over two month period from 5 April to 14 June 2018 and only six trades were done between July (one), October (two), November (one) and December (two) 2018. As such, there was no sustained offending over the entire eight month period. In addition, I think it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the accused’s overall offending when he engaged in trading was in fact shorter; it took place over 34 days as compared to the 50 separate days for _Dennis Tey_.

#### (iv)   Extent of gain

38     The quantum of gain is a material consideration. In _Dennis Tey_, the profit made totalled $30,239. In the instant case, the gain was slightly lower in the sum of $24,195.83.

#### (v)   Abuse of position

39     The offender in _Dennis Tey_ was a trading representative in the financial industry. There was thus a clear breach of responsibility as a trading representative. In contrast, this aggravating factor was absent as the accused is a retail investor.

## Harm

#### (i)   Distortion of the operation of the market

40     Similar to _Dennis Tey_, there is no evidence that the cancelled orders in securities had misled the general investing public. Apart from that, I noted that any market impact in the instant case was far more limited as it involved three SGX-listed counters and 107 false orders, as opposed to the 17 SGX-listed securities and the 465 false orders (which is four times more) in _Dennis Tey_.

#### (ii)   Consequential financial harm

41     In _Dennis Tey_, the financial harm was to two CFD providers. Here, there was one CFD provider. The overall gain in the instant case is also lower. However, the main distinguishing factor from _Dennis Tey’s_ case is that the accused has disgorged his gains. There was no restitution or surrender of the illegal gains in _Dennis Tey_.

#### (iii)   Difficulty of detection

42     The difficulty of detecting commercial crimes has been held to be a factor which justifies imposing a heavy sentence when such crimes are uncovered and prosecuted (_PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25(d)\]).

43     The accused’s trading where he had used his own CFD account was detected within 11 days of the first spoof trade. However, the trading with the use of his friends accounts would have required more effort. To put it in proper perspective, one account of the friend was used for one trade, another account for six trades and rest of the trades were done with the same account.

44     The fact that the orders were in two separate markets – the securities market monitored by SGX and the CFD market as provided and monitored by the CFD provider necessarily meant that the SGX and the CFD provider were only able to see part of the trading data and were unable to see the whole picture.

#### Personal mitigation

45     The accused had a hitherto clean record. I gave him full credit for his timely plea of guilt as taken together with the cooperation in the course of investigations and timely restitution, it signified that the plea was motivated by genuine remorse.

#### Conclusion

46     Taking into account the lesser scale (60 spoof trades and 107 false orders and trading over 31 days in the instant case versus 325 spoof trades and 465 false orders and trading over 50 days), the lesser planning, the lack of any abuse of position and restitution in comparison with _Dennis Tey_, I calibrated the sentence to three weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with two terms to consecutively, making a total of six weeks’ imprisonment. In my view, this was a more just and appropriate calibration of the accused’s culpability and harm.
