Contract – Misrepresentation – Fraudulent – Inducement – Rescission

Civil procedure – Costs

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 2/2019.\]

13 March 2019

### District Judge Loo Ngan Chor:

## INTRODUCTION:

1       The defendant (“Awa”) has appealed against my decision to allow the plaintiff’s claim and to dismiss its counter-claim against the plaintiff (“Zweec”) and the second defendant to the counter-claim, Mr Liaw Kok Eng (“Liaw”).

2       The trial took place over six days in three tranches.

3       Zweec had two witnesses, Mr Jeremy Heng Mok Choon and Ms Cecilia Chow Min Po. Liaw testified for himself. Awa had six affidavits of evidence-in-chief by as many deponents of whom eventually three gave evidence, namely, Mr Fong Kok Wei (“Fong”), Ms Ong Bee Choo Denise and Mr Neo Eng Chuan @ Liang Yong Quan Ronstan.

4       Zweec’s claim was invoiced to Awa on 28th March 2012 vide no. I2001 for $67,538.40 (with GST) towards “20% payment for project commencement” and “40% payment for fabrication component”. Awa paid $10,000 on 19th April 2012 towards the invoice. I allowed Zweec’s claim in the sum of $57,538.40 which was for the balance payment under the invoice due pursuant to a contract dated 1st February 2012 (“the Contract”), drafted by parties. Awa’s counter-claim was inter alia for rescission of the Contract because of six allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations by Liaw.

5       I set out the reasons for my decision. The brevity of this judgment belies how fraught Awa made its case. Owing to the strange way in which Awa chose to present its case – a story long and unstructured in the narrative and short on proof or contradicted by documents with multiplex reliefs many of which were dropped on the first two days of trial – I shall set out in these grounds what I consider the essential disputes and avoid the circumambulatory details that Awa took me through. Where matters are left out, it may be taken that I considered them irrelevant.

## BACKGROUND:

6       So far as concerns the dispute, Awa manufactures “environmental monitoring solutions”, including water analysers for industrial use, as it describes itself in its pleading. Zweec and Liaw saw Zweec as a spin-off from the Awa in that Zweec’s business was that of using video analytics technology for the same purpose.

7       Liaw joined Awa either in September 2008 (according to Awa) or in January 2009 (according to Liaw), after he left his employ by a prawn farming business. Liaw was first Awa’s technical manager before becoming Awa’s Vice President of Business Development in May 2011. Liaw officially left Awa’s employ on 31st March 2012 because his employment was transferred to Zweec, as evidenced by Awa’s letter dated 1st February 2012 to Liaw.

8       Fong was Awa’s principal. Fong and Liaw attended the same church and cell group. For some time, they were firm Christian friends but this dispute led to what became a bad falling out between them.

9       The pleaded preface to Awa’s case was that it contracted with PUB Consultants Pte Ltd (“PUB Consultants”) for a licence agreement dated 27th April 2009 for FAMS Know-how, FAMS being an acronym for Fish Activity Monitoring System which was a collaborative effort between the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) and the Institute for Infocomm Research (“I2R”). FAMS uses video analytics technology to observe and analyse fish behaviour and in that way to serve as an early warning system of water contamination. By a contract dated 21st April 2011 (“the Deployment and Maintenance Contract”, adopting the label used by Awa and Zweec in the Contract at \[17\] below), PUB appointed Awa to supply, install, commission and provide maintenance services for, 35 FAMS units in waterworks in Singapore. Several other agreements followed in connection with FAMS including one dated 24th June 2011 for a software licence with Exploit Technologies Pte Ltd (“ETPL”) (a company related to A\*Star). There were also an Agreement for Research Collaboration dated 1st July 2011 with I2R and one dated 11th July 2011 with PUB for Development and Optimization of FAMS for Use in Raw Water (“R&D Contract”, again adopting the label used by Awa and Zweec in the Contract at \[17\] below ).

10     Liaw was Awa’s staff placed in charge overall with respect to these FAMS contracts and work related to the FAMS contracts.

11     As these projects were happening, Liaw and Fong were discussing the possibility of Fong giving up majority control of Awa in favour of Mr Jeremy Heng and of incorporating a company to concentrate on FAMS and video analytics. It is reasonably clear that Zweec was this company that parties envisaged and Zweec’s name was actually an acronym comprising the letters of several individuals’ names, including Liaw’s (one of the “e” letters) and Fong’s (the “w”). Zweec was incorporated on 11th August 2011.

## Fong’s letter dated 21st December 2011:

12     Fong wrote a letter dated 21st December 2011 to Liaw, which showed that Fong had had a change of heart. A few things in the letter are noteworthy:

a)     Fong spoke of “the recent transition (having) been difficult for me.”

b)     He had to “choose between 2 bad options.” He had decided “to take back Awa.” He would “not release majority control of Awa”.

c)     He tells Liaw to “take FAMS to your new companies and go for your ambition.”

d)     He would not, however, “allow the analyser business to be affected.”

e)     Fong said that Liaw “promised me shares in Zweec. I presume sharing of profits in your new companies. I leave it to you to give me fair and equitable sharing.”

13     Fong was to say at trial that he was unaware of Zweec’s incorporation, that it surprised him, and which he found out only on 16th December 2011. This was clearly contradicted by what Fong’s letter dated 21st December 2011 did say and its general tenor.

## The Contract:

14     Eventually, Zweec and Awa signed the Contract which both Fong and Liaw had a hand in drafting.

15     Fong signed the Contract as Managing Director of and on behalf of Awa. Liaw signed it as Chief Executive Officer of and on behalf of Zweec, even though Liaw was not to be officially with Zweec until 1st April 2012.

16     I now outline the Contract:

i)     Recital 1 speaks of reversing a verbal agreement for Fong to “sell Awa’s majority shares” to Liaw “and partners” owing to “disagreement on the details during its execution.”

ii)     Recital 3 speaks of there having been disagreement in approach to the FAMS business and Fong suggesting “for Awa to release FAMS to” Liaw “and partners”, and that the latter had “appointed Zweec to take over FAMS, its related obligations and its future development.”

17     The Contract provided, amongst other things, that:

iii)     Awa shall return sums of $40,000 and $80,000, being sums paid into Awa’s bank account in July and November 2011 towards the aborted share acquisition. Clause 1 stated that $40,000 had been returned in January 2012 and $80,000 would be returned when Awa had received sufficient funds “from PUB, taking into consideration(s) (sic) the current cashflow situation that Awa is facing.”

iv)     Awa was “to novate all FAMS related license agreement (sic) to Zweec”, expressly referring to the licence agreements with ETPL and with PUB Consultants (mentioned at \[9\] above).

v)     In respect of the Deployment and Maintenance Contract, Zweec was to take over the deployment part of the contract from 1st April 2012 as well as the maintenance part of the contract.

vi)     In respect of the “R&D Contract (PUB tender reference no. 3100700) – for use in raw water”, which was a reference to the R&D Contract, clause 5 provided that Zweec was to take over from Awa “with immediate effect till project completion.”. Clause 5(ii) provided that Awa would issue a purchase order to Zweec for net amounts payable to Zweec “according to the amount highlighted under the payment breakdown in Appendix 3”, which stated a total sum of $105,200 ($112,564, with GST). At Appendix 3 of the Contract, which is headed “FAMS raw water R&D Project Payment Breakdown”, the last sub-heading reads “Payment Schedule by Awa to Zweec” under which it is provided that at “Project Commencement” 20% or $21,040 (before GST), and, at “Completion of Fabrication of FAMS h/w, implementation of video enhancement s/w and sensor/video fusion s/w” 40% or $42,080, are payable. These pertain to the amounts sued on by Zweec, after taking out a sum of $10,000 paid by Awa to Zweec in April 2012.

vii)     Clause 6 provided that “In the event that PUB exercise options in existing contract, or PUB has a new need to tender or for further FAMS deployment, an agreement between Awa and Zweec shall be further negotiated …”

viii)     Clause 7 stated that “With immediate effect, Zweec shall take over and follow up with all FAMS related matters in Taiwan and China.”

ix)     Clause 9 provided that Awa was to transfer to Zweec by 31st March 2012 “all assembly instructions, BOM, maintenance toolset, remaining stock and inventory for FAMS.”

## MY FINDINGS:

## Awa’s claim to rescind the Contract:

18     Awa’s principal case – it had numerous other claims – was for rescission of the Contract because of Liaw’s six alleged misrepresentations. These misrepresentations were allegedly because:

1)     Liaw had stated in an email of 30th January 2012 to the effect that there was potentially $110,000 more to be made. As pleaded, this had the meaning that “PUB will pay \[Awa\] the sum of $110,000 being costs for additional works requested by PUB arising from PUB’s requirement to locate \[FAMS units\] outdoors.”

2)     Liaw had stated in an email of 7th January 2012 that if PUB were to “exercise the option to purchase the remaining 25 \[FAMS\] units”, Zweec would manage the project with profits to be shared 50:50 with Awa.

3)     Liaw had stated in an email dated 7th January 2012 that Awa was on schedule to deploy all 35 FAMS units by 31st March 2012.

4)     Liaw had stated in an email dated 7th January 2012 that Zweec would undertake “the maintenance of the FAMS units under the PUB FAMS contract.” This referred to the Deployment and Maintenance Contract.

5)     Liaw had stated in an email dated 7th January 2012 that “Zweec will undertake the PUB Agreement dated 11 July 2011”. This referred to the R&D Contract.

6)     Liaw had stated in an email dated 7th January 2012 that \[whilst Zweec would undertake the agreement dated 11th July 2011\], technical support would come from I2R and Liaw “had agreed with I2R management for Awa to front the project and Awa will sign a back to back agreement with I2R to support the project.”

19     Awa’s case was that these misrepresentations were fraudulent and induced it to enter into the Contract and to, amongst other things, novate the software licence agreement dated 24th June 2011 with ETPL (by a novation agreement dated 25th April 2012) and the licence agreement dated 27th April 2009 with PUB Consultants (by a novation agreement dated 22nd May 2012).

20     Zweec and Liaw’s pleaded denials of the alleged misrepresentations or that they were fraudulent or that Awa was induced to enter into the Contract because of the alleged misrepresentations.

21     The making of the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations was at the heart of Awa’s case. Fraud requires a high level of probabilities in the proof, and that, as I understand it, entails challenging an opposite witness who says the contrary.

22     In _Panatron Pte Ltd and another_ v _Lee Cheow Lee and another_ at \[14\], the Court of Appeal spoke to the following five elements of a fraudulent representation:

… First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct. Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing. Fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.

23     The legal burden of proof concerning the five elements constituting fraudulent misrepresentations - including that they were fraudulent, that they induced Awa into entering into the Contract and that Awa suffered damages - lay squarely and fixedly on Awa. (See _Power Solar System Co Ltd (In Liquidation)_ v _Suntec Power Investment Pte Ltd_ at \[77\]-\[79\].)

24     Zweec’s learned counsel, Mr Collin Choo, and Liaw’s learned counsel, Mr Alagappan, with respect, correctly pointed out in their closing submissions that Awa’s learned counsel, Mr William Chan, failed to put to any of the relevant witnesses questions concerning the alleged misrepresentations.

25     In _Tan Kok Yong Steve_ v _Itochu Singapore Pte Ltd_ , the High Court had this to say at \[44\] about the imperative to put one’s case:

It is also interesting to note that the Defendant’s counsel did not cross-examine the Plaintiff at all about the meeting on 23 June 2016. The rule in Browne v Dunn \[1894\] 6 R 67, as explained in Phipson on Evidence (Hodge M. Malek gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th ed, 2013) at paras 12–35, states:

As a rule a party should put to each of his opponent’s witnesses in turn so much of his own case as concerns that particular witness, or in which he had a share… If he asks no questions he will generally be taken to accept the witness’ account… \[emphasis added\]

This definition of the rule in Browne v Dunn has been endorsed in the context of civil proceedings by the English Court of Appeal in Deepak Fertilizers & Petrochemicals Ltd v Davy McKee (UK) London Ltd \[2002\] EWCA Civ 1396. It has also been applied locally in Wama Binte Buang v Martin Lee and Another .

27     In Awa’s reply submissions, Mr Chan made points that the _Browne_ v _Dunn_ rule was only “prima facie and the court must look at the totality of the evidence”, “presupposes the witness had given contradictory evidence” and that the rule “concerned the appellate jurisdiction in the review of evidence at trial.” With respect, the last two points were clearly wrong on principle and the first wrong in fact in this case.

28     Purely in respect of the characterisation of the statements as representations, leaving aside the issue of fraud, whether Liaw intended to induce or inducement in fact, or whether Awa suffered any damages, it seemed to me that none of the statements (except possibly (1) and (6) below) could be characterised as representations, as per the sequence at \[18\] above:

1)     Liaw’s point was that PUB was not committing itself to give any additional work so that there was no certainty concerning the sum of $110,000. That being Liaw’s representation, properly understood, it did not bear the meaning (at \[18(1)\] above) Awa assigned to it, ie, that Awa would definitely be getting that sum from PUB.

2)     Liaw’s point concerning the 25 FAMS units, read with clause 6 of the Contract, was not a statement of fact in that this depended on the contingency of PUB purchasing another 25 FAMS units. In any case, Awa did not place in evidence the “specifications and schedule of prices to be prepared describing the goods and/or services to be executed” which were documents to be read with the Deployment and Maintenance Contract so that it could not show that that contract did not contain such an option as Awa alleged.

3)     Liaw’s statement was that “Awa will complete the PUB deployment tender of the 35 units of FAMS (projected to end by March 2012)”. This was expressly a projection and not a statement of fact.

4)     Liaw’s statement that Zweec would take over maintenance of the FAMS units found its way into clause 4 of the Contract (at \[17(v)\] above). As I shall explain below, Zweec did in fact take over maintenance of the FAMS units until it was stymied by Awa. Equally, this statement was one of future intention and not of fact.

5)     In respect of the R&D Contract, my foregoing remarks at (4) apply. Clause 5 of the Contract provided for Zweec to take over the R&D Contract.

6)     As for I2R’s alleged failure to provide technical support for the R&D Contract, Awa did not call I2R to testify on its behalf. Parties appeared to be content to rely on certain emails involving I2R. An email dated 15th October 2012 from I2R appeared to say that Awa had confused I2R’s obligations which it had fulfilled, with Awa’s request for I2R to assist in fulfilling the maintenance obligations (under the Deployment and Maintenance Contract) in respect of the 35 FAMS units installed for PUB.

29     I now advert to the circumstances surrounding how PUB forbade Zweec from further gaining access to “the PUB site on 27th September 2012”. It was Cecilia Chow’s evidence that Zweec had been carrying out maintenance works on the FAMs units on that date when she received a telephone call from PUB that “we should stop all works on site as instructions had been given by \[Awa\] to PUB that we were going to be replaced by a new team” from Awa. Zweec ascertained that PUB had emailed to Fong on 16th September 2012 that with maintenance to run for 24 months from commissioning of the FAMS project on 22nd September 2012, to request Awa to “submit the names of Awa’s standby maintenance team”. In reply, Awa by its letter dated 21st September 2012 headed “Change of Key Personnel”, named persons from Awa, including Fong, to replace the “outgoing” team, including Liaw. In my view, far from Liaw having misrepresented a willingness to take over maintenance under the Deployment and Maintenance Contract or work under the R&D Contract, it was Awa that was in repudiatory breach of the Contract in having pulled the rug from under Zweec. Awa, acting through Fong, had responded to PUB’s request post-commissioning to name a standby maintenance team by altogether replacing the maintenance team from Zweec. Fong clearly meant to keep Zweec from carrying on with the Contract. In this regard, Mr Chan was to make a surprising point in closing that Zweec could still have continued with its job by working under Awa’s name.

30     Having discussed the nature of the statements, I deal briefly with the absence of the other elements required for a cause of action in fraudulent misrepresentation.

31     I did not discern that any of these statements by Liaw were made with a view that they should be relied on for the purpose of inducing Awa to enter into the Contract or that Awa did so rely. It would be recalled that it is apparent from Fong’s letter of 21st December 2011 (before any of Liaw’s statements complained about) and the Contract that Fong had changed his mind about re-structuring Awa to cope with FAMS even though Awa had received sums totalling $120,000 towards the purchase of shares in Zweec. It was entirely Fong’s own idea to give up FAMS to Liaw and Zweec. Fong had expressly given his reasons for this change of mind: Awa had been his hard work for a long time. Whilst Awa’s work was in environmental solutions, it had not until FAMS any involvement in video analytics. This being the case, I also needed persuading how Awa saw that any additional financial benefits related to the Contract were a factor in a decision Fong had already taken to give up FAMS, ie, that Awa was induced. In respect of the allegation relating to an additional 25 FAMS units (\[18(2)\] and \[28(2)\] above), I noted that Fong himself had signed the Deployment and Maintenance Contract and, presumably, the unavailable Specifications. So, Fong could not credibly complain without more that he was induced.

32     Whilst Awa made complaints concerning Zweec’s alleged failures, such as delays (which really had to do with cabling issues said by Zweec to have needed fixing by a third party), there was no proof that Awa suffered any damages. PUB was not called to testify.

33     In respect of whether Liaw had made any of the statements knowing that they were false or not caring whether they were true or false, no effort was expended to show this. On the contrary, one email from Liaw impressed me. In response to Fong’s email of 3rd January 2012 where Fong asked Liaw to “please suggest fair and equitable principles for terms and conditions”, Liaw replied by email on the same day at 6.02pm that “Re: FAMS Im sorry KW, Im really not in the position to suggest at all. Base (sic) on the recent event, I learnt that my ‘fair’ may not be the same as yours. Pleases indicate what you think is fair to you and allow me to work from there.” Liaw’s email manifested that Liaw was unlikely to have deliberately set about making any misrepresentations to procure the Contract.

34     Fong claimed that he only found out about Zweec’s incorporation only much later, on 16th December 2011. I found that Fong could not have been unaware of Zweec’s incorporation for several reasons, including the following:

a)     In November 2011, Zweec had paid a sum of $80,000 towards the purchase of shares in Awa;

b)     Fong was aware that the acronym that was Zweec included a letter of his name even though he was now to say that he doubted that his name was actually reflected;

c)     Fong’s letter of 21st December 2011 was entirely silent on his allegedly recent and irksome discovery when surely one would have expected him to have stated this. Indeed, the tenor of this letter was one of seeking understanding for his change of mind.

d)     On 18th July 2011, in whatsapp exchanges between Liaw and Fong, when following Liaw’s text that he was “very disappointed with you \[Fong\]”, Fong replied praising Liaw’s contributions to Awa without which “awa might have down sized 1 yr ago”, and then added that “zweec must go on with or without me is ok…” and “I feel bad about zweec. U can use my name if u need…”

## Allowing Zweec’s claim and dismissing Awa’s rescission claim:

35     The discussion hitherto takes me to my decision concerning Zweec’s claim. Awa had issued its purchase order no. 6587 dated 21st March 2012 for the sum of $105,200, which with GST of $7364, came to $112,564 (as mentioned at \[17(vi) above, in respect of clause 5(ii) of the Contract. It was described as being for “R&D contract in accordance with Awa-Zweec agreement dated 1st February 2012 point 5”. The corresponding bills by Awa to PUB were invoice no. 6062 dated 23rd September 2011 and invoice no. 6099 dated 12th January 2012 . These two invoices bear handwritten notes that they had been paid on 24 or 29th December 2011 – the 2nd digit was not quite legible - and 12th January 2012. Fong admitted in cross-examination by Mr Choo that PUB had made payments of these invoices.

36     I therefore allowed Zweec’s claim and dismissed Awa’s counter-claim for rescission of the Contract and consequential accounts and enquiries and damages.

## Awa’s other claims:

37     Awa’s counter-claim was for a host of reliefs including those just mentioned. It sought 23 reliefs against Zweec and 21 reliefs against Liaw. Over the first two days of what should have been the start of the trial, Awa dropped a number of its counter-claimed reliefs against Zweec and Liaw. These related to prayers (1) for accounts and profits for (a) a project called DEWS (which was an acronym for “Distress Early Warning System, Drowning Early Warning System”) and (b) for transactions and contracts secured from business trips to USA, Kuwait and Cambodia, and (2) rescission of the two novation agreements referred to at \[19\] above. In regard to the last, Awa’s aborted effort was remarkably timorous and lacking the courage of its (questionable) conviction in that ETPL and PUB Consultants were not joined as parties.

38     Awa’s purported reason for withdrawing the relevant counter-claims was “in view of the limited number of trial days in the interest of not protracting proceedings to focus the subject matter of the trial.” For my part, I found this reason hard to believe.

39     I will now address the other reliefs that Awa did press on with. I should add that owing to my findings related to the alleged misrepresentations, I was particularly circumspect with Fong’s other allegations concerning these further claims, particularly where they represented no more than his undocumented ipse dixit. My aforesaid findings were an overarching doubt over lack of credibility because Fong had sought to completely disregard contemporaneous documents that issued from his own hand.

## Claim related to business trips:

40     Between October and December 2011, Liaw and some others had made sales trips to USA, Kuwait, Taiwan, China and Cambodia for the purpose of marketing FAMS products. Awa had accused Liaw of not providing reports of these trips and wanted Liaw to provide reports of these trips (although it turned out that Fong had included a report of the Taiwan trip in his AEIC). In addition, Awa’s uniform claim arising of these claims was for Liaw and Zweec to account for “trips and transactions arising therefore”. The trips to USA, Taiwan and China included Jeremy Heng and Cecilia Chow. That for Kuwait included Cecilia Chow. Fong himself was on the trip to Taiwan.

41     As the generic factual basis for all five FAMS sales trips was the same, Awa’s withdrawal of its counter-claim relating to three trips raised a question mark about the two, Taiwan and China, that remained.

42     Be that as it may. Liaw denied that he had failed to provide reports of his trips. Liaw’s evidence was that in order to be paid expenses he incurred on those trips, he had to have submitted reports on the trips. I found this point quite plausible. Awa’s claim to the contrary was inherently implausible.

43     Liaw said that no sales had resulted from any of these trips. Indeed Fong admitted in cross-examination that no sales arose from the trips to Taiwan and China. Fong attempted to salvage this claim by saying that opportunities would have arisen for future profit. This was unpleaded.

44     Moreover, by clause 7 of the Contract (at \[17(viii)\] above), Awa had surrendered its rights for FAMS in Taiwan and China to Zweec. Since my decision was to dismiss Awa’s claim to rescind the Contract, clause 7 was a legal impediment to any accounts and profits.

45     For these reasons, I dismissed this claim.

## Claim related to IoVA Lab:

46     Awa also wanted Liaw and Zweec to account for profits and sales made from a laboratory styled Innovations of Video Analytics Laboratory (“IoVA Lab”). IoVA Lab was a collaborative venture between Zweec and I2R with its focus, as its style suggested, on video analytics.

47     Awa’s allegation was that Liaw had in September 2011 informed Fong that IoVA Lab was to be a collaboration between Awa and I2R so that it would be Awa that would “commit resources to contribute expertise to research and develop products to sell through \[Awa\].” A named staff of Awa was deployed to IoVA Lab.

48     Awa sought an account of profits made out of IoVA Lab by Zweec and Liaw.

49     This issue was not put to Liaw.

50     No documents were adduced by Awa that might have supported this assertion. If this claim were true, I would have expected that Fong would have communicated with Liaw concerning progress towards starting IoVA Lab, which would have entailed the commitment of resources by Awa.

51     Those being my considerations, I dismissed this IoVA Lab-related counter-claim.

## Some of Awa’s invoices, a remark:

52     Before I move on to deal with a last substantive point, I should mention for completeness that Awa purported to be “entitled to set-off the following invoices” against Zweec’s claim. These four invoices totalled $198,293.90. These sums were not the subject of any counter-claim against Zweec or Liaw. This issue was not addressed by Mr Chan in either his closing or reply submissions. This was even as Mr Choo addressed these in Zweec’s closing submissions. I took it that Awa had withdrawn these allegations. I would only add that save that I did not think that Awa counter-claimed these sums – Mr Choo referred to this as a counter-claim, I agreed with Mr Choo’s arguments in the closing submissions.

Awa’s claim for Liaw to repay all monies received from employ with Awa and Liaw’s bankruptcy:

53     The last substantive point that I wish to deal with relates to Awa’s claim for a declaration that Liaw had breached his duties to Awa and for repayment of all monies Liaw had received for his employment with Awa. I dismissed this claim.

54     Apart from repeating allegations concerning Liaw’s alleged wrong doings dealt with above, Awa’s case for this appeared to be that Liaw had failed to disclose that he was an undischarged bankrupt and allegedly misrepresented the reasons for his departure from his employment with a prawn farm which had failed. As for the latter, it was alleged that his “associates” from the prawn farm had in June 2016 given very different reasons for the failure of the prawn farm. Awa’s stand was that had Liaw disclosed the “true” reasons concerning the prawn farm and his bankruptcy, Awa would not have employed him or given him any senior appointments or responsibility for involvement with FAMS and PUB.

55     Seeing as how I had found against Awa concerning the alleged misrepresentations, the basic but encompassing reason for my decision to dismiss this startling claim was that only a total failure of consideration would, in the usual way, warrant a contracting party getting his money back.

56     In this case, Liaw had served Awa properly so that this claim was quite amiss.

57     Mr Chan did not put Awa’s case concerning the return of monies.

58     I found that Fong had known of Liaw’s bankruptcy; they were close Christian friends and likely shared with each other personal problems. Liaw’s evidence was that Fong had known of the bankruptcy since 2006. I believed Liaw.

59     Fong claimed that he remained unaware of Liaw’s bankruptcy until he was told of this by Chia Boon Tat on 10th May 2012. He pointed to Liaw’s curriculum vitae and an application form for employment with Awa which was prepared as part of documenting all of Awa’s employment contracts for the purpose of an ISO 9000 audit where Liaw did not complete a question concerning bankruptcy. Looking through this form , it was obvious that apart from writing out his basic particulars, Liaw did not answer numerous questions in the form, of which the bankruptcy question was merely one. The omission to answer the bankruptcy question was neither here nor there.

60     A point that Liaw made in re-examination by Mr Alagappan, which I found convincing because that is a matter of common knowledge, was that Fong, on Awa’s behalf, had to obtain the permission of the Official Assignee before Liaw could make any of the business trips also sued on by Awa.

61     I mention purely in passing that Liaw’s purported employment agreement which Awa relied on, supposedly dated 1st December 2008, was in fact a document created and signed on 1st April 2009 purely for the purpose also of the ISO 9000 audit. The handwritten date of this purported agreement “1/4/09” bore a deletion represented by a line across it, and a new date “1/12/08” was written beside the deleted date.

62     In respect of Liaw’s bankruptcy, it was pure spite that led to Fong feigning ignorance just so as to provide a slender basis to seek repayment of all emoluments paid to Liaw. The spite is apparent even from the title to the action, where Liaw is described as “A Bankrupt”. This was a totally irrelevant appendage to Liaw’s name, something unwarranted by procedure and reinforced the impression that all of this talk about undisclosed bankruptcy was simply designed to hurt and embarrass Liaw.

## CONCLUSION:

63     After I delivered brief reasons for my decision on 8th January 2019, I directed parties to file written submissions on whether I should order indemnity costs against Awa, as sought by Mr Choo and Mr Alagappan. On 15th January 2019, Awa filed its notice of appeal against my said decision.

## Indemnity costs:

64     On 25th January 2019, I made an order for Awa to pay indemnity costs fixed at $52,650 each to Zweec and Liaw. I arrived at this sum by applying an uplift of 30% to the State Courts internal guidelines for standard costs in complex cases for a monetary range approaching the District Court jurisdiction of $250,000, where a trial took six days. I also fixed disbursements payable by Awa to Zweec and Liaw at $10,741.20 and $2585.35 respectively.

65     Whilst there has been no appeal against my costs order, I state for completeness that I applied the principles stated by Millet J in _Macmillan Inc_ v _Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc_ which were accepted by the High Court in _Tan Chin Yew Joseph_ v _Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd_ . As would be apparent from my reasons herein, it was my finding that Awa did conduct its case in bad faith, as a personal vendetta against Liaw and Zweec or in an improper or oppressive manner; it was a veritable abuse of process.

66     For the above reasons, I found as I did.
