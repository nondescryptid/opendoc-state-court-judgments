## Antecedents

4       The accused was untraced.

## Submissions on Sentence

5       The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC-905192-2020 and 20 to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC-905191-2020. The sentences were to run concurrently and the overall imprisonment term should be in the higher end of the range of 23 years to 25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.

6       Counsel for the accused urged the court to impose a global sentence of 23 years and 24 strokes of the cane. The imprisonment term was to be backdated to 5th March 2019.

## Mitigation

7       Counsel highlighted that the accused had pleaded guilty and was a first time offender.

8       The accused is married with 4 young children. He used to be the sole breadwinner for the family. He committed the offence to offset his debts in Malaysia.

9       He regretted what he had done and was remorseful. He had co-operated fully with the authorities.

10     The accused asked for leniency so that he can start life afresh with his family.

11     It was contended that the accused was a courier and his role was to just deliver the drugs. Hence, the accused’s role was minimal.

## Sentencing Considerations

12     Given the nature and gravity of the offences committed, in my view, the main sentencing consideration must be one of deterrence.

13     The penalty prescribed for trafficking in a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) is a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment 15 strokes of the cane and a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment 15 strokes of the cane.

14     In determining the appropriate sentence, I applied the sentencing framework set out in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span>_ (and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Suventher Shanmugam v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span>_ (“Suventher”) at \[28\]). I also used the conversion scale set out in _PP v Tan Lye Heng <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 564</span>_ at \[125\] to derive the following indicative starting points for trafficking between 10 to 15g of diamorphine:

> (a)     10 to 11.5g: 20 to 22 years’ imprisonment;

> (b)     11.51 to 13g: 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     13.01 to 15g: 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment.

15     In the present case, the quantity of drug in the 2 charges was 12.61 grams of diamorphine and 13.74 grams of diamorphine respectively. Hence, the starting point would be 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment in respect of DAC-905191-2020 (12.61g of diamorphine) and 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment in respect of DAC-905192-2020 (13.74g of diamorphine).

16     Next, I proceeded to consider the accused’s culpability and whether there was any aggravating and mitigating factors. Having assessed the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that the accused’s culpability fell within the lower category. I accepted that his role was minimal and that he was a mere courier.

17     I gave credit to the accused for pleading guilty even though it was on the first day of the trial as time and resources had been saved. That there was an absence of antecedents was a neutral factor; indeed, the presence of related antecedents would have been aggravating (BPH v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 764</span> at \[85\]).

18     In the circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that the starting point for imprisonment for each of the offences should therefore be calibrated down as follows:

> (a)     DAC-905191-2020 (12.61g of diamorphine) – from 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment to 20 to 23 years’ imprisonment.

> (b)     DAC-905192-2020 (13.74g of diamorphine) – from 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment to 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment.

19     On the other hand, I noted that there were aggravating features in the present case. The accused had admitted to 2 TIC charges and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. I noted that both these TIC charges involved trafficking of Class A Controlled drugs in significant quantity, namely, 83.01g of Methamphetamine and 211.59g of cannabis respectively.

## Conclusion

20     Considering the above circumstances, I was of the view that the respective sentences must be adjusted to be not less than the starting indicative point and the overall sentence should be more than 23 years’ imprisonment with the mandated minimum number of caning. This was to take into account the aggravating features in the present case. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused as follows:

> (a)     DAC 905191/2020 - 20 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane

> (b)     DAC 905192/2020 - 23 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

21     The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Hence, the total sentence was 23 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane ( pursuant to s328 Criminal Procedure Code the aggregate sentence of caning is limited to 24 strokes of the cane). The imprisonment term was backdated to 5th March 2019.

22     The accused is currently serving his sentence.
