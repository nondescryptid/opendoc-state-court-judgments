### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## DCA 15/2019

1       The Plaintiffs, Sintal Enterprise Pte Ltd (“Sintal”), were at all material times, a company carrying on the business of supply and installation of marble, granite, terrazzo, ceramics and other dimensional stones.

2       The Defendants, White Cubic Pte Ltd (“White Cubic”), were at all material times, a company carrying on the business of supply and installation of marble and granite.

3       The parties had entered into a contract for the purchase and supply of marble. Sintal, as sellers, contracted to supply and sell to White Cubic, as buyers, Annaba Ivory in polished finish, in the total quantity of 2,875 square metres at the price of $114.50 per square metre (“Annaba marble”), and Annaba Ivory in polished finish skirting, in the total quantity of 2,748 metre run at the price of $14 per metre run (“Annaba skirting”). Supply was to be periodic.

4       Sintal’s claim against White Cubic arose when Sintal claimed that White Cubic had failed to finally take delivery of 417.24 square metres of Annaba marble, and 2,748 metre run of Annaba skirting, out of the original total contracted quantities.

5       Sintal claimed that the said Annaba marble and Annaba skirting (as set out in paragraph 4 above) were stored at their (Sintal’s) premises, at considerable cost to them.

6       Sintal claimed that White Cubic was liable to pay them $47,773.98 for the uncollected Annaba marble and $38,472 for the uncollected Annaba skirting.

7       Sintal further claimed that White Cubic was liable for storage costs of the uncollected Annaba marble and Annaba skirting at their premises. These storage costs were quantified, based on the formula of $2 per square foot for 600 square feet for 14 months and continuing. At the end of the stated 14 months, the amount claimed for these storage costs totalled $16,800.

8       White Cubic denied these various claims made by Sintal. White Cubic’s stand was that there were several defects in the marble supplied.

9       White Cubic’s further stand was that the original contract was varied on 2 occasions, on or about 13 October 2013, and on or about 6 December 2013. White Cubic said that pursuant to the variation in December 2013, and the acts of the parties thereafter, the contractual relations between the parties (save for payment) would come to an end, and parties would have no further claims.

10     White Cubic claimed the following defects in the marble that Sintal had been supplying:

> •    Severe tonality differences in the marble;

> •    Marble supplied was chipped at the edges;

> •    Marble supplied contained cracks;

> •    Red veins in the marble supplied;

> •    Colour variation in the marble supplied;

> •    Size of the marble supplied was smaller than what had been ordered;

> •    Suspicions that the marble delivered differed from the marble that had been approved during the dry lay process.

11     After a consideration of the evidence and the submissions of Counsel for the parties, I found that, on a balance of probabilities, White Cubic had sufficiently shown that there were indeed defects in the marble supplied. I further found, in favour of White Cubic, that Sintal had failed to respond satisfactorily to White Cubic’s complaints of the defects in the marble.

12     A consideration of the evidence further led to a finding in favour of White Cubic’s position that the contract between the parties had been varied as alleged, in particular by the events occurring in December 2013. I further found that White Cubic had finally performed their obligations and were therefore not in breach of the contract. Thus, White Cubic was not liable to Sintal for the sums claimed (as set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 above).

13     Pursuant to my finding that White Cubic had fully performed their obligations of the contract (as varied in December 2013), I allowed part of White Cubic’s Counterclaim. We shall return to a fuller consideration of White Cubic’s Counterclaim.

14     I further agreed with White Cubic’s assertion that there had been a variation of the contract in October 2013. By the variation in October 2013, Sintal was no longer obliged to carry out the dry laying of the marble prior to acceptance by White Cubic, and consequently the price of Annaba marble was reduced from $114.50 per square metre to $98 per square metre. That parties subsequently conducted themselves on this revised footing was clear from the evidence. Consideration for this variation in October 2013 was constituted by Sintal not having to carry out the dry lay process for the Annaba marble any further, and White Cubic enjoying a reduced unit price for the Annaba marble.

15     More contentious during the trial was White Cubic’s assertion that the contract between the parties was substantially varied by an agreement in December 2013 to vary the original contractual obligations.

16     I accepted the contention of White Cubic that the continued ill performance of Sintal’s supply of the marble led ultimately to the agreement to the variation of the contract in December 2013.

17     Before turning to the more relevant details of the variation effected in December 2013, we should consider briefly the issue of consideration for such a variation.

18     In White Cubic’s Closing Written Submissions (at paragraphs 31 to 35), Counsel for White Cubic make a case for dispensing with the need to show consideration where variations of contracts are concerned. Counsel cited commentary in The Law of Contract in Singapore concerning the development of law in this area in New Zealand. Suffice to say, we would have to consider the issue with the background of the law as it currently stands in Singapore.

19     What Counsel for Sintal were arguing was that there was no consideration for the variation pleaded by White Cubic, as parties were simply performing the contract as previously entered into and agreed.

20     I could not agree with Sintal’s assertion. The evidence of the events that led to the variation effected in December 2013 showed that Sintal were not satisfactorily performing their end of the bargain, as demonstrated by the inadequate quality of the marble supplied to White Cubic.

21     In coming to the compromise which parties did in December 2013, White Cubic would have at least impliedly agreed to forego any remedies they may have had against Sintal for Sintal’s unsatisfactory performance of their contractual obligations. Once the further batches of marble had been collected by White Cubic pursuant to the agreed variation in December 2013, and payment made by White Cubic, both parties would then be released from their respective contractual obligations, without further claims made.

22     I therefore found that there was sufficient and adequate consideration to support the agreed variation of the original contract.

23     The material parts of the variation effected in December 2013, relevant to the decision as to the parties’ respective rights, are pleaded in White Cubic’s Defence and Counterclaim and are set out in the following paragraphs 24 to 30.

24     The balance of the Annaba marble and the Annaba skirting was agreed to be in the total amount of 800 square metres (with an allowance of plus or minus 10%). This, White Cubic refers to collectively as the “Remaining Annaba Marble”.

25     White Cubic would be allowed to inspect the Remaining Annaba Marble by taking out between 5 to 6 pieces from each crate to ensure conformity with the samples as selected and approved by the Architect as per the original agreement. This inspection was to be carried out on a mutually agreed date. White Cubic refers to this inspection as the “Conformity Inspection”.

26     White Cubic was to take delivery of the Remaining Annaba Marble which conformed to the samples as selected and approved by the Architect as per the original agreement. White Cubic was to pay for these at the rate of $98 per square metre.

27     White Cubic was entitled to reject any of the Remaining Annaba Marble which did not conform with the samples as selected and approved by the Architect as per the original agreement.

28     White Cubic was to procure a letter of credit equivalent to the full amount of the Remaining Annaba Marble.

29     Upon completion of the matters set out in paragraphs 25 to 28 above, the contract between the parties would be deemed to be “concluded”, and there would be no claims as between Sintal and White Cubic arising out of or connected with the contract, or the variations thereof, save for the settlement of accounts as between the parties.

30     Sintal owed White Cubic the total sum of $10,580.40 (which consisted of a deposit of $10,000 paid by White Cubic, and a further orally agreed sum of $10,580.40.

31     From a consideration of the evidence, I agreed with the contention of White Cubic, that the matters set out in paragraphs 24 to 30 above represented the variations effected in December 2013. This can be seen especially from the extract of the email thread between Sintal and White Cubic which can be seen at BA 142-143.

32     I further agreed, from a consideration of the evidence, with White Cubic’s contention in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Defence and Counterclaim, that pursuant to the events subsequent to the December 2013 variation, White Cubic had performed what they had agreed to perform. Therefore, Sintal could not maintain its claim against White Cubic.

33     Sintal had issued a proforma invoice dated 10 December 2013. White Cubic had thereafter procured the issuance of a letter of credit.

34     On 2 subsequent dates in December 2013, White Cubic attended at Sintal’s premises to carry out the Conformity Inspection. White Cubic took delivery of that portion of the Remaining Annaba Marble which passed the Conformity Inspection. The total of this portion amounted to 540 square metres. White Cubic duly paid for this.

35     As for the balance of the Remaining Annaba Marble, White Cubic had rejected the same for having failed the Conformity Inspection. This they were entitled to do pursuant to the variation effected in December 2013.

36     Therefore, my finding based on the evidence was that the parties had agreed to perform their respective obligations as varied by the variations effected in October 2013 and especially in December 2013. White Cubic had fully performed their varied obligations under the contract and had rightfully rejected the balance of the Remaining Annaba Marble as they were entitled to do. The contractual obligations originally entered into by the parties were no longer enforceable where they differed with the varied positions of the parties resultant upon the variations effected.

37     I therefore found that Sintal could not maintain their claim against White Cubic and dismissed their claim against White Cubic with costs.

38     White Cubic had a Counterclaim against Sintal. The first head of claim in the Counterclaim was for the sum of $10,580.40 (mentioned in paragraph 30 above). This claim was premised upon a finding that White Cubic had fully performed their obligations under the contract as varied and was not itself in breach. Pursuant to my finding that White Cubic had indeed fully performed their contractual obligations and were not themselves in breach, this portion of the Counterclaim ought to be allowed.

39     White Cubic had pleaded a claim, further or in the alternative, for the costs they had to incur to source for alternative Annaba marble (that ought to have been sufficiently supplied by Sintal) to meet their needs. They calculated the difference between what they had to pay third party contractors for the alternative Annaba marble and what they would have paid Sintal had Sintal properly performed their contractual obligations, and cited the sum of $3,937.22.

40     It was clear that White Cubic would not be entitled to this claim for $3,937.22. By their own assertions, once they had performed their contractual obligations pursuant to the varied contract, neither party would have any further claim against the other. This would include such a claim that was now quantified by White Cubic in the sum of $3,937.22. This was conceded to in the Supplementary Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of David Chia (DW1), at BA 183.

41     White Cubic was therefore only entitled to judgment on their Counterclaim limited to their said claim for $10,580.40.

42     In summary therefore, Sintal’s claim against White Cubic was dismissed with costs. Judgment on the Counterclaim was awarded in favour of White Cubic against Sintal for the sum of $10,580.40, interest thereon at the rate of 5.33% from date of the Counterclaim till Judgment. White Cubic was to have the costs of the action and the Counterclaim, to be agreed or taxed.
