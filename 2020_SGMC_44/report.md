### Deputy Registrar Kevin Kwek:

## Background

1       On 13 November 2017, the plaintiff, an 11 months old toddler was travelling as a passenger in a car driven by the defendant. The plaintiff was accompanied by her mother and father (the “Family”). The Family was on their way to begin a five-day cruise when the defendant’s vehicle collided into another vehicle along the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway.

2       The plaintiff’s father brought the plaintiff to the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 18 November 2017 after the Family returned from the five-day cruise.

3       The plaintiff’s father, who is the plaintiff’s litigation representative, subsequently commenced these proceedings against the defendant in June 2018 for a claim in negligence. On 12 July 2018, default interlocutory judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for 100% of the damages to be assessed with interests and costs reserved to the registrar assessing the damages.

4       The plaintiff’s initial claim was for (i) general damages of $2,000 for pain and suffering arising from “minor post-traumatic stress disorder”; (ii) transport expenses of $30; and (iii) medical expenses of $120.

5       Prior to the commencement of the assessment hearing on 16 March 2020, counsel for the plaintiff informed the court that the plaintiff was abandoning her claim for general damages.[^1] The plaintiff’s claim for transport expenses was also subsequently abandoned.[^2]

6       Therefore, the only claim before this court is the claim for medical expenses incurred by the plaintiff for the consultation at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on 18 November 2017 totalling $120.

7       The plaintiff gave evidence in court on 16 March 2020. The evidence of the single joint expert – Dr. Aman Akbar – was accepted by both parties and his attendance at the assessment was dispensed with by agreement on 27 July 2020. I now publish the reasons for my decision to address a legal argument advanced by the parties.

## Summary of the parties’ positions

8       The plaintiff submits that as the default interlocutory judgment entered on 12 July 2018 was not set aside, the “issue of liability and causation has been conclusively dealt with” and “the only issue the court needs to address is the issue of quantum i.e. the amount of damages to be awarded”.[^3] The issue of causation that is “conclusively dealt with” by the interlocutory judgment refers to the defendant’s liability in respect of causing the accident _and_ causing the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. As the interlocutory judgment includes the latter “causation” category, it is not open to the court to enquire at the assessment stage whether the accident had caused a particular injury to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff is correct, then it is no longer open for this court to find that the plaintiff had _not_ suffered an injury from the accident and the plaintiff will be entitled to her claim of $120 in medical expenses.

9       On the other hand, the defendant submits that an interlocutory judgment only deals with the defendant’s liability in respect of causing the accident and does _not_ deal conclusively with the issue of causation of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. According to the defendant, it is still open to the court to find at the assessment stage that the plaintiff has not shown that the alleged injuries are attributable to the accident and may attribute a “nil” value in damages in such a scenario.

## Decision

### Whether a defendant can raise the issue of causation of the plaintiff’s injuries at the assessment stage

10     I agree with the defendant that the causation of the plaintiff’s injuries is still a live issue at the assessment stage. This proposition is supported by case law.

11     The plaintiff in _Muhammad Shaun Eric bin Abdullah alias De Silva Shaun Eric v Ng Ah Tee (Chua Seng Thye, Third Party_) <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 268</span> was involved in a spate of accidents over a few years. On 21 November 1999, he was involved in a road traffic accident with the defendant and third party. Consent interlocutory judgment was entered against the defendant with the plaintiff agreeing to bear 10% of the liability and the third party to indemnify the defendant for 15% of the damages that the defendant had to pay the plaintiff. The parties did _not_ (as in the present case) reserve the issue of causation of injuries to the assessing registrar in the interlocutory judgment.

12     The matter then proceeded for assessment where the plaintiff claimed to have suffered six types of injuries. The learned assistant registrar found at \[15\] and \[16\] of the decision that save for one injury (i.e. knee contusions), the plaintiff “had not discharged his burden of proving that his _injuries were caused by the accident_” (_emphasis added_).

13     The learned assistant registrar’s decision was affirmed on appeal by the High Court: _Muhammad Shaun Eric bin Abdullah alias De Silva Shaun Eric v Ng Ah Tee (Chua Seng Thye, Third Party_) <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 180</span>. It is clear from \[5\] of the High Court’s decision that causation of the injuries is a live issue at the assessment stage:

> The main issue in the appeal, as it was in the assessment hearing, was that of causation.

14     Case law aside, there are practical reasons why causation of the alleged injuries should still be a live issue at the assessment stage. Proceedings relating to personal injury claims are typically bifurcated in the State Courts to avoid putting the parties to the expense of engaging expert witnesses (or a single joint expert for cases falling under the ambit of Order 108 of the Rules of Court) before liability is established.

15     As causation issues often require medical expert opinion, such issues should be dealt with at the assessment stage to avoid medical experts having to testify twice (first at trial on causation issues and then again at assessment hearing on the extent of injury(s) suffered). In bifurcated trials, the practice is for parties to adduce at the trial on liability, only evidence on how the accident occurred and/or was caused to determine the apportionment of liability between parties. Issues relating to whether the plaintiff suffered any particular loss or injury caused by the accident are then determined at the assessment stage.

16     For the above reasons, I am of the view that it is still open for a defendant to raise the issue of causation of the plaintiff’s injuries at the assessment stage.

17     On the facts of the present case, I find that the plaintiff did not suffer any injuries from the accident on 13 November 2017. It was evident from the litigation representative’s testimony that he was simply seeking reassurance from a medical practitioner that his daughter was fine:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

\[You and your wife\] claimed \[that the plaintiff\] would occasionally wake up in the middle of the night since the accident – this was your only complaint?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

This is my worry. She has not started talking, the only thing I can do is bring her to doctor for check-up. I just wanted assurance that she is okay.

 |

  
  

18     Dr. Aman Akbar examined the plaintiff six days after the accident when the Family returned from the cruise vacation. It is plain from the extract of Dr. Akbar’s medical report set out below that the plaintiff had not suffered any injuries:

> …\[The plaintiff’s\] parents claimed patient would occasionally wake up in the middle of the night since the accident. She was taking food and drinking as per usual. She was still actively playing as per usual. \[The plaintiff’s\] parents denied any swelling or bruising noted.

> On examination, \[the plaintiff\] was alert, cheerful. Her heart, lungs and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. She was moving all four limbs. No obvious bruising or swelling noted.

19     It is clear from the above that Dr. Akbar did not diagnose the plaintiff with any injuries. The fact that the plaintiff’s parents may have suffered injuries from the same accident does not assist the plaintiff’s case. The court must base its decision on the objective evidence of the plaintiff _for each case_. It should also be highlighted that Dr. Akbar did not refer the plaintiff for any subsequent medical reviews; nor did he prescribe any medication to the plaintiff. These factors militate against a finding that the plaintiff had suffered injuries from the accident.

### The plaintiff’s claim for $120 in medical expenses

20     That the plaintiff did not suffer any injuries from the accident is only relevant to the plaintiff’s claim for medical expenses given that she had withdrawn her claim for pain and suffering prior to the commencement of the assessment hearing.

21     This is a claim for special damages. The general rule is that special damages have to be strictly proven otherwise they are not recoverable: _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[15\]. In addition, medical expenses are claimable _if they relate to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff_ (_emphasis added_): Carrie Chan et el, _Practitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_, LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, at \[2-6\].

22     Having found that the plaintiff had not suffered any injuries from the accident, it follows that her claim for medical expenses fails.

23     I will hear parties on costs.
