Evidence – Assessment of testimonial evidence

29 July 2022

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       DC/DC 14/2020 (“**DC 14**”) is the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for the repayment of USD100,000.00 with interest.

## Undisputed facts

2       The Defendant did not dispute that there was a meeting on or around 11 February 2015. At the meeting, he had received a cheque for USD100,000.00 issued in his name by the Plaintiff (“**the Cheque**”). Soon after the meeting, he deposited the Cheque into his POSB savings account.

3       The evidence revealed that the Defendant had subsequently made the following transfers involving the USD100,000.00 deposited into his POSB savings account:

> (a)     S$109,950.00 was transferred to a bank account belonging to Winhover Investments Ltd (“**Winhover**”), a company incorporated in the state of Papua New Guinea (“**PNG**”), and

> (b)     the remaining S$25,000.00 was transferred to a bank account belonging to his brother, Ilangkumaran Sivagnanam (“**Ilang**”), in separate payments on five occasions in February 2015.

4       It was common ground that the issuance of the Cheque was linked to a charter agreement dated 31 July 2012 involving a vessel, the _Miyabi_ (“**Charter Agreement**”).

5       Under the Charter Agreement, U Sky Limited (“**Sky**”) – a company incorporated in PNG in which Ilang was a director – had chartered the _Miyabi_ from Kong Hoo (S) Private Limited (“**KH**”) to transport diesel within PNG. The signatories to the Charter Agreement were Wong Wee Keong (“**Wong**”) (on behalf of KH) and Ilang (on behalf of Sky).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

## The Plaintiff’s case

6       The Plaintiff’s case is as follows:

> (a)     Ilang had requested a USD100,000.00-loan from KH/Wong. Wong was unable to accede to the request. Since the commencement of the Charter Agreement in 2012 to the time of the request in 2015, Sky had failed to make any payment to KH under the agreement. (This was not disputed by Ilang.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)) Because of this, KH was not willing to provide Ilang with more monies until the accounts had been settled.[^3]

> (b)     Wong approached the Plaintiff to assist. At Wong’s suggestion, the Plaintiff agreed to help by lending USD100,000.00 to the Defendant, and the Defendant could then make the necessary arrangements with Ilang.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

7       Accordingly, Wong arranged a meeting that took place on 11 February 2015 at his office (“**11 February Meeting**”). The attendees at this meeting were Wong, the Defendant, and Khoo Lian Suam (“**Khoo**”) (a director of the Plaintiff).[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The following events transpired at the meeting:

> (a)     After a brief chat, Khoo and the Defendant entered into an oral agreement (“**Oral Agreement**”) whereby[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) -

>> (i)       Khoo (on behalf of the Plaintiff) agreed to lend to the Defendant USD100,000.00, interest free.

>> (ii)       In return, the Defendant agreed to repay the loan within one year, i.e., by 11 February 2016.

> (b)     Following the Oral Agreement[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) –

>> (i)       The Cheque was issued to the Defendant and a photocopy of the Cheque (“**Photocopied Cheque**”) was made;

>> (ii)       The Defendant then wrote his name and identification card number, as well as appended his signature (“**the Acknowledgment**”), on the Photocopied Cheque; and

>> (iii)       In the Defendant’s presence, Wong wrote the following words on the Photocopied Cheque: “PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT WITHIN ONE YER (sic) FROM DATE” (“**the Written Words**”).

> (c)     When Khoo requested the Defendant to countersign against the Written Words, the latter declined. The Defendant said that there was no need to do so as he had already appended his signature on the Photocopied Cheque and agreed to the contents of the Written Words.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

8       The Defendant failed to repay the loan by 11 February 2016. This was despite a letter of demand dated 25 November 2019 issued by the Plaintiff’s solicitors to the Defendant.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) The Plaintiff commenced DC 14 on 2 January 2020.

## The Defendant’s case

9       According to the Defendant –

> (a)     The purpose of the 11 February Meeting was for him to collect, on behalf of Ilang, USD100,000.00 which KH/Wong were supposed to pay for the repairs for the _Miyabi_. These monies were payable under the Charter Agreement.

> (b)     Only two persons attended the 11 February Meeting – Wong and the Defendant. The Defendant denied meeting Khoo at the meeting and entering into the Oral Agreement.

> (c)     On receiving the Cheque, the Defendant wrote the Acknowledgement on the Photocopied Cheque. At the material time, the Photocopied Cheque did not contain the Written Words. After writing the Acknowledgement, the Defendant left the office with the Cheque.

## Key issues for determination

10     The key issue in DC 14 concerned the purpose for the Cheque.

> (a)     Was it an interest-free loan by the Plaintiff to the Defendant (which the latter was obliged to repay) as contended by the Plaintiff?[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> (b)     Or was the Cheque given for the purpose alleged by the Defendant – i.e., as a payment by the Plaintiff (made on behalf of KH) for repairs to the _Miyabi_?

## My decision

### Witness demeanour and evidence

11     The Defence submitted that I should reject the Defendant’s case because Wong and Khoo could not recall a lot of details and had given inconsistent accounts regarding events before, during and after the 11 February Meeting.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) Furthermore, the demeanour of the defence witnesses was impressive while that of the plaintiff witnesses were suspect.[^12]

12     In deciding whose case to accept, I was mindful that there were inconsistencies in Wong and Khoo’s evidence. These witnesses were also unsure about certain details of what had transpired during the 11 February Meeting.

13     That said, I am unable to agree with the Defendant that such “imperfections” in Wong and Khoo’s testimonies meant that they had lied – or warrant rejecting their evidence altogether. This is especially so in light of the following.

14     First, I noted that the inconsistencies in Wong and Khoo’s testimonies were on peripheral matters. These inconsistencies related to minute details regarding events that had transpired some seven years before the trial. Given such a long lapse of time, it is not surprising that their memories had faded (as they had explained during cross-examination) and were thus unsure about certain details regarding the 11 February Meeting. It is trite law that imperfect memories and uncertain recollections should not necessarily be treated as impinging on the credibility of a witness. These are but afflictions which the passage of time will, in varying degrees, bring to bear on all individuals: _Ng Chee Chuan v Ng Ai Tee_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 918</span> at \[16\].

15     Second, I found that Wong and Khoo’s evidence had remained consistent on material aspects of the Plaintiff’s case, namely –

> (a)     that they had met the Defendant at the 11 February Meeting,

> (b)     that the Cheque was given to the Defendant as a loan, and

> (c)     the circumstances in which the Acknowledgement and Written Words were written on the Photocopied Cheque.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

### The contemporaneous documents

16     It is well established that in determining whether to accept a witness’s evidence, it is important to test his evidence against the objective facts and independent evidence, including contemporaneous documentary evidence: _Lim Koon Park v Yap Jin Meng Bryan_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 150</span> at \[76\]; _OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 1206</span> at \[41\].

17     I found the following guidance in _ARS v ART_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 78</span> at \[53\] particularly helpful in determining whose evidence – the Plaintiff’s or the Defendant’s – is more credible:

> (a)     in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time;

> (b)     where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence;

> (c)     the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists;

> (d)     oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’ recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);

> (e)     credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence;

> (f)     where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words; and

> (g)     if there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will nevertheless examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement concluded between the parties.

18     In my judgment, the following pieces of contemporaneous evidence, _if unrebutted_, proved that the Plaintiff’s case that the Cheque was intended to be a loan:

> (a)     The Written Words on the Photocopied Cheque, i.e., “_PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT_ WITHIN ONE YER (sic) FROM DATE” \[emphasis added\]. According to the Plaintiff’s case, Wong had inserted the Written Words in the Defendant’s presence, and the latter did not raise any objection. The Written Words demolished the Defendant’s case that the Cheque was given for repairs to the _Miyabi_.

> (b)     The Typed Words on the reverse side of the Cheque, i.e., “PERSONAL LOAN”.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) These words further bolster the Plaintiff’s case that the USD100,000.00 was a loan.

> (c)     The following WhatsApp messages exchanged between the Defendant and Ilang on 20 February 2015, i.e., about a week after the Defendant had received the Cheque \[“**the WhatsApp Messages**”\]:[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> 
| 

Defendant:

 | 

Done already … I am in Paris… I tried yesterday but couldn’t. Now all the monies have been transferred to U! All the best and _Pls return it to him as soon as you can_! \[Smiley Face Emoji\] \[Thumbs Up Emoji\]

 |
| 

Ilang:

 | 

It will go through u so he cannot complaint (sic)

 |
| 

\[emphasis and words in square brackets added\]

 |

  
  

> In the above messages, the two brothers had referred to the need to return the USD100,000.00. These messages clearly show that both the Defendant and Ilang knew that the monies were a loan.

19     I found that the Defendant had failed discredit the above evidence which are fatal to his case. My reasons for this finding are as follows.

#### The Written Words

20     The Defendant contended that the Written Words were fraudulently inserted on the Photocopied Cheque _after_ he had left the 11 February Meeting, without his knowledge.

21     The implications of the Defendant’s claim are that Wong and Khoo –

> (a)     had colluded to commit fraud even _before_ the Cheque was handed over to the Defendant,

> (b)     had proceeded to perpetuate the fraud by making the allegedly false claim in DC 14, and

> (c)     had gone on to perjure themselves by affirming false affidavits and giving false testimonies in order to maintain the fraud.

22     I found the Defendant’s contention inherently incredible.

23     First, the Defendant had failed to offer any reason as to why the Plaintiff/Khoo and Wong would want to commit the alleged scam. In fact, there is no good reason for them to do so given the following:

> (a)     Wong and Ilang were business partners and had an ongoing Charter Agreement at the material time. Going by the evidence, they also had a good relationship and there was no bad blood between them.

> (b)     The Defendant is the brother of Wong’s business partner. He was a stranger to both Wong and Khoo before the 11 February Meeting and had no dealings with either of them after the meeting.

> (c)     The effect of the alleged scam is simply that the Plaintiff – which was a stranger to the dealings between KH/Wong and Ilang/Sky – would just be getting back the monies that they had provided to the Defendant. The Plaintiff would not receive any incentive from the transaction since it was an _interest-free_ loan. I agreed with the following submissions by the Plaintiff:[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

>> 86.    It bears reminder that it is the Plaintiff that has extended the sum of money of USD 100,000.00 to the Defendant. If this was indeed a “fraud”, then the reward of this fraud (i.e., if the Plaintiff succeeds in this Suit) would be that the Plaintiff merely gets back the sum of USD 100,000.00 (i.e. what the Plaintiff had extended to the Defendant in the first place).

>> 87.    This makes no sense. There is no additional reward awaiting the Plaintiff should this “fraud” succeed. No conspirator would design a fraud such that if the fraud succeeds, the conspirator would simply get back what he put in, with no additional reward to be received, and further that the conspirator is also subject to the additional risk of not even being able to recover such sums it had put in in the first place.

24     Second, if the Plaintiff were intent on defrauding the Defendant, why then did they not immediately commence action to recover the USD100,000.00 from him in line with this intention?

> (a)     It is not disputed that Khoo (on behalf of the Plaintiff) had emailed the Defendant about the loan repayment only in October 2017. This is some 20 months after the deadline for repayment (11 February 2016) had passed. When that request failed to achieve a satisfactory response, the Plaintiff issued a letter of demand only in November 2019. They waited until 2 January 2020 – i.e., about four years after the deadline for repayment had lapsed – before commencing DC 14. In my view, such a long delay in recovering the loan critically undermined the Defendant’s contention that the Plaintiff had hatched a scheme right at the outset to defraud the Defendant.

> (b)     The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff’s delay in recovering the loan from him was “not the actions of a reasonable ‘Lender’”.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) I am not persuaded by this submission. The Plaintiff’s delay in recovering the loan in fact showed that they did not have any ulterior motive in providing the USD100,000.00 in the first place. The delay is consistent with Khoo’s evidence that the loan was given simply _as a favour_ – on account of the fact that Wong (a trusted business partner) had asked for help in lending monies to the Defendant.[^18] The Plaintiff’s case that the loan was given interest free is again consistent with the fact that it was a friendly loan given out of goodwill, and not with an ulterior motive to defraud the Defendant.

25     Finally, I found the Defendant’s claim that the Written Words had been fraudulently inserted into the Photocopied Cheque to be demolished by two pieces of objective and contemporaneous evidence.

#### The Typed Words

26     The first piece of evidence are the Typed Words on the reverse of the Cheque which stated, “PERSONAL LOAN”.

27     When confronted with this piece of damning evidence, the Defendant claimed that he only saw the front of the Cheque and did not notice the Typed Words on the reverse of the Cheque.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

28     I disbelieved the Defendant’s claim. The Defendant clearly had ample opportunity to see, and must have seen, the Typed Words, bearing in mind the following:

> (a)     During the 11 February Meeting, the Defendant had appended his NRIC number and his signature on the reverse side of the Photocopied Cheque. This is the _same side_ of the Photocopied Cheque which contains the Typed Words.

> (b)     Based on the Defendant’s own case, there would not have been any visual clutter on the reverse side of the Photocopied Cheque when he appended his NRIC number and signature on it. That side of the Photocopied Cheque would only have contained the following bare information:

>> (i)       An empty box where the Defendant was supposed to insert details regarding (1) the bank account number that the monies in the Cheque are to be deposited into, (2) the account holder’s name, and (3) telephone number (“**the Box**”); and

>> (ii)       The Typed Words printed in capital letters.

> (c)     The Defendant left the 11 February Meeting with the Cheque. In other words, he had all the time to scrutinise the Cheque and to notice the Typed Words.

> (d)     On the Defendant’s own evidence, he did not want to be a guarantor for the USD100,000.00 payment. The Defendant emphasised that he took the effort to ensure that he did not sign on any guarantor form or enter into any such agreement.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) If the Defendant’s evidence is true, then he would have scrutinised the Cheque and Photocopied Cheque very carefully at all material times – and he would have noticed the Typed Words.

> (e)     In the Photocopied Cheque, the Box did not contain any details.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) It is not disputed that when the Defendant deposited the Cheque into his POSB savings account, he had inserted the relevant details into the Box on the Cheque. It is inconceivable how the Defendant could have failed to notice the Typed Words when inserting these details since these words were just below the Box.[^22]

29     Given the above, I cannot imagine how the Defendant could have missed the Typed Words.

#### The WhatsApp Messages

30     The second piece of evidence that discredited the Defendant’s contention that the Written Words had been fraudulently inserted into the Photocopied Cheque are the WhatsApp Messages.

31     When cross-examined on this adverse piece of evidence, the Defendant’s evidence is illuminating:

> (a)     The Defendant conceded that on its plain meaning, his message showed that the USD100,000.00 was a loan which had to be repaid.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

> (b)     The Defendant explained that in sending the message, he was merely conveying to Ilang what Wong had told him at the office. In his submissions, the Defendant’s counsel urged me to accept this explanation as it contained the truth.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24) If this is so, then the Defendant’s explanation provided yet another piece of corroborative evidence – i.e., at the time when the Cheque was handed to the Defendant, he was specifically told of the need to repay the USD100,000.00. If the USD100,000.00 was for the repairs to the _Miyabi_, then why was there a need to repay the monies? The Defendant’s explanation directly contradicted his case that the monies were not a loan.

32     It appeared from the Defendant’s explanation that while he was the borrower, there was an arrangement between the Defendant and Ilang that the latter would come up with the funds to repay the loan.

> (a)     The existence of such an arrangement is supported by Ilang’s reply to the Defendant’s message, i.e., that the repayment of the monies “will go through u so he cannot complaint (_sic_)”.

> (b)     Ilang’s evidence that he would be the one repaying the USD100,000.00 – through the Defendant – is not at all surprising, given that he was the sole beneficiary of the monies. The objective evidence showed that part of the USD100,000.00 was deposited into Ilang’s bank account. It was also the Defendant’s evidence that Ilang had given instructions for the balance monies to be deposited into the Winhover’s bank accounts for reasons best known to Ilang.

33     When cross-examined on the WhatsApp Messages, Ilang gave an explanation that contradicted the one given by the Defendant. Ilang claimed that the messages had nothing to do with the Cheque – and applied only “if there’s at all _any other payments_ that \[the Defendant was\] supposed to disburse back” \[emphasis added\]. According to Ilang, if there was a need to make such payments, then he would do it through the Defendant since the latter had received the Cheque.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

34     I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submission that Ilang’s explanation for the WhatsApp Messages was inconsistent with the plain meaning of these messages and defied logic.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) For instance, why was there a need for Ilang to link the return of “other payments” to the Plaintiff – with whom he had no dealings – with the USD100,000.00? Additionally, why was there a need for Ilang to assure the Defendant about who and how the return of these other payments would be made since the Defendant would not have been involved in these transactions?

35     I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that the exchange of WhatsApp Messages is a clear admission by the Defendant and Ilang that the Cheque was a loan.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

#### Absence of documents supporting the Defendant’s case

36     As shown above, there is ample contemporaneous evidence, including from the Defendant, to support the Plaintiff’s case that the Cheque was a loan.

37     In contrast, apart from the bare assertions by the Defendant and Ilang, the Defendant’ case that the Cheque was for repairs to the _Miyabi_ is not corroborated by any contemporaneous documentary evidence. The Defendant’s failure to provide any satisfactory explanation for such a glaring absence of documentary evidence rendered his case highly suspect. This is especially so when the Defendant had ample notice of the Plaintiff’s case, including the fact that they would be referring to the Written Words and WhatsApp Messages to substantiate their claim. In this regard, it bears noting that the Plaintiff’s letter of demand and Writ of Summons/Statement of Claim were issued in November 2019 and January 2020 respectively – some two to three years before the trial.

38     In the circumstances, one would have expected the Defendant to have attempted to locate all relevant evidence, including contemporaneous documents of his own, to counter the damning effect of the Written Words and the WhatsApp Messages to his case. Indeed, Ilang was able to exhibit copies of various invoices, consignment notes, airway bills, receipts, etc (“**Disputed Documents**”) in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

39     In my view, the Disputed Documents did not make up for the absence of documentary evidence to support the Defendant’s case that the USD100,000.00 was for the repair to the _Miyabi_. In fact, I did not find the Disputed Documents to be of any assistance.

> (a)     The Plaintiff had challenged the authenticity of the Disputed Documents by way of a Notice of Non-Admission of Documents Referred to in Pleadings or Affidavits dated 26 November 2020. Despite the objection, the Defendant had failed to produce the originals of these documents at the trial. The Plaintiff submitted that the Disputed Documents should not be admitted as evidence. I agree.

> (b)     Many of the documents are not legible, and their relevance to the purported repairs to the _Miyabi_ is not clear. During the trial, the Defendant had failed to explain how the Disputed Documents proved that the repair costs for the _Miyabi_ came to USD100,000.00 – i.e., the amount requested by Ilang. It is well established that the burden remains on the party that had produced documentary records to clearly and fully explain how they supported the inference which that party wishes the court to draw.

> (c)     Furthermore, there are numerous discrepancies between the Defendant’s case regarding what he did with the USD100,000.00 and the Disputed Documents. According to Ilang, _before_ receiving the Cheque, Winhover had already helped to pay for the repairs. As such, after the Defendant had received the Cheque, he instructed the Defendant to transfer some of the funds directly to Winhover _as reimbursements_.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) If this evidence is true, then the dates on the Disputed Documents should reflect a date _before_ the 11 February Meeting. However, these documents – which included invoices[^30] – are dated _after_ the 11 February Meeting. In fact, some of the invoices are dated October/November 2015 – i.e., more than seven months after the Cheque was handed over to the Defendant.[^31] In my view, while there is some evidence to suggest that Ilang did make arrangements for the _Miyabi_ to undergo repairs, this is likely to have occurred _after_ the Cheque was handed over. Put in another way, there is reason to believe that the Cheque had nothing to do with expenditure already incurred on repairs for the _Miyabi_.

### Reasons for the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s involvement

40     A curious feature of this case is that the Defendant and the Plaintiff/Khoo, who were hitherto strangers to each other, had come to be involved in business affairs between Ilang and Wong. In my view, determining why the Plaintiff/Khoo and the Defendant had come to be involved can help unravel the purpose of the Cheque – i.e., whether it was a loan or payment for repairs.

#### The Defendant’s claim for being involved is unconvincing

41     According to the Defendant, he came to be involved in collecting the Cheque on behalf of Sky “out of convenience and urgency”:[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> … At material time, \[Ilang\] was not in Singapore and it would take some time for the monies to be remitted into Sky’s company account directly. As such, on **11 February 2015**, Kumaran for and on behalf of Sky, had sought a favour from the Defendant to facilitate remittance of the monies to pay for the repairs of M.T. Miyabi in accordance with the Cheque Arrangement;

42     I found the Defendant’s explanation as to how he came to be involved to be unconvincing. As the Plaintiff had highlighted in their submissions, if convenience and urgency was a consideration in getting the monies to Ilang, then why was there a need to take an _additional (unnecessary)_ step by making the payment _through the Defendant_? Why not simply have the Plaintiff/Khoo do a bank-to-bank transfer directly to Ilang? After all, the evidence show that this was how the Defendant had transmitted the monies to Ilang – through a bank-to-bank transfer.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) Ilang agreed that there would have been no difficulty for Wong to have caused the monies to be transferred to him this way.[^34]

#### The Defendant had failed to explain why the Plaintiff came to be involved

43     There are also other problems with the Defendant’s case.

> (a)     First, it failed to explain why the Plaintiff/Khoo would allegedly want to pay a substantial amount of monies (USD100,000.00) for the repairs to the _Miyabi_ on behalf of KH/Wong. The Plaintiff/Khoo is not a party to the Charter Agreement and had nothing to do with the _Miyabi_.

> (b)     Second, based on the Defendant’s own case, he had not met Khoo before, during or after the 11 February Meeting. They were strangers to each other. Despite this, it is the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff was happy for the Cheque to be given to him without any documentation as to its purpose. Why would the Plaintiff/Khoo take such risks? This is not what one would expect of reasonable businessmen in their conduct of their business dealings.

#### The Plaintiff had provided a plausible explanation

44     In my view, the Plaintiff had provided a plausible explanation as to why they and the Defendant had come to be involved in the dealings between Wong and Ilang:

> (a)     Ilang had approached Wong for a loan.

> (b)     Wong was not able to provide the loan.

> (c)     Wong was however prepared to ask the Plaintiff/Khoo if they could assist.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

> (d)     Khoo was prepared to grant a personal loan to the Defendant given that Wong was a trusted business partner who had put in a good word for the Defendant. Furthermore, Khoo had assumed that the Defendant would be able to repay the loan, given that he was a pilot with the Singapore Airlines. To Khoo, this meant that the Defendant had a stable job with a blue-chip company and a good career.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36)

45     It was not disputed that the Plaintiff could have executed a bank-to-bank transfer of the monies directly to the Defendant. However, this would not have reflected the true nature of the transfer – which was a loan. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that the 11 February Meeting took place – so that there would be some documentation (in the form of the Written Words on the Photocopied Cheque and the Typed Words) to show that the Plaintiff had provided the monies to the Defendant as a loan.

46     I accepted the Plaintiff’s case that the 11 February Meeting was attended by Wong, Khoo and the Defendant, that there was a discussion between Khoo and the Defendant which led to the Oral Agreement, and that the Cheque was given to the Defendant thereafter.

47     When tested against the totality of the evidence and the natural course of human conduct, I found the Defendant’s case – that after exchanging some pleasantries, he simply collected the Cheque from Wong and left thereafter[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) - to be improbable.

### Defendant’s claim that the Cheque was for repairs to the Miyabi

48     According to the Defendant’s case, the Cheque was intended to be used by Sky “to pay for some repairs of the M.T. Miyabi”.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) The evidence revealed that the bulk of the monies from the Cheque went into Winhover bank account, and the rest went into Ilang’s bank account. During the trial, Ilang explained that Winhover helped to pay for the repairs. As such, after the Defendant had received the Cheque, he instructed the Defendant to transfer some of the funds directly to Winhover as reimbursements.

49     I disbelieve the Defendant’s defence. If the Defendant’s contention were true, one would have expected there to be contemporaneous evidence supporting his case, such as (a) invoices for repairs to the _Miyabi_ totalling USD100,000.00, (b) bank records showing that Winhover and Ilang had paid for the repairs on Sky’s behalf, and (c) payment vouchers and the relevant accounting records from Sky to show that the monies from the Cheque had been applied for the repairs. No such document was produced to support Ilang’s bare assertions.

## Conclusion

50     Given the above –

> (a)     I enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff – the Defendant is to repay to the Plaintiff USD100,000.00;

> (b)     I further order that pre-judgement interest on USD100,000.00 –to run from the date of Writ (2 January 2020) to the date of the judgement at the default rate of 5.33% per annum.
