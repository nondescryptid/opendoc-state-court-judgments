28 November 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       It has often been said that ‘lighting never strikes the same place twice’. However, this was certainly not the case for the accused, Tang Kum Yin, a 65-year-old male Grab car driver who was ‘booked’ twice, for parking the same car at the same road marked by the same two unbroken double yellow lines, thus allegedly breaching the same provision of the Road Traffic Rules on both occasions.

2       Both alleged offences took place within 2 months of each other, on 26 October 2018 and 23 December 2018 respectively, and were detected by different Certis Cisco enforcement officers who each issued a \`summons’ and also took videos and photographs of the offending car (SLU 7316R) when it was parked on the road where unbroken double yellow lines are laid down.

3       Resulting from these two incidents, the accused received separate ‘Notice of Traffic Offence’ from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), which set out the details of his offences, and also offers of composition for the accused. However, the accused declined to pay the composition amounts set out, and decided to claim trial instead.

4       Before me, the accused faced two almost identical charges, which differed only in the dates and times of commission of offences. Essentially, he was charged that he, on 26 October 2018 at about 3.12 pm (1st charge: LTA-9182635043), and 23 December 2018 at about 2.21 pm (2nd charge: LTA-9190454432), at Kampong Bahru Road, parked his motor car No. SLU 7316 R, in contravention of Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules, which are offences under section 131(1) and punishable under section 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

5       To establish its case, the Prosecution called the following witnesses to testify:

> (1)     PW1 Ngan Gee Wah (“Ngan”) – an enforcement officer;

> (2)     PW2 Kishan Rao A/L M T Ramarow (“Kishan”) – another enforcement officer; and

> (3)     PW3 Suhaily Binte Zakaria (“Suhaily”) – a LTA officer.

6       After hearing the testimonies of the witnesses, and viewing the body-worn camera footages and the still photographs taken by the enforcement officers, and after assessing the other evidence produced by the Prosecution, and the evidence from the accused himself, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had established its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused on both charges.

7       Thereafter, following sentencing submissions from the Prosecution, and the mitigation plea from the accused, I imposed a fine of $800 per charge, which was a sentence at the lower end of the range for contested cases of this nature. As he was convicted on two charges, the global sentence was a fine of $1,600 (in default 8 days’ imprisonment). Thereafter, at the accused’s request, he was allowed to pay the fine through four monthly instalment payments of $400 each.

8       The accused has since filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## (2)   Evidence adduced at the trial

### (a)   First Charge – Incident on 26 October 2018

9       Ngan testified that he is an enforcement officer with Certis Cisco. On 26 October 2018, he was in uniform and carrying out his duties at Kampong Bahru Road at about 3.12 pm, when he observed a car (SLU 7316R) that was parked and left unattended on a road where there were unbroken double yellow lines, and with no immediate activity seen.[^1] There was also no one in the car at that time. Ngan then took photographs of the car. These photographs are reproduced below.

![]([2019] SGDC 0250_Image/[2019] SGDC 0250_image1.png)

10     Ngan turned on his body worn video camera to take a video of the car. The footage of what Ngan recorded that day was played in court and admitted as evidence (P8).

11     Ngan then placed a \`summons’ on the windscreen of the car. When he left, the car was still parked in the same position. Ngan testified that from the time when he arrived, until the time he left the scene, he did not see anyone in the car nor anyone approaching the car. Neither were the hazard lights nor the engine of the car turned on.[^2]

12     In response to questions posed to him, Ngan testified that the driver of the car could not stop the car on the double yellow lines to go into a shop and make a delivery, as only immediate pick up and drop off was allowed. [^3]

13     Ngan said that he subsequently made a violation report of the incident (P5). This report set out the details of the incident, including the date, time, offence committed (“Parking at unbroken double yellow lines”), and details of the accused’s car.

### (b)   Second Charge – Incident on 23 December 2018

14     Kishan is also an enforcement officer with Certis Cisco, and his job is to take action against illegal parking. On 23 December 2018 at about 2.21 pm, while he was in uniform and patrolling at Kampong Bahru Road, he saw a stationary car (SLU 7316R) parked with no activity and unattended on a road where there were double yellow lines. Kishan then parked his own motorcycle and took photographs of the front and back of the car, before issuing a \`summons’ to the driver for parking his car on the double yellow lines. The photographs that Kishan took that day are reproduced below.

![]([2019] SGDC 0250_Image/[2019] SGDC 0250_image2.jpeg)

15     Aside from taking the photographs, Kishan also recorded the incident on his body worn camera, which could record both video and audio footage. The footage of what Kishan recorded that day was played in court and admitted as evidence (P4).

16     Kishan said that about 2 minutes after he had issued the \`summons’, the accused, who identified himself as the driver of the car, approached Kishan and asked to be given him “a 5-minute grace period” and for Kishan to cancel the \`summons’. Kishan, however, refused as he said that he could not cancel a \`summons’.

17     Kishan further testified that that no grace period could be given to the driver for such forms of parking, as the double yellow line “….is only for immediate pick up and drop off only, not for stationary park or take some things”.[^4] Kishan also informed the accused to appeal to the LTA if he wished.

18     In court, Kishan confirmed that there were shops near the location where the accused had parked his car, and that there were carpark lots behind the shops.[^5]Kishan subsequently left the location. Around that time, the accused started to drive his car away.

19     Later, Kishan also made a violation report when he returned to Certis Cisco. In the report (P1), he set out the details of the incident, including the date, time, offence committed (“Parking at unbroken double yellow lines”), and details of the accused’s car.

### (c)   Evidence of the ownership of SLU 7316R and notices sent to the accused

20     Suhaily, a senior executive attached to Violation Reports department of the LTA, tendered the following exhibits as evidence:

> (1)     Certificate of ownership of the car SLU 7316R, which showed the owner of the car to be HiPoint Enterprise – P9.

> (2)     ACRA certificate for HiPoint Enterprise showing the accused to be the owner and sole proprietor of this business – P10.

> (3)     Notice of Traffic Offence/Request for Driver’s Particulars number 9182400644 dated 1st November 2018 which was issued to HiPoint Enterprise for the offence committed on 26th October 2018 – P11. The amount of composition was stated as $70.

> (4)     eFDP (electronic furnishing of the driver’s particulars) for notice number 9182400644 showing the accused to have been the driver of the car for the 26th October 2018 incident – P12.

> (5)     Notice of Traffic Offence No. 9182635043 dated 1st February 2019 issued to the accused for the offence committed on 26th October 2018 – P13. The notice of composition was set at $90.

> (6)     Notice of Traffic Offence/Request for Driver’s Particulars number 9182812644 dated 29 December 2018 issued to HiPoint Enterprise for the offence committed on 23rd December 2018 – P14. The amount of composition was set at $70.

> (7)     eFDP (electronic furnishing of the driver’s particulars) for notice number 9182812644 showing the accused to have been the driver for the 23rd December 2018 incident – P15.

> (8)     Notice of Traffic Offence No. 9190454452 dated 16th April 2019 issued to the accused for the offence committed on 23rd December 2018 – P16. The notice of composition was set at $130.

21     The above exhibits essentially showed that the owner of the car SLU 7316R was a company, HiPoint Enterprise, which itself was owned by the accused. For the two offences committed on 26th October 2018 and 23rd December 2018 respectively, the accused was the driver of the car on both occasions. He was offered composition by the LTA at sums of $90 and $130 respectively for the two offences, but the accused declined to pay the composition fines.

### (d)   Evidence from the accused

22     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was sufficient evidence to establish all the elements of the charges, the defence of the accused was called and he elected to testify.

23     In essence, the accused testified that he was a Grab driver and has held a driving licence since the 1970s. For the first incident on 26th October 2018 at about 3 pm, he had parked his car (SLU 7316L) at Kampung Bahru on the double yellow lines in front of his daughter’s confectionary shop to collect a cake for delivery. He had gone into the shop and left the car unattended. When he came out, he had seen the person who issued the \`summons’ (Ngan) riding his motorcycle away.

24     In court, the accused produced an extract (D1) from a publication titled “Driving in Singapore” a book that was published by “Mighty Minds”. The accused highlighted the following contents from D1:

> (1)    At page 104, it is stated that “Two continuous yellow lines (parallel lines) at the side indicate no parking on that side of the road at all times except for the **_immediate_** picking up and alighting of passengers.”

> (2)    At page 132, it is stated that “Two continuous yellow lines at the side of the road” indicates that there is to be “No parking on that side of the road, except for the **_immediate_** picking and alighting of passengers or dropping of goods”, and that the penalty for the breach is a fine.

(emphasis added)

25     The accused claimed that based on D1, he could “pick up and let passengers alight there and also drop goods and pick up goods.” [^6] He, however, does not know whether D1 is a publication from the Traffic Police, LTA, or any government department.

26     For the offence on 26 October 2018, the accused claimed that he was in the shop that day for about 5 to 6 minutes to collect a cake. When asked what he understood the word “immediate” to mean (referred to at pages 104 and 132 of D1), the accused said that this “can be taken as 1 minute or 10 minutes.” [^7] He also said that the enforcement officer (i.e. Ngan) should have waited for at least 10 minutes for the owner of the car to come out, before taking enforcement action. The accused further stated that he did not obstruct traffic by his parking, and that while there were parking lots behind the shop, they were very far away.

27     For the second incident on 23rd December 2018, the accused said that he had similarly parked his car (SLU 7316L) at Kampung Bahru on the double yellow lines in front of his daughter’s shop to collect a cake for delivery to a customer. When he came out of the shop, he had seen Kishan, the person who issued the \`summons’. He said that Kishan had issued this within 5 minutes of the accused parking his car.

28     The accused had confronted Kishan (as seen in the footage P4) and had insisted that Kishan should have given him a chance, especially as he had turned on his car’s hazard lights on this occasion. This was unlike the first occasion when he was ‘booked’ (i.e. on 26 October 2018), when he admitted that he did not turn on the car’s hazard lights.

29     Subsequent to both incidents, the accused had also sent appeal letters to the LTA with regards the \`summonses’ issued to him requesting that they be waived. He had sent two appeal letters for the first incident, and one appeal letter for the second incident. The accused said that he had hoped that the LTA would be “magnanimous” [^8].

30     In the case of the first appeal letter dated 5 November 2018, the accused had subsequently received a reply rejecting his appeal. The accused admitted that he received this letter of rejection before the commission of the second offence (on 23rd December 2018) but that he had gone on to commit the second offence (nonetheless) because he still “need to carry on with \[his\] job”. [^9] The accused said that he subsequently wrote a second appeal letter dated 26th December 2018 for the first incident, after receiving a notice from the LTA. The accused also sent a third appeal letter dated 22th January 2019 to appeal against the \`summons’ for the second incident. Copies of all three appeal letters (written in Mandarin) were collectively tendered in evidence as D2.

31     In summary, the accused stated that “(a)lthough I was in the wrong, I should be given a chance to explain. And a summon should not have been issued just as at the sight of---of a wrongdoing. They should also un---also understand whether this vehicle was parked there or stopped there just for a little while before going off. If I had parked there, I would have nothing to say.” The accused further said that he should only be considered to have parked (on the unbroken double yellow lines) if he had stopped his car there for “More than 10 minutes.” When questioned as to how he came up with this idea of a ‘grace period’ of 10 minutes, the accused admitted that this was not written anywhere. In addition, he admitted that this was “…not according to the law. I feel that 10 minutes is a gesture of goodwill.”[^10] Ultimately, the accused admitted that he had committed the offence of parking his car on the double yellow lines. [^11]

## (3)   The Court’s findings

32     The accused was alleged to have breached Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules (RTR). This reads “No person shall park a vehicle…on any road where unbroken double yellow lines are laid down, from the point where such lines commence to the point they end.”

33     The word “park” is defined in section 2 of the Road Traffic Act (RTA) as follows:

> “park means to bring a motor vehicle or a trailer to a stationary position and cause it to wait for any purpose other than that of immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods or luggage.

34     For the two charges that the accused faced, the evidence that he had committed the offences in question was clear. From the testimonies of the two enforcement officers (Ngan and Kishan), which were supported by the violation reports, as well as the photographs and body worn camera footages taken of the offences being committed, there was no doubt that the charges were made out, in that the driver of the car (SLU 7316R) i.e. the accused, had parked the car by leaving it stationary and unattended on the unbroken double yellow lines laid on the road, and that these breaches took place at the material place, dates and times.

35     In fact, the accused himself admitted to the commission of the offences and also admitted that he knew that what he did was wrong. Further, the accused would especially be aware of his wrongdoing as regards the second offence, since he had committed this offence, after he had already received the notice of offence from the LTA for the first offence, and especially since his appeal for the first offence had been rejected.

36     In the present case, it appeared that the “defence” raised by the accused was that he had left his car stationary and unattended for only a brief period of time, allegedly for about 5 minutes on each occasion because he was at a nearby shop picking up a cake for delivery on each occasion. This, the accused claimed, meant that he had not “parked” his vehicle. He had also urged that the LTA should be “magnanimous” and not prosecute him for the offences.

37     However, with respect, even if what the accused said was true in that he had left his car stationary and unattended for only for a short while at the incident location, the fact remained that his action of keeping his car stationary and unattended on the road in that manner on each occasion still amounted to parking his car on the road where unbroken double yellow lines are laid down. In light of the definition of “parking” under the RTA, his actions still amounted to a breach of the law, as he had undoubtedly brought his “motor vehicle…to a stationary position and cause it to wait for any purpose **_other than that of immediately taking up_** or setting down persons, **_goods_** or luggage”[^12] on each occasion. There is also nothing in the RTA or the RTR which provides for the giving of a grace period of any length to any offender, whether it be 5 minutes or “less than 10 minutes” as suggested by the accused.

38     Indeed, neither the idea nor length of the accused’s suggested “grace period” (10 minutes), was something that was provided or written anywhere, something which the accused himself admitted to. Instead, the concept of a grace period was merely something that the accused unilaterally \`felt’ should be granted out of goodwill (see \[31\]). With respect, what the accused hoped and wished for, is simply not something provided in law. And there was simply no justification for the accused, or anyone else for that matter, to pluck a completely arbitrary figure out of the air, whether it be 1 minute, 10 minutes, 60 minutes or any other figure, as the purported grace period to apply to excuse such breaches.

39     Indeed, even from the accused’s own exhibit D1, it was clearly stated that where there are continuous double yellow lines on the road, there shall be “no parking on that side of the road at all times except for the **_immediate_** picking up and alighting of passengers” (see \[24(1)\] above). In other words, the accused simply has no defence to his charges, something which he appears to be well aware of.

40     As to whether the LTA, as the body prosecuting the accused on behalf of the Public Prosecutor, should have been “magnanimous” and/or have “waived” the \`summonses’, this was not something within the purview or control of the courts. In this regard, it is clearly provided in Art 35(8) of the Constitution that it is the prerogative of the Attorney-General to “institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence”. Further, it is provided in s 11(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) that the Attorney-General as Public Prosecutor shall “have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under \[the CPC\] or any other written law”.

41     Thus, so far as initiating and continuing prosecution against any offender is concerned, this is solely a matter for the Public Prosecutor (and the person(s) he so authorizes) to decide. Further, as noted by the Court of Appeal in _Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 49</span> at \[44\]:

> “The prosecutorial power is part of the executive power, although, under existing constitutional practice, it is independently exercised by the Attorney-General as the Public Prosecutor. In view of his high office, the courts should proceed on the basis that when the Attorney- General initiates a prosecution against an offender (regardless of whether he was acting alone or in concert with other offenders), the Attorney- General does so in accordance with the law.”

42     In any event, in the present case, it appears that the Prosecution had in fact been “magnanimous” towards the accused by offering to have both his offences compounded at an early stage of the proceedings, for sums of $90 and $130 respectively (see P13 and P16). It was the accused who had declined these offers of composition. Had he accepted and paid the composition amounts, the effect would have been that there would have been no further prosecution of the accused for these offences. This, however, was not what he chose to do.

43     Thus, having reviewed the evidence, it was clear that the Prosecution had established its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted him accordingly.

## (4)   The Sentencing Phase

44     The accused is a first offender. As such, for each offence, he could have been sentenced to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months, or to both.

45     The LTA prosecutor, Mr Lau Bee Hin, submitted for a fine of between $800-$1,000 per charge, as the accused had been found guilty after a full trial. Mr Lau also informed the court that had the accused pleaded guilty earlier at the night court, the fine would have been about $400 to $600. Alternatively, if the plea of guilt had been made at the PTC (Pre-Trial Conference) stage, the fine would have been $600 to $800.

46     In mitigation, the accused again stated that he had stopped his vehicle to “pick and go”, and that he was only doing his job. He also asked to be given a chance. Finally, he indicated that he wanted to apply to pay his fine by instalments.

47     In deciding on the sentence to impose, I noted that the accused had committed both offences in the daytime and in full public view. The offences were also almost identical and committed within two months of each other. Further, in the case of the second offence, it was committed after the accused’s appeal against prosecution for his first offence had already been rejected. Yet despite not even having fully resolved his first offence, the accused went on to blatantly commit the second offence. And he was especially audacious to have committed the second offence at essentially the same place and under the same conditions.

48     In addition, the accused had shown no remorse, eschewing the offers of composition made by the authorities at earlier stages of the proceedings, and had contested the charges despite various opportunities to resolve them. In fact, even on the scheduled date of the hearing, before his trial had actually commenced, the Prosecution had offered to proceed on only one charge and to apply to take into consideration the remaining charge.[^13] However, the accused had declined the offer and continued to contest his charges instead. While the accused was perfectly entitled to claim trial, he should then not expect the sentencing discount that would normally be given in a plea guilty situation, where remorse has been demonstrated.

49     In his favour, I took into account the fact that he was a first offender, and that there was no evidence that his illegal parking had caused obstruction or inconvenience to other road users. Thus, while the court could well have imposed a heavier sentence on him especially for the second offence in light of the aggravating circumstances (see \[47\] above), I decided that it would be sufficient to impose a similar fine of $800 (in default 4 days’ imprisonment) for each charge, even though $800 was at the lower end of the range of the fine for claim trial cases.

50     Accordingly, as the accused had been convicted on two charges, the total fine imposed was $1,600 (in default 8 days’ imprisonment). Finally, consistent with his application, I allowed him to pay the fine to the LTA by four instalments of $400 each.

51     The accused being dissatisfied has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence.
