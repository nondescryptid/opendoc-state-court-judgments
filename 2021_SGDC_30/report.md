### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       In the morning of 9 July 2017, three men assaulted a man who intervened in a quarrel which did not concern him. As a result of the assault, the man, Lim Leong Tat (“the Deceased”) succumbed to his injuries, and passed away soon after the attack. The three men were subsequently charged in court:

> (i)     Mollah Hasan, a 34-year-old Bangladeshi national, was charged under section 325 read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”) for causing grievous hurt to the Deceased, in furtherance of his common intention with Rana Sohel;

> (ii)     Rana Sohel, a 38-year-old Bangladeshi national, was charged under section 325 read with section 34 of the Penal Code for causing grievous hurt to the Deceased, in furtherance of his common intention with Mollah Hasan; and

> (iii)     Reza Md Hasan (“Reza Hasan”), a 32-year-old Bangladeshi national, was charged under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code for causing hurt to the Deceased, in furtherance of his common intention with Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel.

2       Mollah Hasan, Rana Sohel and Reza Hasan (referred to collectively as “the accused persons”) were represented by the same counsel.

3       On 16 December 2020, I convicted the three accused persons of their respective charges. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation and address on sentence presented by the Defence, I sentenced the accused persons as follows:

> (i)     Mollah Hasan – four years’ imprisonment, with effect from 24 August 2018 (with the Singapore Prison Service taking into account the period that he was out on bail), and six strokes of the cane;

> (ii)     Rana Sohel – four years’ imprisonment, with effect from 21 July 2017 (with the Singapore Prison Service taking into account the period that he was out on bail), and six strokes of the cane; and

> (iii)     Reza Hasan – six months’ imprisonment, with effect from 28 September 2020.

4       Mollah Hasan has filed an appeal against sentence, while Rana Sohel has filed an appeal against both conviction and sentence. Rana Sohel is currently on bail pending appeal. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       To prove its case, the Prosecution adduced evidence from three main witnesses:

> (i)     Tan Wei Li (“Tan”) (PW7);

> (ii)     Hossen Mohamad Sanowar (“Sanowar”) (PW6); and

> (iii)     the forensic pathologist, Dr George Paul (“Dr George”) (PW9).

6       In addition, the Prosecution called six other witnesses, and adduced the conditioned statements of seven formal witnesses[^1] and a video footage (P9) of the assault. The video footage was stitched together by SSI Ng Shao Jiuan (“SSI Ng”) (PW4) in chronological order, from the various CCTV video clips which were obtained.

7       The authenticity of the video footage was not disputed, and it was also not disputed that the cause of the Deceased’s death on 9 July 2017, which was the day of the attack, was severe neck injury as reflected in the Autopsy Report (P16).

8       Further, it was not disputed that the confrontation between the Deceased and the accused persons started at the Tasvee Restaurant along Geylang Road. At that time, Sanowar was with the accused persons. Lastly, it was not disputed that the Deceased was not known to Tan[^2] and the accused persons. Neither were the accused persons or Sanowar[^3] known to Tan.

### The evidence of Tan Wei Li

9       Tan testified that on the day in question, he was at Tasvee Restaurant with his friends when he noticed the accused persons and Sanowar shouting at his friends[^4]. At that time, the accused persons and Sanowar were seated at a table within Tasvee Restaurant[^5]. Tan then approached their table and confronted them. While Tan and the accused persons were sorting out their differences (Sanowar was not involved[^6]), the Deceased suddenly appeared and interrupted their conversation[^7]. According to Tan, a fight then broke out between the Deceased and the accused persons[^8]. However, Tan was unable to recall who threw the first punch[^9].

10     Tan further testified that the accused persons then assaulted the Deceased, while Sanowar tried to stop the fight[^10]. Tan saw Reza Hasan[^11] grab the Deceased in a violent way[^12] and slapped the Deceased’s arm[^13]. Reza Hasan also pushed the Deceased, and Tan’s impression was that Reza Hasan was trying to hurt the Deceased[^14] while the Deceased struggled[^15]. At some point, the Deceased fell when Rana Sohel grabbed his hair, slammed him on the ground[^16] and hit him repeatedly[^17], and Mollah Hasan then kicked the Deceased on the head[^18].

11     Tan also remembered that the Deceased ended up falling near some steps and Rana Sohel hitting the Deceased on the back of his head[^19]. Eventually, after assaulting the Deceased, the accused persons and Sanowar left the scene. Tan approached the Deceased and asked if he needed to go to the hospital. The Deceased declined and started walking towards Geylang Lorong 24A, and Tan left the scene as well. Later that morning, Tan found out that the Deceased had passed away.

### The evidence of Hossen Mohamad Sanowar

12     Sanowar gave evidence that he was present at the Tasvee Restaurant with the accused persons on 9 July 2017. On that day, he had met Reza Hasan at a coffee shop at Geylang Lorong 14. They were subsequently joined by Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan, and all of them then went to a club at Clarke Quay where they drank until about 6.00am[^20]. Thereafter, they left the club and took a taxi to Tasvee Restaurant[^21]. They ordered some food and sat down at one of the tables. At one point, Rana Sohel shouted and demanded that their food be served[^22].

13     After Rana Sohel shouted at the staff, Tan came to their table and banged on it, proclaiming to be the boss[^23]. Tan and Rana Sohel then started arguing, and as they were arguing, the Deceased came and grabbed Rana Sohel’s collar and they started punching each other[^24].

14     Sanowar testified that he next saw Reza Hasan approach the Deceased and grab his arm. Reza Hasan slapped the Deceased’s arm (to which the Deceased responded with “Ah”) and pushed the Deceased[^25]. At some point, the Deceased and Rana Sohel each lifted a chair. Thereafter, Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan attacked the Deceased. Rana Sohel punched the Deceased’s neck[^26] and back[^27], while Mollah Hasan kicked him after the Deceased had fallen to the ground[^28]. The accused persons then ran towards the direction of Guillemard Road, and Sanowar left as well. Sanowar was arrested one or two days later.

### The aftermath and the evidence of the forensic pathologist

15     At about 7.49am, the Deceased was found by Jasper Kai Larsen (“Larsen”) (PW1) in the back lane of Geylang Lorong 24A. Larsen made a ‘999’ call (P1) and left the scene. The Singapore Civil Defence Force officers were despatched to the scene where the Deceased was pronounced dead at 8.05am[^29].

16     Dr George testified that the Deceased died of severe neck injury – there was a dislocation of the atlanto-occipital joint which caused a compression of the upper cervical cord[^30]. In addition to the dislocation of the joint, there was blood diffusion on both sides of the neck, in the back, which was related to “blunt trauma”[^31].

17     According to Dr George, a “strong directed force” from “a cumulation of multiple actions” was required to cause the kind of injury[^32] that he found. In Dr George’s opinion, in order to cause a dislocation to the neck, “one would first have to loosen and shake up the ligaments, and \[he\] would expect the force to be repetitive, instead of a single directed force”. If it was due to a single directed force, there would also have been “terrific external signs of that injury”, but he did not find any of that on the Deceased[^33]. Judging from the neck injury, Dr George opined that the blunt trauma was caused to the back of the neck[^34].

18     In relation to the Deceased being slammed against the roller shutter and then onto the ground, Dr George’s opinion was that it would have contributed to the loosening of the ligaments around the Deceased’s neck, and ultimately contributing to the subluxation injury on the neck[^35].

### The video footage

19     The stitched video footage (P9) was for a duration of about one hour fifteen minutes. It started about 13 minutes before the arrival of the accused persons and Sanowar at Tasvee Restaurant in a taxi, and ended with a man holding an umbrella and making a call on the mobile phone. The material portions of the video were at the following time-stamps:

> (i)     at time-stamp 18:43, Tan approached the table where the accused persons and Sanowar were seated and banged on the table;

> (ii)     at time-stamp 19:18, some people were seen trying to diffuse the tension between Tan and the accused persons;

> (iii)     at time-stamp 19:53, Rana Sohel and Tan were arguing with each other;

> (iv)     at time-stamp 22:58, the Deceased entered the restaurant;

> (v)     at time-stamp 23:20, Rana Sohel and the Deceased were having a confrontation;

> (vi)     at time-stamp 23:29, the Deceased punched Rana Sohel;

> (vii)     at time-stamp 23:33, Tan tried to intervene;

> (viii)    from time-stamps 23:36 to 23:41, the accused persons advanced purposefully towards the Deceased;

> (ix)     from time-stamps 23:41 to 23:45, Mollah Hasan and Reza Hasan wagged their fingers at the Deceased, following which Reza Hasan grabbed the Deceased and pushed him towards the direction of the road;

> (x)     at time-stamp 23:54, the Deceased grabbed a chair and faced Rana Sohel who was also armed with a chair;

> (xi)     from time-stamps 24:02 to 24:21, the accused persons were facing the Deceased and advancing towards him, while the Deceased retreated to the background;

> (xii)     from time-stamps 25:52 to 26:05, a few pairs of legs could be seen in the background, followed by Rana Sohel appearing in the screen, grabbing the Deceased’s hair and punching him on the back of the head or neck;

> (xiii)    at time-stamp 26:07, the Deceased fell to the ground;

> (xiv)     at time-stamp 26:10, Mollah Hasan appeared and gave a kick to the Deceased’s head, and the Deceased’s head jerked to his right;

> (xv)     between time-stamps 26:12 and 27:48, the group was not seen in the video;

> (xvi)     at time-stamp 28:20, Reza Hasan could be seen, followed by Mollah Hasan slamming the Deceased against the roller shutter at time-stamp 28:24 and then pushing him onto the concrete steps at time-stamp 28:28;

> (xvii)    at time-stamp 28:29, Rana Sohel came and pressed the Deceased’s face down with his left hand before punching him at least twice on the head, near the neck;

> (xviii)    the accused persons then ran off and disappeared from the video at time-stamp 28:35;

> (xix)     at time-stamp 28:38, Tan helped the Deceased up; and

> (xx)     at time-stamp 28:48, the Deceased wiped his face and walked off towards the direction of Tasvee Restaurant.

20     Over the next few minutes after the Deceased left the scene, Tan spoke to some people and the crowd dispersed.

21     The Deceased was seen walking alone along the backlane. He then bent down, squatted, and stood up. He started walking before squatting down again. He got up and walked a few meters before putting his hand against the wall, squatted, sat down and leaned against the wall before slumping to the ground. After the attack, and after the Deceased walked away from the scene, he was alone until his body was spotted by Larsen.

22     The accused persons were subsequently placed under arrest.

## The Defence’s Case

23     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the accused persons and called upon them to give evidence in their defence.

24     The accused persons elected to give evidence.

25     Reza Hasan denied assaulting the Deceased. He claimed that he was merely trying to stop the Deceased from fighting. Rana Sohel claimed that he only punched the Deceased on his back and at the top of his head. Mollah Hasan claimed that he tried to kick the Deceased but missed, and denied pushing the Deceased onto the concrete steps.

26     In addition, Mollah Hasan and Reza Hasan claimed that Sanowar had assaulted the Deceased.

## Closing Submissions

### The Prosecution’s submissions

27     The Prosecution approached its case in two stages.

28     The first stage being events which happened immediately after the Deceased punched Rana Sohel. In stage one, the accused persons approached the Deceased aggressively which culminated in Reza Hasan slapping the Deceased’s arm and pushing him onto the road, while acting in furtherance of his intention with Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel to cause hurt to the Deceased.

29     The second stage started after the Deceased was pushed onto the road by Reza Hasan, with Mollah Hasan and Rana Hasan pursuing the Deceased who tried to flee the scene. In the second stage, Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel repeatedly assaulted the Deceased in the neck area, in furtherance of their common intention to cause grievous hurt to the Deceased.

30     The Prosecution submitted that the video footage was objective evidence showing that the accused persons had assaulted the Deceased as charged[^36], and relied on Dr George’s evidence that the Deceased died of a severe neck injury, arising from:

> (i)     blunt force injuries to the neck;

> (ii)     a subluxation injury to the atlanto-occipital joint;

> (iii)     a subluxation injury to the upper cervical cord _i.e._, a partial dislocation of the upper neck vertebrae from the skull; and

> (iv)     an injury to the spinal cord and the lower brain stem[^37].

31     The Prosecution referred to the cases of _Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 1119</span> (“_Daniel Vijay_”), _Asogan Ramesh s/o Ramachandren and others v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 201</span> (“_Asogan Ramesh_”) and _Samlee Prathumtree and another v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 841</span>, and submitted that there was common intention amongst the accused persons to cause bodily pain and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased, based on the evidence of Tan, Sanowar and the video footage[^38]. By their actions, the accused persons intended or knew that they were likely to cause some form of bodily pain and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased[^39].

32     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the accused persons were not credible witnesses[^40], and could not rely on the defence of private defence[^41].

### The Defence’s submissions

33     The Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that the “sole issue for determination… \[was\] whether the Prosecution \[had\] proven beyond reasonable doubt that Rana \[Sohel\] and Mollah \[Hasan\] did share the common intention to cause grievous hurt \[sic\]” to the Deceased[^42].

34     The Defence argued that the incident happened due to the provocation by Tan and the Deceased, and further submitted that the assault was not premeditated and happened “in the spur of the moment and the main person who to be blame is Tan \[sic\]”. The Defence alleged that the Deceased was the one who escalated the incident to an altercation. The Deceased did not leave the scene after the initial confrontation between him and Rana Sohel but “continue\[d\] to provoke the accused persons by saying something which \[could not\] be seen or heard”[^43].

35     The Defence concluded its submission by arguing that the Prosecution failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused persons had the common intention to cause grievous hurt to the Deceased or had the knowledge that their actions would cause grievous hurt to the Deceased[^44].

## My Decision

### The ingredients of the charges

36     Although only Rana Sohel had filed an appeal against conviction, I will explain my decision in convicting all the accused persons for completeness.

37     The ingredients for the section 323 charge are:

> (a)     Reza Hasan caused bodily pain to the Deceased; and

> (b)     he did so in furtherance of his common intention with Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel to do so.

38     The ingredients of the section 325 charge are:

> (a)     Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel assaulted the Deceased;

> (b)     they knew that their actions would likely result in grievous hurt being caused to the Deceased, or they intended to cause grievous hurt to the Deceased by their actions; and

> (b)     they did so in furtherance of their common intention to do so.

### The main issues

39     The main issues to be determined in the present case were (i) whether the accused persons had caused bodily pain to the Deceased and whether they had inflicted the injuries, found by Dr George, on the Deceased; and (ii) whether they had acted in furtherance of their common intention.

40     Whether the accused persons had caused hurt and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased was based primarily on a finding of facts. As for the accused persons’ _mens rea_, they denied having any intention, common or otherwise, to cause any bodily pain or injuries to the Deceased.

41     According to the case of _Daniel Vijay_ at \[91\], the following three elements must be present in order for the accused persons to be made liable for their acts:

> (a)     the criminal act element – the criminal act done by the doer was commonly intended by all the offenders[^45];

> (b)     the common intention element – this could be inferred from “the offenders’ conduct and all the other relevant circumstances of the case”[^46]; and

> (b)     the participation element – this would include the participation, by an offender, “in any of the diverse acts which together form the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence charged, that unity of criminal behaviour being commonly intended by all the offenders”[^47].

42     In relation to the common intention element, this could be inferred from the presence of a unity of conduct amongst the offenders: see _Asogan Ramesh_ at \[31\] to \[35\].

### Credibility of the Prosecution witnesses

43     Tan and Sanowar gave coherent and consistent accounts of the incident on 9 July 2017. Tan was not known to the accused persons, the Deceased and Sanowar, and the Defence did not offer any reason for Tan to lie or fabricate evidence against the accused persons. Likewise, Sanowar had no reason to lie – the accused persons were his friends, while the Deceased was unknown to him. There was therefore no reason for him to falsely implicate the accused persons.

44     The accounts of Tan and Sanowar were supported by objective video evidence which authenticity was not challenged by the Defence, nor was it alleged by the Defence that SSI Ng had missed out footage which was relevant to the present case. Tan’s and Sanowar’s accounts of the assault, and the video footage corroborated Dr George’s expert opinion that the Deceased’s death was due to a severe neck injury:

> (i)     I accepted Tan’s and Sanowar’s evidence that Reza Hasan had grabbed or slapped the Deceased’s arm before pushing him towards the road. This was captured at time-stamps 23:41 to 23:45 of the video. Tan’s evidence was that Reza Hasan had grabbed the Deceased by the arm and was trying to hurt him. The Deceased was seen struggling. As for Sanowar, his evidence was that he heard a slapping sound when Reza Hasan hit the Deceased’s arm, and the Deceased had exclaimed “Ah”. This happened soon after Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan were seen wagging their fingers at the Deceased and moving towards him in an aggressive manner.

> (ii)     I accepted the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that the Deceased, other than punching Rana Sohel at the beginning, did not hit any of the other accused persons before he was assaulted by Reza Hasan.

> (iii)     I further accepted the evidence of Tan that the Deceased and the accused persons then moved towards the five-foot way in the direction of the KTV lounge. Tan saw Rana Sohel grab the Deceased by his hair and hit him, while Sanowar saw Rana Sohel punch the Deceased on his neck. They then witnessed the Deceased’s falling on the five-foot way and Mollah Hasan kicking him. Tan testified that the kick landed on the Deceased’s head while Sanowar said that although the kick landed on the Deceased, he was unsure which part of the Deceased’s body was kicked. That the Deceased did not attack the accused persons was apparent from Tan’s evidence – Tan testified that he had picked up a metal rack to stop Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan from further assaulting the Deceased.

> (iv)     Finally, I accepted the evidence of Tan that Rana Sohel came and punched the Deceased’s head, while the Deceased was lying near the steps, before the accused persons ran off.

45     I found Sanowar to be an honest witness who did not embellish his testimony in court. For example, Sanowar readily admitted that he did not see where, on the Deceased’s body, Mollah Hasan’s kick had landed. Likewise, Tan did not downplay his role and readily admitted that he had exchanged vulgarities with Rana Sohel at the start, as he had mistakenly thought that Rana Sohel was scolding his friends. He also did not embellish his evidence and admitted that he was unsure who had started the fight.

46     As for whether Reza Hasan had caused bodily pain to the deceased, it could be inferred from the Deceased’s reaction to Reza Hasan’s action that some form of bodily pain was caused. Sanowar had testified that he could hear a slapping sound when Reza Hasan’s hand came into contact with the Deceased, and the Deceased had said “Ah”. Tan also testified that the Deceased reacted to Reza Hasan’s action by struggling.

### The portions of the stitched video showing the assault

47     I found that the video corroborated the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that the accused persons had assaulted the Deceased, thus satisfying the criminal act element as enunciated in _Daniel Vijay_.

48     It was clear from the video from time-stamps 23:36 to 23:45 that the accused persons were moving towards the Deceased in a menacing manner, and Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan were wagging their fingers aggressively at the Deceased. This happened just before Reza Hasan hit and grabbed the Deceased’s arm, and then pushed him towards the direction of the road. It was clear from the video that Reza Hasan’s action was a deliberate attack, and not an action which was accidental or borne out of self-defence.

49     Between time-stamps 25:52 and 26:10, Rana Sohel could be seen grabbing the Deceased’s hair and punching him on the back of the head near the neck. Thereafter, the Deceased fell to the ground. While the Deceased was still on the ground, Mollah Hasan came from behind and gave a kick to the Deceased’s head, which resulted in the Deceased’s head jerking to his right. Likewise, the actions of Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan were deliberate and not borne out of self-defence.

50     At time-stamp 28:20, Reza Hasan appeared on the screen, followed by Mollah Hasan slamming the Deceased against the roller shutter at time-stamp 28:24. The Deceased was then pushed onto the concrete steps at time-stamp 28:28, and was at an awkward angle, with his neck twisted to his left. While the Deceased was still lying on the concrete steps, Rana Sohel came from behind and pressed the Deceased’s face down with his left hand before punching the Deceased at least twice on the head, near the neck.

### Dr George’s evidence

51     It was clear from Dr George’s evidence that the Deceased died of a severe neck injury. Dr George explained that in order to cause a subluxation of the atlanto-occipital joint, the ligaments and muscles around the joint would first have to be “softened”. He opined that it was unlikely that a single force had caused the severe neck injury in view of the absence of any obvious external injury nor would falling, on the part of the Deceased, result in the kind of injuries he found on the Deceased.

52     Dr George further opined that a cumulation of blunt trauma to the back of the Deceased’s neck would likely have caused the injuries found by him. In addition, it was Dr George’s opinion that the action of slamming the Deceased on the roller shutter followed by a hard push onto the concrete steps with the Deceased’s neck twisted to the left would have contributed to the loosening of the ligaments and muscles around his neck.

### Whether the accused persons had acted in furtherance of their common intention to cause hurt and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased

53     Having determined that the accused persons had satisfied the “criminal act element” by assaulting the Deceased, as seen from the video and according to the evidence of Tan and Sanowar, I next considered if the accused persons had acted with common intention to cause hurt and/or grievous hurt to the Deceased.

54     It is clear from _Daniel Vijay_ at \[97\] that whether there was common intention between the offenders could be inferred from their conduct and the surrounding circumstances. It is also trite that common intention amongst the offenders can be developed on the spot (see _Asogan Ramesh_ at \[34\]).

55     The video showed the Deceased punching Rana Sohel at time-stamp 23:29. The accused persons reacted adversely to it and started advancing towards the Deceased who retreated to the foreground of the video. In fact, the Defence had described Mollah Hasan and Rezan Hasan to be “charging towards” the Deceased[^48] and “the manner like want to go and attack him \[sic\]”[^49]. Mollah Hasan and Reza Hasan were wagging their fingers before Reza Hasan slapped and grabbed the Deceased’s arm, and pushed him towards the road. Rana Sohel could be seen just behind them at that juncture. It could therefore be inferred by the conduct of the accused persons that there was a common intention between them to cause hurt to the Deceased for punching Rana Sohel, moments before the accused persons acts of aggression.

56     After the Deceased was assaulted by Reza Hasan, the accused persons could be seen pursuing the Deceased who then retreated to the background of the video. It was the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that all three accused persons followed the Deceased to the five-foot way. At some point, Rana Sohel grabbed the Deceased by his hair and punched the nape of the Deceased’s neck. Reza Hasan could be seen walking parallel to them and looking on at time-stamp 26:05 as the Deceased was being assaulted by Rana Sohel. This was followed by Mollah Hasan who gave the Deceased a hard kick on the head.

57     The Deceased was further assaulted by Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, with Reza Hasan hovering around during the further assaults by Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel.

58     Having viewed the video, and considered the conduct of the accused persons and the surrounding circumstances, it was clear to me that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel had acted with common intention when they relentlessly pursued the Deceased and took turns to attack him.

59     By attacking a vulnerable part of the Deceased’s body repeatedly, which was his neck or his head near the neck, Rana Sohel and Mollah Hasan must have the knowledge that some form of grievous hurt would be caused, or intended for some form of grievous hurt to be caused:

> … In the present case, as explained above, the appellant’s blow was of such a significant force, that in my judgment, it displayed, at the very least, the appellant’s clear knowledge that he was likely to cause grievous hurt, and, having as a matter of fact caused grievous hurt, he was thus guilty of an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code.

> (_per_ Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 116</span> at \[47\])

60     I disbelieved the allegations of the accused persons that Sanowar had contributed to the Deceased’s injuries by hitting him. This was flatly denied by Sanowar, and corroborated by Tan’s evidence that Sanowar did not partake in the assault of the Deceased. I will deal more with the credibility of the accused persons below.

61     I next considered the presence of the “participation element” in relation to the accused persons _i.e._, the formation of the unity of criminal behaviour from their individual acts. While Reza Hasan did not assault the Deceased beyond hitting the Deceased on his arm and pushing him towards the road, Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel continued to assault the Deceased after he was pushed onto the road by Reza Hasan. Their participation was clear from the video footage, and the evidence of Tan and Sanowar, which showed a “unity of criminal behaviour” on the part of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, resulting in grievous hurt being caused to the Deceased.

### Credibility of the accused persons

62     Having found that the Prosecution has proved its case against the accused persons, I considered whether the Defence had raised a reasonable doubt.

63     In determining the credibility of the accused persons, I took into account the consistency of their evidence and their demeanour in court. As pointed out by the Prosecution, their evidence was externally and internally inconsistent and they were evasive in court. The following are some examples:

> (i)     Reza Hasan claimed that when he and Mollah Hasan charged towards the Deceased, they had intended to tell him not to fight as the Deceased was “taking position to fight again”[^50].

> Reza Hasan then grabbed the Deceased’s arm and told him to move[^51]. However, under cross-examination, Reza Hasan claimed that he did not grab or push the Deceased. When he finally conceded that he was in an angry mood, he claimed that it was because he was hungry and did not sleep the night before[^52].

> Reza Hasan’s evidence that he had not intentionally slapped the Deceased’s arm was contradicted by the evidence of Tan and Sanowar. In any event, it was not apparent from the video footage the Deceased was “taking a position to fight” when Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan approached him.

> (ii)     Reza Hasan claimed in examination-in-chief that the Deceased had punched Rana Sohel five to six times[^53], while in cross-examination, he claimed that the Deceased had punched Rana Sohel two to four times[^54]. However, Rana Sohel himself said that the Deceased had only punched him once[^55].

> (iii)     When Reza Hasan was questioned why he had wagged his finger at the Deceased, Reza Hasan gave an illogical reply – that he had intended to raise five fingers, but because he did not sleep the whole night and had not had breakfast, he ended up raising just one finger[^56].

> (iv)     Reza Hasan tried to distance himself from the scene when he claimed that he left the scene midway through the altercation[^57]. However, he could clearly be seen in the video, and his evidence that he left halfway was contradicted by the evidence of Tan and Sanowar.

> (v)     Rana Sohel claimed that he only punched the Deceased’s back and head. However, this was contradicted by the video evidence showing that Rana Sohel had punched the Deceased’s nape and head. In addition, Tan saw Rana Sohel hitting the Deceased on the neck. Tan was an independent eye-witness who neither knew the Deceased or the accused persons at the time of the incident.

> (vi)     Rana Sohel claimed that the Deceased’s severe neck injury could have been due to the Deceased’s fall on the concrete steps. His claim was directly contradicted by the expert evidence of Dr George.

> (vii)     Mollah Hasan claimed that although he tried to kick the Deceased, he had missed and his foot did not come into contact with the Deceased. This contradicted the Defence’s position when IO Lim Leong Chee was being cross-examined – that Mollah Hasan had either _stepped or stamped_ on the Deceased’s head[^58], and not that Mollah Hasan had _kicked_ the Deceased. His assertion was also contradicted by the video footage that his kick landed on the Deceased, which caused the Deceased’s head, as could be seen on the video footage, jerking to the side.

> (viii)    Mollah Hasan claimed that he did not throw the Deceased against the roller shutter or slam the Deceased onto the concrete steps – this was contradicted by the video footage, which showed clearly that Mollah Hasan had thrown the Deceased against the roller shutter before slamming him onto the concrete steps. Mollah Hasan’s inexplicable assertion that the Deceased had punched him a few times at that juncture and had fallen on his own, thereby dragging Mollah Hasan along[^59] was not supported by the video footage, which was objective evidence.

> (ix)     Mollah Hasan asserted that the Deceased had hit his head against the bollard and passed away as a result[^60]. This was neither put to Dr George nor borne out by the video footage.

> (x)     Reza Hasan and Mollah Hasan claimed that Sanowar had assaulted the Deceased. However, this was directly contradicted by the evidence of Tan, and Rana Sohel testified that he was not aware that Sanowar had assaulted the Deceased[^61].

### Defence of provocation

64     In its Closing Submission, the Defence raised the defence of provocation[^62]. In my view, neither Tan’s or the Deceased’s actions constituted grave and sudden provocation. The episode between Tan and the accused persons had clearly blown over by the time the Deceased punched Rana Sohel. They turned towards the Deceased and went after him relentlessly – the Deceased was clearly outnumbered by them and was no match for them. Even if the Deceased’s punch had provoked them, it was insufficient to amount to grave and sudden provocation and certainly not to the extent of causing them to be deprived of their self-control to cause them to attack the Deceased so viciously. The attack by Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel was totally disproportionate to the single punch that the Deceased gave to Rana Sohel.

65     The accused persons claimed that the Deceased had challenged them to a fight and/or had punched them along the five-foot way during the portion of the video that neither the accused persons were, nor the Deceased was visible in the video. Likewise, even if this was true (which I rejected), I did not think that it was sufficient to amount to grave and sudden provocation. In any event, I disbelieved that the Deceased had assaulted the accused persons along the five-foot way as I accepted the evidence of Tan and Sanowar that the Deceased did not assault the accused persons beyond the first punch that he threw at Rana Sohel.

66     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case, beyond a reasonable doubt, against the accused persons. In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that an adverse inference be drawn against Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, under section 169 of the CPC for failing to mention their Case for the Defence that Sanowar had also attacked the Deceased. However, I found the evidence against them overwhelming, and there was no necessity for me to draw an adverse inference against them, under section 169 of the CPC, in order to convict them.

## The Sentence

67     An offence under section 325 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. In addition, the offender is also liable to fine, or to caning.

### Antecedents

68     Mollah Hasan was convicted, on 31 May 2018, of an offence of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code and sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment.

69     Rana Sohel was untraced.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence

70     The Prosecution adopted the two-step sentencing approach laid down in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”) at \[55\] and \[56\], and submitted for a sentence of at least four and a half years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. The Prosecution submitted that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel had repeatedly assaulted the Deceased in the neck region and had kicked him in the head. This was even though the Deceased was trying to disengage from them. Based on _BDB_, the starting point would be a term of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane[^63]. In its submissions, the Prosecution highlighted four aggravating factors: (i) the assault on the Deceased was brutal and sustained; (ii) it was a group assault; (iii) the assault caused public disquiet; and (iv) the offence was committed while Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel were on bail for other offences[^64].

71     However, the Prosecution recognised that there was “no clear evidence” that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel “had intended or anticipated that death would ensue” from their attack. Taking reference from the case of _Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 449</span> (“_Muhammad Khalis_”), the Prosecution submitted that the sentence in the present case should not be less than the sentence imposed on the offender in _Muhammad Khalis_. In _Muhammad Khalis_, the deceased had died after hitting his head on a road kerb as a result of a single blow to his jaw by the offender.

### The Mitigation Plea

72     In its Mitigation Plea, the Defence submitted, for a sentence of “at least three years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane”.

73     The Defence submitted that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel were remorseful and they “sincerely apologised” to the Deceased’s family[^65]. They did not plan the assault, and no weapon was used. In addition, it submitted that Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel did not start the fight and that it could not be ruled out that “the Deceased and Tan \[were\] completely blameless”. Both of them did not envisage that their assault would “end with the death” of the Deceased[^66].

74     In relation to Mollah Hasan, the Defence further highlighted that his parents were in Bangladesh and were ill – they just wanted Mollah Hasan to return to them as soon as possible[^67]. With respect to Rana Sohel, the Defence highlighted that he was the sole bread winner of his family, and he has a five-year-old son who required dialysis[^68].

### Decision on sentence

75     I took guidance from the case of _BDB_ and applied a two-step process in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel[^69]:

> (a)    First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

> (b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

76     In the present case, the injuries caused were serious, and the consequences were fatal. According to the case of _BDB_, the starting point in a case where death is caused “should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years”[^70] and 12 strokes of the cane[^71].

77     Having identified the starting point for this case, I next considered the culpability of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel. The facts of the present case bore some similarities to the facts in _Muhammad Khalis_. In that case, the offender pleaded guilty to two rioting charges and a drug consumption charge. However, he claimed trial to a charge under section 325 of the Penal Code (“the section 325 charge”). He was convicted of the section 325 charge and sentenced to a term of seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

78     The offender was involved in two rioting incidents immediately before the incident involving the section 325 charge. The deceased was not involved in the rioting incidents although he was present at the scene and had observed the two incidents. After the two rioting incidents, the offender became involved in a third dispute, involving the offender’s friend and the deceased’s friend. When the deceased tried to intervene, the offender came from behind and gave the deceased a lunging punch. The punch landed on the deceased’s jaw and caused the deceased to fall, landing on is head and shoulder. The deceased was unable to take any evasive action or break his fall as the punch had knocked him unconscious. On appeal, his sentence was reduced to four and a half years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane.

79     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were aggravating factors. First, both Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel committed the present offences while on bail. Second, the assault was sustained and they had pursued the Deceased even as he tried to disengage. Third, the Deceased was outnumbered by them. Finally, the incident was committed in the morning, in full view of members of public, thereby causing public disquiet.

80     I next considered the factors raised by the Defence in mitigation. In the present case, Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel had claimed trial. While it was their right to claim trial to the charges, it would mean that they were not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of a first-time offender pleading guilty to his charge in a timeous manner. Contrary to their Mitigation Plea, I did not find them to be remorseful. They did not take the trial seriously – they were talking amongst themselves in the dock and snickering, and had to be told off[^72]. Their antics only stopped after they were told to sit at a distance from each other.

81     In relation to their family circumstances, it is well established that other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (_Ong Ker Seng v PP_ \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 406 at \[30\] and _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[31\]).

82     However, I was of the view that the culpability of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel was not as high as the offender’s culpability in _Muhammad Khalis_. The offender in _Muhammad Khalis_ had a chequered past and the attack against the deceased in that case was completely unprovoked. The offender was also involved in two other rioting incidents which culminated into the offence leading to the death of the deceased.

83     Having the above in mind, I was of the view that a sentence which was slightly less than that meted out on the offender in _Muhammad Khalis_ was fair, and I therefore imposed a sentence of four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel. As Mollah Hasan was in remand at the time of sentence, I ordered his sentence to be backdated to his date of remand, and gave directions for the Singapore Prison Service to take into account the period that Mollah Hasan was on bail. Rana Sohel was also in remand before he was bailed out, and his sentence was likewise backdated to his date of remand, with the Singapore Prison Service to take into account the period that Rana Sohel was released on bail.

84     For completeness, Reza Hasan was sentenced to a term of six months’ imprisonment for his role in this incident. Unlike Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, he was charged for a lesser offence under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.

## Conclusion

85     Having given careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel. In my view, a sentence of four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of cane would adequately reflect the culpability of Mollah Hasan and Rana Sohel, and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.
