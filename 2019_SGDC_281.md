### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 62 year-old male Singaporean, was charged for committing mischief by setting fire at a HDB void-deck in the wee hours of the morning which caused extensive damage to the building amounting to more than $30,000. He was represented and claimed trial to the charge. At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. He appealed against both his conviction and sentence. At the time of writing these grounds, he is serving his imprisonment sentence.

## Charge

2       The charge against accused read as follows:

> You…are charged that you, on 20 June 2017, at about 4.46am, at the void deck of HDB Blk 14A Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, Singapore, did commit mischief by fire, _to wit_, by using a lighter to set a discarded mattress on fire, knowing it likely that you would thereby cause damage to the said building and hence wrongful loss to the public, and thereby causing S$33,058.88 worth of damage to the said building, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 435 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

## The Prosecution’s Case

### Prosecution’s Case

3       The Prosecution’s case against the accused is summarised in the prosecution’s submission.[^1] Essentially, the prosecution alleged that the accused had committed the offence of mischief by fire by using a cigarette lighter to intentionally set fire to a mattress which was discarded at the void deck of HDB Block 14A Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, Singapore (“the void deck”). The said mattress was left propped up against the wall at an area (“mattress area”)[^2] where residents would discard unwanted items which was near the refuse collection point (“refuse area”)[^3]. The fire, which the accused intentionally started, spread and caused serious damage to the block of flats. The damage to Block 14A may be seen in the photographs that were tendered in evidence.[^4] The residents had to be evacuated from their homes whilst the fire brigade was putting out the fire. One resident was conveyed to hospital due to smoke inhalation. The repair costs amounted to $33,058.88 as reflected in the charge.

4       The prosecution’s case (as evidenced by uncontroverted CCTV footage and the accused’s police statements) was that the accused was the only person present at the void deck seconds before the mattress started burning. Prosecution also led expert evidence that only a naked flame could have caused the fire of such a magnitude to start so quickly. The prosecution alleged that the accused made two successive trips to the mattress area from his unit which was in the adjacent block. He was looking for discarded items to be salvaged. He lit a cigarette with his lighter and was smoking. On the second trip, he used his lighter to set the mattress on fire. He then went to the market nearby.

5       On his way back to his flat, he saw that he had started a fire which raged uncontrollably and also that the SCDF officers had arrived to put out the fire. The accused ran back to his unit. The CCTV at the staircase landing of his block captured him running up the stairs back to his unit. The police managed to identify the accused from the various CCTV footages and tracked him down by the afternoon. When the police paid him a visit later that afternoon, he denied being at the void deck in the morning. He further denied knowing about the fire until he was confronted with the fact that there was a great commotion as a result of the fire. The prosecution contended that the accused had lied to cover up his commission of the arson.

### The Undisputed Evidence

6       The undisputed circumstantial evidence is set out as follows.[^5]

7       It was not in dispute that in the early hours on the material morning i.e. 20 June 2017, the accused went to the void deck looking to salvage items that had been discarded by residents. It was not in dispute that there was a discarded mattress that was leaning against the wall. There were other discarded furniture items including a sofa. It was also not in dispute that the origin of the fire was the burning of the mattress.

8       Various CCTV footages were tendered in evidence and were not disputed.[^6] The footage (from channel 1 at the void deck) captured the accused at the void deck on both visits to salvage discarded items. He was captured on the footage near the mattress and with a cigarette in his mouth at time stamp 4:45:57 in the morning.[^7] It was not in dispute that he left the void deck at 4:46:22 and was no longer seen from this channel of the footage.[^8]

9       It was not in dispute that at 4:47:00, a tongue of flame is seen on the footage emanating from the top of the mattress. It was not disputed that the fire had already started.[^9] A ‘999’ call was made at 4:51:32 by a member of the public to alert the police of the fire at the void deck.[^10]

10     The accused was then captured on CCTV at his block at about 4:55:20 going up the stairs back to his flat. Whilst the prosecution contended that he was running up the stairs, the accused said he was walking at a normal pace.

11     The accused was arrested that afternoon at about 5.45pm.[^11] He provided the following statements to the police which were admitted in evidence without challenge:

> (i)     an oral statement made to one of the arresting officers (PW3 James Tan) just before his arrest on 20 June 2017 at 5pm[^12];

> (ii)     a long statement recorded by PW1 ASP Seah Kah Peng on 20 June 2017 at 8:38pm[^13];

> (iii)     a further long statement recorded by PW2 ASP Joyce Lau on 21 June 2017 at 6.50pm[^14]; and

> (iv)     a cautioned statement recorded by PW4 Insp Hafiz on 29 September 2017[^15].

12     It was not disputed that the total cost of repairs in respect of the damage caused by the fire at Block 14A was $33,058.88.[^16]

### Fire Investigation Report

13     A Fire Investigation Report (“FIR”) prepared by the SCDF was admitted in evidence.[^17] The SCDF officers who investigated the cause of the fire and who respectively prepared and reviewed the report were called to testify and explain their findings.[^18] Their expertise were not called into question by counsel who cross-examined them to test the validity of their assumptions, findings and conclusions.

14     The SCDF officers made the following conclusions in their FIR which they confirmed and maintained in their oral evidence:

> (a)     Based on the their investigation and findings, the most probable cause of the fire was determined to be incendiary.

> (b)     Naked light from a lighter was believed to be the ignition source.

> (c)     The rubbish bin and discarded items in front of the Pump Room were the ignition fuels.

> (d)     The case was duly handed over to INSP Joyce Lau from Tangling Police Division Headquarters for further investigation.

15     In essence and in summary, what the SCDF officers concluded was that they determined that the fire was most probably incendiary i.e. it was intentionally started and not accidental. They also explained in court that the fire was ignited by a naked light from a lighter as opposed to smoulders from a lit cigarette.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

16     At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for the defence did not make any submission of no case to answer. Given the evidence before the court, I found that there was prima facie evidence to support the key elements of the charge at this stage of the trial. Accordingly, I called on the accused to give his defence to the said charge.

## The Defence

17     The accused elected to give his evidence on oath. He was the only defence witness. His testimony is comprehensively set out in counsel’s closing submission to which I have referred in summarising the accused’s defence.[^19]

### The accused’s evidence

18     In summary, the accused is a 62 year-old man residing with his uncle in a small rental flat on the 2nd floor of the adjacent block.[^20] He has lived there since 2009.

19     On the morning of the material day in question, the accused woke up at about 3:30am because he was fasting. It was the fasting month and he woke up early to break his fast.[^21] He then sat outside his unit, as he usually does. From where he was seated, he had a clear view of the refuse chute area outside of the void deck of Block 14A. He saw some discarded items at the refuse area which piqued his interest.

20     He proceeded to the refuse area to “_see if \[he\] could take back any items like fan…TV..items that \[he\] can carry back home._”[^22] At the time, it was not in dispute that he was bare-bodied and wearing only a pair of shorts.[^23] This fact was important because the CCTV footage of the void deck showed a bare chested person walking around at the void deck and it was not disputed that the said person was the accused. This was the first trip to the void deck.

21     It was also not in dispute that the accused did not see any discarded item that he wanted to salvage. He saw but was not interested in the various items, including a mattress that was propped up against the wall. He went back to his unit.

22     The accused said he wanted to go to the market at Block 18 to purchase a copy of the newspaper. He put on a t-shirt before leaving his unit. Just before leaving the flat, he said he lit a cigarette with a lighter which he then kept in his kitchen drawer. It was a crucial point for the defence that he did not take the lighter out of the flat but kept it back in the kitchen drawer.[^24] The inference flowing from that would be that he did not, at any point in time, use his lighter to start the fire at the void deck. Further, the accused claimed that he would not have carried a lighter because he was down to his last cigarette and there would have been no need for the lighter even if he was minded to carry the lighter with him that morning. In addition, he also claimed that the lighter fluid was almost used up.[^25]

23     He was smoking his cigarette when he left his flat for the market. He had to pass by the void deck _en route_ to Block 18 and he decided to check the refuse area/mattress area again to see if any new item had been discarded during the short space of time after the first trip.[^26] He did not find anything new. This was the second trip to the void deck. He testified that he then discarded his cigarette in the area and proceeded to the market at Block 18. He claimed that he did not see where his discarded cigarette had landed.[^27] The accused said as much in his further statement:

> When I reached there the 2nd time, I was still smoking the cigarette. I looked and make a check, there was nothing new there, so before I left, I throw my cigarette on the floor. There was paper on the floor.[^28]

24     In essence, the accused was prepared to accept that his discarded cigarette had started the fire (possibly by igniting the waste papers strewn on the floor) but disputed the prosecution’s case that he caused the fire by intentionally setting fire to the mattress.

25     The accused proceeded to Block 18 to purchase newspaper and he returned home thereafter. He claimed that he did not see the refuse area on the way back and was not aware of any fire.[^29] He also denied running up the stairs back to his flat. He went back to sleep and was woken up at about 10am by his uncle who informed him of the fire at Block 14A.[^30] They left the flat in the afternoon to buy food and when they returned, the accused was arrested by the police who was waiting for him.[^31] He was questioned by the police. A statement was recorded from him that day. More statements were recorded from him thereafter, including a cautioned statement on 29 September 2017.

## The Court’s Findings and Decision

### The accused was the only person present

26     I agreed with prosecution’s submission and I found that the accused was the only person present at the void deck at the material time just before the fire started.

27     It was not in dispute that he was the only person seen in the CCTV footage at the void deck just before the first tongue of flame was seen at around 4:47 am. The accused did not dispute that he was the only person at the void deck. He did not claim that he saw any one else at the void deck throughout the time that he was at the void deck on both trips. The accused in fact admitted in his further long statement that he was alone in the area:

> QDid you see any one loitering around the area when you walked away from blk 14A

> AI did not see anyone.[^32]

28     The accused also confirmed in his evidence in court that he was the only one around at the void deck before the fire started.[^33]

29     Further, as rightly pointed out by the prosecution, it was very early in the morning well before 5 am and there was little reason for anyone else to be loitering at the void deck.

30     Based on the evidence of the surrounding circumstances and by his own admission, I found that the accused was the only person at the void deck just before the fire started at the mattress area. I therefore found that he was the only person at the void deck at the material time who could have started the fire.

### The accused started the fire

31     As highlighted earlier, the CCTV footage captured the accused last standing behind the mattress at 4:46:22 which is 38 seconds before the fire started (as evidenced by the tongue of flame) at 4:47:00. It was also not in dispute that the accused was smoking even before he was last captured by the CCTV camera near the mattress. Even assuming that the accused had left the area at exactly 4:46:22, no one else was seen near the mattress area until the flames were seen at 4:47:00. Counsel stressed the point that the refuse area was accessible to everyone and suggested that someone else hiding on the other side of the mattress would not have been captured by the CCTV.[^34] Even if so, the evidence of the accused would have discounted that suggestion because the accused himself admitted that there was no one else at the void deck.

32     As rightly submitted by the prosecution, even though the flame itself was first visible at 4:47:00, in actual fact, the mattress was already burning before that because the reflection of the flames (in the form of an orange glow) can already be seen on the wall opposite the mattress at 4:46:44. There was no mistaking that the orange glow on the wall was a reflection of the flames due to the flickering nature and height of the glow. I therefore found that the mattress was already burning at this point in time i.e. 4:46:44.[^35] In other words, the window period is narrowed to 22 seconds from the time the accused presumably left the mattress area till the time the orange glow became visible on the CCTV footage. Given that the evidence did not show anyone else in the vicinity and that burning and igniting the mattress into flames would require some time, I rejected the defence suggestion that someone else could have come along during that very short window period to start the fire. I found that it was the accused who had caused the mattress to burn.

33     I turn now to the question of how he started the fire.

### Fire not caused by discarded cigarette

34     I accepted the SCDF officers’ expert evidence that the fire was started by a naked flame (e.g. from a lighter) as opposed to smoulders (e.g. from a discarded lit cigarette). They also testified that the burn patterns and damage caused indicated that the fire had started at the mattress area.[^36] The place of origin of the fire was not in substantial dispute.

35     LTA Sasi Kumar also pointed out that the orange glow was reflected off the wall opposite where the mattress was situated. There was no doubt that the fire started at the mattress area, if not the mattress itself. I accepted the SCDF officers’ testimonies that the fire was unlikely to have been caused by the embers of a cigarette because the transition from a smouldering state to flaming combustion for a cigarette is quite slow.[^37] In particular, I accepted CPT Cindy Han’s evidence that in her experience, for a discarded cigarette to even ignite waste paper, it would require a few minutes even to produce smoke, and thereafter, a flame may develop.[^38] LTA Sasi Kumar’s experience and evidence was consistent. He testified that in his opinion, the embers from a lit cigarette was unlikely to have caused the fire in this case because a huge the blaze had developed in a very short span of time.[^39]

36     CPT Cindy Han also relied on literature to the effect that the transition from smoulders to flames would on average take as long as 8 minutes for paper products. In an experiment with a cigarette placed horizontally on a cardboard and with a constant wind speed of 1 m/s, the ignition took 5 minutes.[^40] CPT Han explained that a constant movement of air would assist in ignition. However, in real world conditions, there would unlikely be a sufficient and constant airflow. The SCDF officers opined that the mattress material was more difficult to burn than paper products.[^41] Therefore, had it been a cigarette, it would have taken between 45 – 60 minutes for a mattress to catch fire.[^42]

37     CPT Han further testified that having reviewed 720 cases over three years, she has never encountered a case of a smouldering cigarette transitioning into a flame in under a minute.[^43]

38     It was not disputed that the accused was last captured on CCTV still smoking at 4:45:57. That would represent the earliest time that he had discarded his cigarette, although it could even be later since the accused said he discarded his cigarette when he left the area. If there were already flames (as reflected on the wall as a flickering orange glow) at 4:46:44 and assuming he discarded his cigarette at 4:45:57, that would mean that there would have only been a very short period of 47 seconds for the discarded cigarette to ignite the mattress. Even on the assumption of the defence’s best case scenario of more than 60 seconds between the time the cigarette was discarded (4:45:57) to the time that the tongue of flame was first captured on the CCTV (4:47:00), I accepted CPT Han’s opinion that the cigarette would not have started the fire in that short period of time.[^44] I found that the accused’s discarded cigarette would not have ignited the waste paper that were present on the floor in such a short period of time, let alone the mattress. In short, I found that the cause of the fire was not the accused’s discarded cigarette and I rejected the accused’s defence that he might have inadvertently caused the fire by discarding his cigarette on the floor.

### The accused used his lighter to start the fire

39     I accepted LTA Sasi Kumar’s investigative finding that no accelerants (e.g. kerosene, petrol etc) were used to cause the fire. The SCDF officers combed the scene with a combustible gas detector when he attended the scene and did not detect any vapours or traces of the presence of accelerants. The officers combed the area twice just to be sure.[^45] There was also no other physical evidence that an accelerant was involved i.e. no empty containers at the scene that could have been used to store the accelerant.[^46]

40     The SCDF team also ruled out the cause of the fire to be of electrical origin. This was due to the absence of energised equipment at or near the origin of the fire. I further accepted that the void deck lights were still functioning after the fire started[^47]and that there was also no evidence to suggest other accidental causes.[^48] I therefore found that the cause of the fire was not accidental. I accepted the conclusion in the FIR that the cause of the fire was incendiary.

41     I agreed with prosecution’s assertion that the accused had started the fire by using a lighter to ignite the mattress. I also agreed with the prosecution’s case that the accused had brought his lighter with him to the void deck and the mattress area during the second trip. The lighter was admitted in evidence.[^49]

42     Contrary to the defence position that the accused did not bring the lighter to the scene, the accused admitted that he kept the lighter in his pocket when he left his flat the second time:

> Q:Where did you keep your lighter after you light your cigarette outside your house?

> A:In my right side pants pocket.

> Q:What else was in your possession when you left your house the 2nd time?

> A:I have my wallet in my back pants pocket. My right front pants pocket was my light. I never bring anything else. The cigarette was in my mouth.[^50]

43     The accused, however, tried to distance himself from what he had said in his statement. He claimed he did not provide these answers. I rejected the accused’s claim that these answers were not provided by him. First of all, this claim was not put to the recorder of the statement i.e. PW2 ASP Joyce Lau. The statement was admitted without any challenge from counsel as to its voluntariness. Counsel also did not challenge the accuracy of the statement and certainly did not put to ASP Lau that some of the answers were not made by the accused. This claim (that the above answers were not provided by the accused) was only raised when the accused took the stand to give his defence. Even then, the claim was rather equivocal because the accused testified (during examination-in-chief no less) that he _did_ inform the recorder that he had brought along his lighter:

> Qso what did you tell---did Inspector Ashraf ask you where you kept your lighter? Did he pose that question to you?

> AHe did not ask me where I kept my lighter. Before he recorded my statement, he asked me whether I brought along my cigarette and I told him, “Yes, I did.”[^51]

44     Counsel realised that the accused was contradicting himself so she had to ask the accused to repeat his testimony. However, the accused continued to contradict his own defence that he left his lighter at home:

> QCould you repeat what you just said?

> AWhen he asked me, before I left the house, where did I put my cigarette? So I told him that of course, I would put the cigarette on the pocket of my shirt.

> QWhat---did he pose you any questions other than your cigarette? For instance, a lighter.

> ASo he also asked me where I put my lighter, so I told him that I would put on my---my pocket, my---[^52]

45     As can be plainly seen, the accused not only contradicted his defence yet again (that he had left the lighter at home), he also contradicted his new claim that the recorder did not ask him where he had placed his lighter. In short, the accused was all over the place in his testimony as to whether he had left the lighter at home and also what he told the recorder or interpreter.

46     In any event, the prosecution recalled ASP Joyce Lau to rebut the accused’s defence and claim. I accepted ASP Joyce Lau’s confirmation that the answers were given by the accused as interpreted by PW8 INSP Muhd Asraf, who was also called as a rebuttal witness. I accepted INSP Asraf’s evidence, which was consistent with and corroborated ASP Joyce Lau’s position, that the statement was accurately recorded and interpreted and read back in Malay to the accused who then signed the statement to affirm that the statement was true and correct.[^53]

47     I accepted INSP Ashraf’s testimony that the contents of the statement, including the disputed answers, were provided by the accused himself.[^54] Compared to the accused, I found ASP Joyce Lau and INSP Asraf to be far more credible witnesses. At the end of the day, I found the accused’s claim to be nothing more than an afterthought and I roundly rejected his claim.

48     Quite apart from what the accused said in the statement and on the basis of logical reasoning, I rejected the accused’s defence that he had left the lighter at home. In this regard, I found that the accused’s claim that he had placed the lighter back into the kitchen drawer to be illogical and therefore, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that it was unbelievable. This was because by the accused’s own testimony, he was already at the front door on his way out when he lit his cigarette.[^55] Therefore, it would have been illogical and counter-intuitive to go back into the kitchen to put the lighter back into the drawer. One would have thought that if he had not intended to take the lighter out of the kitchen, he would have lit the cigarette in the kitchen. He also claimed that he did not want to light the cigarette within his house. However, that claim would be incongruous with his further testimony that he walked back into the flat with a lit cigarette just to put the lighter back in the kitchen drawer.[^56] His testimony was internally inconsistent and did not make any sense at all. Therefore, I disbelieved his evidence and I found that he took the lighter along with him when he left the flat.

49     Given that (i) there was no one else present except the accused; (ii) the cause of the fire was incendiary; (iii) he had his lighter; and (iv) that it would have taken far too long (if at all) for the accused’s discarded cigarette to ignite the mattress, the irresistible and inexorable inference was that the accused had intentionally used the naked flame from his lighter to burn the mattress thus causing the fire.

### The accused knew he was likely to cause substantial damage

50     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that since the accused had used his lighter to set fire to the mattress and given the size of the mattress and the location of the mattress amongst other discarded furniture and items, he therefore knew that fire would likely to cause extensive and substantial damage to the surrounding area. Being a resident himself at the adjacent block, he would also know that there were residential apartments upstairs, and water and utility rooms etc at the void deck. The accused did agree in cross-examination that he knew that a fire would likely cause damage to Block 14A.[^57]

### Lies as corroboration

51     As submitted by the prosecution, a lie told by an accused is corroborative of his guilt if the lie is deliberate, relates to a material issue, and is motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth.[^58] I agreed with the prosecution and found that the accused told the following such lies.

#### (i)   Accused lied about not being at Block 14A and that he did not see the fire

52     When the police first questioned the accused on the afternoon of the fire before he was arrested, the accused denied being at the void deck that morning and claimed he was at home.[^59] In other words, the accused was giving a false alibi. Of course by then, the police had already identified the accused from the CCTV footage. Even when he was questioned as to whether he was smoking at the void deck, the accused maintained his lie that he was at home and therefore nowhere near the scene.[^60] As correctly submitted by the prosecution and viewed objectively, these were deliberate lies told by the accused to the police. He only came clean when he was finally shown the CCTV footage and he conceded that he was smoking at the void deck that morning before the fire.

53     I found that the lies were deliberate and repeated and that they related to the material issues of whether he was present at the scene and who could have started the fire. I accepted the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s lies were motivated by a realisation of his guilt and a fear of the consequences of telling the truth that he was at the scene just before the fire started.

54     I also found that the accused compounded his lie by claiming that he did not walk past Block 14A when he was returning back to his block from the market and therefore did not see the fire. Looking at the photographs showing the various blocks of flats, I found that he could not have missed seeing the fire at the void deck regardless of the route he took. This was yet a further lie to mask his guilt.

55     In any case, I found that the fire was already raging quite strongly by the time the accused was walking back to his flat. LTA Sasi Kumar’s testimony was in fact that when he arrived at the scene at about 4.55am, the place was fully engulfed, the blaze was very intense and that an evacuation was being conducted even while the firefighting was in progress.[^61] Given these circumstances, it would have extremely unlikely that the accused did not notice the fire.

56     The fact that the accused must have seen the fire was also proved by the CCTV footage of him running up the stairs back to his flat at about 4:55:20. Contrary to his denial and having viewed the CCTV footage that was played in court, I found that the accused was indeed running up the stairs. The CCTV footage clearly showed that he was bounding up the stairs two steps at a time. He was clearly running back to his flat because he had started a fire that was out of control.

#### (ii)   Accused lied that he was unaware of the fire

57     The accused initially denied knowing about the fire. It was only when he was confronted that he must have seen or heard the commotion that morning that the accused then admitted that he knew about the fire.[^62] This was also a deliberate lie in relation to a material fact (i.e. _mens rea_) which lie was motivated by his guilt and fear of the consequences of the police discovering what he knew about the fire.

58     He repeated this lie in his statement:

> Q:On your way back home, did you see any police or fire?

> A:No, it was dark. It was about 5.30am. I didn’t see anything. I went back to my house to rest.[^63]

59     He lied yet again in his further statement:

> When walking through Block 14B Lorong 7, I did not even see any fire at all, and everything was normal at the void deck.[^64]

60     This was patently a lie given that the fire had already started from 4:47:00 and the fire was reported to the police at 4:51:32. By the time the accused was running back to his flat at 4:55:20, the fire engines were already at the scene. The accused clearly lied in his statements to the police as to his state of knowledge of the fire so as to distance himself from the investigations into the cause of the fire.

#### (iii)   Accused lied about leaving the lighter at home

61     I also found that the accused lied in court that he did not bring his lighter out of the flat. He claimed that he had placed it back in the kitchen drawer. However, I found that his testimony contradicted his statement to the police as highlighted above. This was a deliberate lie on a material issue (i.e. cause of the fire) which was motivated by his guilt and fear of the consequences of the police finding out that he used the lighter to start the fire. There would have been absolutely no reason to lie about taking the lighter with him if not for his guilty knowledge that he had used the lighter to cause the fire.

62     In summary, the accused concocted the above deliberate lies which corroborated his guilt.

### Investigations not biased

63     I rejected counsel’s suggestions in her submissions that the investigations by the police and the SCDF were inadequate and biased.[^65] Counsel argued that there was too much reliance on the CCTV footages which captured the accused at the scene and which undermined their objectivity. I disagreed with counsel’s arguments. The CCTV footages provided important leads as to how the fire started and what or who had caused it. Since the accused was the only person seen loitering at the void deck at that early hour just before the fire started and he was also seen smoking, it was only natural and logical that the investigations would center on the identification, location and questioning of the accused as to why he was loitering at the scene shortly before the fire and then seen running up the stairs back to his flat. These were highly suspicious circumstances which necessitated further investigations against the accused.

64     I also rejected counsel’s argument that the SCDF officers were making assumptions without objective scientific bases in that they concluded that the accused must have used a lighter since he was captured by the CCTV to be smoking. As noted above, the SCDF officers explained that bases on their experience and also available literature, the fire was unlikely to have been caused by a smouldering cigarette. They also excluded other accidental or electrical causes. The fire would therefore have been caused by a naked flame such as from a lighter and the officers cannot be faulted for connecting the dots to surmise that the accused, who was smoking, would likely have been in possession of a lighter. In any event, I found that the accused was in possession of his lighter based on his admission in his statement and not because of any unfounded speculation on the part of the SCDF officers.

65     I further rejected counsel’s insinuation that the investigations were incomplete because, for example, the police did not conduct any forensic tests on the accused’s lighter to determine if it had been used to light up the mattress.[^66] This must surely be a fanciful argument. As explained by the SCDF officer (although I would have thought that it was a matter of common sense even without any expert explanation) that it was not scientifically possible to determine if a fire was caused by any particular lighter.[^67] In this case, no accelerant (including lighter and all types of fluids) was detected but that only meant that no external accelerant was used. It did exclude the use of a lighter to produce a naked flame to cause the fire. Such a fire would not give rise to traces of lighter fluid at the scene because the lighter fluid is contained within the lighter and used to create the naked flame and not the fire _per se_. As such, I found that counsel was barking up the wrong tree when she repeatedly questioned the prosecution witnesses on the presence or absence of lighter fluid.

## Conclusion

66     Having considered all the evidence, I found that the accused had used his lighter to burn the mattress which started and caused the blaze. I found that the fire was not caused by a smouldering cigarette. I disbelieved the accused and found him to be untruthful. I rejected his defence that at the highest, he may have unwittingly caused the fire by discarding his cigarette on the ground.

70     As pointed out by the learned DPP, in the precedents where the damage caused was substantial (i.e. precedent nos. 1, 3 and 4), the sentences imposed per charge for those cases were between 3 to 5 years’ imprisonment. I considered that the facts in precedent nos. 7 and 8 were somewhat similar to the present case in that the offenders in those cases also used a lighter to set fire to rubbish at a void deck. However, the resultant fire was confined to a much smaller area and the damage caused was therefore much lower than the present case. Furthermore, the offender in precedent no.8 had mild intellectual disability and the sentencing court would likely have taken this offender-specific factor into account in his favour. As such, the relatively low sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment imposed in those two precedents would not have been appropriate for this case.

71     Ultimately, I had to consider both the degree of culpability and the actual and potential harm when I calibrated the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the present accused. In the present case, it was not in dispute that the extent of damage and the costs of repairs were substantial. I agreed with prosecution’s point and considered that the area that was affected by the fire was extensive and the damage caused by the smoke reached as high as the 4th storey of the block.[^69] This was very evident from the photographs tendered and admitted in evidence.

72     I was also of the view that the potential for even greater harm was high given that it was a residential HDB block and that the accused had started the fire at or before 4:46:44 when most if not all the residents in the block would be home and likely still asleep. If not for the timely mass evacuation carried out by the police and SCDF, there would likely have been serious injuries suffered and possibly even fatalities. In fact, at least one resident had to be sent to the hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation. Quite apart from the issue of injuring and endangering the lives of the residents, the fire also disrupted power and water supplies to the block thus causing much inconvenience to and disrupting the daily routines of the residents. This was over and above the public resources that were expended by the police and the SCDF in conducting the mass evacuation, putting out the fire and carrying out investigations into the cause of the fire.

73     In terms of culpability, I found that the accused’s culpability was not as high and that his motivation was not as malicious as some of the precedents cited by the prosecution. For instance, there was no suggestion that the accused had acted out of revenge or that he had specifically targeted certain or multiple victims. His motivation appeared to be nothing more than acting out of mischief. Nonetheless, I considered that his culpability, whilst not the highest, was still sufficiently high in the sense that it was a conscious and intentional act of using a naked flame from his lighter to burn and set ablaze a large mattress. As the SCDF officers had testified, it would not have been easy to light up the mattress material which was not as combustible as paper products. It would have been a deliberate and calculated act. Therefore, the accused in succeeding to light up the mattress, must have tried very hard to so thus elevating the degree of his culpability. I also agreed with prosecution’s submission that the accused had lied to the police repeatedly to avoid being implicated so that he would not be arrested.[^70]

74     Therefore, having considered the factors of culpability and harm, I would not disagree with the sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment proposed by the prosecution.

### Defence’s submission on sentence and mitigation

75     In her written submission on sentence, counsel submitted for the accused to be sentenced to between 3-4 months’ imprisonment, relying on the sentences that were imposed in three sentencing precedents.[^71] I did not find these three precedents[^72]particularly instructive because no damage was caused in one precedent (_PP v Dwight Soriana_) and in the other two precedents, the area of damage caused by the fire was very much confined (i.e. bedroom in _PP v Soon Yi Xuan_ and the inside of a rubbish chute in _PP v_ _Lee Jun Xiang_). In other words, the extent of the blaze and the level of risk of danger posed to human lives in these precedents was much lower and contained.

76     Counsel also informed the court of the accused’s personal circumstances. Briefly, the accused is 61 years-old and lived with a friend[^73] in a two-room rental flat.[^74] The accused cared for this friend who suffered from kidney failure and diabetes. The accused is unemployed and relied on social assistance to get by. He is a simple man with only primary school education. It was also impressed upon the court that the accused suffered from age-related ailments including a heart condition with previous episodes of heart attacks.

77     I considered the personal circumstances of the accused as outlined above but did not find them compelling or mitigating. In short, I did not find any significant mitigating factors in favour of the accused. On the contrary, he is not a first offender because he has previous convictions (albeit dissimilar) for drugs and property-related offences and even one for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He disputed two other previous convictions[^75], one of which was for an offence in 1987 of mischief under s 427 of the Penal Code, but the prosecution did not rely on these two disputed prior convictions.[^76]

78     I also considered that the accused was unremorseful by denying his wrongdoing and claiming trial to the charge and then lodging this appeal. I did not disagree with counsel’s point that it was the accused’s prerogative to claim trial and that fact alone should not be construed as an aggravating factor.[^77] However, it is also axiomatic that an accused who has shown no remorse by claiming trial ought, if convicted, to forfeit any sentencing discount that he would have gotten had he pleaded guilty. These two corresponding principles are not inconsistent with one another.

### Sentence

79     I considered the prosecution’s sentencing submission which was valid and persuasive. On the other hand, I was neither persuaded by the sentencing precedents nor the personal circumstances of the accused which were relied on by counsel for the defence. I fully agreed with the sentence proposed by the prosecution which was appropriate, justified and commensurate with the gravity of the offence, the overall culpability of the accused and the harm caused by his action.

80     Given the facts and circumstances and the sentencing considerations as highlighted above, I sentenced the accused to three years’ imprisonment which I did not believe was excessive or crushing.
