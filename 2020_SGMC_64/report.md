\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9896/2020/1.\]

18 December 2020

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused pleaded guilty, inter alia, to the following charge for giving an oral statement which was false in a material particular to an Inspecting Officer:

> You… are charged that you, on 27 September 2019, at the Ministry of Manpower Servics Centre located at 1500, Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946, did make an oral statement to an Inspecting Officer, Rachel Tay, which was false in a material particular; to wit, you stated that the company which you were a director of, Pacific Tec International Pte. Ltd. (UEN No.: 201436749C), had paid salaries to six of its employees, as listed under (a) to (f) below, for the period of 1 February 2019 to 30 June 2019, when you knew this was false, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 107(b) read with Section 103(1)(b) of the Employment Act (Chapter 91), punishable under Section 107 of the same Act.

>> (a)    Moshiuz-Zaman Md (FIN: XXX)

>> (b)    Fayaj (FIN: XXX)

>> (c)    Shariful (FIN: XXX)

>> (d)    Sumon Mozammel Huq (FIN: XXX)

>> (e)    Sarker Mohammad Kamrul (FIN: XXX)

>> (f)    Iqbal (FIN: XXX)

2       The Accused also pleaded guilty to two other charges under s 34(1) read with s 22 and s 113A(1)(a) of the Employment Act (Cap 91) (“the EA”), for failure to pay salaries due to the employees of Pacific Tec International Pte Ltd (“the Company”), of which he was a Director. Another two similar charges under s 34(1) of the EA were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing parties on mitigation and sentencing, I imposed the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.7059411882377%"> <col width="37.9275855171034%"> <col width="32.3664732946589%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 906599-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 34(1) read with s 22 and s 113A(1) of the EA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $3,500 in default one week’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 906600-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 34(1) read with s 22 and s 113A(1) of the EA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $3,500 in default one week’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 906604-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 107(b) read with s 103(1)(b) of the EA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $5,000 in default 10 days’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

4       The total sentence was a fine of $12,000 in default two weeks’ and 10 days imprisonment. The Accused has since paid up the fine amount.

5       The Prosecution is now appealing against the sentence for the charge under s 107(b) of the EA (MAC 906604-2020).

## Statement of Facts

6       The salient points in the Statement of Facts, to which the Accused admitted without qualification, are set out below.

7       At the material time, the Accused was the sole director of the Company and in charge of running the company operations and managing the finances of the company. He was also responsible for the payment of salaries to employees of the company.

8       On 6 August 2019, Rachel Tay, an Inspecting Officer (“the Inspecting Officer”) of the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) carried out investigations upon receiving complaints that the company had contravened employment laws with regards to non-payment of salaries to its employees in accordance to the provisions of Part III of the EA.

9       Investigations revealed that on or about the dates stated in column (e) below, the Company had failed to pay the salary of the following employees of the Company in accordance to the provisions of Part III of the Employment Act, and the offences were committed with the consent of the Accused.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.246449289858%"> <col width="22.5845169033807%"> <col width="22.5845169033807%"> <col width="22.5845169033807%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Name of employee</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Occupation</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Date of dismissal</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Salary amount due</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moshiuz-Zaman Md</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Construction Worker</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 July 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$12,066.54</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fayaj</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Construction Worker</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 July 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$10.091.12</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

10     The salary arrears for the above two employees have been settled by the company’s insurers.

11     On 8 August 2019, at the MOM Services Centre, the Accused made an oral statement which was false to the Inspecting Officer, which was later reduced into writing by the Inspecting Officer. The Accused made a statement that the Company had paid the salaries of six employees, as stated in the table below, for the period of 1 February 2019 to 30 June 2019, when the Accused knew that he had not done and that this was false.

12     On 27 September 2019, at the MOM Services Centre, the Accused provided a further statement to the Inspecting Officer. During the statement recording, the Accused stated that the above employees had already been paid their salaries from 1 February 2019 to 30 June 2019. In order to support this, the Accused furnished forged pay-slips of five of the employees. However, when the Accused was requested to submit the bank statements for the purposes of investigations, it was revealed that the amounts reflected in the bank statements did not match the salaries which the employees were supposed to receive from 1 February 2019 to June 2019.

13     Subsequently, the Accused admitted in his statement dated 27 September 2019 that he had failed to pay the salaries of the six employees. The Accused had also asked the employees to sign on blank cheques to assist him to deceive MOM. The Accused also stated that the six employees had lied in their statements that they were being owed salaries from 1 Februry 2019 to 30 June 2019 so that they could be issued special passes in order to stay in Singapore, when he knew for a fact that this was not the case, and that his Company had met with financial difficulties.

14     In consequence of the false statement made by the Accused on 8 August 2019, the course of investigations deviated and this resulted in the MOM having to spend unnecessary time and resources to conduct further investigations into the matter.

## Antecedents

15     The Accused was untraced.

## Mitigation

16     In mitigation, the Accused explained that he had failed to pay the salaries of the affected employees as a result of business difficulties and cash flow issues.

17     On 1 August 2019, as a result of requests to mediate salary related claims, he was notified by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (“TADM”) to attend a meeting at the MOM at Bendeemer.

18     On 8 August 2019, at the first interview with the Inspecting Officer, the Accused made the false oral statement that the Company had paid the salaries of the six employees.

19     On 3 September 2019, the Accused attended a meeting at MOM with regard to the outstanding salaries owed to the employees. During this meeting, he admitted to the TADM officer that the Company owed outstanding salaries to the employees. The TADM officer gave the Acused time to settle the outstanding salaries. The Accused later agreed to settle the outstanding salary payments using the employees’ security bond insurance, and the employees accepted the settlement sums unconditionally.

20     In the second interview on 27 September 2019 with the Inspecting Officer, the Accused then admitted that he was working with the TADM officer to settle the outstanding salaries and that he had given a false statement on 8 August 2019.

21     The Accused admitted giving a false statement when he was first interviewed on 8 August 2019, but stated that he was trying to resolve the issue of the unpaid salaries, and believed that he would do so. As such, he informed the Inspecting Officer that the Company had paid the salaries. Counsel for the Accused pointed out that this was consistent with his later actions taken in resolving the issue. The outstanding salary arrears were settled on 25 October 2019.

22     The Company’s work pass privileges have since been suspended by MOM.

23     For the charge under s 107(b) of the EA, Counsel relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Sam Oh Tiong Li_ (unreported, 2013) (“_Sam Oh Tiong Li_”), where the offender had submitted falsified salary vouchers to an MOM investigating officer, and later gave a statement to the Inspecting Officer confirming that the salary vouchers submitted earlier were true documents. The offender was sentenced to a fine of $5,000 in default 20 days imprisonment. Counsel submitted that the facts in the present case were similar, and asked for a fine to be imposed.

24     Counsel also highlighted that while MOM would have spent unnecessary time and resources to conduct further investigations, the Accused’s false statement did not have the potential to cause ‘appreciable’ harm given that he had been working with TADM to settle the outstanding salaries.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

25     With regard to the charge under s 107(b) of the EA, the Prosecution referred to a table of sentencing precedents under s 22(1)(d) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap. 91A) (“EFMA”) and asked for parity in sentencing as they involved offences of giving false statements as well. The Prosecution highlighted that forged pay slips had been submitted and it was only upon a request for bank statements that these pay slips were found to be incorrect. As this was a “fairly egregious” case, the Prosecution asked for a term of two weeks’ imprisonment.

26     The Prosecution also submitted a table setting out two cases under s 107(b) of the EA – _Sam Oh Tiong Li_, and _Public Prosecutor v Lew Yen Choo_ (unreported, MSC-901467-2015) (“_Lew Yen Choo_”). In particular, they highlighted the case of _Lew Yen Choo_, in which a term of 10 days’ imprisonment was imposed.

## Court’s decision

### No direct parity between s 22(1)(d) EFMA and s 107(b) offences

27     I was not entirely convinced that the precedents under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA could or should be relied upon directly in the present case involving an offence under s 107(b) of the EA.

28     In the first place, the prescribed punishments are significantly different.

> (a)     An offence under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA is punishable with a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.

> (b)     An offence under s 107(b) of the EA is punishable with a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.

29     Secondly, the offence under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA usually involves the making of a false statement in connection with an application for or to renew a work pass. This is significantly different from, and in my view, more aggravated than the facts of the present case.

30     The reasons often given for affirming custodial sentences in cases under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA, usually relate to the regulation of our foreign manpower population and the need to deter any attempts to circumvent this framework, to the disadvantage of our own local workers. Fines are also thought not to be sufficient in such cases where there is a significant wider interest to be protected, and where economic benefits may give rise to incentives to breach the law. See _Chiew Kok Chai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 713</span> at \[51-52\] and Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition) at pages 1583 – 1585.

31     These reasons are not applicable to the present case. While the interests of workers in obtaining salary rightfully due to them is important, it is not on the same scale or depth as protecting the wider societal interest of regulating the foreign manpower population in Singapore. I further note that there are usually immigration considerations involved in offences under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA as well. The degree of harm caused or likely to be caused in cases under s 107(b) of the EA is therefore different from that under s 22(1)(d) of the EFMA.

32     I accept, of course, that providing false information to a public officer in the course of an inquiry or investigation is not conduct which should be condoned. However, I do not think that every such offence necessarily calls for a custodial term. A similar offence involving the provision of false information to a public servant is that under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“Penal Code”). Some guidance on when the custodial threshold is crossed in such cases can be found in _Koh Yong Chiah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span> (“_Koh Yong Chiah_”), where the High Court indicated that for offences under s 182 of the Penal Code, whether the custodial threshold is crossed should essentially be based on the degree of harm caused or likely to be caused by the offence. If “appreciable harm” may be caused by the offence, then the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term. (See _Koh Yong Chiah_ at \[50\])

33     I did not think that “appreciable harm” was caused, or as likely to be caused, by the offence under s 107(b) of the EA in the present case.

### No appreciable harm in the present case

34     The Accused had made a false statement on two occasions – 8 August 2019 and 27 September 2019 when he provided forged pay-slips to support his earlier false statement. I note, however, that in between these two dates, he had already come clean with the TADM officer (on 3 September 2020) that the company owed outstanding salaries to the employees, and was working with the TADM to settle the salary arrears. The arrears were eventually settled by the Company’s insurers on 25 October 2019.

35     Based on this chronology of events, I accepted that the Accused did not seriously mean to evade his responsibility as an employer, and his action in committing the false statement offence can be said to be more foolish than deceptive.

36     There was also no appreciable harm caused to the employees by the false statement, given that their salary arrears were eventually settled. While there would have been unnecessary resources wasted by MOM in further investigations, these costs appeared to be minimal, or in any case was not elaborated further on by the Prosecution beyond stating the same in the Statement of Facts.

37     I note that the submitting of the forged pay slips was an aggravating factor. However, this particular falsehood was discovered on the same day (27 September 2019), when the Accused also came clean and admitted that he had given a false statement. Therefore, this submission of forged payslips, while certainly not to be condoned, did not result in any appreciable harm as well.

### Similar precedents

38     There appeared to be a dearth of sentencing precedents for an offence under s 107(b) of the EA. Parties were only able to furnish two unreported precedents – _Sam Oh Tiong Li_ and _Lew Yen Choo_.

39     I agreed with counsel that the facts in _Sam Oh Tiong Li_ appear similar to the present case, in that falsified salary vouchers were provided to MOM and later affirmed in a false statement to be true documents. For the charge of providing the falsified salary vouchers, the offender was convicted under s 101(b) read with s 99 and s 113A of the EA, and for the charge of providing a false statement, he was convicted under s 107(b) read with s 103(1)(b) of the EA. He was sentenced for each charge to a fine of $5,000 (in default 20 days imprisonment).

40     The case of _Lew Yen Choo_ was quite different, involving an offender who had crafted a story to mislead the investigation officer in the investigations, and specifically to protect one Tan Taiming, the person actually managing the company in question. In fact, she had been paid to be registered as a director of the company, to shield Tan from investigations and any trouble with the law. For the charge under s 107(b) of the EA, she was sentenced to a term of 10 days’ imprisonment. Another charge under s 22(1)(b) of the EFMA was taken into consideration.

41     In my view, the present case was not as aggravated as in _Lew Yen Choo_, which involved a higher level of deception specifically for a pecuniary purpose. The degree of harm caused in _Lew Yen Choo_ would also have been higher, given the elaborate lie to throw off investigations in order to allow the real culprit to get away.

42     On the other hand, the facts of the present case are quite similar to that in _Sam Oh Tiong Li_, where a fine was meted out.

### Other mitigating circumstances

43     The Accused was untraced and had pleaded guilty early. He had also settled the salary arrears on 25 October 2019, long before he was charged in August 2020.

## Conclusion

44     In the circumstances, I was of the view that the custodial threshold was not crossed for the offence under s 107(b) of the EA (MAC 906604/2020), and imposed the maximum fine of $5,000 (in default 10 days imprisonment).
