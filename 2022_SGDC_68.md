> **DAC 916000-2021**

Charge

> are charged that you on the 24th February 2021, at about 12.22 pm, along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim at the junction of Benoi Road, Singapore, did drive motor taxi SHC3328A, without due care and attention, to wit, by failing to conform to the traffic light signal which showed green for proceeding straight and a red right arrow, thus resulting in collision with the lorry YN8129R, which was proceeding straight along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards AYE(MCE), from your left to the right, which resulted in your motor taxi to lose control, and veered to the left and collided onto a stationary motorcar SJQ667G, resulting in the passenger of your taxi, namely Lim Ah Chong, Female Chinese 72 years old, who was seated at the rear passenger seat of your taxi to sustain serious injuries, thus causing death, and you have therefore committed an offence under Section 65(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed), punishable under Section 65(2)(a) read with Section 65(6)(a) of the same Act.

2       Two remaining charges, namely:

> (a)      **DAC 916001-2021** - a charge under s 65(1)(_a_) punishable under s 65(3)(_a_) read with s 65(6)(_d_) of the of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)(“RTA”) and

> (b)      **DAC 916002-2021** - a charge under s 65(1)(_a_) punishable under s 65(4)(_a_) of the RTA

> were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After carefully considering the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Defence’s plea in mitigation, I sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of eight years with effect from the date of his release.

4       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence and order of disqualification on 20 March 2022. He is presently serving his sentence.

When the traffic light signal changed to green to go straight ahead, with a red right turning arrow, the accused failed to conform the traffic signals and proceeded to make a right turn into the Benoi Road towards the direction of Upper Jurong Road.

17     As the accused was approaching the junction of Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards AYE (MCE), the 1st involved party’s lorry proceeded straight, from the accused’s left to right and collided onto the left portion of the accused’s taxi.

### Forensic Reports

33     Senior Technical Investigator, Muhd Nazril of LKK Auto Consultants Pte Ltd, conducted the mechanical inspection of the taxi on 21 May 2021. In his report, he stated that he was unable to determine whether there was any possible mechanical failure to the taxi that may have contributed to the accident. The extent of damage that it had sustained had prevented him from carrying out any operational test(s) and/or static test(s) to its engine system, transmission system, steering and braking system. However, the four tyres fitted on the taxi were found to be in serviceable condition with remaining tread depth of approximately 6mm each. This had included the deflated rear right tyre.

34     Forensic Pathologist, Dr Tan Shi Rui, from the Health Sciences Authority, performed the autopsy on the deceased and certified the cause of death as multiple injuries. She also stated in the clarification report obtained that the injuries present were consistent with being due to a road traffic accident.

35     The traffic light report prepared by Project Manager Jeffrey Lim of Eng Hup Engineering, stated that there was no report of traffic light malfunction received on the accident located, at the time of the accident. Based on the traffic light report, the traffic light system was in Phase C of operation at the time of the accident. In this phase, the set of traffic lights facing the slip roads of both direction of AYE would be showing the green signal for at least 10 seconds. After which, it would be showing the amber signal for at least 3 seconds, followed by 3 seconds of all red signal before changing to the next phase.

36     The Forensic Report prepared by Leong Wai Ying, Senior Forensic Scientist from the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory of Health Science Authority (“HSA”) dated 12 July 2021 stated that the 1st involved party’s Lorry was found to be travelling between the average speed of 51 km/h to 56 km/h prior to the collision. The prescribed road speed limit for the stretch of Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim is 50 km/h. The report also stated that the 1st involved party’s Lorry had crossed the stone line for his direction, Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards AYE(CTE) when the traffic light signal was showing “Amber” for his direction.

### Footages

#### From the 1st witness

37     The footage revealed that the 1st witness had come to a stop on lane 1 of the 6-lane road just before the junction of Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. He was the first vehicle in line on the lane before an unknown motorcycle had stopped ahead of him, in between lanes. Shortly after coming to a stop, vehicles from his right were seen moving off and the accused’s taxi could be seen making a right turn ahead from the left side of the junction. The accused’s taxi was later seen stationary in the middle of the junction.

38     The accused’s taxi was seen driving off when an unknown lorry was seen passing the junction, from the right to left side of the 1st witness. At the same time, an unknown grey van was seen making the right turn behind the accused’s taxi as well. As the accused’s taxi was about to drive across the road from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, the 1st involved party’s lorry was seen approaching the junction from the right side of the 1st witness and subsequently collided onto the left side of the accused’s taxi.

39     Due to the collision, the accused’s taxi was seen veering to the left side of the 1st witness. The accused’s taxi narrowly missed colliding onto the 1st witness’s vehicle as well as the motorcycle ahead. The unknown grey van, travelling behind the accused’s taxi, narrowly missed a collision with the first involved party’s lorry. The unknown grey van completed the right turn after the collision and continued with its journey.

#### From the 2nd witness

40     The footage from the 2nd witness’s vehicle revealed that the 2nd witness was travelling on lane 1 of the 6-lane road and had come to a stop at the traffic light junction. The 2nd witness was the 2nd vehicle in line on the lane 1. A motorcycle was seen stationary on lane 2 with the 2nd involved party’s motorcar stationary behind the motorcycle. The traffic light was observed to be showing the red arrow signal for his direction of travel. Vehicles from the right side of the road were seen moving off and the accused’s taxi could be seen making the right turn from the junction straight ahead, from the left to right. The accused’s taxi was seen shortly after appearing on the right side of the junction.

41     An unknown grey van was seen travelling behind the accused’s taxi, making the right turn as well. At the same time, the 1st involved party was seen approaching the junction from the right and collided onto the left side of the accused’s taxi. The 1st involved party’s lorry narrowly missed a collision with the unknown grey van. After the collision, the accused’s taxi veered to the left (rear first) and collided onto the 2nd involved party’s stationary motorcar, before coming to a stop. The 1st involved party’s lorry continued travelling across the junction and came to a stop on the left side of the road, after the junction while the unknown grey van completed the right turn and drove off from the junction. The rider of the motorcycle on lane 2 managed to shift his motorcycle to avoid the path of the accused’s taxi. The traffic light signal for the 1st involved party’s direction of travel could not be seen from the footage at the time of the collision.

#### From the accused

42     The footage from the accused’s taxi revealed that the accused’s taxi had come to a stop on lane 1 of the 2-lane road, meant for going straight only. The traffic light signal was observed to be red at the time. When the traffic light signal changed to green, the accused was seen making a right turn instead of travelling straight. As he made the right turn, he was seen coming to a stop in the middle of the junction. Vehicles were seen travelling from his left to right ahead. Shortly after, the accused continued driving across the junction. The footage came to a stop as he was about to complete driving across the junction. The collisions were not captured in the footage.

#### From LTA’s Camera

43     Footage from the LTA camera revealed that the traffic light signal was red for vehicles travelling from Benoi Road when the accused’s taxi was seen making the right turn and entering the junction. Vehicles were seen moving off from the top left to right view of the footage. The accused’s taxi was then seen coming to a stop in the middle of the junction when an unknown grey van was seen making the right turn into the junction as well. The accused’s taxi began moving off shortly after and at the same time, the 1st involved party was seen travelling from top left to right view of the footage. The 1st involved party’s lorry was then seen colliding onto the left side of the accused’s taxi. After the collision, the accused’s taxi veered to the right and collided onto the 2nd involved party’s stationary motorcar. The unknown grey van narrowly missed the collision with the 1st involved party’s lorry and was seen driving off after the collision occurred.

44     At the time of the accident, traffic flow was moderate, road surface was dry and visibility was good.

45     On 24 February 2021 sometime about 12.22 pm, along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards AYE(Tuas), the accused did drive motor taxi SHC3328A, without due care and attention by failing to conform to the traffic light signal which showed green for proceeding straight and a red right arrow, resulting in a collision with the lorry YN8129R, which was proceeding straight along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards AYE(MCE), which resulted in the accused losing control of his taxi and colliding onto motor vehicle SJQ667G, resulting in the death of Lim Ah Chong.

52     It was submitted that the present case warrants classification of the accused’s conduct as Medium-Culpability based on the following two factors:

> (a)     the accused had executed an illegal right turn from a non-turning lane on a red right-turning arrow. This subsequently resulted in the lorry colliding into the accused’s vehicle; and

> (b)     the two charges taken into consideration for similar offences involving two other victims – one who suffered hurt and another who suffered grievous hurt.

53     It was further submitted that in the level of culpability classification categories outlined by the court in _Selvakumar_, Medium-Culpability includes some manner of dangerous driving including driving against the flow of traffic and swerving across lanes suddenly. The accused’s illegal right turn from a non-turning lane can be analogised to these examples of moderate culpability. This, along with the charges taken into consideration, places accused’s conduct in the Medium-Culpability classification, thus warranting an indicative starting sentence of 12 to 24 months’ imprisonment.

54     It was highlighted that while the court in _Selvakumar_ did not articulate the relationship between the “harm” caused, the court had drawn the principles from the 5-step framework in _Public Prosecutor v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen_”), where “harm” was considered at \[110\] to arrive at a starting point. It was submitted that a similar application would therefore be appropriate.

#### Contributory negligence does not apply

55     It was submitted that the key point on contributory negligence was enunciated by the High Court in _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span> (“Nickson Guay”) as follows: does the conduct of the victim or a third party have a direct bearing on the culpability of the offender in order to affect the sentence to be imposed (at \[70\]).

56     In interpreting this principle, the court in _Selvakumar_ noted the following at \[166\]: An example will be an accused intending to make a right turn out into the main road. He saw the victim’s vehicle a distance away. Ordinarily, he would have cleared the turn safely with that distance. However, the victim was speeding. Despite that, the accused decided to proceed ahead and could not make the turn safely resulting in a collision occurred. Unfortunately, the accused would still be responsible for his misjudgement since he did not have the right of way to execute the turn.

57     It was further submitted that applying this to the present case, the 1st involved party’s lorry (YN8129R) which collided into the accused’s vehicle was travelling at 51 km/h to 56 km/h on a 50 km/h road. This difference between the lorry’s speed and the permitted speed limit is minute and negligible. In any event, it also does not affect the accused’s responsibility as he did not have the right of way to execute the illegal right turn. There is thus no third-party contributory negligence in the present case.

58     It was the Prosecution’s case that Menon CJ’s comments in _Nickson Guay_ were pertinent:

> \[Defence Counsel’s submissions\] rests on erroneous assumption that the law needs to “apportion” responsibility between all persons whose actions might have contributed to the result which forms the subject matter of the offence… that is not the position taken in criminal law.

> Where the conduct of the victim or third parties, whether negligent or otherwise, has materially contributed to the outcome for which the offender is being charged, but has no bearing on the culpability of the offender, it should not affect the sentence to be imposed.

#### Offender-specific factors – the accused’s chequered driving record

59     It was submitted that having determined the accused’s culpability and the appropriate starting point, it was necessary to consider offender-specific factors. In this respect, the accused’s prior driving records was relevant.

60     In _Teo Seng Tiong v Public Prosecutor_ \[2021\] 2 SLR 652 at \[99\] (“_Teo Seng Tiong_”), the Court of Appeal noted that the Prosecution may raise the accused’s prior driving record, including any compositions under the Road Traffic Act, as a factor relevant to sentencing:

> On any reasonable view, an offender’s bad driving record or his impeccable driving record must be a relevant factor when the court considers the appropriate sentence after convicting him on a RTA offence. A bad driving record reflects the offender’s attitude towards road traffic rules and safety and the particular circumstances may call for both specific and general deterrence in sentencing.

61     It was highlighted that the accused in the present case has a chequered driving history dating back to 1994 and as recent as November 2020. This history includes composition for offences of inconsiderate driving under s 65 of the RTA, failing to give a warning signal under r 2(2) Road Traffic Rules, driving in a bus lane under r 8(1) of the Road Traffic (Traffic Sign Rules), speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA, failing to conform to a red light signal under s 120(1)(b) of the RTA, making an unauthorised U-Turn under r 13(1) of the RTR Rules, failing to form up correctly when turning right under r 8 of the RTR.

62     It was submitted that this blatant disregard for traffic rules must be factored as part of the accused’s sentence. Taking this into consideration and noting that the accused has pleaded guilty, it was further submitted a term of 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment within the 12 to 24 months’ range in the Medium-Culpability category and the mandatory 8 years’ disqualification from all classes should be imposed.

## Mitigation

63     In his written plea in mitigation, Defence Counsel Mr. Tan Yanghao, Marcus had set out his client’s personal background as well as the circumstances that led to the commission of the offences.

#### Events on 24 February 2021

64     It was the Defence’s position that prior to the accident on 24 February 2021, the accused had been in full compliance with the relevant traffic regulations.

65     It was submitted that the accused had come to a complete stop at lane 1 of Benoi Road due to the red light, in full compliance with the relevant traffic indicators. It was not denied that he was on a lane meant solely for vehicles going straight. Upon the light turning green, he made a right turn instead and had failed to conform to the direction indicator on the road.

66     In addition, an unknown grey van had likewise made a right turn behind his taxi. It was the Defence’s position that there was a real possibility that the accused and the driver in the grey van had mistakenly believed that they were on a turning lane rather than a straight only lane.

67     According to the Defence, it was evident from the footage that the accused had realised his error after entering the junction. He had stopped in the middle of the junction, showing that he had been paying due care and attention to the road as there were other vehicles passing in front of him. He had only started to move off when it appeared that the road was clear. It was submitted that it was then that the 1st involved party’s lorry collided with his taxi at high speed.

68     It was further submitted that from the Speed Analysis Report, it appeared that the 1st involved party’s lorry was travelling above the average speed limit (50km/h) of Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. He had also crossed the line when the traffic signal was indicating amber. According to the Defence, from the footage, it does not appear that the 1st involved party’s lorry was visible to the accused prior to the accident. There would have been little to no time for the accused to react to the 1st involved party’s lorry.

69     It was reiterated that it was the 1st involved party’s lorry which then collided with the accused’s taxi, and as evidenced from the footages, the impact was quite significant.

#### Submissions on sentence

70     It was highlighted that a term of incarceration is not mandatory for any offences under s 65 of the RTA. However, the fact that a death has arisen as a result of the accused’s momentary lapse cannot be downplayed.

71     It was submitted that _Selvakumar_ was instructional in providing guidelines for sentence determination. In that case, the accused had made a right turn out of a carpark at Changi Beach Carpark 4. The victim had collided with the right side of the accused’s lorry resulting in his death.

72     It was submitted having regard to the facts and applying the guidance from the case of _Selvakumar_, a sentence of no longer than three months’ imprisonment and a disqualification of no less than eight years was sufficient to meet the ends of justice in the circumstance. According to the Defence, as the accused’s culpability was low in the circumstance, the starting point the starting point of his sentence was six months’ imprisonment. The Defence had been instructed that the accused had not been in any significant accidents to date.

73     It was submitted that the accident was caused by the accused’s momentary lapse in attention, as well as possibly his error of judgment. According to the Defence, there was no dangerous or reckless driving prior to entering the junction, nor was there any indication that he had not complied with traffic regulations at any time prior to the accident.

74     In the present case, the degree of culpability should be low as none of the culpability-enhancing factors set out in _Selvankumar_ at \[32\] were present. It was submitted that the accused had followed the traffic signal (albeit an erroneous one), this was not a case where he was in reckless disregard of the relevant road rules. It was highlighted that the accused was not the only driver making this error. The driver of the grey van behind him likewise made the same error. While this does not excuse the accused’s actions, this was an entirely reasonable mistake to make.

75     This was not a case where the accused had entirely abrogated his responsibility to pay attention to road conditions. He had stopped his vehicle in the junction when he saw other cars travelling in front of him. He had clearly only driven after it appeared that the road in front of him was clear. He was already caught in an unenviable situation. He was in the middle of a junction and it was unclear if there was additional danger to his passengers and other road users should he have remained in the junction. Further, it did not seem that he would have been able to see the lorry coming as his line of sight was obstructed by the pillars and greenery of the overhead expressway. According to the Defence, the accused had to make the best judgment call he could in the situation. While the end-results were tragic, it cannot be said that he had not done his best at the instant moment.

#### Contributory negligence

76     According to the Defence, it was evident that the lorry driver had been travelling above the speed limit of 50km/h. It is also trite that any vehicle approaching a junction ought to keep a careful lookout prior to crossing the junction. As a heavy vehicle carrying loads, the lorry driver has the additional duty to ensure that he is driving in a safe manner. His culpability was compounded by his crossing the junction at the amber signal. It was submitted that there was no time for the accused to react or take any evasive action prior to the collision.

77     It was further submitted that was undisputed that the lorry had collided with the accused’s taxi and it was his own negligence or rashness that had materially, if not entirely, contributed to the accident. It was the Defence’s position that the lorry driver’s exceptional act of negligence (_ie_ speeding and attempting to beat the red light, amongst others), coupled with the accused’s effort at mitigating his failure to drive with due care and attention should merit a reduction of sentence below the normal sentencing band.

#### Mitigating factors

78     The accused was truly remorseful for the accident and had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity. This has the effect of saving both public and judicial resources. He is currently sixty-one years of age and not a man in prime health. It was submitted that a significant term of incarceration would have an addition burden on his condition. He is required to go for half-yearly medical examinations to ensure that his medical condition does not deteriorate. He would not be attempting to reacquire his driving licence upon the lifting of his disqualification as he would be close to seventy years of age at that time.

## Prosecution’s Reply

79     In response to the Defence’s submissions that the accused had made a mistake and it was not deliberate, the Prosecution’s position was that it was not mitigatory because the offence in question was driving without due care and attention.

80     In respect of whether or not the third party or the victim’s actions affected the culpability, the factor to be determined is whether or not the third party’s action had an impact on the accused’s culpability in failing to conform with the traffic red light signal. It was submitted that the collision in this case pertains to outcome but not the culpability because the culpability here was whether or not he had beat a red light.

### S 65(1) of the RTA

81     S 65(1) of the RTA encapsulates the primary offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. The subsequent subsections from ss 65(2) to 65(4) are the penalty prescribing provisions, each tiered according to the degree of hurt caused and for s 65(5), for any other case of non-personal injury or potential harm. The present offence under s 65(1) of the RTA was enacted on 1 November 2019, following the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 19 of 2019).

82     Prior to the 2019 amendment, the offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration under s 65 of the RTA was a singular provision without any differentiation as to degree of hurt caused and punishable with a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding six months or imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both. A second or subsequent offender was liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or to both. In addition, pursuant to s 42(1) of the RTA, the court has a discretion to impose a period of disqualification for life or for such a period as the court may think fit.

83     Presently under s 65(1) of the RTA, a first offender under s 65(1) falls within the lowest end of the spectrum of no personal injury or potential harm is occasioned is liable to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or to imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both. At the highest end of the spectrum where the most serious harm _ie_ death is caused, the first offender is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding three years or to both. In addition, enhanced penalties as well as minimum disqualification periods were introduced for offences where death or grievous hurt is caused as well as for a repeat offender, a serious offender as well as a serious repeat offender.

84     The present case falls under the most serious category of the primary offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. Presently, as at the date of my decision there is no existing sentencing framework enunciated by the High Court for offences under s 65(1), particularly one punishable under s 65(2)(_a_) of the RTA. In _Wu Zhi Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 261</span>(“_Wu Zhi Yong_”), Menon CJ had dealt with the first category and the more serious form of irresponsible driving and prescribed a sentencing band framework for an offence reckless driving under s 64(1) punishable under s 64(2C)(_a_) read with ss 64(2C)(_c_) of the RTA. After a careful consideration of different sentencing approaches at \[22\] to \[29\] Menon CJ had prescribed the sentencing band approach when dealing with offences punishable under s 64(2C)(_a_) read with ss 64(2C)(_c_) of the RTA. At \[30\] and \[48\] of the judgment, the High Court had set out the following sentencing approach:

> The sentencing approach

> 30 At the first step, as set out in _Terence Ng_ at \[39\], the court should identify the band applicable to the offence and the indicative starting point with reference to that band, having regard to the _offence_\-specific factors present. These would encompass factors relating to the manner and mode by which the offence was committed, as well as the harm caused by the offender. At the second step, the court would have regard to the _offender_\-specific factors, being the aggravating and mitigating factors that are personal to the offender.

> 48 At the second step of the analysis, the court will have regard to the offender-specific factors. Examples of these factors have been set out at \[62\] – \[71\] of _Terence Ng_ and apply equally in the present framework. Offender-specific aggravating factors include offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the presence of relevant antecedents (apart from where the offender’s antecedents have been taken into account under the “repeat offender” or “serious repeat offender” provisions), and evidence showing a lack of remorse. Offender-specific mitigating factors include evidence of genuine remorse and an offender’s youth.

85     Although the present case concerns the second category of irresponsible driving, due to the similarity in the structure of the statutory provisions for both forms of irresponsible driving under s 64(1) and s 65(1), I was of the view the observations as well as the sentencing approach set out by Menon CJ are instructive and provides some useful guidance on how an offence under s 65(1) should be dealt with the necessary downward calibration.

86     Both the Prosecution and the Defence have relied on _Selvakumar_ where the district judge had proposed a sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 65(2)(_a_) of the RTA for offenders who claim trial. I am mindful that as there was no appeal against this decision, there is no appellate determination on the appropriateness of the suggested sentencing framework.

87     Nevertheless, I am in agreement with the range of custodial sentences within each of the sentencing bands in _Selvakumar_ as it utilises the full sentencing range available for such an offence where the most serious harm _ie_ death was caused. For such offences, as a form of deterrence, the imposition of custodial sentences should be the norm unless there are exceptional circumstances to warrant the imposition of a fine.

#### Sentencing approach

## My decision on sentence

88     In the present case both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that a custodial sentence as well as a disqualification order for a period of prescribed minimum period of eight years for all classes of vehicles should be imposed. Nevertheless, the disagreement is in respect of the appropriate length of the imprisonment term.

89     To determine the appropriate sentence, the court should first consider the offence-specific factors to determine the appropriate sentencing band where the present offence should be situated. Such factors would include the following:

> (a)     The manner, the mode and the location by which the offence was committed _eg_ driving against the flow of traffic, high degree of carelessness;

> (b)     the level of potential harm _eg_ serious risk posed to other road users;

> (c)     the nature of the harm caused to the victim _eg_ the degree of hurt caused and whether there was any property damage;

> (d)     the number of victims involved;

> (e)     the accused’s motivation for driving _eg_ he had been driving a passenger for hire or reward;

> (f)     the accused had failed to stop after the accident to evade arrest or to avoid apprehension.

## Offence-specific factors

#### Manner, mode and location of offence

90     In the present case, the offence was committed at a signalised traffic light-controlled junction. It was clear that at the material time the accused had flouted the road traffic rules when he made a right turn from a lane which was meant for vehicles going straight. In addition, when the traffic light signal had changed to green to go straight ahead with a red right turning arrow, the accused turned right into the Benoi Road towards the direction of Upper Jurong Road. It was clear that the accused exhibited a high degree of carelessness in his manner of driving. Hence, I disagreed with the Defence’s position that prior to the accident, the accused had been in full compliance with the relevant traffic regulations.

91     By disregarding the traffic light signals and failing to form up correctly when he intended to turn right, the accused had encroached into the travel path of the 1st involved party’s lorry which was proceeding straight from the accused’s left to right. This resulted in the lorry colliding onto the left portion of the accused’s taxi. The accused’s taxi veered to the right, collided onto the front portion of the 2nd involved party’s motorcar which was stationary along Benoi Road towards Pioneer Road on lane 2 of the 6-lane road due to a red traffic light signal.

#### Serious potential harm

92     There was serious potential harm present in the present case as the accident had occurred on a weekday at 12:55pm when the traffic flow was moderate, the road surface was dry and visibility was good. From the footage, it was clear that when the accused’s taxi veered to the right, he had narrowly missed colliding into the first witness’s vehicle, the motorcycle ahead as well as other vehicles within the vicinity which were stationary along Benoi Road due to the red light signal. Given the fact that these vehicles were formed up in a stationary position, there would have been no time and it would have been difficult for them to react or take any evasive action to avoid any collision had the accused’s taxi veered even further to the right.

#### Nature of harm caused

93     In respect of the harm caused, I considered the fact that the deceased, the 1st and 2nd victims and the accused sustained multiple injuries and were conveyed to hospital. The deceased passed away on the 27 February 2021. The first victim suffered hurt as set out at \[22\] while the second victim suffered grievous hurt as set out at \[24\] and \[26\].

#### The accused’s motivation for driving

94     All in all, there were three victims who were passengers in the accused’s taxi in the present case. The accused had driven them for the purpose of reward.

95     Due to the seriousness of the offence as set out above, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s illegal right turn from a non-turning lane can be analogised to these examples of moderate culpability. Together with the two charges that were taken into consideration, the accused’s culpability was in the moderate category and fell within the indicative starting sentence of 12 to 24 months’ imprisonment. There were several offence-specific aggravating factors present in this case namely, the high degree of carelessness, the serious potential harm to other road users and serious harm caused to multiple victims.

96     I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the first involved party. He was not driving at an excessive speed and I was of the view that the difference between the lorry’s speed and the permitted speed limit was not significant. Unlike the accused who had failed to conform to the red right turning arrow, the lorry had crossed the junction when the light was amber. I further agreed with the Prosecution that it also does not affect the accused’s responsibility as he did not have the right of way to execute the illegal right turn. Hence, there was no third-party contributory negligence in the present case.

97     The next step was for me to calibrate the sentence after considering offender-specific factors.

## Offender-specific factors

98     The accused had pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge and was remorseful for his actions. Two other charges namely a charge under s 65(1)(_a_) punishable under s 65(3)(_a_) read with s 65(6)(_d_) of the of the RTA and a charge under s 65(1)(_a_) punishable under s 65(4)(_a_) of the RTA were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

99     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused has a chequered driving history dating back to 1 September 1994 and as recent as 14 November 2020 as set out at \[48\] above. The accused had compounded offences of inconsiderate driving under s 65 of the RTA, failing to give a warning signal under r 2(2) Road Traffic Rules, driving in a bus lane under r 8(1) of the Road Traffic (Traffic Sign Rules), speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA, failing to conform to a red light signal under s 120(1)(b) of the RTA, making an unauthorised U-Turn under r 13(1) of the RTR Rules, failing to form up correctly when turning right under r 8 of the RTR. What was significant was that his last four compositions were for failing to conform to a red light signal. This is clearly an aggravating factor as it shows that flagrant disregard for road traffic rules as well as his disregard for the safety of other road users.

100    The Prosecution had sought a sentence of between twelve to eighteen months’ imprisonment and disqualification for a period of eight years. The Defence had sought for a sentence for three months’ imprisonment and disqualification for a period of eight years. Due to the seriousness of the offence and the presence of several offence-specific aggravating factors, I was of the view a sentence of twelve months imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances. I also imposed the minimum disqualification period of eight five years with effect from the date of release. In my view, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately addressed the seriousness of the offence and the severity of the harm caused.
