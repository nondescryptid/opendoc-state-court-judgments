### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       Just after midnight on 9 July 2017, two BMW cars, one white and the other blue, were seen been driven at high speeds down a stretch of Lim Chu Kang road towards Jalan Bahar. The accused, a 41-year-old male Singaporean, was the driver of the white BMW car, while one Chua Dong Cheng (“Chua”), was driving the blue BMW. Both drivers were quickly arrested by the traffic police who were conducting ‘stealth operations” at the material time. The accused’s white BMW car, with registration number SKS775S (“accused’s white BMW”), was subsequently examined and certain illegal alterations were discovered.

2       In connection with his actions, the accused faced a total of four charges under the Road Traffic Act (RTA). He claimed trial to three charges, essentially for engaging in a speed trial (i.e. illegal racing), dangerous driving, and for using the car with illegal alterations made to it. The details of these three charges are set out below:

> (a)     1st Charge (“speed trial charge”)

>> You… are charged that you, on the 9 July 2017 at about 12.26 a.m., along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar, Singapore, being the driver of motor car SKS775S, did take part in trial of speed with one Chua Dong Cheng, the driver of motor car SKB203R, without permit granted by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, and you have thereby committed an offence Section 116(7) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

> (b)     2nd Charge (“dangerous driving charge”)

>> You… are charged that you, on 9 July 2017 at about 12.26 a.m., along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar, Singapore, did drive motor car SKS775S at a speed which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road, to wit,

> a)     by driving at a speed of 179 kmph which exceeded the prescribed speed limit of 70 kmph of the road,

> b)     by accelerating rapidly and travelling at a high speed in a manner of trying to gain a lead against one Chua Dong Cheng, the driver of motor car SKB203R and competing with the said Chua Dong Cheng,

> and you have thereby committed an offence Section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

> (c)      3rd Charge (“illegal alterations” charge)

>> You… are charged that you, on 9 July 2017 at about 12.26 a.m., along Lim Chu Kang Road, Singapore, did use the motor vehicle SKS775S, which had been altered in a manner that does not comply with the rules as to construction, weight and equipment applicable to the class or description of the vehicles to which the said car belongs, to wit,

>>> a)    By tampered or modified exhaust pipe: Missing cat converter

>>> b)    Front number plate insecure

>> and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(6), punishable under Section 5(7) of the Road Traffic Act Chapter 276.

3       The Prosecution called eight witnesses to give evidence, and also tendered various exhibits, including in-car camera footages from the blue BMW car. This car belonged to Chua (“Chua’s blue BMW”), the person whom the accused was alleged to have engaged in the illegal speed trial with.

4       At the end of the Prosecution’s case, I called for the accused’s defence. He elected to give evidence, and also called on the person from whom he had bought his white BMW car.

5       Thereafter, having heard the testimonies of the witnesses, and after having carefully considered the evidence produced and the detailed submissions made by the Prosecution and by the accused, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the charges had been made out, and I convicted the accused on all three charges. The accused then consented to having the remaining charge taken into consideration for sentencing (“TIC charge”). Following this, I sentenced the accused to a global imprisonment sentence of 3 weeks, a global fine of $3,000 (in default 6 days’ imprisonment), and two orders of disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months from the date of release.

6       The accused has file an appeal against his conviction, sentence and the disqualification orders. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## (2)   The Prosecution’s case

### (a)   Outline of the evidence and the witnesses called

7       In essence, the Prosecution’s case was that on the evening of 8th July 2017, the accused, Chua, and some of their friends, gathered at the side of the road along Lim Chu Kang Road. Subsequently, at about 12.26 am on 9 July 2017, the accused drove his white BMW behind Chua’s blue BMW and both of them made illegal U-turns near the lamp post after the junction of Old Lim Chu Kang Road in the direction of Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar (this is the subject matter of the TIC charge). Following this, both the accused and Chua drove their vehicles towards the junction of Old Lim Chu Kang Road. When they passed the traffic junction, which was marked by a traffic light, both cars accelerated quickly and sped off at high speeds in an illegal race with each other.

8       During this time, officers from the traffic police who had been observing them, moved in and logged the speeds of the cars driven by the accused and Chua. The accused’s white BMW, was logged as travelling at 179 km per hour (kmph), while Chua’s blue BMW was logged at 177 kmph. The prescribed speed limit of the road was 70 kmph.

9       After the speeds of their vehicle were logged, they were intercepted by the traffic police officers and placed under arrest. The in-car camera footages from Chua’s car were also seized, and the cars were towed back and inspected. Some illegal alterations were found on the accused’s white BMW.

10     For the trial, the eight Prosecution witnesses who testified consisted of four police officers, the “co-accused” Chua, and a witness who transcribed the contents of the forward facing in-car camera found in Chua’s car, as well as two witnesses who had examined the accused’s white BMW after the incident. I will set out the essence of the evidence of the critical witnesses below, in relation to the charges against the accused.

### (b)   Evidence of the speed-trial and dangerous driving: 1st and 2nd charges

#### (i)   Police officers’ evidence of the speed trial and dangerous driving

11     Four police officers testified for the Prosecution. One of them was a police photographer. The other three police officers were PW1 Senior Staff Sergeant Abdul Rhani Bin Abdul Samad (“SSS Rhani”), PW3 Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamad Burhan (“SSS Burhan”) and PW8 IO Sharifah. An outline of the evidence of the last three police witnesses is set out below.

##### (1)    Evidence of PW1 Senior Staff Sergeant Rhani (“SSS Rhani”)

12     The first police witness, SSS Rhani, is a traffic policeman who has been with the police force for 9 years. He testified that on the material date, he was one of the officers deployed at Lim Chu Kang by the junction of Ama Keng, to attend to a case of illegal speed trial at the location. There, he stationed himself with a few colleagues at Ama Keng by Lim Chu Kang Road, facing the direction of Jalan Bahar. SSS Rhani said that as the officers were deployed in covert operations, they wore black jackets and had black motorcycles (“stealth bikes”) so as to blend in with the surroundings.

13     When they arrived and positioned themselves at the location (at a positon marked as X on the google map exhibit (P1)), they heard the “revving” of engines coming from the direction of Lim Chu Kang. They then headed out from their position to a bus stop where they had a clear view and could see the stretch of Lim Chu Kang where vehicle enthusiasts would take part in speed trials. The officers then spotted two cars approaching their direction before making U-turns near the entrance of the army camp at Ama Keng facing the direction of Jalan Bahar. From there, the vehicles started to move off at fast speeds. SSS Rhani and his colleague then began to give chase on their motorcycles, logged the speed of the two cars, and then stopped them.

14     SSS Rhani said that he had a clear view of the U-turn site and of the race. The stretch of the road was well lit, with no trees blocking, and the officers could see the whole stretch clearly. They could also hear clearly as there wasn’t any loud sound at that time[^1].

15     SSS Rhani also testified that the two cars involved in the race consisted of a white BMW that travelled on the right side of the road, and a dark blue BMW that travelled on the left. He said that he trailed the white BMW (subsequently found to have been driven by the accused). He logged the vehicle’s speed after trailing it for 500 metres to obtain its constant speed and turned on his motorcycle’s blinkers.

16     The speed that SSS Rhani logged for the accused’s white BMW was 179 kmph, while the speed limit of the road was 70 kmph. SSS Rhani said that the logging of speed was very accurate with an error of plus-minus 5 kmph. SSS Rhani also testified that the accused’s white BMW was travelling at a speed that was dangerous as it was in excess of 100 kmph of the road speed limit, and the driver would not be able to react in time to something, even a stone, in front of him. The driver thus posed a danger to others as well as to himself.[^2] SSS Rihana subsequently put up an arrest report (P2) in respect of the accused’s arrest.

17     The Prosecution also produced footage from a front facing in-car camera (P3) that had been installed in Chua’s blue BMW at the material time. The footage was shown in court of events which had taken place on 9 July 2017 from 12.25:29 am to 12.29:11 am. Amongst other things, this footage showed the accused’s white BMW at various times when it was driven in front of Chua’s blue BMW.

18     Based on the footage, and using the google map exhibit (P1), SSS Rhani was able to identify where the two cars U-turned, and also the traffic junction where the race started and where SSS Rhani said that he heard a single horn to signal the start of the race. Further, SSS Rhani identified the place where he had logged the accused’s white BMW’s speed, where the officers started to turn on their blinkers, where both vehicles made a second U-turn and stopped, and where their drivers (the accused and Chua) were arrested. SSS Rhani also testified that when arrested, the accused admitted that he was travelling at a fast speed and claimed that he was testing his vehicle at the scene[^3].

19     When questioned by the accused, SSS Rhani confirmed that he had heard a single sound of the car horn before the race began, even though the sound of the horn was not captured in the in-car camera footage. He believed that this was because the camera was inside the car near to the driver, while the sound of the horn was projected outside the car.

##### (2)    Evidence of PW3 Senior Staff Sergeant Burhan (“SSS Burhan”)

20     The second police officer who testified was SSS Burhan. He has been a traffic policeman for 12 years. On the material date, he was similarly deployed at Lim Chu Kang along of Ama Keng Road, and arrived there at about 11.30 pm. He said that the police had received a complaint a month earlier about cars racing at the location, so they visited the area regularly on weekends.

21     When he was at the bus stop along Lim Chu Kang Road, SSS Burhan spotted one white BMW car going along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar moving at a fast speed. He then saw the white BMW and a blue dark BMW approaching from Lim Chu Kang Road towards Neo Tiew Road. At that stage, SSS Burhan put on his helmet, got on his bike, ready to go if was any activity.

22     Subsequently, he saw the same two cars each make a U-turn just before the bus stop along Lim Chu Kang Road. When the U-turns were completed, SSS Burhan said that his colleagues were already with him at the bus stop, but they could not be seen in the camera footage (P3) because they were in “stealth mode” with their motorcycles completely black, and without any headlights or blinkers on.

23     SSS Burhan said that the two BMW cars then lined up next to each other at the traffic light before the junction of Old Lim Chu Kang Road. He heard the sound of one horn before both cars moved off. SSS Burhan then started to pursue the two cars on his motorcycle together with SSS Rhani. The lights and blinkers on his motorcycle were not turned on at that time. Specifically, SSS Burhan followed behind Chua’s blue BMW and trailed it for at least 400 metres at about 5 car lampposts away before he started to clock the speed. SSS Burhan logged the speed of Chua’s blue BMW (number: SKB203R) as 177 kmph. SSS Burhan also said that from his 12 years with the traffic police, his experience was that this practice of speed logging is very accurate.

24     After logging the speed, the blinkers on the police motorcycles were turned on and the BMW cars started to slow down before they made a U-turn back along Lim Chu Kang Road. SSS Burhan subsequently obtained the particulars of the driver of the blue BMW, and also seized his in-car camera’s memory card. This seizure was acknowledged by Chua, the driver of the blue BMW.

25     SSS Burhan also said that he has perfect eyesight.

##### (3)    Evidence of PW8 IO Sharifah

26     The investigating officer, PW8 IO Sharifah, testified that Lim Chu Kang is a major road where the traffic at night was light or non-existent. The speed limit of the road is 70 kmph. The traffic police had set internal guidelines that a driver who drives 40 kmph in excess of the speed limit would be considered dangerous to the driver himself and to other road users[^4]. IO Sharifah said that in this particular case, as the accused had exceeded the speed limit by a large margin, the charge of dangerous driving was made out against him.

27     IO Sharifah further stated that as regards the speed trial involving the accused and Chua that took place there on 9 July 2017, no permit was granted by the Deputy Commissioner of Police for a speed trial or race for this event. IO Sharifah also testified that the traffic police has a SOP (P9) which sets out 4 methods to detect speeding offences, including the trailing method which SSS Rhani and SSS Burhan had used in this case.

28     In addition, IO Sharifah said that Chua had been charged with essentially the same four charges as the accused (illegal racing (speed trial), dangerous driving, illegal alterations and making an illegal U-turn), and that Chua had pleaded guilty to the first two charges with the remaining two charges taken into consideration for sentencing. She said that there was no “transaction or deals or inducement made” with Chua in connection with his plea of guilt[^5]. Neither was there any outstanding investigation or charge against Chua at the time that he pleaded guilty to his two charges.[^6]

29     Separately, IO Sharifah also stated that the police had sent a summons to Chua in 2018 to ask for particulars of the driver of a car for an unrelated speeding offence. IO Sharifah confirmed that the driver for that case was not Chua but someone else, and that the latter had already paid a composition fine for that speeding offence.

#### (ii)   Chua’s in-car camera footage and evidence implicates the accused

30     The Prosecution also produced the in-car camera footages of two cameras that had been mounted on the front and back respectively of Chua’s blue BMW at the material time. In addition, a transcript of voices captured by the front mounted in-car camera was produced by PW4 Tan See Hua (Ms Tan), who has been an interpreter with the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) for 11 years.

31     Ms Tan had viewed the entire video and had transcribed the words (spoken in Hokkien and English) that were audible to her. However, it was apparent that there were words spoken in the video, that were unclear and/or were drowned out by background noise, and which were thus not reproduced in the transcript (P5).

32     In any event, the relevant extracts of P5, and a description of the images from the forward facing in-car camera, are reproduced below.[^7]

33     Aside from evidence derived from his in-car camera, Chua, who was allegedly involved in the illegal race with the accused, and who had been convicted for similar charges of illegal speed trial and speeding in relation to 9 July 2017 event, was called to testify. While initially ambivalent in his evidence, Chua admitted that on the material date, he was racing with the accused in their respective BMW cars. Just prior to the race, the two of them had also met up with 2 mutual friends, Joseph and Joel, who were also driving BMW cars.

34     Chua further said that the starting point of the race was at the traffic light. Using the evidence from his in-car camera footage, Chua testified that at 12:25:43 am, he was seated in his blue BMW, and speaking through his car window to the accused who was sitting in his white BMW that was beside Chua’s car. Chua had told said to the accused: “Once we passed the so-called traffic light, we go already”[^8].

35     In addition, Chua explained that at 12:27:11 am, when the two BMW cars were side by side, Chua had said “can go”. He confirmed that the white BMW that was shown in the footage (on the right of Chua’s blue BMW) was driven by the accused. When Chua was cross-examined by the accused about the footage, Chua said that he was not sure if the in-car camera in his BMW was able to capture the sound of a car horn from outside the vehicle.

36     Chua further stated that from the time his car crossed the traffic light, both he and the accused started to accelerate aggressively[^9]. Chua admitted that he was travelling at least 177 kmph, that he was racing with the accused, and that both he and the accused were travelling dangerously that night[^10]. As shown in the footage at 12:27:21 am, Chua said that he was accelerating and trying to overtake the accused, who still had the lead on him. Subsequently, at 12:27:57 am, the traffic police overtook him and signalled for him to stop.

### (c)   The alterations and condition of the accused’s white BMW

37     PW5 Mr Muhammad Syafiq Bin Mohd Amrullah (Mr Syafiq), a vehicle inspector who examines vehicles for compliance with the requirements of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), had inspected the accused’s white BMW car after the police referred it for inspection following the incident. Mr Syafiq subsequently put up a Notice of Re-inspection pertaining to his inspection (P6), wherein he indicated that he had found two areas of non-compliance for the accused’s vehicle, namely that

> (a)     There was missing a catalytic converter which would affect the emissions, and

> (b)     The number plate was insecure because it had no bracket and screw. Instead, the number plate was secured by 3M tape.

38     Another Prosecution witness, PW6 Mr Ang Bryan Tani (“Mr Tani”), a senior technical investigator and certified accident re-constructionist with LKK Auto Consultants Private Limited, was requested by traffic police to perform a mechanical inspection of the accused’s white BMW. Mr Tani prepared a report (P7) indicating that he did not find any mechanical fault or any abnormality to the engine system, transmission system, steering system, braking system or tires.

39     However, Mr Tani found several modifications (alterations) on the accused’s white BMW which pertained to the air intake system, the brakes, the suspension, the 2 front seats and the steering wheel. They were obvious from a visual inspection. Mr Tani testified that the modifications would improve certain aspects of the operative behaviour of the vehicle. Specifically, “(f)or the air intake, it will improve its, uh, engine performance. Whereas for the suspension it would improve the stability of the vehicle. The brakes, it will improve the braking efficiency. Whereas the seats the---the---the 2 front seats is basically, uh, provide added support for people that are---persons that are seated at the 2 front seats.” [^11]

40     He further opined that there are typically two types of car owners or drivers who would make modifications. The first are those who want to own a car which is different from the standard. “And the 2nd profile on type of people would probably be, um, those that would want to drive a car, um, in a faster manner.” He further stated that the modifications would allow the engine to perform better than the original or standard condition, and the owner can drive the car faster. [^12] Also, the missing catalytic converter on the accused’s car, would allow for the exhaust gases to flow out freely and result in more harmful pollution to the environment, more power to the vehicle and the exhaust would also typically be louder. [^13]

## (3)   An Outline of the Defence’s case

41     The accused gave evidence in his own defence, and also called a witness to testify.

### (a)   Accused’s denial of the charges

42     The accused testified that he had purchased his white BMW, which was a turbo-charged car, second-hand from an owner-seller, Joseph. The accused said that a turbo-charged car has more power and uses less fuel, and the car was bought for his wife as a family car. The purchase was completed on 28 June 2017, and he had taken possession of the car on the same day. He said that it was very “rushed” at that time as his family was preparing for a family trip to Bangkok from 1st to 7th July 2017.

43     The accused also said that he knew the seller of the white BMW to be a person who took good care of his car. The accused testified that he did not test drive the car, nor did his wife, even though the car was bought for her. He also did not send the car for a check in the workshop before he bought it. When he purchased the car, he did not notice that the number plate was insecure, and only found out about this after the incident.

44     The accused claimed that Joseph had told him that he (Joseph) had a LTA-approved exhaust costing a few thousand dollars that was fitted on the car. The accused said that he could not check whether exhaust was modified or not. He also did not have the document stating that the exhaust was LTA approved even though he claimed to have been shown this document by Joseph previously[^14]. The accused testified that after he had purchased the car, he told Joseph to send it to workshop to make sure that it was in a good condition, and to carry out the standard oil change and maintenance[^15]. The accused said that he did not tell the workshop what to do because he was not paying for it.

45     The accused further said that he was supposed to collect the car after returning from his overseas family trip on 7 July 2017. When his flight landed in Singapore that day at 1810 hrs, he had rushed down to the workshop to collect the car. He had then driven it to Bishan and parked it. While driving the car, he noticed that it was loud and was reverberating a little, but he said that he thought it was due to a cold start. In any event, he was too tired to care and just wanted to go home and rest.[^16]

46     The accused said that he and his wife had subsequently driven the car on the afternoon of 8 July 2017. His wife felt that the exhaust was too loud for a family sedan and the accused agreed. The accused had contacted the seller in the evening of the 8th of July as the accused wanted him to rectify the loud exhaust noise at his cost. The seller responded that this could be due to the LTA approved aftermarket exhaust and that the car had passed the LTA vehicle inspection on 17 June 2017 as indicated in the LTA letter (D12). However, the accused admitted that D12 only stated that the silencer on the exhaust was approved. It did not address the fact that the catalytic converter was missing on his white BMW.[^17]

47     The accused testified that the seller suggested verifying the issue at Lim Chu Kang road that very same night, as this location was far away from public housing. Also, it was a long straight road with no traffic at night and therefore would not cause any disturbance to the general public. The accused claimed that: “My motive for being there that night was simple and straightforward. It was simply for the seller to acknowledge the issue and rectify it at his cost. There was never any intention to race or conduct any form of time trial as alleged.” [^18]

48     The accused claimed that he reached the area around midnight. He said that there was “a bunch” of people and cars along Lim Chu Kang, including Chua with his car. The cars there were all black or dark coloured. The accused said that Chua was an acquaintance whom he had met once many months earlier. However, aside from Chua and Joseph (the seller of the accused’s white BMW), the accused claimed that he did not know the rest of the people there, nor did he interact with them.[^19]

49     At the location, the accused had popped open the bonnet of his car for Joseph to see. Joseph had apparently told the accused that he would arrange with the accused for the car to be fixed. The accused then sat in his car for a while and then decided to go off when “it’s about time” [^20] This was at around 12.25.49 am. The accused acknowledged that at that location, he had not driven with Joseph in the car for the latter to listen to the noise from the car, nor did he test the car in front of Joseph.[^21]

50     The accused said that he subsequently drove his white BMW and then followed Chua’s blue BMW when the latter drove in front of him. The accused then saw Chua’s blue BMW make a U-turn at about 12.26.49 am, and the accused followed by making the same U-turn as well. The accused said that he thought that this was the normal way to make a U-turn, and that he wanted to head in the correct direction to go home.[^22]

51     The accused said that after this, he just continued to drive straight on the right side of the road and reached a traffic light. This was at about 12.27.05 am. The accused admitted that the in-car camera footage shown in court indicated that at about 12.27.09 am, the engine was “reving” and it was loud, and Chua could also be heard saying “Okay, bro, 2 horns go up”. [^23] However, the accused insisted that he did not hear these words when they were said by Chua on the day of the incident, as his (the accused’s) car window was wound up. The accused also suggested that Chua may have wanted a race on that day, but that “that is his one-sided intention”.[^24] The accused claimed that there was totally no reaction from him to what Chua had said, and that he (the accused) was just doing his own thing. [^25]

52     When asked about the footage of the events at 12:27:12 am, the accused admitted that at that time, his car was on the right and slightly ahead of Chua’s car at the traffic light[^26]. At 12:27:22 am, there were loud exhaust sounds from the cars “reving”. The accused admitted that he accelerated and was far ahead of Chua’s blue BMW, even though he insisted that he was (still) in his car doing his own thing. Nevertheless, at 12:27:46 am mark, his car was some distance ahead of Chua’s blue BMW. [^27]

53     The accused also claimed that he did not notice the speed that he was driving on that day, although he knew that he was “going a bit faster”, as the road was “totally clear, there’s no obstacle, brightly lit, good condition, everything is good, so I just go and take the opportunity to actually hear the…exhaust sound like at maybe higher rev…”.[^28] However, as to whether he was driving at 179 kmph as alleged by SSgt Rhani, the accused said that he did not think that he was travelling that fast, only that he was travelling above 70 kmph. He also said that he was not sure if he was going above 100 kmph, although he said that he was travelling “maybe 100”, but did not think he was travelling more than 130 kmph. [^29] The accused subsequently said that he thought that he was travelling “…probably between 70 and below 100 or thereabout…”[^30] He admitted that after he had overtaken Chua’s blue BMW in his white BMW, he did not see Chua overtake him subsequently.

54     The accused further said that he subsequently saw some flashing like lights from his rear-view mirror and he slowed down to see what was going on. This was at about 12:27:34 am. He then made a U-turn at about 12:27:56 am and stopped at the side. By then, the police had come along, and said to him that he was racing. His reaction was “Huh? What? What’s going on?” [^31] The accused was subsequently arrested.

55     When questioned, the accused disagreed with the DPP’s suggestion that the average speed that his car travelled over the distance from the traffic light to the final U-turn point (about 1.76 km based on the google map measurement) was about 158.4 kmph. [^32]

56     In short, the accused insisted that there was no race or competition with Chua on that date. Further, he said that there could not have been any speed trial if there wasn’t any start point or end point, or any individual taking time. He further insisted that it was Chua who had spontaneously suggested to race or to have a speed trial, and that the accused himself wasn’t aware of this at that time as his car window was wound up and his exhaust was extremely loud, such that he could not have heard anything said from outside his car. In addition, the accused insisted that from Chua’s in car-camera footage, there wasn’t any horn sounded by Chua or anyone else to signal the start of a race. Further, the accused said that there was no response or communication from himself to Chua, and hence this could not be considered a case of an illegal speed trial. In addition, the accused said that when Chua stated the word “Bro” (before they moved off from the stationary point and before they made the U-turn), Chua was actually talking to a man in black, rather than to the accused whose car was next to Chua’s car at that time.

57     In addition, the accused claimed that Chua’s plea of guilt was “…likely based on his spontaneous one-sided intention and of fear of a greater punishment”. He also said that Chua was an unreliable witness because “within an hour, he had said yes and no to the same questions a couple…of times” [^33]. He said that he and Chua were “raw acquaintances”, and that there was no bad blood or disagreements between them.[^34] The accused also insisted that the person labelled as “M2”, in the transcript (P5) of the in-car camera footage was not him but was someone else, possibly Joseph.

58     Finally, as for the two traffic police witnesses (SSS Rhani and SSS Burhan), the accused claimed that they were inaccurate in their testimonies and that they had lied and falsified evidence in terms of what they saw or heard, particularly since no horn was heard on the in-car camera footage. The accused also claimed that SSS Rhani had lied about seeing the two cars at the traffic light, and about having clocked the accused driving at 179 kmph. However, the accused admitted that he did not know these two officers personally, nor had he seen them before. There was also no bad blood between them, and he did not know why they would lie to implicate him except that “(m)aybe they wanted to…be able to issue a summon ticket”, although he also said that he did not want to speculate as to their reasons. [^35]

### (b)   Evidence from Joseph was largely unhelpful

59     Joseph was a witness for the Defence. He was the person who had sold the white BMW to the accused. Joseph said that on the night of the incident, he had received a call from the accused who had said that the white BMW had some problems with the exhaust, as it was very loud and he wanted Joseph to fix it at his cost. Thus, Joseph wanted to verify this and suggested meeting at Lim Chu Kang as this was very far away from public housing, so as not to disturb other people, and also as this was a very long straight road.

60     When he reached the location, he said that Chua and Joel were also there in their own BMW cars, although Joseph claimed that he did not know why they were there. They were chatting when Joseph arrived. Joseph then started talking to the accused and the latter told Joseph that when he started the car and drove past, it was like “a mini explosion”. Joseph suspected that this was because the catalytic converter was missing and he told the accused that he would supply the original catalytic converter, which he had removed before selling the car to the accused. Joseph said that he knew the catalytic converter was missing when he sold the car to the accused but he did not think that would be an issue for the accused.[^36]

61     From the rear video footage taken from the blue BMW, Joseph also said that he was the person in black who was seen walking towards Chua’s car. He claimed that he thought that Chua was talking to him and that was why he had walked over to Chua’s car. However, Chua had driven off.

62     Joseph also said that the accused was on the right side of Chua’s car. While he could say that Chua’s car window was down, Joseph was somewhat unclear about whether the accused’s car window was up at that time. In any event, Chua and the accused had subsequently driven off into the distance and outside of Joseph’s visual range.

## (4)   The Court’s Findings

### (a)   Evidence implicated the accused in illegal speed trial and dangerous driving

63     There was ample evidence which implicated the accused in the commission of the illegal speed trial and dangerous driving offences.

64     First, there was clear and damning evidence from the two traffic police officers, who were eye-witnesses, and who had a clear view of the offences.

> (a)     The two officers, SSS Rhani and SSS Burhan, were at the scene at the material time to carry out a covert operation. This followed earlier complaints about car racing activities that had taken place at that area during the weekends.

> (b)     For their operation, both police officers had essentially camouflaged themselves by wearing black, and were equipped with black (“stealth”) motorcycles. It also appears that they had positioned themselves so as to observe the stretch of the road where the race between Chua and the accused eventually took place. Further, as was evident from the testimonies of these officers, the road was sufficiently well-lit and clear such that the two police officers were able to observe what was happening.

> (c)     The two officers also gave clear and consistent accounts about seeing the BMW cars of the accused and Chua approaching from the same direction, before both cars made illegal U-turns just before the bus stop along Lim Chu Kang Road. The cars then lined up next to each other at the traffic light, and both cars also moved off at the sound of a horn.

> (d)     Each police officer then followed a BMW car on his respective motorcycle; SSS Burhan drove behind Chua’s blue BMW, while SSS Rhani followed the accused’s white BMW. Each officer followed for a distance of about 400-500 m, before logging Chua as driving at 177 kmph, and the accused driving at 179 kmph respectively. The speeds logged by these officers, indicating that the accused’s driving speed was higher than that of Chua’s, was consistent with the fact that after the race had started, the accused’s car was in front of Chua’s car throughout, even though both cars had started off side by side from the same traffic light.

65     Second, it should also be noted that the clear and convincing evidence of both police officers, was supported by various exhibits tendered in court.

> (a)     For one, P1 (which was a google map diagram with distance measurements of various points on the road) showed the route travelled by Chua and the accused in their cars during the race, and the distances that their cars managed to cover in the relatively short period of time. The average speed that a car would need to drive to cover that distance in that time was calculated by the DPP as 158.4 kmph.

> (b)     Next, P2, which was the arrest report that SSS Rhani made less within an hour after arresting the accused, also corroborated his account and that of SSS Burhan about the accused’s actions. As written in P2 (and elaborated on in court), SSS Rhani had stated:

>> ‘Spotted abovementioned stopping along Lim Chu Kang Road junction of Old Lim Chu Kang road. Towards the direction of Jalan Bahar. On the right of 3 lane road. Spotted abovementioned parallel to SKB 203R on the right side, I then heard a single horn sound and abovementioned was seen picking up speed. Trailed abovementioned from lamppost 138 till up to lamppost 86F and logged abovementioned speed going at 179 kmph over 70 kmph road speed limit of. I then turned on my blinkers and abovementioned immediately slowed down and made a U-turn at Lorong Rusuk and proceed to stop abovementioned at lamppost 67F facing towards end. Upon interviewing, abovementioned admitted to offence caused claiming that he is testing out his vehicle. Placed abovementioned under arrest for dangerous driving and speeding at high speed. IO Zulkifli was consulted and acknowledged. That’s all’.

66     Third, the two officers’ accounts of what they saw on the material date, were also strongly corroborated by independent and objective evidence derived from Chua’s car, namely P3, the footage from the forward facing in-car camera, and P5, the transcript of P3. Such evidence provided strong support to the officers’ accounts in the following way:

> (a)     In P5 (at page 2), Chua (indicated as M1) was heard talking to someone (i.e. M2) about Joseph (“M1: “I bought one for, I bought one for Joseph lar…”). This clearly showed that M2, the person whom Chua was heard speaking to (in connection with the race) was not Joseph, contrary to the accused’s claims, but someone else who was in close vicinity to Chua at that time. Further, Chua, who was sitting in his car next to the accused who was in his own car at that time, was also heard saying loudly that after they pass the traffic light “then we go already”. Chua’s words were immediately followed by both Chua and the accused moving off in their respective BMW cars at around 12:25:45 am, and heading in the same direction. These circumstances strongly suggested that M2, whom Chua was speaking to at that time, was actually the accused (and not Joseph), and that M1 (Chua) and M2 (the accused) were discussing about starting off from a traffic light.

> (b)     Both cars then made an illegal U-turn, (at 12:26:46 am) and headed along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar. They then approached a traffic light and lined up abreast. Chua was then heard to say “ok, bro, two horn and go ah” (at about 12:27:09 am).

> (c)     Following this, Chua’s blue BMW and the accused’s white BMW were then seen (and heard) to accelerate very quickly and move off at high speeds from the traffic light (at about 12:27:12 am).

> (d)     Next, from the in-car camera footage, the accused’s white BMW was seen to pull ahead of Chua’s blue BMW at about 12:27:14 am, and the accused’s car raced off ahead. Chua’s car never caught up with the accused’s car. This last observation was especially important, since the evidence of the police officers was that Chua’s blue BMW was logged at the speed of 177 kmph (which Chua admitted), and the accused’s white BMW was captured (by a different officer) as moving at an even faster speed of 179 kmph. As stated previously, the accused’s higher driving speed would explain why Chua’s car was never able to catch up with the accused’s car even though both cars started off at the same time and from the same point.

> (e)     It could also be seen from the footage that the road was well-lit with street lamps, and that this was a major road. This meant that the police officers would have had a clear view of the accused’s actions, and the manner in which the accused have driven his car in his speed trial with Chua. It also meant that the court, and all parties in court, could also see from the footage how the accused had driven his white BMW on the date and time in question.

67     Thus, not only were the police officers’ accounts internally consistent, they were externally consistent with each other, and their evidence was also fully supported by the exhibits P1, P2, P3 and P5. The speeds of the accused and Chua’s car were also measured by instruments on the police officer’s vehicles that had been checked and ascertained to be accurate. In short, there was no reason to doubt that they had correctly measured Chua as having driven at 177 kmph (which he admitted to), and the accused as having driven, in his race with Chua, at 179 kmph, when the speed of the road was only 70 kmph.

68     The accused, driving his white BMW at a higher speed than Chua in his blue BMW, was also observed to have won his race convincingly. However, by driving in the manner and the speed that he did when racing with Chua, the accused was clearly driving dangerously since, if nothing else, his ability to respond to road conditions and road situations would have been impaired and affected as a result. All in all, the evidence pointed convincingly to the accused’s guilt on both the illegal speed trial and dangerous driving charges.

69     In addition to the already compelling evidence discussed above, I also noted that Chua himself had admitted that he was engaged in the illegal speed trial with the accused as alleged in the charge. He had in fact already admitted and pleaded guilty to committing the same offence, and also to dangerous driving, in regard to his actions on the material night.

70     Further, to the accused’s questions, Chua confirmed it was the accused whom he had spoken to when he was in his car next to the accused’s car, just prior to driving off before the race commenced, and that this was what was recorded in his in-car camera[^37]. While the accused took issue with the accuracy of Chua’s evidence, as well as his possible motive for testifying against him, and further tried to discredit Chua on aspects of his evidence that the accused argued were equivocal, and also that Chua was capricious, I found no reason to disbelieve Chua’s accounts about his actions and that of the accused that night. Clearly Chua, by disclosing about his involvement and that of the accused in the illegal race, has nothing to gain by testifying in the accused’s trial.

71     Indeed, I noted that while Chua was initially hesitant and coy about his involvement and that of the accused on the material night, when he was questioned further by the DPP, Chua was more candid about his own wrongdoing, just as he spoke about the accused’s role and involvement in the matter. Moreover, as Chua had already “paid the price” when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment, fines and disqualification for engaging in the illegal speed trial and in driving in a dangerous manner in connection with his race with the accused, I was of the view that there was no reason for Chua to perjure himself and falsely implicate the accused in the commission of the offences, if indeed, the claims were untrue. This was especially so since there was no evidence of any grudge or ill feeling between Chua and the accused. Even the accused himself admitted that he and Chua were (mere) acquaintances, and that there was no bad blood between them.

72     Further, Chua’s evidence of the cars engaging in the speed trial on the material night, of both parties’ cars accelerating during the race, of the accused then pulling ahead of him in his white BMW, and of the accused maintaining a consistent lead over Chua’s blue BMW, even as Chua himself was found to be as driving at 177 kmph during this race at one stage, were all in line with the other evidence discussed above.

73     All in all, I accepted Chua’s evidence and admissions (before me and when he pleaded guilty earlier) that he had engaged in the speed trial with the accused, as well as about how he had driven that day. While his evidence was not really critical, in light of the other evidence that already pointing clearly to the accused’s guilt, Chua’s account nevertheless fortified the already compelling case against the accused.

74     As for the accused’s bare denial to the charges, and his attempts at casting aspersions on the Prosecution witnesses, as well as his various challenges against the evidence adduced, with respect, I found the accused’s testimony, and his denials and claims, completely unconvincing, largely inconsequential, and plainly at odds with the clear and objective evidence (especially from the footages and transcript) produced.

75     Further, contrary to the accused’s claims that he did not respond to Chua’s allegedly one-sided invitation to race, what the accused did, as evidenced in the in-car camera footages, and from the evidence of the police officers, as well as the testimony of Chua, all pointed to the accused being fully involved, and completely engaged in the illegal speed trial with Chua, and driving in a dangerous manner in the process.

76     For completeness, I would also add that the accused’s witness, Joseph, did not see the critical events when the accused and Chua were driving (and racing) their respective BMWs along Lim Chu Kang Road towards Jalan Bahar at the material time. Thus, his evidence was of no help to the accused.

77     In summary, in light of the overwhelming evidence against the accused, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had established the guilt of the accused on these charges. Accordingly, as it was abundantly clear that the accused did engage in the speed trial and committed dangerous driving as alleged, I had no hesitation in finding him guilty on these charges.

### (b)   Evidence against the accused on the charge of illegal alteration

78     The evidence of the illegal alterations was clearly set out in LTA notice of non-compliance (P6), which stated that the following defects were found

> (a)     Exhaust Pipe & Silencer: Tampered or modified exhaust pipe – Missing cat converter; and

> (b)     Number Plate: Front Number plate insecure.

79     The above findings was confirmed by the evidence of Mr Syafiq, the vehicle inspector in court. Further, as set out above, Mr Tani, from LKK Auto Consultants, also commented that the missing catalytic converter on the accused’s car would, amongst other things, result in a louder exhaust and also more power to the vehicle.

80     In fact, it was also clear that by the accused’s own evidence, even before the date of the offence, he was already suspicious that there was something not right with the car, due to the loud noise that he had heard when driving it, something which his wife also complained to him about. Yet he continued to drive the car. In fact, even after the accused had obtained confirmation from Joseph about the defect, and the latter had allegedly promised to look into rectifying it, the accused not only continued to use the car, but even decided to “push its limit” by accelerating and driving it at 179 kmph on the material date. Clearly, there was no excuse for his actions.

81     In short, the evidence pointed inexorably to the fact that the accused had used and driven his white BMW despite the fact that it had the illegal alterations at the material time. In other words, the Prosecution has also proven this charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

## (5)   Sentencing Considerations

82     Having found the accused guilty on all three charges, I had to decide on the appropriate sentence to impose

### (a)   Prescribed punishments, TIC charge and antecedents

83     The prescribed punishments for his offences are as follows:

> (a)     For the 1st charge of taking part in a trial of speed without a permit which is an offence section 116(7) of the RTA, it is provided that a first offender “….shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and shall also be punished with a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000”.

> (b)     For the 2nd charge of dangerous driving under section 64(1) RTA, a first offender “shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both”; and

> (c)     For the 3rd charge of using a vehicle with illegal alterations under section 5(6), a first offender “shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both”.

84     Further, section 42(1) of the RTA states that:

> “A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.”

85     In the present case, following his convictions, the accused also consented to having the charge of making an illegal U-turn which is an offence under Rule 13(1) of the Road Traffic Rules, punishable under Section 131(2) of the RTA taken into consideration for sentencing.

86     The accused does not have any similar antecedents.[^38]

### (b)   Prosecution’s submissions and Accused’s mitigation plea

87     The Prosecution informed the court that Chua, who had pleaded guilty to the corresponding charges of illegal speed trial and dangerous driving, had been sentenced as follows:[^39]

> (a)     Illegal Speed Trial/Racing: 2 weeks' imprisonment and fine of $1,500, in default 3 days' imprisonment, and disqualification from driving (all classes of vehicles) for 18 months from the date of release.

> (b)     Dangerous Driving: Fine of $1,000, in default 2 days' imprisonment, and disqualification from driving (all classes of vehicles) for 18 months from the date of release.

88     The Prosecution highlighted that unlike Chua, the accused here had claimed trial, had shown no remorse, and had also made allegations against the police officers accusing them of lying, and of impropriety in relation to their dealings with Chua. The DPP thus submitted that for the illegal speed trial charge, the court should impose a sentence of 3 weeks' imprisonment, a fine of $1,500, and disqualification from driving (all classes of vehicles) for 18 months from the date of release. The Prosecution, however, did not submit on the sentences for the dangerous driving or illegal alteration charges.

89     As regards mitigation, the accused said that he had been wrongly accused and asked for leniency. He also spoke about his financial burdens and the suffering that he and his family has had gone through in connection with the case.

## (6)   Decision on Sentence

90     The accused claimed trial to the charges. Thus, unlike Chua who had pleaded guilty, the accused was not entitled to any sentencing discount for a plea of guilt.

91     At the same time, in the course of conducting his defence, the accused had made serious allegations of impropriety against the police officers. There was also nothing highlighted by him when given the opportunity to mitigate, nor was there anything brought up during the trial, that was of any real mitigating value.

92     Accordingly, in line with the principle of parity, the position taken by the accused towards the charges, the manner that he conducted the trial, and the circumstances of his offences, I imposed the following sentences:

> (a)     For the first charge (DAC-919801-2018) of illegal speed trial: 3 weeks' imprisonment and fine of $1,500, in default 3 days' imprisonment, and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months from the date of release;

> (b)     For the second charge (DAC-919802-2018) of dangerous driving: Fine of $1,000, in default 2 days' imprisonment, and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months from the date of release, and

> (c)     For the third charge (DAC-919803-2018) of illegal alteration: Fine of $500, in default 1 day's imprisonment.

93     The global sentence imposed on the accused is thus 3 weeks' imprisonment, a fine of $3,000 (in default 6 days' imprisonment), and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months from the date of release.

94     The accused has appealed against his conviction, sentence and the orders of disqualification, all of which I have stayed pending the hearing of the appeal. The accused is currently on bail.
